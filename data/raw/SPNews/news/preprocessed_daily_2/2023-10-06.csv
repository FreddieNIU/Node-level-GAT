I will now turn the call over to Neil Ashe.Story continuesNeil Ashe: Thank you, Charlotte, and good morning to all of you joining us. Our fiscal fourth quarter performance demonstrated excellent execution. Our focus on margin and cash generation led to increased adjusted operating profit margin and higher adjusted diluted earnings per share despite a decline in sales in the lighting business. This quarter concluded a successful year. We delivered strong financial performance, we continued to improve our businesses, and we allocated capital effectively. Throughout fiscal 2023, both our lighting and spaces teams made meaningful progress driving our business forward. In our Acuity Brands Lighting and Lighting Controls business, our strategy is to increase product vitality, improve service levels, use technology to improve and differentiate both our products and our services and to drive productivity.In 2023, we realigned our product portfolio through the introduction of Design Select. We now have three defined ways in which we go to market, Contractor Select, Design Select and Made to Order. By combining a high product vitality and improved service levels, Design Select allows us to better serve lighting specifiers, distributors and electrical contractors. The realignment of our portfolio, together with our ongoing product vitality efforts, has allowed us to strategically manage price in a dynamic environment, while the ongoing productivity improvements in our supply chain continue to improve our processes and manage our costs. We also continuously evaluate our portfolio. This year, better valuation resulted in the divestiture of our Sunoptics daylighting business and the decision to exit Winona Custom Architectural Lighting Solutions.There's a bit of noise in the numbers this quarter, resulting from a series of actions. The first is the result of our ongoing transformation efforts. We have redefined our work, where and how it is done, resulting in organizational changes that will lead to more efficiencies. The second are charges primarily for impairments of trade names related to prior acquisitions. The third charge resulted from the collectability of a supplier warranty obligation owed to us for components we used in products manufactured and sold between 2017 and 2019. Karen will cover each of these in more detail. This year, our teams have refreshed approximately 20% of our product portfolio and have introduced many new product families. I'd like to highlight our American Electric Lighting brand, where we launched AutoConnect, which is a durable, value-driven solution for outdoor infrastructure lighting that includes connected luminaires for roadway, industrial and commercial applications.The rollout was targeted to coincide with the anticipated increase of infrastructure investments and positions us well for continued success. In August of this year, the City of Philadelphia announced that it has selected our American Electric Lighting outdoor lighting product as a major supplier for the Philadelphia Streetlight Improvement Project. The citywide project will replace and connect approximately 130,000 street lights into a network of more efficient, longer-lasting, remotely controlled LED lights, which is expected to reduce street lighting energy usage by more than 50% and is expected to reduce municipal carbon emissions by more than 9%. Our team continue to be recognized for our innovation and the value that our products bring to our customers.In the fourth quarter, six of our lighting solutions were selected for the 2023 Illuminating Engineering Society Progress Report, which showcases the year's most significant advancements in the art and science of lighting, including our WarmDim technology from Aculux, emergency battery backup cylinders from Gotham, and flame lighting technique from Hydrel. Our marketing team was also announced as a winner of the Best of the Best Marketing Award for 2023 by the Electrical Distributor Magazine. Now, moving to spaces, where we had another great year. The strategy for our Intelligent Spaces business is to make spaces smarter, safer and greener by connecting the edge to the cloud. Distech has the best edge control devices on the market, and Atrius will be the best in cloud applications.Our strategic priority for Distech is to expand our addressable market in two ways. The first is geographic, and the second is increasing what we control in a built space. In 2023, we continued to drive this strategy forward by establishing a presence in the UK market and through the acquisition of KE2 Therm, which added commercial refrigeration controls to our portfolio. The integration of KE2 Therm is progressing well, and we rounded out a successful year with them being awarded a 2023 Dealer Design Award. Earlier this year, we launched Atrius DataLab, the intersection point between the edge devices and Distech and the applications in the cloud. Atrius DataLab is a foundational to our ability to automate the environment of a built space and help ensure that our partners achieve their specific energy and sustainability goals.During the quarter, Atrius was named as a Sustainability Leadership Award winner in the 2023 Sustainability Awards program. The program honors people, teams and organizations who have made sustainability an integral part of their business practice or overall mission. I'm pleased with the progress we have made as a team in 2023. We have successfully positioned our company at the intersection of sustainability and technology, setting ourselves up for long-term growth by taking advantage of two of the most important megatrends, minimizing the impacts of climate change and maximizing the impacts of technology. Our ABL business continue to lead as the largest lighting and lighting controls company in North America. And we have made the business more predictable, repeatable and scalable by focusing on product vitality, improving service levels, the use of technology throughout the business and driving productivity.Our spaces business continued to grow as an attractive technology business that connects the edge to the cloud for built spaces. Distech has a significant technology advantage that we can continue to expand as the mechanical and analog controls of today become digital over time. And Atrius introduced new applications in the cloud that are already making a difference for our customers. We have changed how the company works through our better, smarter, faster operating system. Better, smarter, faster is the combination of processes, tools and ways of working that spans from strategy to people to operating rhythms to problem solving. It is unique to our organization and allows us to drive strategic alignment, manage change and deliver results.A technician inspecting newly installed lighting components in a state-of-the-art commercial building. A technician inspecting newly installed lighting components in a state-of-the-art commercial building.Our values are at the core of our culture and help create a shared purpose for achieving our company's strategic goals. We make decisions based on our values, and these values impact how we treat each other and how we serve our customers. The combination of better, smarter, faster and our values allows us to operate more efficiently with greater distribution of responsibility and accountability throughout the company. It is how we continue to improve our businesses and respond quickly and effectively to changing economic environments. The alignment of everyone in our organization through our value creation model, through our total rewards framework compounds that responsibility and accountability. Our associates understand how they contribute to our overall strategy.If you stop people in our company and ask them how we create value, they will answer we grow net sales, we turn those profits into cash, and we don't grow the balance sheet as fast. This year, we have continued to demonstrate that we are effective capital allocators. We have invested for growth in our current businesses through R&amp;D and capital expenditures. We've enhanced our portfolio through the exit of Sunoptics and the acquisition of KE2 Therm. We've maintained our dividend, and we've created a permanent shareholder value with approximately $1.3 billion in share repurchases since the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, which amounts to about 23% of the then shares outstanding. As we turn to our fiscal 2024, our strategic priorities remain the same.In our lighting business, we will continue to drive margin and cash flow. We expect roughly the same market conditions in lighting for the remainder of this calendar year, with the potential for some improvement in the next calendar year. We will continue to grow our Intelligence Spaces group in three ways, geographically, by adding control planes and by delivering applications that make a difference in built spaces. We will continue the development of our better, smarter, faster operating system in order to improve our current businesses and those that we acquire in the future, and we will continue to allocate capital consistent with our priorities. Now, I'll turn the call over to Karen, who will update you on our 2023 performance and provide more details about 2024.Karen Holcom: Thank you, Neil, and good morning to everyone on the call. We executed well throughout fiscal 2023. In a challenging sales environment in the lighting business, we improved our adjusted operating profit by $9 million year-over-year and generated cash flow from operations of $578 million. We continue to improve our businesses and allocated capital effectively. For total AYI, we generated net sales in the fourth quarter of approximately $1 billion, which was $100 million or 9% lower than the prior year as a result of the decline in net sales in our ABL business. This was partially offset by continued growth in the ISG business of 17% in the quarter. We continued to deliver year-over-year margin improvement. During the quarter, our adjusted operating profit was down year-over-year on lower sales, while we expanded adjusted operating profit margin to 16.1%, an increase of approximately 80 basis points from the prior year.The increase was driven largely by the significant improvement in our gross profit margin as we continue to strategically manage price and costs. During the quarter, our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.97 increased $0.02 or 1% over the prior year. In ABL, net sales were $944 million in the quarter, a decrease of 11% compared with the prior year, driven by declines across most of our channels, offset slightly by continued strong performance in our retail channel. ABL's adjusted operating profit decreased 2% to $159 million on lower net sales and we delivered adjusted operating profit margin of 16.8%, a 150 basis point improvement over the prior year as we strategically managed price and input costs improved, particularly steel and inbound freight.As Neil mentioned at the beginning of the call, we also took several charges during the quarter that's primarily related to ABL. Taken together, these amounted to $35.5 million in non-recurring pretax charges or $0.87 in diluted earnings per share. The first is a result of our ongoing transformation efforts and includes a charge of $6 million in severance as we realigned how we work. The second is a $16.5 million non-cash impairment charge for a small investment and for certain trade names related to prior acquisitions. In addition, we transitioned several of those trade names from indefinite to definite lives to more accurately reflect their value. The third is a $13 million pretax non-cash charge for the impairment of a receivable based on its collectability.The receivable is from a supplier who owes us a warranty obligation related to the recovery of quality costs we have incurred for certain ABL outdoor lighting products manufactured and sold between 2017 and 2019. We are pursuing recovery from the supplier. ISG's net sales for the fourth quarter were $72 million, an increase of 17%, as Distech continued to win business across new and existing customers. This quarter, we also had a modest benefit from the acquisition of KE2 Therm. ISG's adjusted operating profit was $14 million, which was a decline of approximately 3% over the prior year as we continued to invest in the business for long-term growth. Now, turning to our cash flow performance. We generated $578 million of cash flow from operating activities for the full year of fiscal 2023, an increase of $262 million over the prior year, driven largely by improvements in working capital.We've improved both days of inventory and accounts receivable compared to the end of fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2023, we invested $67 million in capital expenditures and allocated $269 million to repurchase approximately 1.6 million shares. Since the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we have repurchased over 9 million shares at an average price of approximately $143 per share, which was funded by organic cash flow. I now want to spend a few minutes expanding on our outlook for 2024. Consistent with our 2023 guidance, we are going to provide annual guidance anchored around net sales and adjusted diluted EPS. We will also provide you with certain assumptions, which you can find in the supplemental presentation available on our website after the conclusion of this call.For full year fiscal 2024, our expectation is that net sales will be within the range of $3.7 billion and $4 billion for total AYI. This is based on the assumptions that ABL will deliver sales down low to mid-single digits as a result of conditions in the lighting macro environment. And ISG will continue to generate sales growth in the mid-teens as we continue to take share and expand geographically and into new control planes. We expect to deliver adjusted diluted earnings per share within the range of $13 to $14.50 for total AYI. Our capital allocation and priority -- our capital allocation priorities in 2024 are unchanged, and we will continue to focus on delivering margin and cash flow. In conclusion, we strategically managed price and cost and delivered margin growth at ABL.We continue to grow the Intelligent Spaces Group. We generated strong cash flow from operations and allocated capital effectively. We continue to improve the business through product and productivity improvements, and we continue to take the steps necessary to drive our transformation forward. Thank you for joining us today. I will now pass you over to the operator to take your questions.Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird.See also   Top 20 Most Beautiful Island Countries in the World and 20 Most Profitable Small Businesses to Start in 2023.Q&amp;A SessionTim Wojs: Good morning. Maybe, Neil, just to start, anything from an environment perspective, just any color that you could maybe provide on kind of what you're seeing kind of in the end market demand environment, maybe the quoting environment today? And your comments maybe about calendar year '24 maybe being a bit better. Is that just kind of starting to cycle easier comparisons? Or is there something that you're kind of seeing from a visibility perspective that you'd call out?Neil Ashe: Yeah, good morning, Tim. Thanks for the question. So first of all, we're really proud with our performance. We've obviously demonstrated that we can execute in this environment. And I wish the economy would line up with our fiscal year, but it doesn't. So the -- as we're looking forward to kind of our fiscal first quarter and the rest of this year, while the business is relatively consistent, it's pretty much choppy all over. So we feel good about kind of where we guided for the year given that. And we also feel like there's still strong kind of volume in each of our networks. So the C&amp;I network, obviously, is about 60% of the business. As Karen pointed out, the retail business has remained strong for us. The direct business has been comparatively strong for us.And as you can see in our channel, the OEM business is down, which is our sales to other lighting manufacturers. So taken together then, we feel like we're comfortable operating in this environment and we feel like we've got a responsible plan for 2024.Tim Wojs: Okay. Okay. Good. And then just, Karen, just when you think about guidance, and I guess, high-level, sales down kind of low to mid-single digits. It's -- at least in ABL business, I think it's down 3% overall. And I think that the midpoint of the EPS range winds up being down 2%. Could you just maybe give us kind of the puts and takes or what to think about in terms of kind of managing maybe a down volume environment versus kind of keeping margins what appears to be pretty stable?Karen Holcom: Yeah, sure. Thanks, Tim. So the guidance, just to reiterate, the guidance for the net sales range is $3.7 billion to $4 billion, and you'll see all this in the presentation. That does anticipate that lighting would be down low to mid-single digits as we discussed, kind of the continuation of the trends that Neil talked about just a moment ago. When we look at the margin that we expect to maintain, it's a solid plan. And we don't expect to stay kind of at the high levels that we are now, but we still expect to be able to strategically manage our product vitality, our service levels, our technology and productivity to continue to deliver strong performance that would land us in the EPS range of $13 and $14.50 for the year.I would just call out ISG, we're still predicting up to mid-teens in that business. So that's still going to continue to grow next year. The acquisition of KE2 Therm will be a benefit as well. So really, really pleased with the performance overall.Tim Wojs: Okay, okay, good. I’ll hop back in queue. Good luck on everything, guys.Neil Ashe: Thanks, Tim.Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Ryan, your line is now open. Our next question will come from Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo.Joe O’Dea: Hi, good morning.Neil Ashe: Hey, Joe. How are you doing?Joe O’Dea: Doing well, thanks. I guess first question is just the sort of combination of sort of channel inventory management and then the macro. And so what you've seen over the course of the past few months, what you're anticipating through kind of the rest of this year in terms of any additional headwinds related to destock? Or is there a little bit of a transition where macro has gotten a little bit choppier, but destock gets a little bit less challenging.Neil Ashe: Yeah. So just for -- just a little bit of historical context as we kind of recreate FY '23, obviously, we burned through backlog through the first half of our fiscal 2023. We talked extensively through the remainder of the year at how lead times have compressed, and that's led to the destocking you referred to. We're now getting to a more normal relationship between order rate and shipment rate. So we're starting to -- and that's what I was alluding to in the answer to Tim's question, we still -- we're comfortable operating in this environment. So I think what we are experiencing now are macro lighting trends. And unfortunately, we're in a period where people are just buying less lighting and lighting controls. I'll also highlight, though, that as Karen pointed out, the Intelligent Spaces Group continues to grow mid-teens.So the portfolio of the business is expanding. At the same time, in both the Lighting business and the Spaces business, we've been able to layer in margin despite the decline in sales at ABL.Joe O’Dea: Got it. And then on the cash side, I think another year of solid cash generation. You did less on the buyback side. You ended with cash in a pretty strong position. And so just any commentary around what you might be seeing on the M&amp;A pipeline side of things? Or is it kind of as you're monitoring may be a little bit choppier environment, the bias to hold a little bit more cash, how we should think about buyback posture in 2024?Karen Holcom: Yeah. Thank you, Joe. You'll see in the presentation that we'll post -- we've talked about some of the assumptions that reflect our cash priorities for next year. So our cash -- our capital allocation priorities are going to be the same. First to invest in our current businesses for growth. Second, to invest in M&amp;A. Third, to maintain our dividend. And fourth, will be share repurchases. And so at this point, we've repurchased about 23% of our shares since we started at the beginning of fiscal -- fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. And so we're looking at this upcoming year about $40 million to $60 million in share repurchases is what we would expect, and you'll see that in the presentation. And then, Neil, do you want to comment on?Neil Ashe: I'd just add a couple of things, Joe. First is, obviously, we have done, I think, a very -- an outstanding job of generating cash. So through layering in margin and aggressive management of our balance sheet and working capital, especially on the lighting side, we've demonstrated the ability to generate a significant amount of cash. Our priorities, as Karen outlined, are -- remain the same. We want to grow our business. And so -- but when the market presents us with opportunities, we will take advantage of those opportunities to repurchase shares. We've demonstrated since we've been here over the last 2.5 years that when the stock goes down, we buy more and when the stock goes up, we buy less. And -- but our focus and our priorities are in the order and Karen mentioned them.We want to grow our current business and we want to grow the platform through acquisitions. And we feel good about our opportunities in all of those. On the acquisition side, our priority is the -- is to continue to add to our Intelligent Spaces Group. We think that there are very interesting and in some cases, meaningful opportunities to expand there. And so that's where we're spending the most of our time. But we are also open for business on the lighting side to other specific opportunities.Joe O’Dea: Great. Thanks very much.Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS.Chris Snyder: Thank you. I wanted to ask about the ABL guide for 2024. And specifically, what we should expect in first half versus second half. So down low to mid-single for the year. I think Neil talked about pressure in the market through the end of this calendar year. So I would assume that the declines are steeper in the first half and then moderate in the back half. Is there any color about how we should be thinking about the slope of ABL in '24 as we're kind of working towards to that low to mid-single digit decline? Thank you.Neil Ashe: Yeah. So, Chris, thanks for the question. I would guide you back to kind of historical sequential trends where obviously, on a sequential basis, we drop off from fourth quarter to first quarter and from first quarter to second quarter. And last year, in those same periods, we were still at inflated levels of backlog as we were burning through backlog. So then we get you to a more normal -- in our assumptions, get you to a more normal cadence in the back half of the year.Chris Snyder: Thank you. I appreciate that. So it sounds like maybe high single digit type declines in the first half, if I run that seasonality. And certainly, we see how the comps in the back half get easier. And is the uplift in growth really just kind of a function of the comps getting a lot easier into the back half? Or is there also an assumption that the macro will become more supportive into the back half? Thank you.Neil Ashe: So our assumptions aren't relying on significant improvement on the -- from a macro environment. As I mentioned, we have returned to a more normal relationship between order intake and shipment rates. So we are -- and as I mentioned, we're comfortable executing in this environment. So I think what we are ultimately suggesting for fiscal 2024 is that by the back half of the year, we end up kind of clearing all of the legacy impacts of the increased backlogs and all of the other supply chain things. And so we end up with a more normal year. I think if you were -- if the economy matched up with our fiscal year, which it has no interest in what our fiscal year is, then you would say -- you would notice the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2023 and the first and second quarters of fiscal 2024 on a calendar basis.But that gets us to where we are, which is kind of where you suggest, which is we'll be down in ABL in the first half of the year, and it will normalize a little bit in the back.Chris Snyder: Thank you. Appreciate that.Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.Unidentified Analyst: Hi, thanks for taking the question. This is Grace on for Brian. I guess my first question, just to follow up on the last question. Sounds like you're expecting improvement. You called out the assumption of clearing all the legacy impact of the increased backlog. Just curious like what gives you the confidence to see that improvement? Are you seeing like sell-through improvement from quarter-over-quarter?Neil Ashe: Yeah, Grace, as I pointed out, we've returned in the lighting business to a more normal relationship between order intake and shipment rates within the quarter. So we are at normal lead times. So our lead times are in the 20- to 30-day range in our lighting business, which translates to a performance where orders and shipments are consistent. As I explained in response to Chris' question, the -- we were at this point in the -- last year for our fiscal first and second quarters in lighting, we were burning through additional backlog. So we obviously are not burning through additional backlog anymore. So we have returned to a more normal correlation between order intake and shipment rate.Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you. I’ll pass it on.Neil Ashe: Thank you.Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jeff Osborne with TD Cowen.Jeff Osborne: Hey, good morning. Just, Neil, you mentioned several times, expanding geographically and control planes on the ISG side. Do you have any organic efforts there? You alluded to potentially meaningful M&amp;A activity there. I was just curious how to balance those two comments.Neil Ashe: So that is basically all organic. So Distech continues to grow. We've called out the UK where we've had some success in that market, and we'll continue to expand in Asia over the course in Australia over the course of this year and beyond. So that is primarily organic growth. The acquisition that added to that would be KE2 Therm, which added refrigeration controls. So those are added. So we're confident in the organic cash, I mean, the organic growth at ISG. Any acquisitions we make would then be in addition to that, and we see some interesting opportunities there as well.Jeff Osborne: Perfect. And then either for you, Neil, or Karen, what are the assumptions around price and volume mix as it relates to the revenue guidance for the year?Neil Ashe: Yeah. I'll take that one, Jeff. So, as Karen has explained through the course of this year, volume was -- we had a healthy mix in fiscal 2023 first half of both volume and price. That was, again, as we were burning through the backlog. Through the back half of this year, we have delivered performance largely through price as volumes have moderated. So, on a sequential basis, we feel pretty decent on the relationship between volume and price. So we think we're in a healthy balance of both of those for -- in our lighting guidance for 2024. They are -- the volume is impacting and we're comfortable with where we are in price.Jeff Osborne: Got it. Thank you. That’s all I had.Neil Ashe: Thanks, Jeff.Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.Jeffrey Sprague: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. If we just follow up a little bit back to what you just said on price. So if I understand, you're saying most of the revenue decline that we see in the quarter is price. Is that what you meant? Could you just kind of clarify what you said?Neil Ashe: Yeah. Sorry, if I left with that impression, that was not what I intended to say. So I was talking about fiscal '24 in response to other Jeff's question, which was -- and so how we how we got the -- how we got to our net sales assumptions for the lighting business next year.Jeffrey Sprague: Got it. And then if I recall, you haven't actually made a major pricing move for the better part of the year. Is that correct? And do you have additional pricing actions in the market at this point in time?Neil Ashe: So as we've mentioned consistently, Jeff, we have -- our strategy, the underlying strategy of product vitality, service, technology and productivity has afforded us the opportunity to more strategically manage price. So while there were a number of broad pricing actions through kind of '22 and '23, we've become significantly more targeted in those actions now. So for example, we're in the market now. We just recently announced a price increase around certain controls products this quarter. The -- we're also strategic about where we choose to invest in price. That's generally in the Contractor Select portfolio, and it's generally to expand our market share in the electrical distribution channel. And it's highly targeted.So it's very low dollars comparative investment on a percentage basis. So the strategy has empowered us to more strategically manage price. And so we are no longer really going after broad-based pricing changes like that up and down, but more strategically managing on different categories and for different reasons.Jeffrey Sprague: And then maybe just one last one. So the cash flow was solid in '23. But by my math, the inventory days are actually now a fair amount below normal. Can you do more on inventory or working capital at this point? Maybe just a little -- some thought on cash outlook for 2024.Karen Holcom: Yeah, I think as we look ahead, Jeff, I agree, we had a really good performance this year with our cash flow generation, and we were able to improve our days. I think there's still some opportunity as we look ahead, probably not to the magnitude of what you see in -- or what we saw in 2023. So for example, if you think about where we were in '22, we had high levels of inventory because of lead times from our suppliers. We were able to bring that down to a little bit better than our normal levels of inventory. But I think as we continue to drive the strategy, particularly at ABL, around product vitality, service, technology and productivity, there is still room for some improvement as we kind of drive that strategy throughout the business.Neil Ashe: And Jeff, I'd love to take this opportunity to summarize kind of where I think we are from a performance perspective. Obviously, it's hard to increase margins when sales are declining. We've demonstrated that we can do that. It's also hard to make the kind of improvements that we've demonstrated and you highlighted from a working capital perspective, we've structurally improved the business. The strategy, as Karen outlined, has changed, both where we -- how we operate and how successfully we can operate. So that makes us very comfortable with our continuing performance around margin and cash generation.Jeffrey Sprague: Great. Thank you.Neil Ashe: Thanks.Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Joe, your line is now open.Joe O’Dea: Hi, thanks for taking the follow-up. I just want to circle back to the kind of sequential commentary. So it seems like if we run sort of normal seasonality out of the fourth quarter kind of revenue rate, we get roughly to the midpoint. I guess that also would seem to imply that you're going from an environment where you were dealing with channel inventory rationalization that ends. And so arguably, there should be an uplift and maybe the incremental pressures that the macro is a little bit more challenging. And so just wanted to sort of touch on that dynamic again a little bit more. And then within that, I think a tremendous amount of focus on sort of verticals within non-res and so any additional commentary sort of on thoughts that you have around kind of verticals that would be stronger where you're maybe paying a little bit closer attention to any potential softness.Neil Ashe: Yeah, Joe, thanks for the follow-up. So again, we would like to provide you as much of a read through the macro as we can, but we can only kind of comment really on our performance. And so as it relates to that, as just to kind of reiterate, in the first half of fiscal 2023, we were burning through backlog. We have now returned to a more normal order and relationship between order and shipment rates, where our order rate is -- it drives basically the shipments within the quarter, and we're at kind of a 20- to 30-day lead times, so average lead time in the lighting business. So things are relatively back to normal. So on a sequential basis, that's how you see the more traditional sequential seasonality play out. So as we look forward, I'd like to say we know more about the macro environment than others.The advantage, but we -- I don't think we do. The advantage we have is that our portfolio on the lighting side really addresses the -- wherever there can be growth in the marketplace. So the product vitality efforts that we have undertaken, the service levels we have undertaken, allows us to be strong in retail, strong in electrical distribution, strong in each of the categories, well positioned for infrastructure. So we are in the places where we can benefit from any changes in the lighting market. In the meantime, we're comfortable operating at these kind of levels of market activity and continuing to deliver the margins and the cash flow that Karen effectively highlighted through the guidance.Joe O’Dea: Thanks for those details.Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS. Chris, your line is now open.Chris Snyder: Hey, sorry about that. I was on mute. Thank you guys for letting me hop back in here. I just wanted to ask on gross margin. I don't believe this has come up. Can you just talk about what level of gross margin is implied in the guide next year as we're going from $3.7 billion to $4 billion of revenue to that $13.00 to $14.50 of earnings? Thank you.Neil Ashe: Yeah, sure. Chris, I'll take that. The -- as Karen pointed out, the -- all we are guiding to is net sales and adjusted EPS. I'm confident in your math skill, so you'll quickly realize that, that implies that we are -- we don't need to be at the levels of margin we were in the fourth quarter to -- for the full year next year to deliver that range. What it does say, though, is that, as I was responding to Jeff Sprague earlier, we have structurally improved this business, which allows us to operate at higher margins than the company has operated in the past. It's worth saying that the fourth quarter gross profit margins are the highest in the history of the company. So we don't have to maintain those levels to continue to deliver what we consider to be outstanding performance.And further, as I have pointed out repeatedly, the -- and our value creation model is about growing net sales, turning profits into cash and not growing the balance sheet as fast. So we've made structural changes, which allow us to operate at these higher margin levels and to turn those margins into cash. So we feel really good about kind of the permanence of the changes that we've made in the lighting business and the continued opportunity we have to improve that. At the same time, we can continue to grow the portfolio through ISG and then through adding additional businesses to the portfolio.Chris Snyder: I really appreciate that. And if I could follow up with one more, and it's probably the biggest question that I get, is when we look at this gross margin, I mean it's pretty incredible, up 340 basis points versus the start of the year. But at the same time, volumes have rolled. I understand that there's the backlog dynamic. I understand maybe the macro is a bit softer. But do you guys think that there is any negative volume impact from this big uplift in gross margin? And how does the company think about balancing that? It feels like there's a bit of maybe a sliding scale dynamic. Thank you. I appreciate it.Neil Ashe: Yeah. No, I appreciate you asking the question and giving us the opportunity to address it. We talked a bit about this in the third quarter call. But I want to reflect on it some more, which is most importantly, our strategy in the lighting business around product vitality, service, technology and productivity has put us in a position to manage price and to manage margins in a step function better way than we have in the past. And so we feel really good about that. As we have evaluated volumes, and I was addressing this with Jeff's question, we strategically managed price where we choose to where we think we can drive volume. We realize that at these margin levels, we've created a significant amount of value. And so we have a lot of incentive to continue to operate at these margin levels.All of the data that we are looking at across verticals says that we are appropriately pricing for the volume that's available in the market. And that's our goal over time. So we will -- that's why we've continued to layer in margin and cash flow during this low volume period and why we believe we're well positioned for the inevitable return of volume growth at some point in the future.Chris Snyder: Thank you. I really appreciate that.Neil Ashe: Thanks, Chris.Operator: Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions in queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Neil Ashe for any closing remarks.Neil Ashe: First of all, thank you all for spending some time with us this morning. We're really proud of our financial performance, as we've talked about through the call. We had a great year. We delivered strong financial performance. We continue to structurally improve both the lighting business, and we continue to grow the Intelligent Spaces Group, and we allocated capital effectively. Our priorities for next year remain the same. We're going to continue to focus on operating excellence in the lighting business and making it more predictable, repeatable and scalable. We'll continue to grow the Spaces business, and we will be consistent with our capital allocation priorities. So we look forward to being back together with you at the end of the quarter, and hope you have a good rest of your day. Thank you for your interest in Acuity Brands.Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.]"

(NYSE:PVH) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 13% in the last quarter. But looking back over the last year, the returns have actually been rather pleasing! After all, the share price is up a market-beating 46% in that time.Since the long term performance has been good but there's been a recent pullback of 3.4%, let's check if the fundamentals match the share price. See our latest analysis for PVH There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During the last year, PVH actually saw its earnings per share drop 78%.Given the share price gain, we doubt the market is measuring progress with EPS. Therefore, it seems likely that investors are putting more weight on metrics other than EPS, at the moment.We doubt the modest 0.2% dividend yield is doing much to support the share price. Revenue was pretty flat year on year, but maybe a closer look at the data can explain the market optimism.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-and-revenue-growthPVH is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. Given we have quite a good number of analyst forecasts, it might be well worth checking out this free chart depicting consensus estimates.A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that PVH shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 47% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That certainly beats the loss of about 7% per year over the last half decade. We generally put more weight on the long term performance over the short term, but the recent improvement could hint at a (positive) inflection point within the business. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand PVH better, we need to consider many other factors.

11,bdbffb83-c2da-3924-b23a-556fc106e55c,USB,2023-10-06,U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 76% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-bancorp-nyse-usb-favoured-110042768.html,1696590042,STORY,['USB'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in U.S. Bancorp implies that they have significant influence over the company's share priceA total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 47% ownership Recent sales by insiders Every investor in U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 76% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of U.S. Bancorp. View our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About U.S. Bancorp?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that U.S. Bancorp does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of U.S. Bancorp, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in U.S. Bancorp. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.4% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.1% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 3.9% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of U.S. BancorpWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of U.S. Bancorp in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$98m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 23% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over U.S. Bancorp. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for U.S. Bancorp  that you should be aware of.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

And when it comes to play, Jackson competes in beep baseball, a sport that is accessible for people who are blind or visually impaired.Jackson joined U.S. Bank almost three years ago and works as an accessibility experience designer, evaluating the images and text the bank uses in its mobile banking apps and digital banking tools for desktop and laptop users.""We make sure that accessibility is considered in the design because when access is considered throughout the ideation of the design phase, it reduces the chances of a product having accessibility issues when it goes into development,"" Jackson said. ""We base our guidance on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and use the current international standards.""Beep baseballJackson began playing beep baseball about 10 years ago when he joined a local team in Georgia, where he lives.""I ended up playing with three different teams here in Georgia and made it to the Georgia State Games,"" he said. ""I'm a Georgia State Games Gold Medal winner. Ironically, I played my worst game that day, but the guys around me were on, so we won.""As the name suggests, beep baseball includes a ball that beeps so that athletes who are blind or visually impaired are able to locate it by sound.There are only two bases in the game, first base and third base, and they're four-foot-tall padded cylinders equipped with speakers that make a buzzing sound. When batters hit the ball, one of the bases will start buzzing, meaning batters don't know which base they need to run to until after they hit the ball.Story continuesThere are six fielders who cover different zones. If a fielder picks up a batted ball before the hitter makes it to the designated base, the batter is out. If the batter gets to the base before a fielder gets the ball, it counts as a run. There is no running between bases.The pitcher and catcher are not visually impaired and pitchers pitch to their own team, with the goal of throwing a pitch the batter can hit. Because players have different levels of visual disabilities, the batter and fielders wear blindfolds. There will also be at least one spotter in the field who isn't visually impaired and can give limited instructions to fielders, with the goal of helping to prevent fielders from colliding while going after a ball.""The spotters don't always save us,"" Jackson said. ""There are collisions and some of us can get pretty banged up.""Jackson has competed in the National Beep Baseball Association World Series four times, including this year and last year with the Texas-based Tyler Tigers.""There haven't always been a lot of options for us when it comes to competing at that level and it's wonderful when you can do this,"" he said. ""The competition and the camaraderie with the different teams is second to none.""Accessibility in actionIt's a similar camaraderie that Jackson said he loves about his team at the bank. Because he and his fellow accessibility experience designers are embedded within each of the digital product teams, they can have a significant impact on the way digital tools like the mobile app and online banking look and function.The team works to help U.S. Bank clients do their digital banking with simplicity and ease - regardless of any permanent, situational or temporary disability.Jackson said he's already looking forward to next year's Beep Baseball World Series.""Oh man, I love playing,"" he said. ""There are only three things I love more than the sport of beep baseball: my faith in God, my family and what I do every day when I show up to work, which is to make a difference in individuals' lives by empowering them to impact the world through accessible products.""View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from U.S. Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: U.S. BankWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/us-bankEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: U.S. BankView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/790330/love-of-the-game-drives-employee-to-compete-in-beep-baseball-world-series]"

CF, ICL Group Ltd. ICL and Intrepid Potash, Inc. IPI.Industry: FertilizerLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2159824/3-top-fertilizer-stocks-to-buy-from-a-promising-industryThe Zacks Fertilizers industry is expected to benefit from strong demand fundamentals for major crop nutrients, including phosphate and potash. The underlying strength of the agricultural market and attractive farm economics are spurring demand for fertilizers globally.Industry players such as CF Industries Holdings, Inc., ICL Group Ltd. and Intrepid Potash, Inc. are poised to gain from higher demand for fertilizers in the major markets. While weak fertilizer prices pose headwinds, factors like healthy farm income and expectations of increased planted acres are expected to drive crop nutrient demand globally in the near term.About the IndustryThe Zacks Fertilizers industry comprises producers, distributors and marketers of crop nutrients for the global agriculture industry. Companies in this space offer nutrients such as phosphates (including diammonium phosphate, monoammonium phosphate and phosphoric acid), potash and nitrogen (including urea, ammonia and urea ammonium nitrate) fertilizers. They also provide other nitrogen products to help farmers maximize crop yield.Crop nutrients are essential to drive agricultural productivity and the natural fertility of the soil. Demand for these nutrients is being supported by the need to increase the production of grains to address rising food consumption globally. Moreover, the constant need of growers to nourish their crops, replenish nutrients in the soil following a harvest and boost yields to feed a growing global population boosts the consumption of fertilizers.What's Shaping the Future of the Fertilizers Industry?Strong Demand for Crop Nutrients: The companies in the fertilizers space are well-placed to benefit from strong global demand for major crop nutrients. In the United States, healthy farm profits and high levels of planted acreage are expected to drive demand for fertilizers. Strong farmer economics are also expected to support demand in major markets such as Brazil and India.Story continuesThe phosphate market is benefiting from higher global demand and low producer and channel inventories. Strong grower economics and healthy crop commodity prices are also expected to drive potash demand globally. Demand for nitrogen fertilizer also remains healthy in major markets. High levels of corn planted acres should drive demand for nitrogen in North America. Moreover, demand for urea imports remains favorable in Brazil and India.Agricultural Fundamentals Remain Favorable: While the coronavirus pandemic stung a vast spectrum of industries, agriculture was relatively unscathed, given the sustained rise in food demand globally. Moreover, strong global demand coupled with supply constraints boosted crop commodity prices. Higher freight, energy and labor costs and raw material shortages contributed to the upside.Prices of corn, soybean and wheat rallied to multi-year highs last year, partly driven by supply worries stemming from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and are likely to remain elevated due to lingering concerns over the war. Farmer economics also remain attractive in most global growing regions on strong crop demand. Expectations of high levels of planted corn and soybean acres globally also suggest a pickup in fertilizer demand.Weaker Fertilizer Prices a Concern: Fertilizer prices surged to historic high levels in the first half of 2022, riding on the impacts of the war in Ukraine that led grain prices shooting to record levels and export curtailments in China to meet domestic demand. Disruptions due to the sanctions in Belarus also contributed to the spike.However, prices of phosphate and potash retreated in the back half of the year from their peak levels as farmers reduced application rates due to affordability issues. Escalating costs led to growers reducing fertilizer applications or switching to less fertilizer-intensive crops. Global nitrogen prices have declined since the beginning of 2023.Higher global supply availability driven by higher global operating rates has resulted in a decline in prices. While fertilizer prices have stabilized somewhat of late, weaker year-over-year prices are likely to dent the profitability of companies in this space over the near term.Zacks Industry Rank Reflects Upbeat ProspectsThe Zacks Fertilizers industry is part of the broader Zacks Basic Materials sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #82, which places it in the top 33% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates a bright near term.

Strategic Resource Group Managing Director Burt Flickinger states that the “significant concerns” of side effects surrounding appetite suppressants should be the focus and states that retailers like Walmart and Costco (COST) “have better prices” for products that could aid consumers in losing weight.Noting that many consumers are living paycheck to paycheck, Flickinger believes the “second half of this decade” is where the effects of these drugs might be felt by food sellers.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video Transcript- Walmart raising concerns about the popularity of these weight loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy on its bottom line. The retail giant saying it's seeing consumers pull back as some analysts warn of bigger issues for food companies as a result of the drugs. Joining us now is Burt Flickinger, strategic resource group managing director.So Burt, let me ask you this because you're a-- you're an investor watching right now, and you have money you put it to work in fast food chains, candy makers. Burt, should you be worried about these popularity of these appetite suppressing drugs?BURT FLICKINGER: I know, Josh, and you and Annalee just synthesize it very well, referring to the Jeffrey's research. There is no GLP one jail. So there are only a few million consumers on these drugs. They're significant concerns in terms of side effects, most of them gastro, and the weight population in terms of the CDC. People percent overweight and or obese is doubled in children, adult women, and adult men during the last generation.So there's plenty of room for weight loss drugs, and there's plenty of room for better nutrition, exercise, health care, and especially private label products from the retailers like Walmart, Kroger, Costco that have better products at much more competitive prices, that people can get good nutrition and live much more healthfully going forward without the risk of drug side effects like the GLP-1 drugs side effects that you and Julie just reported-- you and Annalee just reported.Story continues- Hey, Burt. It's Julie here. It's good to see you. You mentioned Walmart. Walmart, head of US operations, making headlines yesterday for saying that the drugs are having an effect according at least to their data, do you think they're just making excuses or preparing the street for a hit to sales here?BURT FLICKINGER: Julie, your retail instincts are the best of anybody in the industry. And you're right again because Walmart's slowing is 60% of consumers are paycheck to paycheck, cash to credit constrained crop year prices during the last two years have cut in half. National brand manufacturers haven't lowered the prices. Walmart's getting the benefit of inflation.But like Dollar General, like Dollar Tree, like Target, Walmart's missing the numbers. So companies like Target on Yahoo Finance near a 52 week low while Novo Nordisk, which I'm also a shareholder as well with all the retailers stock, has doubled during the last year. I think there's-- to quote Alan Greenspan, ""a little too much irrational exuberance.""Jefferies is also reported on GLP-1 drugs. Walmart, Target, Costco, Kroger will all do well in the future, but the GLP-1 drugs will not have a meaningful effect until the second half of this decade, not the first half of this decade.]"

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Raymond James Financial (NYSE:RJF). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. View our latest analysis for Raymond James Financial How Fast Is Raymond James Financial Growing?If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. It certainly is nice to see that Raymond James Financial has managed to grow EPS by 25% per year over three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Not all of Raymond James Financial's revenue this year is revenue from operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers used in this article might not be the best representation of the underlying business. While we note Raymond James Financial achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 2.8% to US$11b. That's progress.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-historyOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Raymond James Financial.Are Raymond James Financial Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Raymond James Financial has a market capitalisation of US$21b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$2.0b. Investors will appreciate management having this amount of skin in the game as it shows their commitment to the company's future.Is Raymond James Financial Worth Keeping An Eye On?You can't deny that Raymond James Financial has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. With EPS growth rates like that, it's hardly surprising to see company higher-ups place confidence in the company through continuing to hold a significant investment. On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research. You should always think about risks though. Case in point, we've spotted   1 warning sign for Raymond James Financial  you should be aware of.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

Of this cohort, Wedbush's work showed average student loan debt balances ranging from $0 to $50,000.Read more: Worried about when student loan repayments resume? These programs could helpThe Grinch balloon passes by windows of a building on Central Park West during Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York Thursday, Nov. 23, 2017. (Craig Ruttle/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)The categories that were most often cited as areas for spending pullbacks were restaurants, apparel, and electronics.Some of the most at-risk retailers from any spending slowdown are discretionary names such as Williams-Sonoma (WSM), Wayfair (W), and Best Buy (BBY) Nikic said.The restart of payments — after a crushing blow in June to President Biden's plan to forgive up to $20,000 in debt for millions of borrowers — has put the crippling amount of student debt on the books of many households back into the spotlight.The total amount of student debt in the US tallies a bloated $1.8 trillion, per the most recent data from the Federal Reserve. Student loan debt levels have tripled since 2008.An estimated 43 million people in the US have some amount of outstanding student loan debt, so a wide swath of the population could be poised to rein in consumption into year-end.Data from the Federal Reserve estimates that the typical student loan payment ranges from $200 to $299 a month. US consumers could now end up making an incremental $120 billion of student loan payments annually, estimates Nikic.Nikic's research computes that if consumers need to spend an incremental $120 billion annually on student loan payments, it could wipe off 2.5% of the total $5 trillion in discretionary spending done annually.That's brutal news for retailers still contending with high merchandise inflation, rampant theft, and a shift to demand for services.Story continues""With consumers now needing to divert some of their monthly income towards student loan payments, there is risk that this could 'crowd out' other spending items,"" Nikic explained. ""Furthermore, this comes at a time when U.S. consumers are increasingly feeling pressures from a variety of sources, including waning pandemic savings, rising gas prices, record-high credit card debt, and a continued normalization of spending on services vs. goods. Thus, these factors could combine to weigh on a variety of companies, including retailers of discretionary goods.""A customer pays for shoes with cash in a store at a shopping center during Black Friday sales, in Caracas, Venezuela, Nov. 25, 2022. (Leonardo Fernandez Viloria/REUTERS) (Leonardo Fernandez Viloria / reuters)In fact, discretionary retailers may be seeing the first round of effects that Nikic discussed.Macy's (M) said its second quarter credit card sales tanked 36% from the prior year to $150 million. Department store rival Nordstrom (JWN) voiced that it's seeing a similar trend.Interest on student loans began accruing once again on Sept. 1 after several COVID-related pauses.Read more: Can you pay student loans with a credit card?The rise in credit card payment delinquencies and weak credit sales prompted BofA to slash its profit estimates on both Macy's and Nordstrom last week.In turn, investors continue to approach shares of discretionary retailers cautiously into the start of the holiday shopping season.The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLY) has shed 7% in the past three months, worse than the 4.5% decline in the S&amp;P 500. Shares of Macy's and Nordstrom are down 32% and 30%, respectively, over the same stretch. Kohl's (KSS) is off by 23% while Target (TGT) has declined by 22%.Another new survey out this week from Morgan Stanley's Jeffrey Adelson found that only 24% of student borrowers can make their full monthly payment without reducing spending. That is down from 29% just three months ago.About 50% of student debt borrowers intend to begin paying their loans this month, meaning consumers' cash flows are getting ""tighter,"" Adelson pointed out.""Consumers are having an incrementally harder time making ends meet over the past several months,"" Adelson said.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

This has impacted Levi's sales at retail partners such as Walmart and Target, where prices of its Signature and Denizen lines start just below $30.Net revenue in Levi's Americas segment decreased 5%, even as its direct-to-customer (DTC) business, which serves a more affluent consumer, rose 12%.""The brand is trying to sell more through DTC but overall will probably face headwinds going into the holiday season,"" said Michael Ashley Schulman, a partner at Running Point Capital.Its margins were also hit by price cuts on certain denim bottoms sold to wholesale retailers like Macy's and Nordstrom in a bid to boost sales among more price-sensitive shoppers.Levi's adjusted gross margins declined 130 basis points to 55.6% during the third quarter, also hurt by lower full-price selling and higher product costs.Story continuesAnalysts have said Levi might have to increase promotions and cut prices if wholesale channel sales continue to worsen, which could pressure its margins further. Shareholders are skeptical of the company's prospects ahead of the key holiday season, according to Schulman, even as executives pledge to expand Levi's denim assortment into skirts, dresses and other womenswear.""It seems that management's narrative of an expanding casualization trend in workwear and potential European and Asian growth is not resonating with investors,"" he said.Levi forecast revenue to be flat to up 1% in fiscal 2023, compared with prior estimate of 1.5% to 2.5% growth.The company said it expects an adjusted profit per share at the low end of its prior estimated range of $1.10 to $1.20. Analysts on average were expecting $1.12.Net revenue declined to $1.51 billion in the quarter ended Aug. 27 from $1.52 billion a year earlier, missing analysts' estimate of $1.54 billion, according to LSEG data.

Cybersecurity insurance should cover most of the costs, MGM said, although the full impact has yet to be determined.MGM, the largest casino operator on the Las Vegas Strip, said the damage is contained at this point, though the hackers obtained personal information about customers who visited the resorts prior to March 2019. That personal information includes Social Security and passport numbers, MGM said.The company doesn’t believe the perpetrators obtained customer passwords or bank account information, nor is it aware of any identify theft or fraud as a result of the hack.“We responded swiftly, shut down our systems to mitigate risk to customer information, and began a thorough investigation of the attack,” Chief Executive Officer Bill Hornbuckle said in a letter to customers.The hackers obtained access to the company’s computer systems by tricking IT service desk staff, Bloomberg News has reported. Caesars Entertainment Inc., another large casino operator, was attacked by the same group and paid them to go away.The assault crippled casino and hotel operations at MGM nationwide. Guests had to check in to the hotels by writing their information on clipboards. Slot machine patrons were paid out by hand, rather than through paper vouchers. Some guests were unable to use credit cards or charge anything to their rooms. The hack also took out the company’s websites, which meant guests couldn’t reserve rooms online.Story continuesMGM said occupancy at its hotels was 88% in September, compared with 93% the prior year. The company forecast a return to that level in October and November, when a big Formula One race comes to town.Read more: Casino Hackers Use Low-Tech Tricks to Exploit Corporate Targets(Updates with insurance coverage in second paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe War in Israel Shows How Social Media’s Idealistic Era Has EndedWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money EraBusiness Schools Aim to Build Entrepreneurs With Expanded ProgramsHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?Europe at War Can’t Ignore Poland’s Bitter Election©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Michael Burry Stocks Other Hedge Funds Like Most.A market crash before yearend is the latest prediction by famed investor Michael Burry. The legendary investor who accurately predicted the 2007 financial crisis is sounding the alarm bells that the US stock market will crash and has started using 90% of his portfolio to bet on the market downturn using options. Obviously we don't know the exercise price of these options, but it is very likely that these positions appreciated as the S&amp;P 500 declined in recent weeks.Burry has never shied away from controversy, having made bold bets and predictions in the past, some of which have turned out to be true. The Scion Asset Management founder made $100 million for himself and $725 million for his investors when he shorts the housing market ahead of the market crash in 2007.With a net worth of about $1.2 billion, he makes a fortune by taking short positions in assets and counters he believes are overvalued amid deteriorating fundamentals and macroeconomics. The value investor and stark proponent of fundamental analysis are best known for his research acumen, which allowed him to make bold bets in the past. Likewise, his moves in the market are followed by amateur and professional investors.Regulatory filings indicate the investor has taken a $1.6 billion short position that will accrue profits in case of a market downturn. Fillings indicate that he has taken negative options on the S&amp;P 500 and The NASDAQ 100, representing the US economy. The fillings through his asset management firm Scion Asset Management show large stakes against the two stock indexes that give him the right to sell the asset at the particular price.The short bets come as the S&amp;P 500 has risen by about 16% year to date, and the Nasdaq 100 is also up by about 28%. Nevertheless, the two indexes came under pressure at the end of the third quarter. The NASDAQ posted its biggest monthly loss for the year in September, signaling waning upward momentum.Story continuesThe NASDAQ dropping 5.8% in September is already sounding warning bells of a potential market reversal. The pullback comes as Burry continues questioning the slowing of the US economy amid the high-interest rate environment. While most economics predict a soft landing, Burry remains skeptical; thus, the short bet on the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P 100 represents the US economy.Even though Burry is pessimistic about the overall stock market outlook, he does not always get it right. In January he tweeted “Sell” to his 1.4 million followers. Barely a month later had, he admitted he was wrong as he wrote: “I was wrong to say sell.”What followed was the market rally, with the S&amp;P 500 recouping all the losses accrued in 2022. The Nasdaq 100 also saw its year gains surge to over 40% affirming the bull trend. Likewise, when inflation was at its peak last year, Burry predicted a stock market crash, suggesting that the S&amp;P 500 would bottom below 1900 based on how it has fared during past crashes. However, that is yet to come true a year after as inflation has declined significantly.15 Michael Burry Stocks Other Hedge Funds Like Too.Michael Burry of Scion Asset ManagementBurry was also burned when he opened a short position on Tesla, reiterating that the electric vehicle giant was overvalued. While taking the short position in 2020, he advised the company’s CEO, Elon Musk, to use the opportunity to raise capital by issuing more shares. While the stock was trading for $250 at the time, it ended up doubling in value, putting Burry in a big loss in his short position.Burry also predicted in the summer of last year that American households faced the risk of exhausting their savings by year-end owing to rising prices and soaring borrowing costs. He warned of a risk of a decline in consumer spending that would erode corporate profits. For now, consumer spending has proved to be resilient, with the economy holding steady, supported by a solid labor market.While the famed investor remains bearish heading into year end, he remains bullish on some stocks that other hedge funds are closely following.

The year-on-year oil price is now falling again and tracking losses of 5%.That's a significant relief for the inflation part of the bond blowup and will help keep a lid on U.S. pump prices.But to the extent the oil price is flagging renewed concerns about global growth - in part due to the relentless rise in borrowing rates - can be seen in a retreat in commodity prices in general. Copper prices fell to their lowest of the year on Thursday and core commodity indexes are back at August levels.Two-year U.S. inflation expectations in the bond market have plunged about 30 basis points to just 2.13% over the past two weeks - as near as makes no difference to the Federal Reserve's target.Whether that darkening demand picture holds or not will again hinge on the critical U.S. employment report out later on Friday - where a marginal slowing of monthly payroll growth to 170,000 last month is expected, alongside a downtick in the jobless rate to 3.7%.This week's surprisingly soft private sector payrolls data from ADP was countered by other readings showing still modest weekly jobless claims, relatively contained layoffs in September and a rebound in job openings in August.All to play for then.And the latest Fed soundings indicate that the screaming rise in Treasury yields to new 16-year highs close to 5% - a jump of at least half a percentage point in 10-year rates - may have achieved the sort of additional credit tightening that obviates the need for another Fed policy rate hike.Story continuesSan Francisco Fed boss Mary Daly said that with monetary policy ""well into"" restrictive territory and Treasury yields so high, the central bank may not need to raise rates further.All of which sees U.S. bond yields retain an uneasy calm into the jobs numbers. Ten-year yields hovered about 4.75% on Friday - still off Tuesday's peak at 4.88%.Implied rates from Fed futures markets pulled back the chances of another hike in the cycle to less than 50%.Seeing some potential light at the end of the tunnel, Wall St stocks staged a late comeback close to opening levels on Thursday and stock futures were steady ahead of today's open.The dollar stayed on the backfoot for now too.The other side of the bond market angst - U.S. fiscal policy stasis and the prospects of a government shutdown again next month - remained unresolved as Republicans moved to appoint a new House speaker after their unprecedented ouster of Kevin McCarthy from the post this week.Former President and leading candidate for next year's White House race Donald Trump said he's endorsing Congressman Jim Jordan for the post - an appointment that won't encourage any bets on congressional compromises to avert a shutdown.And that mixed picture of fiscal dysfunction and a potential economic hiatus from furloughing thousands of government workers is the backdrop to Treasury secretary Janet Yellen's trip to the annual International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings in Morocco next week.Elsewhere in the corporate world, shares of Tesla fell 1.47% to $256.22 premarket after the electric vehicle giant stepped up its aggressive discounting and cut prices of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in the U.S. by about 2.7% to 4.2%.In M&amp;A news, Exxon Mobil is in advanced talks to acquire Pioneer Natural Resources in a deal that could value the Permian shale basin producer at about $60 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Friday:* U.S. Sept employment report, Aug consumer credit; Canada Sept employment report* Federal Reserve Board Governor Christopher Waller(By Mike Dolan; Editing by Toby Chopra mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com.

Saudi Arabia and Russia have curbed output by an additional 1.3. million barrels per day (bpd) in addition to agreed OPEC+ cuts.Russia, the world's top seaborne diesel exporter, imposed a ban on fuel exports in late September. However, on Friday, Moscow lifted the ban on pipeline diesel exports via ports, removing the bulk of restrictions, although curbs on gasoline exports remain.The recent ban has left diesel supplies short, encouraging refiners to make more. For that, they are seeking to buy the medium-sweet crude that yields more of the fuel group known as distillates when it is refined.Differentials for such Nigerian grades are at their highest levels since August 2022, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 sent crude prices soaring, according to LSEG data.Bonga, for instance, is being offered at dated Brent plus $9 a barrel, while Escravos and Forcados are in excess of dated Brent plus $8, said a trader of West African crude.Differentials for Angolan grades of crude, which are lighter than those from Nigeria, have also gone up, another trader of West African crude said.""Sellers are betting on a market deficit,"" a third trader of West African crude said.The upward pressure on medium sweet crude has also been seen elsewhere. In Brazil, differentials for medium-sweet crude grades have risen by at least $2 a barrel since the last cycle, a trader of Brazilian crude told Reuters.Demand from Europe and Asia is strong, the trader said.LIGHTER CRUDE WEAKERLighter crudes including from Nigeria which have a lower diesel yield have also rallied although not to the same extent, traders said.Story continues""Differentials are strong across the board, but the more diesel-rich crudes are doing better,"" another trader said.Across the Atlantic, differentials for light sweet U.S. crude grades, which have a lower diesel yield, have weakened.The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude discount to the international benchmark Brent narrowed last week to as little as $2.56 a barrel, the narrowest since May 2022. That discouraged exports of U.S. crude abroad, and weakened differentials for light sweet crudes, traders said.WTI Midland , a light sweet U.S. grade, weakened to an 80-cent premium to U.S. crude futures last week, the weakest since May. Light Louisiana Sweet weakened to a 93-cent premium to U.S. crude futures, the weakest since December 2022.But European refiners need to produce enough diesel to cover this winter, so they are willing to pay higher premiums for heavier crudes from West Africa and beyond.Still, even with a narrower spread, U.S. light sweet grades still have seen some demand from buyers in Asia, because of tighter global supply and limited choice, a U.S.-based trader said.

But it also may be a sign of economic weakness with U.S. government data showing the four week average of gasoline demand at lowest seasonals in 26 years.Before this week's drop, gasoline prices had posted a 7.4% jump in the third quarter, riding increases in crude oil futures after production cuts from Saudi Arabia, Russia and other OPEC+ members.U.S. wholesale gasoline prices are tumbling, with percentage drops per gallon on Wednesday between 6.9% and 10.8%.A flurry of weak economic data took more wind out of the market. Crude futures settled an eye-popping $5 a barrel lower on Wednesday, and fell another $1.66 on Thursday.The four-week average of motor gasoline product supplied - a proxy for demand - averaged 8.3 million barrels a day, down 5% from the same period last year, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. [EIA/S]Demand data was partially influenced as drivers were deterred by severe rain and flooding on the U.S. East Coast.Gasoline stocks built by 6.5 million barrels in the week, well above analysts' expectations.""All told, fuel prices may be closer to consumers' pain threshold than inflation-adjusted prices might suggest,"" JP Morgan said in a note on Wednesday, indicating that high prices have led to consumers cutting back on driving.The 3-2-1 crack spread, a proxy for refining margins, fell below $20 a barrel for the first time in 18 month on Wednesday, and is down nearly 40% in the past month.The gasoline crack was $9.63 a barrel, the lowest pandemic-era shutdowns of 2020.Gasoline prices, currently averaging $3.77 a gallon, could end up near $3 a gallon in regions including the Midwest and East Coast later this autumn, said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service (OPIS).Story continuesThere were 20 U.S. states with some retailers charging under $3 a gallon, he said, and he expects half of the U.S. to hit that level by Oct. 31.The selloff was unusual considering a ban on diesel exports from Russia, continuing oil output cuts from OPEC, and heavy seasonal refinery maintenance curtailing fuel production, Kloza said.The U.S. ADP National Employment Report on Wednesday showed private payrolls rising by only 89,000 jobs in September, the smallest count since January 2021.Oil sold off on the view that 18 months of interest rate hikes by global central banks were inflicting economic pain.""When positioning is stretched it can easily turn into a bloodbath,"" said one crude trader.(Reporting by Laura Sanicola; Editing by David Gregorio)]"

Fresh signs of that caused both Brent crude and West Texas Intermediate oil to sink as much as 6% on Wednesday.""The gasoline crack has absolutely cratered, really remarkably,"" he said, referring to the price difference between crude and refined products. ""That's telling you the Saudis pushed the oil price too high.""And while demand is slower, the supply side is expected to remain steady.Sankey said it was unlikely Saudi Arabia would cut production further to prop up prices. He said the kingdom had already cut output to 9 million barrels a day, and any more reductions would damage the country's market share in oil.Meanwhile, US domestic oil production has held up, and supplies from sanctioned regimes such as Iran and Venezuela are helping offset cuts elsewhere.""All of those things haven't really been appreciated by the market, I don't think, but essentially, it allows for much more oil supply from sanctioned nations,"" he said.While factors such as a recent Canadian pipeline outage or production-cut decisions made by Russia could still swing oil markets in either direction, Sankey said wholesale prices would soon come in lower as demand keeps sliding.""You will see lower prices at the pump over the coming months,"" he added.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

These metrics will help us assess each zip code's affluence and relative wealth.The median home sale price data was obtained from Property Shark. The median household income data was gathered from Income by Zip Code and Zip Atlas.The median home sale price measures the typical or average price of homes sold in a specific area or market over a certain period. For example, Atherton, California, with a zip code of 94027, has a median home sale price of $7.9 million. This makes it the highest-ranked zip code on our list of the 30 richest zip codes in the US, based on median home sale price. Zip codes with higher median home sale prices suggest that the locals have accumulated wealth, possibly due to rising property values and higher incomes.The median household income measures the typical or average income level of households in a given area. It is calculated by ranking all households in the area by income and then taking the household's income in the middle. The median household income can be used to gauge the overall economic well-being of a community, city, or country, as it provides insight into the level of affluence and financial security of the residents.Zip codes with higher median income and median home sale prices can offer a better quality of life, as they tend to have more amenities, better job stability, higher incomes, and a more stable economic base. These factors can make them attractive places to live, work, and invest.We first ranked each zip code on each index from 1 to 30, with 1 indicating the zip code with the highest value for median home sale price and median household income. We then assigned weights of 0.5 to the median home sale price and 0.5 to the median household income. Finally, we calculated a composite weighted average of these scores to determine the 30 richest zip codes in the US. After the final calculation of the composite scores, the zip codes were ranked from 1 to 30, with 1 indicating the richest zip code and 30 indicating the least richest zip code.The median of each metric was used to measure both metrics to avoid skewness. Below is our list of the 30 richest zip codes in the US. Richest Zip Codes in the US30.

The Future Is Battery-Powered Electric CarsOnly an Equities Crash Can Rescue the Bond Market, Barclays SaysIn a wide-ranging interview, Kristalina Georgieva also said Zambia and Ghana, which have both defaulted on their debt, are making progress under their IMF programs, while Tunisia doesn’t need a restructuring yet but should act soon to shore up its economy.Egypt’s devalued the pound three times since early 2022, with the currency losing almost half its value against the dollar. Georgieva said it’s delaying the inevitable by holding off from doing so again and the longer it waits, the worse it will get.‘Sooner the Better’“The sooner we can reach an agreement on the road map for this the better,” she said. “The issue here is very simple. Egypt would bleed reserves protecting the pound and neither the country nor overall the environment is such that this is desirable. That’s a problem that has to be solved.”Egypt’s net international reserves last year fell to the lowest level since 2017 before stabilizing in recent months to reach $35 billion in September — still down by more than a fifth since their 2020 high.IMF Sees Higher Odds for Soft Landing Amid Uneven Global GrowthKeeping the pound stable has come at a cost, however, draining the economy of foreign exchange through a drawdown of commercial banks’ net foreign assets, which shrank in August by over 5% to $13.1 billion, according to calculations by Cairo-based HC Research.Still, Georgieva said an IMF review under the country’s $3 billion rescue program is making progress.Story continues“In the last couple of days there have been some constructive engagements,” the IMF head said ahead of a speech she made in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. “There will be more systematic work of our team with Egypt. So stay tuned. Let’s see what would come out in the next weeks.”Egypt’s long-term foreign debt rating was downgraded late Thursday by Moody’s to Caa1 from B3, seven levels into junk. The ratings agency cited the government’s “worsening debt affordability trend and the persistence of foreign currency shortages in the face of increasing external debt service payments over the next two years.”The situation in Tunisia, another troubled economy in North Africa, is less dire but still needs urgent action to complete arrangements over a $1.9 billion rescue package from the lender, Georgieva said.A debt restructuring is not required as “they are not yet hanging at the cliff,” she said. Nevertheless “the sooner the country takes some measures to strengthen their fiscal position, to strengthen their overall economic performance the better.”Egypt and Tunisia have some of the highest bond yields in the world, underscoring how wary investors are of owning their debt. Egypt’s dollar notes have an average yield of 18.5%, according to Bloomberg indexes, while a Tunisian bond maturing in 2025 trades above 40%.Further south on the continent both Zambia and Ghana, two nations that have defaulted on their debt, are in line for further support, Georgieva said.A memorandum of understanding with Zambia’s bilateral creditors has been agreed in principle and will be signed after a few details have been ironed out, she said.What Instead?Ghana, which won $3 billion in support from the IMF, is undergoing a first review of that program and that review will be completed in November, according to Georgieva.“Ghana is doing actually quite well. You have seen that their position has improved over the last month, the economy is in a much better place. I would very much hope that we can have the disbursement,” she said referring to a $600 million tranche of IMF money that’s due to be disbursed in November.“That is part of the confidence building that we are projecting,” she said.In broader comments, Georgieva said resolving the unsustainable debt crises of many nations is the “top priority” and defended the G20 Common Framework for debt treatment, which has been criticized for the slow pace its takes applicants to win relief.As more applicants come forward the process is getting quicker: Chad took 11 months between an initial staff level agreement to financial assurances, Zambia nine months, Sri Lanka six months and Ghana five months, she said.“I hear lots of people saying, oh this doesn’t work.” she said. “My question to them is, ok, you forget about it. What do you have instead?”Georgieva Says IMF to Boost Climate Funding, Weighs Nature SwapsIn a further recognition of the difficulty many of the world’s poorest nations are having repaying debt, Georgieva said she backs the idea of debt payment suspensions when countries are hit by climate disasters.“I’m very much in favor of including clauses in debt, be it bonds or loans, that put debt service suspension in place. So if a natural disaster happens, the country is not forced to choose between saving lives and paying creditors,” she said. “We all need to think about how we go about debt service in a world of more frequent and devastating climate disasters.”--With assistance from Mirette Magdy, Moses Mozart Dzawu, Matthew Hill and Zijia Song.(Updates with Moody’s rating downgrade in ninth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekAftermath of an Assassination: Inside the India-Canada CrisisAmerica’s Factory Boom Brings Billion-Dollar Projects to Tiny TownsAmerica’s High EV Costs Are Driving Buyers to HybridsEuropean Real Estate Faces New Pressure as Property Funds WobbleCan AI Beat the Market?

It is worth considering Marathon Oil (MRO), which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry.When looking at the last two reports, this energy company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 14.59%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the last reported quarter, Marathon Oil came out with earnings of $0.48 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.43 per share, representing a surprise of 11.63%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.57 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.67 per share, delivering a surprise of 17.54%.Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Marathon Oil lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Marathon Oil has an Earnings ESP of +8.38% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on November 1, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

55,e58bb2ee-d534-3203-b52e-d033b1ee65b5,MSI,2023-10-06,Is AT&T (T) Exploring DirecTV Stake Options for Core Focus?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/t-t-exploring-directv-stake-125900231.html,1696510740,STORY,"['T', 'ANET', 'MSI']","[According to a Bloomberg report, AT&amp;T Inc. T is reportedly considering all the viable options for its 70% ownership stake in DirecTV as it nears the expiry of its holding period in America’s third-largest pay-TV provider. Although both AT&amp;T and DirecTV have refused to comment on the industry grapevines, undisclosed sources privy to the discussion have revealed that the talks are in a nascent stage at the moment.AT&amp;T acquired DirecTV in 2015 for a total consideration of $67.1 billion (including assumed debt) to extend its footprint beyond the realms of the wireless business into the pay television industry. However, the business did not live up to expectations and began to lose subscribers with the emergence of online streaming services.AT&amp;T lost about 3 million video customers in 2020 and recorded $15.5 billion in impairment charges on its pay television business. Consequently, it divested a minority stake in DirecTV satellite and streaming service along with its U-verse TV operations in 2021 to private equity firm TPG. AT&amp;T received about $7.6 billion from the asset sale and retained a 70% ownership stake in DirecTV, with an option to sell the same after Jul 31, 2024. The agreement with TPG also included a clause that enabled AT&amp;T to hold sale discussions before the end of that commitment period.Accordingly, the company is exploring various options as its dwindling customer base has cut into the cash distribution it receives from DirecTV, with payments falling sharply to $1.9 billion in the first half of 2023 from $2.7 billion a year ago. In addition to continuing its existing business as before, the other options before AT&amp;T are a dividend recapitalization, the addition of a new investor, or exit from the venture as early as August 2024 through an outright sale.  The separation of the media assets is likely to offer AT&amp;T an opportunity to better align its communications business with a focused total return capital allocation strategy. The company is uniquely positioned to benefit from the upcoming 5G boom. As the first carrier in the industry, AT&amp;T has presented its 5G policy framework that stands on three vital pillars — fixed wireless, edge computing and 5G. It is focusing on a fiber densification strategy, which is anticipated to enhance broadband connectivity for consumers and enterprises, alongside 5G deployments boosting the end-user experience.With a customer-centric business model, AT&amp;T is likely to benefit from the increased deployment of mid-band spectrum and greater fiber densification. AT&amp;T expects to deploy mid-band spectrum to 200 million users by 2023 end and reach more than 30 million customer and business locations with fiber by the end of 2025. The extensive fiber footprint is likely to minimize its maintenance and repair costs while generating higher ARPU.The stock has lost 4.4% in the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 8.3%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAT&amp;T currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The selective preliminary metrics offer clarity regarding its business operations as it aims to navigate through a challenging macroeconomic environment.Management expects third-quarter GAAP revenues of $40-$45 million compared with the earlier estimation of $62-$70 million. The lower revenue projection is primarily due to delays in government defense orders owing to a deadlock in the U.S. federal budget. This adversely impacted the Point-to-Point business. Additionally, soft revenues from the Point-to-Multi-Point business, lower enterprise orders and adverse EMEA market conditions are likely to result in lower-than-expected revenues.Cambium currently expects net income to be below the lower end of the earlier guidance both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. The company had earlier expected non-GAAP earnings in the range of $3.7-$6.9 million or 13-25 cents per share. Cambium expects a cash balance in the vicinity of $27 million, with $45 million available in the revolving credit line. The company expects channel inventories to decline significantly with higher sales through distributors.Despite short-term market aberrations, Cambium is well-positioned to benefit from proprietary software and product ramp-up, likely facilitating it to deliver a compelling combination of price, performance and spectrum efficiency. One of the major advantages of the company is its fixed wireless broadband networking infrastructure solutions, which are distinguished by embedded intelligence and scalability.Continued investments in wireless fabric and embedded software capabilities with expanded channel partner relationships are the cornerstones of Cambium's long-term growth across a diverse set of markets. The company intends to augment its geographical footprint by collaborating with major network operators, thereby driving its product adoption across various end markets. Amid the rapid 5G shift, accretive investments in high-speed wireless networks are likely to position its portfolio to secure lucrative opportunities in the long run.Over the past few years, it has benefited from investments related to gigabit wireless solutions such as 60 GHz millimeter wave products and Wi-Fi 6. The first phase of the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund is expected to boost the deployment of broadband service among underserved communities and help bridge the digital gap over the next 10 years.Some of its competitive strengths are advanced RF signal algorithms that boost network performance with evolving technologies like noise filtering and frequency reuse and efficient wireless fabric that enables operators to strengthen their networks with incremental fixed wireless access points. Its cloud-based network management software acts as a major tailwind that simplifies the overall deployment process through hassle-free configuration and monitoring.Shares of the company have lost 56.4% in the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 8.3%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCambium presently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Key PicksArista Networks, Inc.

According to Ofcom, the U.K.'s communications regulator, both companies held a combined 70 to 80% share of the region's public cloud infrastructure services market in 2022.Yahoo Finance Anchors Akiko Fujita and Rachelle Akuffo break down the investigation details and discuss some of the broader concerns around the tech companies.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]- Well, Amazon and Microsoft are in the hot seat after UK regulators launched an investigation into the tech giant's cloud services. The investigation comes after a study from Ofcom brought to life concerns about the ability for customers to use multiple suppliers. And we should mention for those who aren't familiar, Ofcom is UK's communication regulator.This should not come as a surprise necessarily because Ofcom has been looking into the dominance that Amazon and Microsoft have had on cloud services for a year now. And this push for an investigation is the result of that investigation that preceded it. Now, this number, I think, Rachelle, is worth pointing out and points to why there are concerns. When you look at Amazon Web Services, Microsoft's Azure combined, they have 70% to 80% of the market.And the concern is that they lock customers in and make it more difficult to customers to get out of that particular ecosystem, so something that they are under investigation for in the UK. There's another investigation in Japan. There's an investigation in the Netherlands, France. Not necessarily limited to the UK, but it points to where the regulation spotlight is being shined on right now.RACHELLE AKUFFO: It's true. And obviously, because they make up the biggest share here, they got most of the spotlight. But this does speak to broader concerns that they have in the UK about the dominance of some of these companies. And as you mentioned here, it's about being able to switch-- being difficult for customers to switch, being difficult for them to be able to use multiple suppliers, and also talking about some of the software licensing practices of these cloud providers. So even though Amazon and Microsoft in the crosshairs here, certainly not the only ones the UK regulators are focusing on here, Akiko.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, Google just close behind or actually I should say they're not that close behind. They are third in terms of market share, but just 5% to 10%. So that shows you the dominance from Amazon and Microsoft as well. We always look to the UK as well as the EU as a potential template, a sign of things to come in the US because they have tended to really lead on regulation, especially around tech. But certainly, a story to follow here because no question regulators here in the US are also watching this space and investigating it closely.]"

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Michael Burry Stocks Other Hedge Funds Like Most.A market crash before yearend is the latest prediction by famed investor Michael Burry. The legendary investor who accurately predicted the 2007 financial crisis is sounding the alarm bells that the US stock market will crash and has started using 90% of his portfolio to bet on the market downturn using options. Obviously we don't know the exercise price of these options, but it is very likely that these positions appreciated as the S&amp;P 500 declined in recent weeks.Burry has never shied away from controversy, having made bold bets and predictions in the past, some of which have turned out to be true. The Scion Asset Management founder made $100 million for himself and $725 million for his investors when he shorts the housing market ahead of the market crash in 2007.With a net worth of about $1.2 billion, he makes a fortune by taking short positions in assets and counters he believes are overvalued amid deteriorating fundamentals and macroeconomics. The value investor and stark proponent of fundamental analysis are best known for his research acumen, which allowed him to make bold bets in the past. Likewise, his moves in the market are followed by amateur and professional investors.Regulatory filings indicate the investor has taken a $1.6 billion short position that will accrue profits in case of a market downturn. Fillings indicate that he has taken negative options on the S&amp;P 500 and The NASDAQ 100, representing the US economy. The fillings through his asset management firm Scion Asset Management show large stakes against the two stock indexes that give him the right to sell the asset at the particular price.The short bets come as the S&amp;P 500 has risen by about 16% year to date, and the Nasdaq 100 is also up by about 28%. Nevertheless, the two indexes came under pressure at the end of the third quarter. The NASDAQ posted its biggest monthly loss for the year in September, signaling waning upward momentum.Story continuesThe NASDAQ dropping 5.8% in September is already sounding warning bells of a potential market reversal. The pullback comes as Burry continues questioning the slowing of the US economy amid the high-interest rate environment. While most economics predict a soft landing, Burry remains skeptical; thus, the short bet on the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P 100 represents the US economy.Even though Burry is pessimistic about the overall stock market outlook, he does not always get it right. In January he tweeted “Sell” to his 1.4 million followers. Barely a month later had, he admitted he was wrong as he wrote: “I was wrong to say sell.”What followed was the market rally, with the S&amp;P 500 recouping all the losses accrued in 2022. The Nasdaq 100 also saw its year gains surge to over 40% affirming the bull trend. Likewise, when inflation was at its peak last year, Burry predicted a stock market crash, suggesting that the S&amp;P 500 would bottom below 1900 based on how it has fared during past crashes. However, that is yet to come true a year after as inflation has declined significantly.15 Michael Burry Stocks Other Hedge Funds Like Too.Michael Burry of Scion Asset ManagementBurry was also burned when he opened a short position on Tesla, reiterating that the electric vehicle giant was overvalued. While taking the short position in 2020, he advised the company’s CEO, Elon Musk, to use the opportunity to raise capital by issuing more shares. While the stock was trading for $250 at the time, it ended up doubling in value, putting Burry in a big loss in his short position.Burry also predicted in the summer of last year that American households faced the risk of exhausting their savings by year-end owing to rising prices and soaring borrowing costs. He warned of a risk of a decline in consumer spending that would erode corporate profits. For now, consumer spending has proved to be resilient, with the economy holding steady, supported by a solid labor market.While the famed investor remains bearish heading into year end, he remains bullish on some stocks that other hedge funds are closely following.

67,49fa566e-3fb6-3978-80a7-30d59587e63e,WBA,2023-10-06,Earnings Preview: Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) Q4 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-walgreens-boots-alliance-140007025.html,1696514407.0,STORY,['WBA'],"[The market expects Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended August 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 12. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis largest U.S. drugstore chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.69 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -13.8%.Revenues are expected to be $34.55 billion, up 6.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.02% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Walgreens?For Walgreens, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.60%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Walgreens will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Walgreens would post earnings of $1.06 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1, delivering a surprise of -5.66%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Walgreens doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Laxman Narasimhan, CEO of Starbucks since last October, took an unusual crash course. Working with his predecessor Howard Schultz and board chair Mellody Hobson, he designed a six-month “immersion” to learn life as a barista.“The idea was to really immerse myself in the business, understand the culture, understand it from a partner's lens, and also get really good at coffee, which I love drinking…I became a certified barista, working in stores across the U.S., working in stores in Europe, in Mexico, as well as in China and Japan. And it gave me a real lens into what it meant to be a partner at the company.""“Somebody asked me this question, ‘Why was your training six months long?’ And I said: ‘That's a very Western way of phrasing the question, right? Because if you were Eastern, you would ask the question: why was it only six months?’ I learned a lot. I think it was a really good push from both Howard and Mellody that I would do that.” Narasimhan told Michal Lev-Ram and me on this week’s Leadership Next podcast that what he learned from his immersion that Starbucks’ purpose, ultimately, is to provide human connection. I pushed Narasimhan on the connection point, having became a Starbucks regular during the pandemic because of convenience. I can order my drink in advance and have it waiting for me when I arrive. But that convenience has also given the stores more of the feel of a factory, and less of a place for human connection.“The pandemic did, in fact, have quite an impact on consumers, and an impact on Starbucks. We’re still working our way through it…We need to do better. Having said that, that moment of interaction, even in a drive-thru, where you are speaking with a barista, is a moment of connection.” We asked Narasimhan how he felt about his business in China, at a time of tension between China and the West. His response:“China is ten percent of our business and growing. We are opening a store there every nine hours…We have a real belief in the long-term potential of our business in China. We believe we are building bridges, over coffee.”Story continuesIf you are wondering, Narasimhan’s coffee drink of choice is a Doppio Espresso Macchiato. And he doesn’t drink after 2:00 p.m. You can listen to the full podcast on Apple or Spotify.

Starting with the price-to-earnings valuation of both stocks is a great way to see if it's a good time to buy after the recent selloff.Starbucks' stock certainly looks more intriguing trading at a 26.3X forward earnings multiple. This is near the Zacks Retail-Restaurants Industry average of 22.5X and not an overly stretched premium to the S&amp;P 500’s 19.7X.Furthermore, SBUX shares trade well below their five-year high of 97.6X forward earnings and at a slight discount to the median of 29.9X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs for Chipotle, its stock has been able to command a high premium over the years due to its expansive bottom line growth but CMG shares are trading attractively relative to its past as well.At 43X forward earnings, Chipotle’s stock trades 69% below its own five-year high of 141.5X and at a 21% discount to the median of 54.6X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGrowth &amp; OutlookWith Starbucks having a large presence in China there has been much optimism about the company’s continued growth after the reopening of the Chinese economy earlier in the year.To that point, Starbucks reported record revenue of $9.16 billion for its most recent fiscal third quarter after Q3 sales in China jumped 46% year over year. Total sales are now projected to be up 11% in fiscal 2023 and jump another 11% in FY24 to $39.67 billion.On the bottom line, Starbucks' annual earnings are forecasted to jump 17% this year and climb another 17% in FY24 at $4.06 per share.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchChipotle has largely conquered its operating expenses making it one of the most profitable restaurant chains in the United States in terms of gross margins.Illustrative of such, sales are expected to rise a very respectable 13% in FY23 to $9.81 billion but Chipotle's earnings growth is astonishing, with EPS forecasted to soar 31% to $43.16 a share. Fiscal 2024 sales are expected to jump another 12% with earnings anticipated to climb another 21% to $52.10 per share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeawayConsidering Chipotle’s extremely lucrative earnings potential and more reasonable valuation after the recent dip in its stock, CMG shares land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Robust original equipment manufacturer and Maintenance, Repair and Operations commercial activity is driving the Aerospace Systems segment. Strong aftermarket mixes also aided the segment.Benefits from Win Strategy: The company’s unique Win Strategy, which focuses on innovation, strategic positioning, distribution growth and incentive plan to drive organic growth, is supporting PH’s margin performance. In fiscal 2023 (ended Jun 30, 2023), the company’s adjusted EBITDA margin increased 100 basis points year over year, driven by the benefits from the Win strategy.Expansion Efforts: Parker-Hannifin’s expansion initiatives are expected to drive its growth. In September 2022, the company completed the acquisition of Meggitt plc, a global leader in motion and control technologies. The acquisition expanded PH’s presence in the UK, positioning it well to provide a broader suite of solutions for aircraft, and aeroengine components and systems. Thanks to the Meggitt acquisition, the Aerospace Systems segment sales increased approximately 90% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter.Rewards to Shareholders: The company continues to increase shareholders’ value through dividend payments and share buybacks. In April 2023, PH hiked its dividend by 11% to $1.48 per share (annually: $5.92). In fiscal 2023, Parker-Hannifin rewarded its shareholders with dividends of $704.1 million, up 23.6% year over year.In light of the above-mentioned positives, we believe, investors should retain the PH stock for now, as suggested by its current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly. Top 5 Upgrades: Citi upgraded O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $1,040, up from $983. The firm thinks the recent pullback in the shares presents an attractive buying opportunity ""for the stable, defensive retail stock.""Needham upgraded Ceridian (CDAY) to Buy from Hold with an $82 price target. A positive customer conference confirmed the firm's recent HCM channel conversations on stabilizing sales churn and improved win rates in the enterprise customer segment, the firm tells investors in a research note.BofA upgraded Trane Technologies (TT) to Neutral from Underperform with a price target of $210, up from $187. The company continues to outperform peers on revenue, adjusted earnings and free cash flow conversion, the firm tells investors in a research note.BofA upgraded Parker-Hannifin (PH) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $475, up from $435. The firm calls Parker-Hannifin a ""good company for uncertain times"" and sees it having ""long runway"" for a re-rating of the shares.RBC Capital upgraded Beacon (BECN) to Outperform from Sector Perform with a price target of $94, up from $91. The firm's roofing industry checks point to upside to guidance driven by residential roofing.Top 5 Downgrades:Citi downgraded Tractor Supply (TSCO) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $207, down from $250. The operating environment is getting tougher for Tractor Supply as big-ticket weakness continues, disinflation weighs on same-store-sales, and home-related spending slows, the firm argues.Exane BNP Paribas downgraded Yeti (YETI) to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $42, down from $54. While the recall of soft coolers makes it hard to assess Yeti's underlying demand, the firm's work suggests the company's trends are slowing.Raymond James downgraded Clorox (CLX) to Market Perform from Outperform without a price target after the company provided an update on fiscal Q1 that was significantly worse than expected due to the recent cybersecurity attack.Citi downgraded Floor &amp; Decor (FND) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $90, down from $122. The firm believes it is prudent to shift to a Neutral rating given the threat of higher rates for longer to existing home sales and home improvement spending. Jefferies downgraded Marriott Vacations (VAC) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $112, down from $150. The concerns over the macroeconomic outlook, notably consumer credit and interest rates, ""are driving a separation of timeshare business merits from valuations,"" the firm says.Top 5 Initiations: BofA initiated coverage of Wingstop (WING) with a Buy rating and $218 price target. The firm set its price target based on steady state earnings power at 7,000 U.S. stores and thinks that with only 6% share that Wingstop should continue to outpace the LSR chicken segment.Rosenblatt initiated coverage of Fabrinet (FN) with a Buy rating and $230 price target. Fabrinet, which makes very-short reach active optical cables, or AOCs, with 800G transceivers for Nvidia (NVDA) is ""one of the earliest and most direct beneficiaries of the strong ramp"" of the AI 800G Optical supply chain, the firm tells investors.BofA reinstated coverage of Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) with a Neutral rating and $33 price target. The firm notes margins are being pressured near-term by the longer maturity curve and in addition to margin headwinds, and sees risk to topline growth from slower consumer spending and ""still somewhat untested brand portability."" BofA reinstated coverage of Jack in the Box (JACK) with a Buy rating and $85 price target. The company's data driven approach has translated into higher restaurant volumes and structurally higher franchisee returns, ""the linchpin of unit growth,"" the firm says.BofA initiated coverage of Shake Shack (SHAK) with a Neutral rating and $66 price target. Shake Shack's average unit volumes are stabilizing and pricing will likely moderate, the firm tells investors. ]"

But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Archer-Daniels-Midland's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Archer-Daniels-Midland is:16% = US$4.2b ÷ US$25b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.16.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Archer-Daniels-Midland's Earnings Growth And 16% ROEAt first glance, Archer-Daniels-Midland seems to have a decent ROE. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 12% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. This probably laid the ground for Archer-Daniels-Midland's significant 24% net income growth seen over the past five years. However, there could also be other causes behind this growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Archer-Daniels-Midland's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 11% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is ADM worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether ADM is currently mispriced by the market.Is Archer-Daniels-Midland Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Archer-Daniels-Midland's three-year median payout ratio is a pretty moderate 31%, meaning the company retains 69% of its income. So it seems that Archer-Daniels-Midland is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees impressive growth in its earnings (discussed above) and pays a dividend that's well covered.Besides, Archer-Daniels-Midland has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 34% of its profits over the next three years. Still, forecasts suggest that Archer-Daniels-Midland's future ROE will drop to 11% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Archer-Daniels-Midland's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and the dividend capture strategy, and go directly to read 5 Best October Dividend Stocks To Buy. Dividend payments around the world have been growing significantly because investors are increasingly interested in income-generating assets. This strong reputation of dividend stocks didn't happen overnight; it's based on historical data that demonstrates how these stocks have consistently performed better than other types of investments over the years. Companies that regularly increase their dividends are particularly attractive in this scenario. They are considered real winners because they not only garner appreciation from investors but also thrive in changing market conditions. According to a report by Morgan Stanley, dividends are a crucial investment for long-term investors. Stocks with high dividends typically do well when inflation is higher than usual but on a downward trend. These stocks are also considered safe and become even more appealing during uncertain economic times because they provide stability and reliable income.As mentioned above, global dividends have experienced significant growth this year. China's largest companies have paid out 1.5 trillion yuan ($206 billion) in dividends this year, which has already exceeded the 1.27 trillion yuan paid out in 2022, according to a report by Bloomberg. The major contributors to this increase are the largest state-owned banks, with PetroChina and Kweichow Moutai following closely behind. Similarly, Janus Henderson reported that 98% of US companies either increased their dividends or maintained them at the same level in the second quarter of 2023. This percentage is significantly higher than the global average.Dividend investing can be a sound strategy for long-term investors. Holding onto stocks with consistently increasing dividends can lead to higher yields on original investment over time. Regular dividend hikes often contribute to an increase in the stock's share price. According to a recent report by T. Rowe Price, between the end of 1985 to the close of 2022, dividend growers in the Russell 1000 Index performed better than the broader benchmark index. Furthermore, these dividend-growing stocks showed lower levels of price fluctuations or volatility. Some of the best dividend stocks in this regard are The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) as these firms have consistently increased their dividend payments for many years.Story continuesIn addition to long-term investors, dividend investing can be appealing to some short-term investors through a dividend capture strategy. It involves purchasing a stock just before it goes ex-dividend and then selling it shortly thereafter, typically after the dividend is received. This strategy aims to capture the dividend income while minimizing exposure to the stock's price fluctuations. To learn more about this investment approach, have a look at our article Dividend Capture Strategy Stocks To Buy.10 Best October Dividend Stocks To Buy Our Methodology:This list outlines the dividend capture strategy for selecting prominent dividend stocks that will trade ex-dividend in October 2023.

PPG recently introduced high-performance ultrafiltration (UF) membrane and filter components for industrial process water and wastewater applications. The UF membrane expands PPG's line of microfiltration (MF) membranes and filter elements, which are designed to remove oil and other contaminants so that process water and wastewater can be disposed of or reused safely and economically, contributing to addressing global water scarcity.PPG's UF membranes are superhydrophilic, or water-loving, and have a proprietary antifouling treatment technology, which prevents difficult-to-filter pollutants from fouling the membranes and filter elements. As a result, the service life of membranes can be extended, resulting in decreased maintenance and replacement expenses.High-performance MF and UF membranes from PPG separate oil, grease and emulsified pollutants from larger volumes of industrial process water. This can reduce the number of filters and manufacturing floor space required to recover and reuse water. PPG membranes, when combined with an antifouling treatment, can provide plant managers and maintenance engineers with a solution that allows their filtration systems to function better and last longer while also being easier to clean.The ability to clean and reuse industrial process water is advantageous in a variety of ways, not only for the enterprises that recapture this valuable resource but also for the environment by lowering demands and stress on freshwater supplies, PPG noted.Shares of PPG have gained 13.2% over the past year compared with a 13.2% rise of its industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company expects adjusted EPS for the third quarter to be in the range of $1.85-$1.95. For the full year, the company raised its adjusted EPS projection to the range of $7.28-$7.48. These projections consider various factors such as current global economic activity, soft global industrial production, continued economic uncertainty associated with geopolitical issues in Europe and higher interest rates in most developed countries.The company expects performance coatings demand in Europe to stabilize at lower levels than the pre-conflict period in Ukraine while raw material and transportation normalize closer to pre-pandemic levels.For Industrial coatings, PPG anticipates a low single-digit percentage decline in organic sales due to lower global industrial production, except for modest growth in China. Other industrial end-use markets are expected to be soft. However, selling price increases are expected to continue.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksPPG currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the basic materials space include Carpenter Technology Corporation CRS, The Andersons Inc.

And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, long term Packaging Corporation of America (NYSE:PKG) shareholders have enjoyed a 73% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 50% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 37% in the last year , including dividends .With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. See our latest analysis for Packaging Corporation of America While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Packaging Corporation of America managed to grow its earnings per share at 4.4% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 12% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Packaging Corporation of America's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Packaging Corporation of America, it has a TSR of 103% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Packaging Corporation of America shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 37% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 15% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Packaging Corporation of America , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

The stock fell short of the S&amp;P 500, which registered a loss of 0.13% for the day. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.03%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.12%.The the stock of oil refiner has fallen by 5.27% in the past month, lagging the Oils-Energy sector's loss of 5.06% and overreaching the S&amp;P 500's loss of 5.53%.The investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Phillips 66 in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is scheduled to release its earnings on October 27, 2023. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $5.14, indicating a 20.43% decline compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $34.18 billion, down 29.9% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $16.57 per share and revenue of $138.37 billion. These totals would mark changes of -11.81% and -21.25%, respectively, from last year.It's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Phillips 66. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.The Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 7.27% higher.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Phillips 66 (PSX) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $5.32 a share, just 22 days from its upcoming earnings release on October 27, 2023.Phillips 66's Earnings ESP sits at 3.47%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $5.32 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.14.PSX is one of just a large database of Oils-Energy stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Chevron (CVX).Chevron is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on October 27, 2023. CVX's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $3.55 a share 22 days from its next earnings release.For Chevron, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.35 is 5.85%.Story continuesPSX and CVX's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

We are not making this move to withdraw the drug from the market,"" said Harpreet Singh of the FDA oncology division.The FDA's expert advisers voted 10 to 2 that the main goal of the late-stage confirmatory study could not be relied upon to assess the benefits of the drug, although several panel members noted that the voting question was very narrowly framed.Much of the committee's discussion centered on concerns that trial investigators allowed too many patients to switch between the treatment and control arms of the study.Data from the confirmatory study showed that Lumakras reduced the risk of disease progression in patients with advanced lung cancer by 34% compared with chemotherapy.Lumakras showed no significant difference in overall survival - the gold standard for cancer drugs - but Amgen said the study was not designed to demonstrate a survival benefit.The panel's decision was in line with an assessment from FDA staff reviewers, who suggested earlier this week that the trial data may be biased and may not be sufficient to confirm the benefits of Lumakras.Story continuesThey flagged several issues with the trial, including the way the study was conducted and loss of follow-up data from patients who withdrew consent.Lumakras is approved to treat advanced lung cancer in patients with mutations of the KRAS gene whose disease has worsened after chemotherapy or other treatments.The FDA grants accelerated approval where there is an unmet need and data demonstrating a drug is likely to work. It requires confirmatory trials be conducted to prove safety and efficacy in order to receive traditional approval.Lumakras is an oral drug designed to target a mutated form of a gene known as KRAS that occurs in about 13% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), the most common type of lung cancer, and less frequently in some other solid tumors.The FDA, which generally follows the advice of its expert panels but is not bound to do so, is expected to make a decision on the traditional approval for Amgen's drug by Dec. 24.(Reporting by Pratik Jain and Bhanvi Satija in Begaluru and Deena Beasley in Los Angeles; Editing by Bill Berkrot)]"

The company expects strong sales growth of products like Tezspire, Evenity, Repatha, Prolia and Tavneos to be offset by lower revenues from oncology biosimilars and legacy established products such as Enbrel in the future quarters.The addition of Horizon Therapeutics, if successfully closed, will enhance Amgen’s growth prospects. Amgen also has some key pipeline assets in obesity and inflammation, which are indications that can have a large market opportunity. Several data readouts are expected in the next 12 months.However, increased pricing headwinds and competitive pressure are hurting sales of many products, including some biosimilars. Weakness in some key brands like Otezla and Lumakras create potential revenue headwinds.(You can read the full research report on Amgen here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of ServiceNow have outperformed the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry over the year-to-date period (+39.4% vs. +15.4%).

It may also be affected if China enforces its announced sanctions against RTX’s missile and defense unit.However, thanks to its wide range of combat-proven defense products, RTX Corporation continues to receive ample orders from the Pentagon and its foreign allies. A steady recovery in commercial air traffic is boosting commercial OEM as well as commercial aftermarket sales for RTX.Looking ahead, the company expects global air traffic to fully recover to 2019 levels post 2023 and its commercial aircraft volume growth to be up around 20% in 2023.

The decision comes after unions criticized the company’s efforts to finalize an agreement on pay and conditions.Chevron reiterated that it is “meaningfully engaged” as it continues to work with all parties to finalize the drafting process based on recommendations from the country’s labor regulator. The Gorgon and Wheatstone facilities accounted for about 7% of global LNG supply last year.Renewed strikes revive the risk of interruptions to shipments from Australia — one of the world’s biggest exporters of the fuel — at a crucial time of year. Europe in particular is still finding its footing after last year’s energy crisis. Gas prices spiked in recent months on concerns about interruptions to Australia’s supply.Although Europe receives almost no gas from Australia directly, its market has been sensitive to possible supply shocks. The region depends on LNG to replace Russian pipeline gas, and it would have to compete with Asian buyers for global tanker-borne fuel.While renewed walkouts could add to uncertainty on supply, no LNG cargoes were missed during previous strikes, said SEFE Energy Ltd., a UK energy supplier, in a note.Story continuesFor now, mild weather has helped to mute European demand that is already eroded by weak industrial consumption.

The year-on-year oil price is now falling again and tracking losses of 5%.That's a significant relief for the inflation part of the bond blowup and will help keep a lid on U.S. pump prices.But to the extent the oil price is flagging renewed concerns about global growth - in part due to the relentless rise in borrowing rates - can be seen in a retreat in commodity prices in general. Copper prices fell to their lowest of the year on Thursday and core commodity indexes are back at August levels.Two-year U.S. inflation expectations in the bond market have plunged about 30 basis points to just 2.13% over the past two weeks - as near as makes no difference to the Federal Reserve's target.Whether that darkening demand picture holds or not will again hinge on the critical U.S. employment report out later on Friday - where a marginal slowing of monthly payroll growth to 170,000 last month is expected, alongside a downtick in the jobless rate to 3.7%.This week's surprisingly soft private sector payrolls data from ADP was countered by other readings showing still modest weekly jobless claims, relatively contained layoffs in September and a rebound in job openings in August.All to play for then.And the latest Fed soundings indicate that the screaming rise in Treasury yields to new 16-year highs close to 5% - a jump of at least half a percentage point in 10-year rates - may have achieved the sort of additional credit tightening that obviates the need for another Fed policy rate hike.Story continuesSan Francisco Fed boss Mary Daly said that with monetary policy ""well into"" restrictive territory and Treasury yields so high, the central bank may not need to raise rates further.All of which sees U.S. bond yields retain an uneasy calm into the jobs numbers. Ten-year yields hovered about 4.75% on Friday - still off Tuesday's peak at 4.88%.Implied rates from Fed futures markets pulled back the chances of another hike in the cycle to less than 50%.Seeing some potential light at the end of the tunnel, Wall St stocks staged a late comeback close to opening levels on Thursday and stock futures were steady ahead of today's open.The dollar stayed on the backfoot for now too.The other side of the bond market angst - U.S. fiscal policy stasis and the prospects of a government shutdown again next month - remained unresolved as Republicans moved to appoint a new House speaker after their unprecedented ouster of Kevin McCarthy from the post this week.Former President and leading candidate for next year's White House race Donald Trump said he's endorsing Congressman Jim Jordan for the post - an appointment that won't encourage any bets on congressional compromises to avert a shutdown.And that mixed picture of fiscal dysfunction and a potential economic hiatus from furloughing thousands of government workers is the backdrop to Treasury secretary Janet Yellen's trip to the annual International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings in Morocco next week.Elsewhere in the corporate world, shares of Tesla fell 1.47% to $256.22 premarket after the electric vehicle giant stepped up its aggressive discounting and cut prices of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in the U.S. by about 2.7% to 4.2%.In M&amp;A news, Exxon Mobil is in advanced talks to acquire Pioneer Natural Resources in a deal that could value the Permian shale basin producer at about $60 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Friday:* U.S. Sept employment report, Aug consumer credit; Canada Sept employment report* Federal Reserve Board Governor Christopher Waller(By Mike Dolan; Editing by Toby Chopra mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com.

The vote followed a similar move by colleagues at a meeting less than 24-hours earlier.Reuters reported on Thursday, the bulk of workers at the facilities had voted to strike.“It’s disappointing but hardly surprising Chevron have welched on the deal given the bad faith they have shown bargaining with their workforce over the last year or so,"" Offshore Alliance's Brad Gandy said in a statement.“The Offshore Alliance is a member-led union and at mass meetings held in the last 24 hours members have resolved to recommence protected industrial action.""Chevron must be given seven business days notice before strikes can begin and unions said they plan to file the notice on Monday.Chevron said on Friday it continued to work with all parties to finalise a deal based on recommendations made by Australia's industrial arbitrator, the Fair Work Commission (FWC), in September.A union representative who declined to be named said there are no talks currently scheduled with Chevron.A pay and conditions deal brokered by the FWC in September ended weeks of strikes at the two facilities responsible for around 7% of global LNG.However, the parties have been unable to agree on the wording of a final contract.If the two sides fail to reach a deal, the matter could go back to the commission, which had been due to begin hearings on whether to intervene and end strikes when the parties reached an 11th-hour agreement.Those hearings were adjourned for four weeks in late September to give time to draft an agreement. Chevron would need to give seven days' notice before resuming the matter. (Reporting by Nilutpal Timsina in Bengaluru and Lewis Jackson in Sydney Editing by Mark Potter and Sharon Singleton)]"

Saudi Arabia and Russia have curbed output by an additional 1.3. million barrels per day (bpd) in addition to agreed OPEC+ cuts.Russia, the world's top seaborne diesel exporter, imposed a ban on fuel exports in late September. However, on Friday, Moscow lifted the ban on pipeline diesel exports via ports, removing the bulk of restrictions, although curbs on gasoline exports remain.The recent ban has left diesel supplies short, encouraging refiners to make more. For that, they are seeking to buy the medium-sweet crude that yields more of the fuel group known as distillates when it is refined.Differentials for such Nigerian grades are at their highest levels since August 2022, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 sent crude prices soaring, according to LSEG data.Bonga, for instance, is being offered at dated Brent plus $9 a barrel, while Escravos and Forcados are in excess of dated Brent plus $8, said a trader of West African crude.Differentials for Angolan grades of crude, which are lighter than those from Nigeria, have also gone up, another trader of West African crude said.""Sellers are betting on a market deficit,"" a third trader of West African crude said.The upward pressure on medium sweet crude has also been seen elsewhere. In Brazil, differentials for medium-sweet crude grades have risen by at least $2 a barrel since the last cycle, a trader of Brazilian crude told Reuters.Demand from Europe and Asia is strong, the trader said.LIGHTER CRUDE WEAKERLighter crudes including from Nigeria which have a lower diesel yield have also rallied although not to the same extent, traders said.Story continues""Differentials are strong across the board, but the more diesel-rich crudes are doing better,"" another trader said.Across the Atlantic, differentials for light sweet U.S. crude grades, which have a lower diesel yield, have weakened.The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude discount to the international benchmark Brent narrowed last week to as little as $2.56 a barrel, the narrowest since May 2022. That discouraged exports of U.S. crude abroad, and weakened differentials for light sweet crudes, traders said.WTI Midland , a light sweet U.S. grade, weakened to an 80-cent premium to U.S. crude futures last week, the weakest since May. Light Louisiana Sweet weakened to a 93-cent premium to U.S. crude futures, the weakest since December 2022.But European refiners need to produce enough diesel to cover this winter, so they are willing to pay higher premiums for heavier crudes from West Africa and beyond.Still, even with a narrower spread, U.S. light sweet grades still have seen some demand from buyers in Asia, because of tighter global supply and limited choice, a U.S.-based trader said.

A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapDeep Dive into NRG Energy's Financial HealthHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with NRG Energy should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Piotroski F-score of 1, Altman Z-score of 1.03, and a Beneish M-Score of 59.36 that exceeds -1.78, the threshold for potential earnings manipulation. These indicators suggest that NRG Energy, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Story continuesDecoding Financial Indicators: Piotroski F-score, Altman Z-score, and Beneish M-scoreThe Piotroski F-score, created by accounting professor Joseph Piotroski, is a tool used to assess the strength of a company's financial health. The score is based on nine criteria that fall into three categories: profitability, leverage/liquidity/ source of funds, and operating efficiency. The overall score ranges from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating healthier financials. NRG Energy's current Piotroski F-Score, however, falls in the lower end of this spectrum, indicating potential red flags for investors.Before delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Developed by Professor Messod Beneish, the Beneish M-Score is based on eight financial variables that reflect different aspects of a company's financial performance and position. These are Days Sales Outstanding (DSO), Gross Margin (GM), Total Long-term Assets Less Property, Plant and Equipment over Total Assets (TATA), change in Revenue (?REV), change in Depreciation and Amortization (?DA), change in Selling, General and Admin expenses (?SGA), change in Debt-to-Asset Ratio (?LVG), and Net Income Less Non-Operating Income and Cash Flow from Operations over Total Assets (?NOATA).Company Snapshot: NRG Energy IncNRG Energy is one of the largest retail energy providers in the U.S., with 5.5 million customers. Its 2023 acquisition of Vivint Smart Home adds 1.9 million home services customers. NRG also is one of the largest U.S. independent power producers, with 13 gigawatts of coal, gas, and oil power generation capacity primarily in Texas. NRG exited Chapter 11 bankruptcy as a stand-alone entity in December 2003.Is NRG Energy (NRG) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapAnalysis of NRG Energy's ProfitabilityFirstly, let's address profitability. One significant component of the F-Score is a positive return on assets (ROA). A closer look at NRG Energy's ROA reveals a worrying trend of negative returns. This indicates the company's inability to generate profit from its assets - a fundamental concern for any investor.Let's delve deeper into NRG Energy's financial health by examining the decline in its return on assets (ROA) over the past three years. The data indicates 2021: 6.67; 2022: 12.59; 2023: -6.65, when expressed in percentages. Such a decrease is concerning, as the Piotroski F-Score penalizes companies with lower current ROA compared to the previous period. This ongoing decline highlights another potential risk associated with investing in NRG Energy.Observing the financials of NRG Energy, it's important to note that the cash flow from operations over the trailing twelve months (TTM) stands at $-3857 million, whereas the net income in the same period is significantly higher at $-2055 million. The Piotroski F-score considers this discrepancy as a potential red flag. The rationale behind this is that a company's operating cash flow is a more direct and less manipulated measure of its cash-generating ability than net income. Net income, while important, is susceptible to accounting treatments and non-cash items which can distort the true cash profitability of the company. If a company consistently shows lower cash flows from operations relative to its net income, it could indicate that the earnings quality is poor and the company might have difficulties sustaining its operations or financing its obligations, a fact which could negatively impact its financial stability and investor confidence.Leverage, Liquidity and Source of Funds: A Worrying TrendIs NRG Energy (NRG) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapExamining NRG Energy's financial stability, there's a notable decrease in its current ratio over the past three years, as shown by the data 2021: 1.24; 2022: 1.29; 2023: 1.02, which is expressed as percentages. The current ratio is a key indicator of a company's short-term financial health, as it gauges the ability to cover short-term liabilities with short-term assets. A declining current ratio suggests that NRG Energy's liquidity and capability to manage immediate financial obligations are deteriorating.Operating Efficiency: A Darker PictureLastly, concerning operating efficiency, the Piotroski F-score examines changes in gross margin and asset turnover. Regrettably, NRG Energy follows a discouraging trajectory with a decrease in gross margin percentage over the past three years, as demonstrated by the data provided: 2021: 25.95; 2022: 25.45; 2023: 0.22 (expressed in percentages). This contraction in gross margin suggests that NRG Energy is grappling with either an escalation in the cost of goods sold or dwindling prices - both of which are inauspicious indicators for profitability.While the Piotroski F-score is not the only lens through which to view a potential investment, it is a robust and comprehensive tool for evaluating a company's financial health. Unfortunately for NRG Energy, its current score suggests potential troubles. The company's low Piotroski F-score, combined with a high Beneish M-score and an Altman Z-score below the safety threshold, points to a potential value trap. Despite the attractive price, these indicators suggest that investing in NRG Energy could be risky.NRG Energy's Low Altman Z-Score: A Breakdown of Key DriversA dissection of NRG Energy's Altman Z-score reveals NRG Energy's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress:When it comes to operational efficiency, a vital indicator for NRG Energy is its asset turnover. The data: 2021: 1.13; 2022: 1.06; 2023: 0.99 from the past three years suggests a recent decline following an initial increase in this ratio. The asset turnover ratio reflects how effectively a company is using its assets to generate sales. Therefore, a drop in this ratio can signify reduced operational efficiency, potentially due to underutilization of assets or decreased market demand for the company's products or services. This shift in NRG Energy's asset turnover underlines the need for the company to reassess its operational strategies to optimize asset usage and boost sales.The days sales outstanding (DSO) is an important financial metric that denotes the average time a company takes to collect payment after a sale is completed. Looking at the historical data from the past three years (2021: 1.13; 2022: 1.06; 2023: 0.99), there appears to be a rising trend in NRG Energy's DSO.An uptick in DSO might indicate aggressive revenue recognition practices, and in some cases, potential earnings manipulation. To explain, when DSO increases, it means the company's receivables are growing. This could be a result of sales being recorded before customers have paid, which inflates the revenue figures. In extreme cases, a company may even recognize revenue from sales that may never be collected, an action that is considered earnings manipulation. A rising DSO figure warrants scrutiny as it can signal financial distress or questionable accounting practices within the company. Therefore, investors should closely monitor such trends for early detection of any potential financial risks.The Gross Margin index tracks the evolution of a company's gross profit asThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

(NYSE:TSN) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.48 per share on the 15th of December. This means the annual payment is 4.0% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for Tyson Foods Tyson Foods' Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. Prior to this announcement, Tyson Foods' dividend was only 48% of earnings, however it was paying out 697% of free cash flows. While the company may be more focused on returning cash to shareholders than growing the business at this time, we think that a cash payout ratio this high might expose the dividend to being cut if the business ran into some challenges.According to analysts, EPS should be several times higher next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 38%, so there isn't too much pressure on the dividend.historic-dividendTyson Foods Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $0.20, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $1.92. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 25% a year over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.Dividend Growth Potential Is ShakyInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. However, things aren't all that rosy. Tyson Foods' EPS has fallen by approximately 34% per year during the past five years. Such rapid declines definitely have the potential to constrain dividend payments if the trend continues into the future. However, the next year is actually looking up, with earnings set to rise. We would just wait until it becomes a pattern before getting too excited.Story continuesIn SummaryOverall, we don't think this company makes a great dividend stock, even though the dividend wasn't cut this year. While the low payout ratio is a redeeming feature, this is offset by the minimal cash to cover the payments. We don't think Tyson Foods is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach.

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Qualcomm (QCOM) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Qualcomm currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.72, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 23 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.72 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 23 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 15 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 65.2% and 4.4% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for QCOMBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for QCOMCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Qualcomm here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Qualcomm, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Should You Invest in QCOM?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Qualcomm, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 0.6% over the past month to $8.32.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Qualcomm. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for Qualcomm with a grain of salt.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this chipmaker have returned -4.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -5.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry, which Qualcomm falls in, has lost 6.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Qualcomm is expected to post earnings of $1.92 per share, indicating a change of -38.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $8.32 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -33.6%. This estimate has changed -0.6% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.09 indicates a change of +9.3% from what Qualcomm is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Qualcomm.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Qualcomm, the consensus sales estimate of $8.55 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -25%. The $35.71 billion and $36.93 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -19.2% and +3.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryQualcomm reported revenues of $8.45 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -22.7%. EPS of $1.87 for the same period compares with $2.96 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.51 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.72%. The EPS surprise was +3.31%.Over the last four quarters, Qualcomm surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Qualcomm is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Qualcomm. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $746.3 million, the contract is expected to be completed by December 2030.

Majority of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Fort Worth, TX.Importance of F-35 for LMTLockheed enjoys a dominant position in the global military aircraft space with its F-35 fleet. The stealth aircraft boasts features that make it an ideal choice for many nations. The company’s constant efforts to modernize and upgrade the aircraft using advanced technologies to meet current warfare needs boost demand significantly.The F-35 program remained the largest revenue generator for the Aeronautics business unit.

The jet deliveries for 2025 and beyond are still estimated to be 156. This should bolster the company’s revenues from the military aircraft field.Growth ProspectsAmid the widespread geopolitical tensions prevalent across the globe, nations are rapidly augmenting their defense purchase to strengthen their warfare capabilities. This has led to the increased demand for fighter jets, which form an integral part of a country’s defense products.Looking ahead, per Mordor Intelligence projections, the global military aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 7.37% during the 2023-2028 period.

They are offering the option to PIK a portion of the interest expense, meaning it would be paid with more debt, said the people, who aren’t authorized to speak publicly.Pricing is currently being discussed at 550 basis points over the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, SOFR, according to the people. Half of that spread would be eligible for PIK treatment, the people added.Representatives for Carlyle and Medtronic declined to comment. The financing details are still being negotiated, as is the acquisition. Both could change or not happen at all.The ability to offer PIK debt is an advantage for private credit funds as they compete with Wall Street banks to finance deals. It’s currently difficult for banks to raise such debt in the high-yield bond or leveraged loan markets, and private equity firms have increasingly tapped private lenders for PIK debt to soften their companies’ interest burden. With three-month SOFR at 5.4%, Medtronic is looking at paying nearly 11% in annual interest costs.Read more: Carlyle Seeks Roughly $2.5 Billion Debt for Medtronic Units BidBlackstone recently included a PIK component in the financing for the $3 billion merger of HealthComp Holding Company LLC and Virgin Pulse.

First, REITs provide exposure to the real estate market without the need to purchase a home and otherwise get into buying some type of property, which typically comes with a considerable upfront cost.REITs also have another advantage, which is the sector as a whole offers great dividends for investors due to the fact that to be registered as a REIT, the company must give 90% of their taxable income in the form of dividends to be paid out to investors.Real estate, just like any other sector, is subject to downturns, with increased interest rates making home buying seem more and more out of reach for some individuals and higher rent prices, especially in growing cities, among other issues.

(NYSE:MRK) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Merck The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At MerckThe Executive VP &amp; General Counsel, Jennifer Zachary, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$2.3m worth of shares at a price of US$118 each. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$102. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.All up, insiders sold more shares in Merck than they bought, over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At Merck Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Merck. In total, insiders dumped US$948k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesDoes Merck Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Merck insiders own 0.07% of the company, currently worth about US$173m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Merck Insiders?Insiders sold Merck shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Merck. For example - Merck has 4 warning signs we think you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

But rising levels of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) can make current antibiotics less effective. There's no simple solution to the complex problem of AMR, but we're committed to investing our expertise and resources alongside our partners to get antibiotics to those who need them most. Lives are at risk, and the time to act is now.Through this groundbreaking partnership of over 20 leading pharmaceutical companies, philanthropies and organizations, we aim to bridge the gap between the innovative early antibiotic pipeline and patients. True to our legacy of preventing and treating infectious diseases, we're proud of our commitment to invest $100 million over 10 years in the AMR Action Fund. The fund's collective goal is to bring two to four novel antibiotics to patients and physicians by 2030.As of early 2023, the AMR Action Fund has invested in five small biotech companies advancing research for new medicines to fight some of the most dangerous bacteria as determined by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization.Here are five reasons collaborative efforts are key to addressing AMR:01. New antibiotics are urgently needed; however, there are relatively few in development.The future of antibiotic innovation is at serious risk. Major scientific, regulatory and economic challenges discourage innovation in antibiotics, resulting in a decline in the number of companies conducting antimicrobial R&amp;D. Recognizing there's no one-size-fits-all solution to the problem, our company and others have suggested a series of policy reforms across several regions of the world. However, time is running out. We need collaboration from policymakers to help antibiotic innovation flourish for decades to come.Story continues02. Once new antibiotics are approved, they need to be used responsibly.At Merck, we're making significant investments to support antimicrobial stewardship (AMS), a broad term for the implementation of evidence-based policies to slow resistance to current antimicrobials. Our investments and partnerships help hospitals around the world develop and implement patient-centered AMS programs that are customized locally based on factors like epidemiology, clinical setting and resource availability to support the responsible prescribing and use of antimicrobials. We also provide significant grant funding to support a wide range of AMS initiatives and collaborations.Some of our global contributions to AMS include:Supporting the development of several AMS Centers of Excellence throughout the world.Helping public health leaders effectively monitor and address emerging AMR infections, promote AMS and customize accepted AMS strategies to meet local needs.Providing significant grant-funding for numerous investigator-initiated AMS research projects.03. Tracking resistance trends and using data to help doctors prescribe the right medicines remains critical.Our company has been tracking global resistance trends for over 20 years. This data helps doctors prescribe the right medicines. One of the largest and longest-running AMR surveillance programs, our Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART) program has collected nearly 500,000 Gram-Negative bacterial isolates from around 220 sites in more than 60 countries since 2002.We're also a partner of the AMR Register, a first-ever online platform that allows pharmaceutical companies to securely share data on infection-causing pathogens with researchers, national governments and multilateral organizations working to fight AMR.04. AMR extends beyond human health.The challenge of AMR is multifaceted, and a One Health approach to creating policies is critical to attain optimal health for people, animals and the environment.When it comes to animal health, vaccines can help minimize the need for antibiotics. Merck Animal Health is one of the largest manufacturers of animal health vaccines, supplying over 102 billion doses each year.Protecting the environment through responsible manufacturing is another key component of the One Health approach. We work with our partners in the AMR Industry Alliance to inform science-based manufacturing standards to help ensure scrutiny of industry manufacturing supply chains.05. The time to act against AMR is now.With collaboration across the scientific community and policymakers, AMR is preventable.We all have a role to play as we prepare for the next health crisis. We must act now to put measures in place to ensure we have the antibiotics we need.""AMR is not a future problem - it's here now, threatening human, animal and environmental health as we know it. We must take swift, collaborative action to help reduce the risk of AMR before it's too late,"" said Jennifer Zachary, executive vice president and general counsel at Merck and member of the Global Leaders Group on AMR.To learn more about the investments that the AMR Action Fund is making to help ensure patients and physicians have access to effective antimicrobials -- now and in the future -- please visit their website.View original content here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Merck &amp; Co., Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Merck &amp; Co., Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/merck-co-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Merck &amp; Co., Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/790306/merck-is-collaborating-to-address-antimicrobial-resistance]"

He said Whitaker ""has expressly committed to focus on the FAA's primary responsibility, which is ensuring the safety of our national aerospace.""The committee held a confirmation hearing for Whitaker on Wednesday and he also won the support of Republican Senator Jerry Moran. Committee chair Maria Cantwell said she thought Whitaker did ""very well"" at hearing and she hopes to have a committee vote on the nomination.Whitaker said the FAA must fix persistent air traffic controller staffing issues. The FAA has 10% fewer controllers than it did in 2012.""We just simply need to solve this problem and figure out how to get it done,"" Whitaker said.He also said the FAA must address a spate of near miss airplane incidents and ""really drive the most serious ones down to a level of zero ... that needs to be our target."" In April, the FAA named an independent safety review team to look at ways to boost air safety and make recommendations by October.The FAA last month said it would again extend cuts to minimum flight requirements at congested New York City-area airports through October 2024.Story continuesU.S. airlines including United have expressed growing frustration with air traffic staff shortages and sought waivers to minimum flight requirements.Another key issue is when the FAA will certify the Boeing 737 MAX 7, a smaller version of the best-selling plane. In July, Boeing said the first MAX 7 delivery had been delayed to 2024. Congress in December waived rules requiring the MAX 7 and MAX 10 to have modern cockpit alerting systems.(Reporting by David Shepardson Editing by Bernadette Baum and Nick Zieminski)]"

143,223c4d7c-fa52-3033-87be-34228676f579,PWR,2023-10-06,"Quanta Services (NYSE:PWR) sheds 11% this week, as yearly returns fall more in line with earnings growth",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quanta-services-nyse-pwr-sheds-102553692.html,1696587953,STORY,['PWR'],"[Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE:PWR) shareholders have seen the share price descend 19% over the month. But that does not change the realty that the stock's performance has been terrific, over five years. To be precise, the stock price is 435% higher than it was five years ago, a wonderful performance by any measure. So we don't think the recent decline in the share price means its story is a sad one. Of course what matters most is whether the business can improve itself sustainably, thus justifying a higher price.While this past week has detracted from the company's five-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment. See our latest analysis for Quanta Services To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Quanta Services managed to grow its earnings per share at 15% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 40% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Quanta Services has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Quanta Services will grow revenue in the future.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Quanta Services, it has a TSR of 444% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Quanta Services has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 27% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 40% per year, is even more impressive. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Even so, be aware that  Quanta Services is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , you should know about...Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of companies we expect will grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: American Water Works Co. Inc. AWK, Vistra Corp. VST, Pinnacle West Capital Corp. PNW, OGE Energy Corp. OGE and The Southern Co. SO.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:Add These 5 Utilities to Your Portfolio for Long-Term GainsVolatility has reappeared on Wall Street since August as U.S. stock markets have been witnessing a reversal of the impressive bull run in the first seven months of this year. Markets may remain volatile in the near future. Wall Street is currently in a “Catch 22 situation.”Weak economic data will indicate that the Fed’s aggressive interest rate hike policy for one and half years has started bearing fruits. On the other hand, this will also indicate a slowdown in economic activities.At this stage, it should be prudent to invest in defensive stocks like utilities with a favorable Zacks Rank to strengthen your portfolio. Out of the 11 broad sectors of the S&amp;P 500 Index, the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) suffered the most in 2023 as market participants’ thrust shifted from defensive to growth/momentum stocks. Year to date, XLU has plunged 19.5%. This also indicates that utility stocks are currently available at an attractive valuation.Utilities Immune to Vagaries of Economic Cycle   The Utilities sector is mature and fundamentally strong as demand for such services is generally immune to the changes in the economic cycle. Such companies provide basic services like electricity, gas, water and telecommunications, which are always in demand.Consequently, adding stocks from the utility basket usually lends more stability to a portfolio in an uncertain market condition. Moreover, the sector is known for the stability and visibility of its earnings and cash flows.  Stable earnings enable utilities to pay out consistent dividends that make them more attractive to income-oriented investors.Story continuesUtility companies enjoy a reputation for being safe given the regulated nature of their business. This lends their revenues a high level of certainty. These companies also benefit from the domestic orientation of their business, which shields them from foreign currency translation issues.Additionally, utilities are generally low-beta stocks (beta &gt;0 but &lt;1). At this stage, investment in low-beta stocks with a high dividend yield and a favorable Zacks Rank may be the best option.If the market’s northbound journey is reestablished, the favorable Zacks Rank of these stocks will capture the upside potential. However, if the market’s downturn continues, low-beta stocks will minimize portfolio losses and dividend payments will act as a regular income stream.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five low-beta utility stocks that are regular dividend payers. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions within the last 60 days and have good potential for the rest of 2023 and 2024. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

This represents the first step in Evernorth's active collaboration with providers as the industry looks to create meaningful, standardized metrics for behavioral health care. ""Across the health care industry, we all understand the importance of measurement, and delivering quality behavioral health outcomes and care represents our next step in strengthening the interventions for our patients and deepening our relationships with providers,"" said Eva Borden, president, behavioral health, Evernorth. ""Right now, there is a lack of consistent, repeatable measures – that are broadly agreed upon – resulting in more administrative work, and less trust, from our provider partners. This is the first step as we seek to actively collaborate with providers, as enhancing the provider experience is critical to the success of measurement-based care. We are creating a program that will deliver best-in-class clinical outcomes and multi-stakeholder affordability.""Measurement-based care, also referred to as value-based care, has long existed for physical health but has not seen the same adoption in behavioral health. In the journey toward behavioral measurement-based care, providers and payers have used a variety of measures, sharing them via spreadsheets or claims and document submissions to understand quality. The goal of this new program is to align on treatment measurements that can ultimately drive improvements in care, cost, and collaboration, as well as remove administrative burdens for providers.Story continues""We are identifying the most important measurements at each point in the patient journey and creating standard ways to capture them,"" said Dr. Doug Nemecek, chief medical officer, behavioral health, Evernorth. ""Our ongoing strategy involves building collaborations with key providers committed to quality outcomes and creating, with their partnership, interventions that will benefit patients, clients, and mental health professionals alike.""As part of the program's initial launch, Evernorth will work with over 44,000 providers, with plans to expand over time. The providers include behavioral health coaches, therapists, and prescribers who can help with a variety of mental health conditions, including anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, substance use disorders, and more. Evernorth has identified key metrics for the program to ensure that customers have quick access to high-quality care, including how long it takes a patient to get an appointment, avoidance of a higher level of care, and total cost-of-care savings. The program will add to these measures over time as Evernorth engages with providers to align on best metrics.""By tracking this information, we can help move the needle in partnership with our providers as we all work together to improve care for the people we serve,"" Dr. Nemecek said. ""We want our providers to be focused on patient care and not on paperwork, and we plan to incorporate measurement in ways that minimize the administrative burdens and maximize the benefits for providers and patients. By embedding shared metrics in the customer journey, both payers and providers will develop insights into access and outcomes that will benefit everyone.""About Evernorth Health Services Evernorth Health Services creates pharmacy, care, and benefits solutions to improve health and increase vitality. We relentlessly innovate to make the prediction, prevention, and treatment of illness and disease more accessible to millions of people.

This company, which is in the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This defense contractor has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 3.58%.For the most recent quarter, Northrop Grumman was expected to post earnings of $5.31 per share, but it reported $5.34 per share instead, representing a surprise of 0.56%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $5.16 per share, while it actually produced $5.50 per share, a surprise of 6.59%.Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Northrop Grumman lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Northrop Grumman has an Earnings ESP of +1.02% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on October 26, 2023.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Consumer Cyclical Stocks To Buy Now.What Are Consumer Cyclical Stocks?Consumer cyclical stocks include stocks relying on the business cycle and economic conditions, that is, their profitability and performance in a given financial year is highly dependent on market conditions throughout that year. These stocks are primarily found in sectors providing non-essential, even luxury, goods to consumers, such as the automotive sector, the travel and leisure sector, the entertainment sector, and the retail sector, among others. Since these stocks are heavily dependent on market conditions, a lot of investors might wish to avoid them because of their unpredictability. However, any investment portfolio requires a good balance of different categories of stocks, and for some investors, consumer cyclical stocks, with their volatility, can actually help achieve long-term wealth.The current state of the US market is heavily volatile and unpredictable, especially for consumer cyclical stocks in the automotive sector. This is primarily because of the United Auto Workers (UAW) strikes occurring nationwide. However, major automakers such as General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) that are impacted heavily by the strikes are continuing to hold on. On October 5, CNBC's Jim Cramer made some comments on Ford Motor Company's (NYSE:F) current approach to handling the UAW strikes. Here's what he said:""Ford is trying to prove that that they really aren't the same as the others. GM fired a huge number of United Auto Workers in the last, I don't know, in the last decade, but Ford didn't. And Ford's actually moved a lot of UAW workers from temporary to full, which is the only way to get them within the contract that they're operating under: more money. So, I know that Ford felt a little upset that Biden joined the picket line, but at the same time Ford is seeing some movement by Fain.""Story continuesAccording to Cramer's analysis, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) may be looking to shift a part of its production to Mexico while the strikes continue. He sees this move coming about in the next couple of weeks.At the same time, Paul Jacobson, the CFO at General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) also joined CNBC's ""Halftime Report"" on October 4 to discuss the company's announcement of a new line of credit worth $6 billion to help it cope with the financial effects of the UAW strikes, the cost of which had reached about $200 million at that time, according to CNBC. Such developments show that even in the face of adversity, reliable companies in the consumer cyclical space are continuing to hold on and ensure that they retain their profitability for the sake of their own revenues and the profits of their shareholders.How Are Other Areas Of The Market Performing?This cursory view of the automotive sector can make one wonder how cyclical stocks in other areas of the market are faring. CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" delved into the state of the retail sector on October 5, which can help investors see how other areas are performing. Here's what CNBC's Courtney Reagan had to say about the status of holiday toy sales in the retail sector:""While total toy sales are expected to fall year-over-year, there's something consumers find a way to buy - it's toys for Christmas. Good news for parents, or Santa, we should say, toy inventory is solid, so shortages aren't expected, and toy prices are down about 2.9% over last year.""All in all, you can't really say that consumer cyclical stocks like the ones mentioned above, and even others like NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) and The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), have it easy this year. However, efforts are being made to keep consumer sales up so these companies retain their profits. As such, we have compiled a list of some of the best cyclical stocks to buy now, particularly those that can be considered the best cyclical stocks in 2023.11 Best Consumer Cyclical Stocks To Buy NowSource:PixabayOur MethodologyWe used a stock screener to find consumer cyclical stocks and first selected 30 stocks for our list below.

(NYSE:LOW) in its first half of 2023 investor letter:Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) is a high-quality business with significant long-term earnings growth potential operated by a superb management team that has been successfully executing a multi-faceted business transformation. In recent quarters, industrywide sales have retrenched slightly, driven by record lumber deflation, moderation in DIY discretionary demand (particularly with big-ticket items), a mix-shift from large to smaller Pro-specific projects, and a general trend of consumers reallocating budgets from goods to services. Sales remain elevated relative to 2019 baseline levels driven by a combination of price and mix, while units have largely normalized. Against this backdrop, Lowe’s headline same-store-sales growth has been modestly negative, offset by material margin expansion and the benefits of Lowe’s best-in-class share buyback program positioning the company to generate roughly flat earnings growth in 2023.Lowe’s remains well positioned to manage through uncertainty. Nearly two-thirds of Lowe’s revenue comes from non-deferrable repair and maintenance activity, which is comparatively insulated from the macroeconomic environment. Lowe’s continues to make progress on various business initiatives that should aid the company’s ability to improve share and grow revenue even in challenging macro environments. Select initiatives for 2023 include the continued rollout of Lowe’s market-based delivery model (now &gt;60% complete, a critical component of Lowe’s business transformation objectives), a new 300-store rural localization merchandising program, and enhancements to Lowe’s MVP Pro Rewards program…” (Click here to read the full text)Like General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), NIKE, Inc.

The emergency use of PAXLOVID is only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic under Section 564(b)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b)(1), unless the declaration is terminated or authorization revoked sooner.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONWARNING: SIGNIFICANT DRUG INTERACTIONS WITH PAXLOVIDPAXLOVID includes ritonavir, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, which may lead to greater exposure of certain concomitant medications, resulting in potentially severe, life-threatening, or fatal eventsPrior to prescribing PAXLOVID: 1) Review all medications taken by the patient to assess potential drug-drug interactions with a strong CYP3A inhibitor like PAXLOVID and 2) Determine if concomitant medications require a dose adjustment, interruption, and/or additional monitoringConsider the benefit of PAXLOVID treatment in reducing hospitalization and death, and whether the risk of potential drug-drug interactions for an individual patient can be appropriately managedPAXLOVID is contraindicated in patients with a history of clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions (eg, toxic epidermal necrolysis or Stevens-Johnson syndrome) to its active ingredients (nirmatrelvir or ritonavir) or any other components of the product. If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately discontinue PAXLOVID and initiate appropriate medications and/or supportive care.PAXLOVID is contraindicated with drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A and for which elevated concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening reactions and drugs that are strong CYP3A inducers where significantly reduced nirmatrelvir or ritonavir plasma concentrations may be associated with the potential for loss of virologic response and possible resistance. There are certain other drugs for which concomitant use with PAXLOVID should be avoided and/or dose adjustment, interruption, or therapeutic monitoring is recommended. Drugs listed here are a guide and not considered a comprehensive list of all drugs that may be contraindicated with PAXLOVID. The healthcare provider should consult other appropriate resources such as the prescribing information for the interacting drug for comprehensive information on dosing or monitoring with concomitant use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor like PAXLOVID.Drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A for which elevated concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening reactions:Alpha 1-adrenoreceptor antagonist: alfuzosinAntianginal: ranolazineAntiarrhythmic: amiodarone, dronedarone, flecainide, propafenone, quinidineAnti-gout: colchicine (in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment)Antipsychotics: lurasidone, pimozideBenign prostatic hyperplasia agents: silodosinCardiovascular agents: eplerenone, ivabradineErgot derivatives: dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, methylergonovineHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors: lovastatin, simvastatin (these drugs can be temporarily discontinued to allow PAXLOVID use)Immunosuppressants: voclosporinMicrosomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor: lomitapideMigraine medications: eletriptan, ubrogepantMineralocorticoid receptor antagonists: finerenoneOpioid antagonists: naloxegolPDE5 inhibitor: sildenafil (Revatio®) when used for pulmonary arterial hypertensionSedative/hypnotics: triazolam, oral midazolamSerotonin receptor 1A agonist/serotonin receptor 2A antagonist: flibanserinVasopressin receptor antagonists: tolvaptanDrugs that are strong CYP3A inducers: PAXLOVID cannot be started immediately after discontinuation of any of the following medications due to the delayed offset of the recently discontinued CYP3A inducer:Anticancer drugs: apalutamideAnticonvulsant: carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, phenytoinAntimycobacterials: rifampin, rifapentineCystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator potentiators: lumacaftor/ivacaftorHerbal Products: St. John’s Wort (hypericum perforatum)Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions: Initiation of PAXLOVID, which contains ritonavir, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving PAXLOVID, may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A. Medications that induce CYP3A may decrease concentrations of PAXLOVID. These interactions may lead to:Clinically significant adverse reactions, potentially leading to severe, life-threatening, or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medicationsLoss of therapeutic effect of PAXLOVID and possible development of viral resistanceSevere, life-threatening, and/or fatal adverse reactions due to drug interactions have been reported in patients treated with PAXLOVID. The most commonly reported concomitant medications resulting in serious adverse reactions were calcineurin inhibitors (eg, tacrolimus, cyclosporine), followed by calcium channel blockers.Hepatotoxicity: Hepatic transaminase elevations, clinical hepatitis, and jaundice have occurred in patients receiving ritonavir. Therefore, caution should be exercised when administering PAXLOVID to patients with pre-existing liver diseases, liver enzyme abnormalities, or hepatitis.Because nirmatrelvir is coadministered with ritonavir, there may be a risk of HIV-1 developing resistance to HIV protease inhibitors in individuals with uncontrolled or undiagnosed HIV-1 infection.The most common adverse reactions in the PAXLOVID group (≥1%) that occurred at a greater frequency than in the placebo group were dysgeusia (5% and &lt;1%, respectively) and diarrhea (3% and 2%, respectively).The following adverse reactions have been identified during use of PAXLOVID under Emergency Use Authorization:Immune System Disorders: Anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reactionsSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndromeNervous System Disorders: HeadacheVascular Disorders: HypertensionGastrointestinal Disorders: Abdominal pain, nausea, vomitingGeneral Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: MalaisePAXLOVID is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A, and an inhibitor of CYP2D6, P-gp, and OATP1B1. Coadministration of PAXLOVID with drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A and CYP2D6 or are transported by P-gp or OATP1B1 may result in increased plasma concentrations of such drugs and increase the risk of adverse events. Coadministration with other CYP3A substrates may require a dose adjustment or additional monitoring.Pregnancy: Available data on the use of nirmatrelvir during pregnancy are insufficient to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Published observational studies on ritonavir use in pregnant women have not identified an increase in the risk of major birth defects. Published studies with ritonavir are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk of miscarriage. There are maternal and fetal risks associated with untreated COVID-19 in pregnancy.Lactation: There are no available data on the presence of nirmatrelvir in human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. A transient decrease in body weight was observed in the nursing offspring of rats administered nirmatrelvir. Limited published data report that ritonavir is present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of ritonavir on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for PAXLOVID and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from PAXLOVID or from the underlying maternal condition.Contraception: Use of ritonavir may reduce the efficacy of combined hormonal contraceptives. Advise patients using combined hormonal contraceptives to use an effective alternative contraceptive method or an additional barrier method of contraception.Pediatrics: The optimal dose of PAXLOVID has not been established in pediatric patients.Systemic exposure of nirmatrelvir increases in renally impaired patients with increase in the severity of renal impairment. No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild renal impairment. Reduce the dose of PAXLOVID in patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥30 to &lt;60 mL/min). PAXLOVID is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR &lt;30 mL/min) or in patients with end-stage renal disease (eGFR &lt;15 mL/min).PAXLOVID is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).Please see Full Prescribing Information, including BOXED WARNING and Patient InformationClick for Fact Sheets:For Consumers:EUA Fact sheet for Patients, Parents, and CaregiversFor Healthcare Professionals:EUA Fact Sheet for HCPsINDICATIONS AND IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR PREVNAR 20U.S. INDICATIONSPREVNAR 20® is a vaccine approved for:the prevention of invasive disease caused by 20 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 8, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 18C, 19A, 19F, 22F, 23F, and 33F) in individuals 6 weeks and older.the prevention of otitis media (middle ear infection) caused by 7 of the 20 strains in individuals 6 weeks through 5 years.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONPREVNAR 20 should not be given to anyone who has had a severe allergic reaction to any component of PREVNAR 20 or to diphtheria–toxoid-containing vaccine.Individuals with weakened immune systems may have a lower immune response.

No financial terms were disclosed.Representatives for Promosome and Pfizer did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday. A representative for BioNTech's attorneys declined to comment on the filing.The agreement comes weeks after Promosome abandoned a related lawsuit against COVID-19 vaccine maker Moderna.San Diego and New York-based Promosome was formed to commercialize technology developed by biochemistry researchers at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California. Promosome sued Pfizer, BioNTech and Moderna in June, accusing the companies of copying its technology for making doses of mRNA small enough to use safely and effectively in the vaccines.The lawsuits said that Promosome discussed its technology with representatives from Moderna and BioNTech between 2013 and 2016.Promosome had asked the court for a share of royalties from the shots. Pfizer earned $37.8 billion last year from sales of its COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty, while Moderna made $18.4 billion from its vaccine Spikevax.Pfizer and BioNTech denied the allegations and claimed Promosome had withheld information from the U.S. Patent Office when applying for the patent that would have rendered it invalid.The Promosome lawsuits were among several U.S. patent cases brought by biotech companies over the alleged misuse of their technology in the groundbreaking shots. Moderna filed a patent lawsuit against Pfizer and BioNTech last year that is still ongoing. (Reporting by Blake Brittain in Washington; Editing by David Bario and Andrea Ricci)]"

As of Jun 12, 2023, 57 patients (54 NSCLC and three other solid tumors patients) received 15-200 mg once daily doses of NVL-655.Per the data readout, NVL-655 demonstrated preliminary activity in the enrolled and heavily pre-treated patient population as measured by objective response rate (ORR). Partial responses were observed in 45% of response-evaluable patients with ALK-positive NSCLC, receiving 15-150 mg once daily doses of NVL-655.Additionally, an ORR of 65% was achieved in patients with baseline ALK resistance mutations, while an ORR of 41% was observed in patients previously treated with Pfizer’s PFE Lorbrena (lorlatinib), including cases with compound resistance mutations. Furthermore, treatment with NVL-655 showed the early indicators of central nervous system activity.The company’s stock rallied about 35.6% on Wednesday, in response to encouraging preliminary data from the ALKOVE-1 study of NVL-655 in advanced ALK-positive NSCLC. Year to date, shares of NUVL have skyrocketed 93.1% against the industry’s 18.2% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe phase I dose-escalation portion of Nuvalent’s ALKOVE-1 study is currently enrolling ALK-positive NSCLC patients who have previously received at least one ALK TKI and patients with other ALK-positive solid tumors who have been previously treated with at least one prior systemic anticancer therapy.The primary goal of the phase I portion of the study is to determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and if applicable, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of NVL-655 in patients with ALK-positive solid tumors.Story continuesAdditional objectives in the study include evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetic and tolerability profiles and the evaluation of the preliminary anti-tumor activity of NVL-655.Nuvalent also reported that the preliminary pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated dose-proportional exposure and preliminary pharmacodynamic analysis showed reductions, including clearance, of ALK fusion and mutation variants in ctDNA.NVL-655 was overall well-tolerated, reporting mild treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). Most commonly reported TRAEs included nausea, transaminase elevation, fatigue and constipation.As of the freeze data of the preliminary analysis, an MTD was not identified and the phase I portion was still ongoing to determine the RP2D.Pfizer’s Lorbrena is currently approved in the United States to treat first, second and third-line advanced ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC.PFE initially received accelerated approval for Lorbrena in the second and third-line treatment of advanced ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC. It was converted to full approval along with the FDA approval of the label expansion of Lorbrena to include the first-line treatment of advanced ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC in 2021.Pfizer’s Lorbrena is also currently approved in the EU and marketed under the brand name Lorviqua. Notably, Lorviqua is also indicated for first, second and third-line treatment of advanced ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC.The recommended dose strength of Pfizer’s Lorbrena/Lorviqua is 100 mg orally, once daily.Nuvalent, Inc.

Parker did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Lindell said on Thursday that he is ""out of money"" and praised his lawyers as being courageous.Lindell said he was the victim of ""lawfare"" and that he is unable to borrow money. He said he is looking for new counsel.""We’ll find someone, that’s the way it is,"" Lindell said.Dominion is seeking $1.3 billion in damages from Lindell and his pillow company in the Washington case. Smartmatic is seeking an unspecified amount of damages in Minnesota federal court.Fox Corp and Fox News in April settled defamation claims brought by Dominion for $787.5 million. Smartmatic's separate $2.7 billion lawsuit against Fox is pending in New York state court.Both companies are also pursuing election-related defamation lawsuits against former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and others.Trump has continued to make false claims that voting fraud cost him the last election even as he faces criminal prosecutions in Washington and Georgia over his attempts to overturn the 2020 results.

A full 30% of the Gen Z cohort don't drink alcohol at all, the company's research shows.“That plays right into our overall strategy, where we’re moving beyond beer, we’re moving into non-alc products whether those are energy drinks, whether they are non-alcoholic beers,” CEO Gavin Hattersley told CNBC's ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer on Wednesday.The interview came after this week’s investor day, where Hattersley's executive team unveiled their plans to defend their market share gains in light and premium beers that comprise the bulk of its business, while pushing into new product categories.The non-alcoholic beer category today comprises less than 1% of the market, but it is expanding at a double-digit rate. To better capture that growth, Molson Coors is launching a new alcohol-free version of its craft Belgian white-style brand of wheat beer, Blue Moon.“One of our bigger innovations which I think is going to be a big deal for us is the launch of Blue Moon non-alc which we’re bringing in December just in time for Dry January,” Hattersley told Cramer.Gen Z drinking lessMolson Coors is also expanding its partnership with the Coca-Cola company to include a new Peace Hard Tea brand in addition to their spiked versions of the latter’s Simply line of juices. The brewer is also aiming to reach Gen Z consumers who do drink alcohol with its Vizzy hard seltzer.Story continuesBut one key pillar of its strategy involves further developing a line of zero-sugar energy drinks called ZOA, which was co-founded by Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. In September, Molson Coors struck a deal to expand its minority stake and remain the line's exclusive distribution partner while gaining a seat on its board.To help Molson Coors better understand the tastes of the younger consumer group and what types of beverages that might appeal to them, its management has developed what they call a legal age Gen Z culture panel.“If we want to build what they want, we need to know what makes them tick,” chief commercial officer Michelle St. Jacques told investors on Tuesday.According to Gallup’s Lydia Saad, young consumers deem moderate alcoholic consumption too unhealthy. In a recent article, she also cited a shift from alcohol to marijuana, which is now legal in several states.But a major reason for the decline in young Americans who drink, Saad said, is that the number of Black, Hispanic, Asian or other racial minorities has doubled as a proportion of that age group over the past two decades. These groups have persistently been less likely to consume alcohol across all age groups than their white peers.“The overall drinking rate among 18 to 34-year-olds has naturally fallen as the proportion who are non-White has increased,” wrote Saad, Gallup’s director of U.S. social research.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com]"

Rivian's (RIVN) stock fell sharply after announcing a $1.5 billion convertible bond offering. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that at least 20 million General Motors (GM) vehicles have air bags with a potentially dangerous part that the government says should be recalled. Shares of Lamb Weston Holdings (LW) jumped after the frozen potato products company reported first quarter results that topped analyst estimates.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video Transcript- And shares of Rivian plummeting today after the EV maker revealed it will issue $1.5 billion worth of convertible notes. The company also issuing preliminary third quarter estimates that show sales will be slightly lower than expected. So it's been a wild week for Rivian, Julie. But on the preliminary Q3 revenue, so they expect a range of $1.29 to $1.33 billion. Street was at $1.3 billion. And then they're going to issue $1.5 billion convertible debt. So they're looking to raise cash.JULIE HYMAN: And they need the cash, because they are still losing money on every car that they make. Now as we've talked about with the bigger-- even the bigger automakers haven't necessarily gotten that mix right. They still lose money in some cases on their EVs as well. But to your point, it hasn't just been a wild week. It has been a wild all of its public existence for this company.- Look at that chart.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, the year to date, it's actually up, shockingly. But it's down more than 40% over the past year, because investors can't figure out what to do with this thing. Is it eventually going to gain more critical mass? Are they going to make money on the cars? Are they going to sell more of them, and therefore go trickle through to the bottom line? I think that a lot of investors are still really struggling with this. I was just looking at the short interest on the stock, which is about 12% of float-- so still relatively high short interest of people who are not confident in the story here.Story continues- They are losing money on every vehicle they sell. Now, you can, of course, make that up if you sell a lot. But that takes time.JULIE HYMAN: Exactly. Right, exactly. So we'll see what ends up happening. Let's stick with automakers in terms of movers we're watching. General Motors on the list. Those shares are off by more than 3% and at three-year lows. Now that's after a ""Wall Street Journal"" report revealed at least 20 million vehicles were built with a potentially dangerous airbag part that the government says should be recalled. Now this is an ongoing issue that the government has been looking into.These parts made by ARC automotive, which have pushed back against the government's criticism of the part. And GM's not the only automaker that has them in its cars. But this new ""Journal"" report, when you see the number 20 million vehicles, if indeed there ends up having to be a recall, that's obviously a large number.- Yeah, and the ""Journal's"" pointing out the number of affected GM vehicles. That hasn't been disclosed publicly yet. But you think about the headlines. I mean, this is just about the last thing GM needs right now with, of course, the ongoing UAW strike that shows no end in sight.JULIE HYMAN: No. And if you look at the 20 million for GM, what the ""Journal"" is saying and what regulators have said is that there are 52 million overall airbag inflators made by this company ARC automotive that could be faulty. As I said, the company has pushed back, and so NHTSA-- the National Highway Safety Transportation Administration-- Safety Transportation Administration-- has called for public hearings and has been holding them on this issue to try to press it. So in other words, there are still more developments to come in this story.- Rough headlines. Shares of Lamb Weston holdings. Let's check that out. Rising today. Nice pop, nearly 10% after the company's first quarter earnings beat on the top and bottom lines. The frozen potato producer also raising its fiscal guidance. So frozen potato products, Julie, that's what we're talking here. Earnings beat, boosted the earnings forecast. Nice jump in volume. And some analysts, I know, are saying this was encouraging, given what they see as that weaker restaurant trend. So they like what they heard here--JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, we're talking--- --and so do investors.JULIE HYMAN: --frozen fries, frozen tots, all of your favorite frozen products.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and the dividend capture strategy, and go directly to read 5 Best October Dividend Stocks To Buy. Dividend payments around the world have been growing significantly because investors are increasingly interested in income-generating assets. This strong reputation of dividend stocks didn't happen overnight; it's based on historical data that demonstrates how these stocks have consistently performed better than other types of investments over the years. Companies that regularly increase their dividends are particularly attractive in this scenario. They are considered real winners because they not only garner appreciation from investors but also thrive in changing market conditions. According to a report by Morgan Stanley, dividends are a crucial investment for long-term investors. Stocks with high dividends typically do well when inflation is higher than usual but on a downward trend. These stocks are also considered safe and become even more appealing during uncertain economic times because they provide stability and reliable income.As mentioned above, global dividends have experienced significant growth this year. China's largest companies have paid out 1.5 trillion yuan ($206 billion) in dividends this year, which has already exceeded the 1.27 trillion yuan paid out in 2022, according to a report by Bloomberg. The major contributors to this increase are the largest state-owned banks, with PetroChina and Kweichow Moutai following closely behind. Similarly, Janus Henderson reported that 98% of US companies either increased their dividends or maintained them at the same level in the second quarter of 2023. This percentage is significantly higher than the global average.Dividend investing can be a sound strategy for long-term investors. Holding onto stocks with consistently increasing dividends can lead to higher yields on original investment over time. Regular dividend hikes often contribute to an increase in the stock's share price. According to a recent report by T. Rowe Price, between the end of 1985 to the close of 2022, dividend growers in the Russell 1000 Index performed better than the broader benchmark index. Furthermore, these dividend-growing stocks showed lower levels of price fluctuations or volatility. Some of the best dividend stocks in this regard are The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) as these firms have consistently increased their dividend payments for many years.Story continuesIn addition to long-term investors, dividend investing can be appealing to some short-term investors through a dividend capture strategy. It involves purchasing a stock just before it goes ex-dividend and then selling it shortly thereafter, typically after the dividend is received. This strategy aims to capture the dividend income while minimizing exposure to the stock's price fluctuations. To learn more about this investment approach, have a look at our article Dividend Capture Strategy Stocks To Buy.10 Best October Dividend Stocks To Buy Our Methodology:This list outlines the dividend capture strategy for selecting prominent dividend stocks that will trade ex-dividend in October 2023.

Editorial photo for a financial news article. 8k. --ar 16:9Brendan Foley: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Let me start by saying how pleased I am to join you today for my first earnings call as President and CEO. Just over one month into my new role, I am energized by our underlying business trends, which reinforce our competitive advantages and differentiation. Let's turn to our results. We drove another quarter of strong performance, reflecting sustained demand and effective execution of our growth strategies across our Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments. Our results were in line with our expectations across our business, notwithstanding challenges for our Consumer segment in Asia Pacific, or APAC, where the pace of China's economic recovery been slower than previously anticipated.Story continuesLet me start with the highlights for the third quarter. We delivered solid constant currency sales growth. We continued to realize effective price realization, and importantly, volume performance, excluding China, has improved each quarter throughout the year. We continued to see top-line momentum in our business, positioning McCormick for sustained growth. We drove meaningful year-over-year margin expansion, underscoring our focus on profit realization. Year-to-date cash flow from operations more than doubled relative to the prior year due to higher operating income and working capital improvements. Our performance demonstrates the strength of our business fundamentals and the effective execution of our proven strategies while leveraging the sustained demand for flavor.Turning to Slide 5. In the third quarter, we drove 6% sales growth in constant currency, demonstrating the strength of our broad global portfolio. Our constant currency growth reflected strong business performance, with an 8% contribution from pricing and a 2% decline in volume and product mix. This decline in volume was driven by two factors: a 1% volume decline attributable to the impact of a slower-than-expected economic recovery in China; and a 1% decline related to the divestiture of Kitchen Basics, the exit of our Consumer business in Russia, and the pruning of low-margin business to optimize our portfolio. All other underlying volume and mix performance was flat for the quarter, which is a sequential improvement from the second quarter where total underlying volume growth was down approximately 1%.I would like to now share a few highlights on gross margin and operating income for the quarter, which Mike will cover in more detail. We drove strong gross margin improvement year-over-year, reflecting continued recovery of the cost inflation our pricing lagged last year, and cost savings from our CCI and GOE programs. We remain focused on improving our margins over the long term and believe that our recovery will be a continuous build. And we expect to return to historical levels and believe there is a runway beyond that, recognizing it will take some time. Higher gross profit for the quarter was partially offset by lower-than-expected performance in China as well as higher SG&amp;A. As planned, we continue to build back incentive compensation and increased brand marketing investments.The net impact was a 5% increase in adjusted operating income versus the prior year. Overall, we are pleased with our execution and results year-to-date. These results, combined with the strong demand we continue to expect across our portfolio and our focused approach to optimizing our cost structure, reinforce our confidence in our growth trajectory during the fourth quarter and beyond. Moving into the fourth quarter, we can continue to expect top-line momentum across our portfolio, including growth in China, as we lap the COVID-related disruptions. China's growth, however, is expected to be less than originally anticipated, which, when combined with its year-to-date performance, has led to a lower full year 2023 benefit than we originally expected.Despite this impact, however, we are reaffirming our sales outlook and now anticipate our results will be closer to the middle of our guidance range. We are reaffirming our operating income outlook, which highlights stronger than originally expected profit realization on our business, excluding China. Demand is strong. We are driving improvement in our margin profile and are optimizing our cost structure effectively. Now for our performance by segment. Starting with our Consumer segment on Slide 7. We saw solid results across the Americas and EMEA, which were tempered by our APAC region due to China, as I mentioned earlier. Notwithstanding China, we are pleased with our underlying performance. Now for some highlights by regions. First, in the Americas.Our total U.S. branded portfolio consumption as indicated by our IRI consumption data and combined with unmeasured channels grew approximately 4%. Excluding the year-over-year impact of the Kitchen Basics divestiture and the exit of DSD, Direct-Store-Delivery, of our bagged Hispanic spices. There is a minor difference between our sales and consumption, which is attributable to listing fees for a significant increase in new distribution and new products. For example, our new Cholula and Stubb's items and Tabitha Brown line extensions. Importantly, our categories remain advantaged in terms of growth relative to overall macro trends, and we are well positioned to drive future growth. The fundamental strength of the spices and seasonings category is evident as cooking at home has remained elevated since pre-COVID and consumers have an increasing demand for flavor.U.S. spices and seasonings growth is continuing to outpace the total edible category in units and dollars. We have the right plans in place and are taking the right actions to grow market share in this very attractive and competitive category. We have made progress and shown improvement relative to the beginning of the year. We continue to restore distribution, which was lost because of supply issues. As we look at our performance and our trends, we are happy to see total distribution point growth in the third quarter. We also continue to be pleased that our assortment on shelf is more productive than pre-COVID. In addition, we have significant new distribution and innovation that is starting to come online as customers reset their shelves.As we've said before, restoration will take some time and we expect to drive growth as we continue to progress. In addition to driving distribution gains, we have a continued focus on supporting our brands and optimizing pricing. As you would expect, this has become a more important part of our category management efforts in recent years. Our diverse portfolio allows us flexibility to optimize our pricing effectiveness. We look at both our everyday price and our promotional returns, as well as use innovation, including price pack architecture to drive growth. Our efforts are yielding results. The renovation of our U.S. core everyday spice and herb portfolio is rolling out according to plan. At the end of the third quarter, we have shipped about 40% of our renovated SKUs. And notably, products that have transitioned on shelf have seen high-teens improvement in velocity.And our significant brand marketing campaign featuring the benefits of the new packaging ramped up at the end of the third quarter leading into the holiday season. Our larger-size Super Deal herbs and spices continues to gain share. We saw strong performance in the third quarter, driven by pricing and higher unit volume. Expanded distribution has been a major driver for our performance, as well as consumers that are seeking value and trading up to larger sizes. We have the right assortment in this environment. Our household penetration on larger sizes is greater than pre-COVID. We are confident this product line will continue to drive growth as we expand distribution further and launch new line extensions. Our grilling performance was strong this quarter, supported by our Fire Up campaign as well as contribution for new product launches that we discussed on our earnings call in June.Frank's RedHot sauces, French's mustard and Stubb's Bar-B-Q sauces and rubs, as well as Lawry's marinades, all delivered significant growth in the third quarter relative to the prior year. We drove double-digit sales growth with contributions from pricing and volume across our total grilling portfolio. And we drove market share gains in mustard, barbecue sauce and marinades in the third quarter. Our expansion into the fast-growing Mexican aisle with new Cholula taco recipe mixes and salsas is continuing to build distribution and performance to date is outperforming our expectations. Finally, in the Americas, we continue to drive double-digit consumption growth in e-commerce led by spices and seasonings. We are realizing high returns on our investments, gaining new customers and growing with new products.Turning to EMEA, where we delivered a great quarter, our strongest quarterly sales performance in more than two years with double-digit sales growth. Notably, in the UK and France, we drove volume growth as pricing remained elevated. In both countries, we delivered significant growth in the discount channel, driven by expanded distribution with new and existing customers. In other parts of the region, we are also making meaningful progress in this fast-growing channel. We grew our business in the discount channel by over 30% across EMEA in the third quarter. Our grilling activations with key retailers in France and our promotional activities in the UK along with brand marketing support, drove strong third quarter growth across the growing portfolio.E-commerce also contributed meaningfully to our growth in both countries. Consumption data continues to indicate that the consumer is holding up well in our categories, with consumption trends continues to accelerate across the region. We grew share in herbs, spices and seasonings for our total EMEA business, with the UK, Eastern Europe, Italy and France all contributing. France grew share for the first time in two years. And UK recipe mixes, we extended our leading share position during the third quarter. New products and effective in-store promotions drove share gains. We also continued to drive hot sauce category growth in the UK, with Cholula leading to growth in the third quarter. And we are also building distribution of Cholula in France.In our APAC region, while the pace of recovery in this business has been slower than expected, we continue to believe in the long-term growth trajectory of our business in China. Notwithstanding the slower recovery in China, in all regions, in our Consumer segment, our investments in brand marketing, category management initiatives and new products are proving to be effective, and driving strong growth across our categories. We are making sequential improvement on volume, advancing our heat platform, and are pleased with our performance. We continue to fuel our growth with the power of our brands and increased innovation and brand marketing. We are also forming strategic partnerships to reach and enhance brand awareness with loyal built-in audiences.Building on the success we have with our Tabitha Brown partnership in light of new products in the U.S., where growth continues to accelerate, we are partnering with Nadiya Hussain, a celebrity British chef who won the sixth series of BBC's The Great British Bake Off in EMEA. We are launching a delicious range of short seasonings, recipe mixes, and meal kits with Nadiya and are helping build the confidence of UK consumers in the kitchen with cook-along videos and recipe ideas. We are thrilled to partner with Nadiya and preliminary results are very positive. We are looking forward to working with her on various future initiatives across the region to expand our brand awareness and accelerate new product growth. Our brand marketing efforts continue to drive awareness and strengthen our brands.As you may have seen in July, we partnered with Mars and launched a limited edition French's mustard-flavored SKITTLES. The objective of the campaign was to create top-of-mind awareness for French's through a buzzwordy moment to further strengthen the power of our brand. And of course, you can always have fun with mustard. We are thrilled that this was our most successful earned campaign to date with a record 5 billion impressions. It is also a perfect example of how we leverage our strengths across both segments, underscoring their complementary nature. Our Flavor Solutions team created the mustard flavor for this limited-edition product, which built awareness for both our consumer and foodservice businesses. Our segments are working together to further bolster French's success.I am passionate about how our two segments, Consumer and Flavor Solutions, complement each other, reinforcing what differentiates McCormick and enabling us to drive sustainable growth. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we are excited about the holiday season and our related brand marketing plans across all regions. Importantly, with our supply issues resolved, we are better positioned than we were last year entering this season. We are increasing our merchandising levels, to one similar to pre-COVID and are supporting our portfolio with holiday brand marketing campaigns across all regions. We are expecting a strong holiday season. Wrapping up the Consumer update, our year-to-date results bolster our confidence that we will continue to drive sales growth as we have in the past.The supply issues we experienced last year are resolved and we are using our strength in category management to increase distribution and drive McCormick and category growth. We believe the execution of our growth plans will be a win for consumers, customers, our categories and McCormick, which differentiates us even more and strengthening our leadership in our core categories. Now turning to Flavor Solutions on Slide 10. Our growth momentum in this segment continues to be exceptional. The third quarter marks our 10th consecutive quarter with double-digit constant currency sales growth. Our growth was led by pricing actions in all three regions. We are priced to cover current year inflation and are continuing to recover the cost inflation our pricing lagged the last two years.We remain committed to restoring our Flavor Solutions' profitability. And in third quarter, we again drove significant margin expansion versus prior year, and expect continued progress toward our objective to build back our margin in this segment. Let me turn to our highlights by region. Our Americas' third quarter strong sales growth was led by pricing, with an increase in volume contributing as well. Both the flavors and branded foodservice product categories grew by double digits. With flavors, our seasonings growth was strong, including volume growth related to new products. We are helping our customers grow with the strength of our brands. Our continued success with providing the seasoning for co-branded items included new ones with Frank's RedHot and Stubb's this quarter, contributed to our growth.Strength in our customers' iconic products also contributed to our seasonings' growth, particularly related to our heat platform. We also have strong momentum in flavors for performance nutrition beverages and health and market applications. Our growth is outpacing the market, fueled by the advantages of our proprietary technologies. Importantly, we are winning with new products for existing and new customers, largely across our mid-market customer base, who are category leaders in specific markets or are high-growth innovators, and whose growth is outpacing larger customers. We continue to have a robust pipeline of new products and our conversion rate is strong. We are creating preferred flavors, enabling our customers to continue to win in the marketplace.In branded foodservice, we gained share in spices and seasonings this quarter. Additionally, our recent new products, Frank's Mild sauce and Frank's Nashville Hot seasoning, are performing very well and are exceeding our expectations. They have both been well received by our customers, reinforcing that the demand for heat is growing at both the mild and hot end of the spectrum. We are excited for continued growth in these items as well as the overall breadth of opportunity in heat. Moving to EMEA, we continue to drive broad-based growth across the portfolio with strong growth in both our quick-service restaurant and packaged food and beverage customers. Pricing drove the growth as some of our customers in both channels continue to experience softness in the volume within their own businesses.As we continue to prune low-margin business in our Flavor Solutions segment, while it did not impact the third quarter, I want to mention that we divested a small canning business which was part of our Giotti operations in Italy. This divestiture allows us to focus our resources on our core flavors product category and drive further growth. Mike will have more on the future impact of this divestiture on the EMEA region in a few minutes. And in APAC, while the economic recovery in China was not as strong as anticipated, China contributed to the regional pricing and volume growth. Across the region, we benefited from our QSR customers' increase in promotional activity. The strength of our Flavor Solutions portfolio and capabilities, including our differentiated customer engagement and culinary-inspired innovation, are driving outstanding Flavor Solutions momentum.Our flavors product category, our 100% focus on flavor, our breadth and reach, our unrivalled consumer insights, and our proprietary technology platform gives us an advantage and positions us well to continue to win in the technically-insulated and value-added part of our portfolio, driving growth and advancing our flavor leadership. And in branded foodservice, we expect new products, increased menu penetration, culinary partnerships, and our expertise in heat to drive continued growth. Our robust growth plans in Flavor Solutions and effective execution of our proven strategies bolster our confidence in continuing our growth trajectory and driving our Flavor Solutions leadership as well as margin restoration. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mike to provide details on our financial performance.Mike Smith: Thanks, Brendan, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 13. Our top-line constant currency sales grew 6% compared to the third quarter of last year, reflecting 8% from pricing, partially offset with a 2% volume and mixed decline. As Brendan already mentioned, there were impacts of volume related to the slower-than-expected recovery in the China Consumer business, the divestiture of Kitchen Basics, the exit of our Consumer business in Russia, and strategic decisions we made related to optimizing the profitability of our portfolio. As a result, at the total company level, excluding these items, underlying volume performance was flat for the quarter and improved sequentially from the second quarter. In our Consumer segment, constant currency sales increased by 1%, reflecting a 5% increase in pricing actions, partially offset by a 4% volume decline.Included in this volume decline are: a 2% decline due to a lower-than-expected recovery in China; and a 2% decline attributable to the Kitchen Basics divestiture, our business exit in Russia, and the Hispanic product DSD exit to optimize margins. On Slide 14, Consumer sales in the Americas increased 2% in constant currency and included a 4% increase from pricing actions, partially offset by a 2% volume decline due to the Kitchen Basics divestiture and DSD items I just mentioned. In EMEA, constant currency Consumer sales increased 10%, with a 13% increase from pricing actions, partially offset by a 3% volume decline primarily from exiting Russia. Excluding Russia, sales growth was broad-based across all markets and categories. Constant currency Consumer sales in the APAC region decreased 11%, driven by a 15% volume decrease, primarily due to a slower-than-expected recovery in China.Also contributing to the decline was the impact of lapping strong China demand in the prior year following significant extended lockdowns during the second quarter of last year. Turning to our Flavor Solution segment in Slide 17. We grew third quarter constant currency sales 11%, reflecting a 10% increase from pricing and a 1% increase from volume and product mix. Our volume growth was partially offset by the pruning of low-margin business. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales rose 10%, reflecting a 9% increase from pricing and a 1% volume and product mix growth. Growth was broad based across the portfolio, with strengths and flavors, including seasonings and specialty flavors, as well as branded foodservice. In EMEA, constant currency sales increased 15%, with pricing actions partially offset by lower volume and product mix, including a 1% impact from exiting the private label product line mentioned earlier.Outside of this product discontinuation, volumes declined due to softness in some of our customers' volume within their own businesses. Regarding the divestiture of the Giotti canning business Brendan mentioned earlier, we expect this divestiture to impact EMEA Flavor Solutions by approximately 3% starting in the fourth quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024. For the total Flavor Solutions segment, we expect an approximately 1% impact, and for the total company, less than 1%. In the APAC region, Flavor Solutions sales grew 13% in constant currency with a 7% contribution from pricing and 6% volume growth, driven by our customers' promotional activities and limited time offers across the region. As seen on Slide 21, gross profit margin expanded 150 basis points in the third quarter versus the year-ago period, reflecting our steadfast focus on increasing profit realization.Favorable drivers in the quarter were our CCI and GOE programs, and the continued recovery of the cost inflation our pricing lagged over the past two years. We expect to finish 2023 meeting the cost recovery plans we set as we entered the year. We are very pleased with our gross margin expansion for the quarter. Historically, our third quarter gross margin has been higher than the second quarter. This year, however, they were comparable at approximately 37% because we realized our highest level of both pricing and cost recovery from prior years in the second quarter. We expect to continue to drive margin improvement in the balance of the year. And as evident by our full year outlook and year-to-date results, we expect a higher gross margin in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of this year as well as expansion from the fourth quarter of 2022.Now moving to Slide 22, selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG&amp;A, increased relative to the third quarter of last year, as higher employee incentive compensation expenses and distribution costs were partially offset by CCI-led and GOE cost savings. Brand marketing also increased compared to the third quarter of last year and we continue to expect a low single-digit increase in brand marketing for the full year. As a percentage of net sales, SG&amp;A increased 160 basis points. Strong sales growth and gross margin expansion, partially offset by higher SG&amp;A costs, resulted in a constant currency increase in adjusted operating income of 5% compared to the third quarter of 2022. In constant currency, adjusted operating income in the Consumer segment, which was impacted by the slower China recovery and brand marketing investments, declined 5%, and in the Flavor Solutions segment, adjusted operating income increased 42%.Turning to interest expense and the income taxes on Slide 23. Our interest expense increased significantly over the third quarter of 2022, driven by the higher interest rate environment. And quickly touching on tax, our third quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 21.4%, compared to 21.2% in the year-ago period. Our income from unconsolidated operations in the third quarter reflects strong performance in our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico. We are the market leader with the McCormick-branded mayonnaise, marmalades, and mustard product lines in Mexico, and the business continues to contribute meaningfully to our net income and operating cash flow results. At the bottom-line, as shown on Slide 25, third quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share was $0.65 as compared to $0.69 for the year-ago period.The decrease was driven by lapping a favorable impact primarily related to an optimization of our debt portfolio included in other income in the third quarter of last year. This impact is also a headwind to our full year results. On Slide 26, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations year-to-date was very strong, $660 million in 2023 compared to $250 million for the same period last year, a 164% increase. The increase was primarily driven by higher operating income and working capital improvements, including lower inventory. We returned $314 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $187 million of cash for capital expenditures through the third quarter. We expect 2023 to be a very strong year of cash flow as evidenced by our 2023 year-to-date cash flow from operations of $660 million, which is already slightly higher than our full year cash flow in 2022.Our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth, returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends, and paying down debt. We remain committed to a strong investment-grade rating. With our improving gross margin and lower inventory, we are well positioned to continue paying down debt, and we now expect to de-lever to approximately 3 times earlier in 2024 than we originally expected. Now turning to our updated 2023 financial outlook on Slide 27. Our 2023 outlook reflects our continued positive top-line growth momentum and, with the optimization of our cost structure, increased profit realization. We expect to drive margin expansion with strong sales and adjusted operating income growth.Adjusted operating income growth is expected to be partially offset by higher interest expense and a higher projected effective tax rate. We also anticipate minimal impact from currency rates, although there will be a timing aspect as we realize an unfavorable impact year-to-date through the third quarter and project a favorable impact in the fourth quarter. We are reaffirming our sales and operating profit outlook for 2023 despite a slower recovery in China. We no longer expect a 1% contribution to our sales from lapping last year's COVID disruptions in China. And we're also revising the benefit from a China recovery to our operating income from 300 basis points to 100 basis points. At the top-line, we continue to expect 5% to 7% growth, and anticipate our results will be closer to the middle of our guidance range given the lower-than-expected China recovery.The wrap of last year's pricing actions as well as the impact of new ones in 2023 are the primary drivers of growth. Several factors are expected to impact our volume and product mix for the year, including: price elasticities, which are consistent with 2022 at lower levels than we have historically experienced, but in line with the current environment; the divestiture of our Kitchen Basics business in August of last year and the exit of our Consumer business in Russia during last year's second quarter; the continual pruning of lower-margin business from our portfolio; we continue to estimate the Americas Consumer segment DSD exit and the EMEA's Flavor Solutions private label discontinuation to be approximately a 1% impact on the year, which began to impact us in the second quarter of 2023; and finally, the divestiture of Giotti's canning business, which closed on the first day of the fourth quarter, will have a minimal impact on total company sales for the year.We continue to plan to drive growth through the strength of our brands, as well as our category management, brand marketing, new products, and customer engagement plans. Our 2023 gross margin is projected to range between 110 basis points to 140 basis points higher than 2022 compared to our prior guidance of 50 basis points to 100 basis points. This gross margin expansion reflects a favorable impact from pricing, cost savings from our CCI-led and GOE programs, and portfolio optimization, partially offset by the anticipated impact of a low- to mid-teens increase in cost inflation. It also reflects more than offsetting cost pressures with pricing actions, as we recover the cost inflation or pricing lagged the last two years. Moving to adjusted operating income.We continue to expect 10% to 12% constant currency growth. There are some discrete items expected to impact our 2023 adjusted operating profit growth. First, remaining consistent with our prior outlook, we expect our GOE program to have an 800 basis point favorable impact and the Kitchen Basics divestiture to have an unfavorable 100 basis point impact. Next, I already mentioned the expected 100 basis point benefit related to China, which is lower than the originally anticipated 300 basis points. Finally, we expect a 900 basis point unfavorable impact from building back incentive compensation, slightly ahead of our prior projection of 800 basis points, given the increase in earnings expectations since the beginning of the year. The net impact of these discrete items is an unfavorable 100 basis points as compared to a 200 basis point favorable impact in our previous outlook.The reaffirmation of our adjusted operating income outlook despite the unfavorable change in the impact from discrete items highlight stronger than originally expected profit realization on our underlying business, which is now expected to be 11% to 13% growth compared to 8% to 10% growth previously. We are reaffirming our low single-digit increases in brand marketing investments, our CCI-led cost savings target of approximately $85 million, our interest expense outlook of an estimated range from $200 million to $210 million in 2023, and our 2023 adjusted effective income tax rate projection of approximately 22%. We are increasing our income from unconsolidated operations projection to a 30% expected increase from 2022, reflecting the strong performance we expect in our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico.To summarize, our 2023 adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect strong underlying business growth of 14% to 16%, above our prior projection of 10% to 12%. Combining this 14% to 16% underlying growth with a 1% unfavorable impact from the discrete items on adjusted operating profit and the combined interest and tax headwind of 9% results in an expected increase of 4% to 6% or a projected guidance range of adjusted earnings per share in 2023 of $2.62 to $2.67. We are projecting strong operating performance in 2023 with continued top-line momentum, significant optimization of our cost structure and strong adjusted operating profit growth, as well as margin expansion and strong cash flow. We remain confident in the underlying strength of our business and delivering on the profitable growth reflected in our 2023 financial outlook.Brendan Foley: Thank you, Mike. Before we turn it over to Q&amp;A, I would like to provide some closing comments. Global demand for flavor remains the foundation of our sales growth, and we have intentionally focused on great fast-growing categories. Our alignment with long-term consumer trends, healthy and flavorful cooking, trusted brands, increased digital engagement, and purpose-minded practices continue to create a tailwind for growth. McCormick is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this demand for great flavor. With the breadth and reach of our strong global flavor portfolio, we are end-to-end flavor for our consumers and customers. We remain a different kind of CPG company, one differentiated by our growth platform, the results that we have achieved over the last years and our culture.We play in great and fast growing categories. Our two segments, Consumer and Flavor Solutions, complement each other, reinforcing our differentiation. The scale, insights, and technology that we leverage from both segments are meaningful in driving sustainable growth. We continue to leverage the strength of our culture and the power of people to drive success. I want to thank McCormick employees worldwide as their energy and excitement for the business is coming through in our results. Now to recap the key takeaways as seen on Slide 30. Our third quarter performance was strong, reflecting sustained demand and the effective execution of our growth strategies. And our volume performance, excluding China, continued to improve. We drove meaningful year-over-year margin expansion, underscoring our focus on profit realization.Our year-to-date cash flow from operation results was strong, already equal to our full year 2022 results. Our reaffirmed sales and operating profit guidance, despite lower-than-expected China recovery, highlights the growing strength of the rest of the business. The strength of our business model, the value of our products and capabilities, and execution of our proven strategies bolsters our confidence in our growth trajectory over the long term. Now for your questions.Operator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question is coming from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.Andrew Lazar: Great. Thanks very much. Good morning, everybody.See also 15 Stocks Billionaire Seth Klarman Likes the Most Now and The 10 Largest Gambling Stocks of 2023.Q&amp;A SessionBrendan Foley: Good morning, Andrew.Mike Smith: Good morning.Andrew Lazar: Good morning. I guess maybe to start off with McCormick obviously as you mentioned saw some sequential volume improvement in Consumer Americas in the fiscal third quarter and you're lapping an easier -- and even easier I guess down 11% volume decline in the year-ago period in the fourth quarter. So, I guess my question is would you expect volume in the Consumer Americas segment to flip positively in the fourth quarter? And if not, I guess, what would be the key factors that would keep you from doing so, obviously all in the context of an industry volume backdrop that remains kind of subdued?Brendan Foley: Well, thanks Andrew for your question. Just to maybe speak first to last year's fourth quarter. I think our sales growth back in 2022 was down about 1.7%, I think, on sales. And that was up without Kitchen Basics. And we were lapping the 2021 retail inventory build in a high level. I think we, as we talked about on that call, entered the 2022 holiday with just a lot stronger inventory than we were counting on or predicting or forecasting. So, the way we're looking at it is the net sales impact really was up about -- a little over 4% in the fourth quarter last year. So, we're not seeing that necessarily as an easy comparison overall, but just talking to dollars first, that's kind of our view is just we're still looking at a pretty robust fourth quarter from a year ago just knowing that we had that comparison in the fourth quarter.Now, when we look at this year's fourth quarter, as we said on the call here earlier, you will see the impact of that DSD continuation in our Hispanic bagged spices part of our business. It just tends to be -- that business tends to be heavier in the fourth quarter because of the holidays, so that will be a little bit stronger then. But to our spices and seasonings business, we continue to see improving trends in that part of our portfolio. And you should expect to see that in the fourth quarter, that sequential improvement in performance overall. And we feel like we're going to have a strong holiday. I mean, I think the reasons why we feel good about the direction of that part of our portfolio is, and you heard it on the call, we're gaining share and we're gaining distribution on Super Deal, Herbs &amp; Spices.On the Lowry's opening price point platform, we're still getting really good performance for that, but still also building out distribution. And we have one value retailer that we've only begun just starting shipments on, and they'll start to build out and fill out more store locations because we have like just in that one particular account, 85% of the locations still yet to come. So, we still see distribution build happening behind Lowry's overall. And that renovation that we launched here this year, we talked about in the second quarter, is doing really well where we see it getting on shelf. Now we shipped about 40%, but what's appearing on shelf is probably just a little bit different because we don't really have that data. But what we're seeing with when we see that new package come on shelf is that [Indiscernible] improves quite a bit.So, we're really encouraged by our performance there. And we're definitely seeing strong consumer reaction to the new package. And so that will obviously continue to build in the four quarter. And we're also turning on our media right now, advertising the benefits of the package. But then we're also having holiday campaigns starting to run too. So, we feel like there's a lot of good momentum in the pipeline. Obviously, a lot of that will carry into 2024, but we still feel really good about the strength of that part of our business going into the fourth quarter. What's also helping us though is that our core categories are performing a little bit stronger than overall total edible in the grocery store. So, we see continued strength there just from a category standpoint.We have good performance across other core categories like recipe mix, condiments, and sauces. So, we expect pretty good performance there. But there are some categories where we participate along with our food peers, it's probably at a much smaller scale. But these are categories like frozen or the Asian category where we see more volume decline like we've seen in the rest of center of store in that part of our business. That's just one part of it. The portfolio I just gave you some color on that we're seeing definitely the type of softness that you're seeing in other categories. But the fundamental trends have not shifted. Despite this recovery in China being a lot slower, U.S. and Europe are performing as expected. And as you heard in the call, we kind of reaffirmed our guidance on sales despite China, which is meant to indicate that we still see a strength in the performance of our business overall.Andrew Lazar: Great, thanks. I'll pass it on and leave it there. Thanks so much.Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions.Alexia Howard: Good morning, everyone.Brendan Foley: Good morning.Alexia Howard: Can I ask about the market share trends that we're seeing in Americas Consumer? It's obviously been under pressure for some time because of the distribution losses and so on. But I'm wondering if there is light at the end of the tunnel in terms of when either the comparables get easier or innovation helps to turn it around. I'm just wondering what the outlook is there. And then, I have a follow-up.Brendan Foley: Thanks, Alexia. Yeah, I think as we take a look at our performance overall in terms of shares, et cetera, just talking maybe specifically to spices and seasonings, the dollars are a bit tricky because we are seeing private label and our competitors take more price right now in the last couple of months to catch up to the pricing that we've taken in the marketplace. But this is helpful obviously because it starts to close price gaps. And so, I think you're seeing some stronger dollar performance there. But from a unit standpoint, we believe we're performing even better. That lag is even less. And so, as we then look to the pipeline of activities that we have going on, much like I just mentioned on the previous question, whether it's parts of our product line that are really starting to build momentum or distribution that builds momentum, we see a strong pipeline across that part of our portfolio as well as just stronger overall marketing initiatives now that we have really a shared supply across all of our portfolio.So, when we talk about light at the end of the tunnel, we just see sequential improvement over the course of time as we fall back on distribution points, which we've grown this quarter, as well as just the pipeline of activity and renovation that we have across our portfolio. You're seeing a good view of that right now, but there's more to come. And so, we do feel pretty confident about our ability to continue driving sequential improvement, whether it's in spices and seasonings or across other categories.Mike Smith: I think, too, we think some of the same things we've done in Europe, for example, where we had, as we mentioned today, a really good share performance and volume performance in markets like UK and France, which are similar to the U.S. So those types of activities we are doing, whether it's innovation, upgrading, renovating the line, have had success over there too.Alexia Howard: Great, thank you. And just as a quick follow-up. You talked about the free cash flow allowing you to de-lever more quickly than expected. What's your level of appetite for acquisitions next year? And where are the priorities? Is it Consumer? Is it Flavor Solutions? Domestic? International? Just wondering how you're thinking about the pipeline on the M&amp;A side. And I'll pass it on. Thank you.Mike Smith: Alexia, as you said, we're having really good success on our operating cash flow. We're really excited about that. As we said on the call today, we're going to de-lever faster than we thought to get back to our 3 times target. We're always looking at acquisitions. I mean, we have a corporate development team that is always working internally to look at those assets. We have an appetite as part of our long-term growth algorithm. A third of our 4% to 6% long-term growth algorithm is M&amp;A. However, we're still in the process of paying down debt. I think the fourth quarter is our biggest cash flow quarter generally. As we get into next year though, as we get closer to our targets, I think as assets come up that are attractive, whether they're Consumer or Flavor Solutions, U.S., International, we really look for things that don't dilute our sales growth.Our top-line is really important to us. You look at the past with Cholula and FONA and RB, those are the type of assets we really like. Would we like it to be a bit more international? Yes. Flavor Solutions now also is an area where we really like that and look at FONA and Giotti as past acquisitions we're really happy with. So, sorry for the long-winded answer, but I think we're getting back to where we want to be to enter back in the M&amp;A market. And as long as it meets those strategies in both Consumer and Flavor Solutions for attractive assets, we'll be buyers hopefully at the right price.Brendan Foley: But right now, paying down our debt is our priority.Alexia Howard: Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.Operator: Our next question is from the line of Max Gumport with BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your question.Max Gumport: Hey, thanks for the question. A number of your broader U.S. packaged food peers have been talking about value seeking behavior, whether it's moving down to cheaper brands and private label, or channel shifting, or simply buying less units of food. You mentioned some comments earlier about the movement to larger package sizes that you're seeing, but I'm curious if you can talk more broadly about how value seeking behavior is impacting your business, particularly given you're also a large producer of private label spices and seasonings. Thanks very much.Brendan Foley: Thanks for the question. We're seeing value play out through many different types of actions from the consumer. Some are going to larger sizes and we see that quite a bit and as an example of where we're taking an opportunity to continue growing even more quickly. In that part of our portfolio, we're definitely seeing sustainable continued trends towards larger sizes. And what's also interesting about larger sizes, at least in the categories that we have, especially spices and seasonings, is that the purchase rate is still just as fast as it was with a smaller size. So, people are going through when they have it in the household, they're going through a little bit just as fast or more quickly. But the other way value kind of presents itself too is opportunities like this opening price point.With the pricing that's happened in the market, as we talked about before, it created a price pocket that we feel like we needed to fill with a brand like Lowry's. And so that's playing a role in our portfolio that's offering a brand to consumers. And a lot of consumers still prefer brands. And it's allowing them to move towards a brand that's a lower opening price point and fills the need. And we're seeing a lot of success with that too. But the other way we're really talking a lot about value is directly to the consumer, especially if you think about a lot of our communication right now over the past year has been value oriented. And we're talking about the role that our portfolio plays in terms of providing flavor for pennies of serving.And that is really having a positive impact. Plus, a lot of our content is also focusing on how consumers continue to save money by creating, let's say, for example, just larger batch sizes of food so they can have leftovers for a couple nights in a row, or tricks and hacks like that that allow consumers to create even more value and stretch the food dollar even further. That's where we see our category really playing a role in the household, especially during this kind of -- where there's a lot of consumer concern around inflation, our categories are playing a helpful role in that. So, we're looking at it from a number of different angles, but I just illustrated three right there that we are hitting pretty hard during this period of time.Max Gumport: Thanks. Very helpful. I'll pass that along.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.Adam Samuelson: Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone.Mike Smith: Good morning.Brendan Foley: Good morning.Adam Samuelson: Good morning. I guess maybe trying to take Andrew's question in maybe a slightly different kind of light. Brendan, is there any way to help frame the distribution kind of gains that you're seeing and expect to see over the incoming quarters? Any way to quantify kind of how we should think about total distribution growth and where that will peak from a TDP perspective into 2024? It's harder to fully see that expansion in the scanner data. And so, I'm wondering if part of it is growth in certain unmeasured channels or value retailers that aren't captured in Nielsen.Brendan Foley: Well, Adam, just a few things around TDPs. I'm not going to be talking about what to expect in 2024, just -- because we'll talk about that guidance as we look at early next year, but just talking a little bit more about TDP performance. It remains an important area of focus for us, and we've been taking a lot of action to restore distribution, which has really lost the supply over the last one or two years. I think it's an important reminder that about half of those TDP losses are a result of just proactive discontinuations that we made. And those are not likely to be restored. But we are starting to see TDP growth, something which we said would start to come this year in the third quarter. And we believe that performance has improved versus like the previous two quarters of the year.And I would also just share with you that our assortment on shelf now is even more productive than it was versus pre-COVID. So that velocity, those turns that we get on shelf from that assortment there is actually even more productive not only for McCormick, but also for the retailer. So that's something really important to pass along. And we'll start to see more distribution come online as retailers reset their shelves. We're seeing a bit of that happen right now as we speak going into the fourth quarter, but we expect to see even more of that as we go into 2024. So that's one, I think, context around, TDPs and distribution that we think provides context and color. We will continue to accelerate innovation, and that's something that we did in 2023.We'll continue to do that in future fiscal years. That will also build on sort of the TDP momentum and distribution growth that we see. I think those are some of the points that I think that are without calling out a specific TDP number and gain to expect. We continue to see continued improvement, sequential improvement as we look at this over time. And as we mentioned in previous calls, it will take a little bit of time to get it back, but we are still making forward progress on this.Adam Samuelson: Okay, that's helpful. And if I could just ask a separate question on the Flavor Solutions segment. And as you think about some of the different customer types that you have and geographies, how would you frame kind of recent inbound kind of bid activity in RFPs and contract win rates? Are you seeing your customers accelerate their innovation agenda to drive growth in their business? Or is activity levels slowing down? Just any color -- as you think about that pipeline of new business wins, kind of how would you frame that?Brendan Foley: I'd point to our performance in the Americas as an example as to how to think about our current momentum on our flavor business. We had really good sales growth, but we also had some volume growth. And that's an example of what we're seeing not only through our flavors business but also branded foodservice. And we are starting to -- we are growing share in a number of the strong categories that we participate in. We talked about performance nutrition or the health end market. We see it happening there, or even in alcoholic beverages. We have been seeing some nice growth and gains in that part of our business. Is there anything particularly unique at this point in the year versus what it was like earlier in the year?No, I don't think I can point to anything that's terribly unique that we haven't already talked about before, but this has been an element of sort of continued sequential improvement of performance. We've been able to grow a little bit of volume here probably because of the strength of our products and technology that go into the categories we play in. And so that's I think some of the context there. We're happy to be growing share. We believe that we have the right plans. Now if you look at elsewhere within Flavor Solutions, our EMEA business tends to be more heavily weighted towards the QSR part of our customer base. They're not seeing the type of traffic and promotions that they have in, let's say, the prior year. So, we still see a little bit of pressure on overall volumes there.Conversely, in Asia Pacific, our QSR business there is actually doing quite well. Customers are turning back on promotions. They are trying to drive more traffic in their stores. And so, we, as a result, are also seeing some nice volume growth in that part of our portfolio at Flavor Solutions. But dialing back to sort of that flavor part of our category, we are pleased with the performance that we have made so far this year. And it's continued momentum, but nothing that there is a certain new inflection point to share with you.Adam Samuelson: Okay, I appreciate all that color. I'll pass it on. Thanks.Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Pleased proceed with your question.Steve Powers: Hey, great, and good morning. Thank you.Brendan Foley: Good morning, Steve.Mike Smith: Hi, Steve.Steve Powers: Hey. So, I wanted to ask on the incremental gross margin improvement that you see in your outlook this quarter, building on a raise that happened last quarter as well. And just, if you could put a little bit of context and detail around exactly what's driving that incremental gross margin upside? Question number one. Then, question number two is, as we've seen that gross margin tick up over the balance of the year, we haven't seen you change your reinvestment strategy in terms of brand marketing. I just want a little bit of color and context as to why that isn't a source of reinvestment as you do realize that gross margin upside.Mike Smith: Well, thanks, Steve. This is Mike. I'll take that one. I'm surprised it took five questions to get to gross margin, so thanks for asking that question. First of all, we're really pleased with the gross margin performance this year. We've had improvement. We had a strong third quarter. You think about the things we're doing with the cost recovery through our pricing, which we've really been successful at this year. The GOE and CCI commitments we put out at the beginning of the year, we're really happy with our performance there across those segments, that's the other thing. These margin improvements are happening both in the Consumer and Flavor Solutions side, which is really -- which is great. As far as raising for the year, as you know, we've had good performance year-to-date.And even with some of the challenges in China, our strong underlying performance has really held through. So, as to why we wouldn't raise really the A&amp;P spent, I mean, we feel really comfortable where we are from A&amp;P with our current guide. The third quarter was up 8% and it was the highest dollar amount we've ever spent in the third quarter. So, we feel we're very effective there. Actually, CPI is a topic, we get savings across all costs of goods sold, but we get it on SG&amp;A too. And A&amp;P is an area where the teams have gotten real cost savings or efficiencies in our advertising program. So, it's even higher than you see from a dollar perspective. So, I think we're confident where we are in gross margin. We're building back. If you go back to pre-'19 -- pre-COVID in 2019, our gross margins were around 40%.Using our implied guidance this year, gets you around 37%. The interesting thing is if you look at the map on the pricing dilution that has happened, it's been -- it's over 500 basis point headwind to us, which you can see, we're down 300 basis points. So during that time, through CCI and other things, we've captured some of that back, which we continue to see in the future as we get back to those pre-COVID gross margin and operating profit levels.Brendan Foley: Now, Steve, if I could, there was a question in there about A&amp;P too, and just to really kind of build on that. In that, we were up significantly in the third quarter [indiscernible] at 8%, but it was probably our highest historical spend, right? So, we're really putting a lot more in the A&amp;P as we sort of called out, and we'll have a strong level again in the fourth quarter, and these are going into a lot of important campaigns right now. So, I just wanted to reinforce, I think we are seeing still an increase in spend in that part of our -- in that line of the P&amp;L.Steve Powers: Okay. That's great. And so, I guess -- that's helpful. Thank you. And Mike, so just playing back the various puts and takes on gross margin, is it fair to say that the biggest sort of upside surprise for you over the course of the year has just -- has been successful price realization, or are there elements of business mix or other drivers there? Because it feels like the productivity has come in solidly, but roughly in line with, I think, original expectations. Cost inflation hasn't changed materially, so it seems like the buckets has to be pricier, or...Mike Smith: The way I say it, Steve, everything is going to move in the right direction. We were successful getting our cost recovery. We got some pricing earlier as you probably inferred from some of our pricing numbers. So, we got our pricing faster than last year, which was helpful. The GOE and CCI programs, like I said, have met targets. And frankly, we're a bit prudent this year. I think as we said -- as we gave guidance in January after last year, we wanted to make sure we hit our numbers. There was a lot of big assumptions going in into 2023, pricing, GOE program, things like that, and we knew the China -- we were counting on a China recovery which impacts not only gross margin but operating profit. So, we felt at this time after Q3, where we see us spending for the year, we felt it'd be a good line of sight to the commodity cost, things like that too, which gave us the comfort to get there.The other thing, too, is, as you think of it, when Brandon was talking a little bit about the strong -- our underlying performance in things like spices and seasonings, when you look at our performance in other markets, we've had really good portfolio -- really good portfolio mix, and some of the things we're doing on portfolio optimization with pruning low-margin business does help grow these margins also, and will help us as we go into the future.Steve Powers: Yeah. Okay. Very good. Thank you so much.Operator: Our next questions come from the line of Matt Smith with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions.Matt Smith: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question.Brendan Foley: Good morning.Matt Smith: If I could follow up on the margin commentary and the headwind from pricing dilution, as we look at the Flavor Solutions business, you've been making margin recovery progress there. But can you talk about the factors that are keeping the current margin 400 basis points or so below historical levels? And how much of that is the mechanical pricing impact versus other factors? And then, what supports the margin recovery from here?Mike Smith: Yeah, it's a great question, Matt. If you think about it, pre-COVID, we were at 14.5% operating profit, which at the time we were really happy with because we came from a low of around 6% several years before. But we also did acknowledge that as we migrated our portfolio, we had higher aspirations to get higher than that as we migrated to more flavor type products. COVID has been -- and the cost related to that have really been a big challenge to us and a headwind, and also the huge cost increases that have hit Flavor Solutions. So last year, we were at 8%, as you know. This year, we're looking to build back. Year-to-date, we're around 10%. So probably around that for the end of the year. So, 200 basis point improvement this year.Back to your question on dilution, at the operating profit level, we've had about a 300 basis point dilution impact on Flavor Solutions. So theoretically, if that didn't happen, I know it did happen, but that 10% would become 13%. So, we're about 150 basis points short of that pre-COVID-19 margin improvement. And things like we've done with GOE, which we see continuing and wrapping into next year; the dual running costs, we're having it primarily in our Flavor Solutions business in the UK manufacturing facility, that goes away partially next year and the year after it's totally gone, which is great; continued TCI. So, these types of things will get us back to -- and portfolio migration, pruning the low-margin business, we talked about some of the private label foodservice business in the EMEA this call.Those types of things were focused really, really well on getting our margins up. And some of the things when Brandon talks about performance nutrition and beverage, those are the flavor type of items. They're growing faster. We really like those. They can help margin up our whole Flavor Solutions portfolio.Brendan Foley: But we do like the progress we're making independent of price and dilution, just on overall improvement in the margin there. So, we do believe we're moving in the right direction.Matt Smith: Okay, thank you for that. I can pass it on.Mike Smith: Okay. Thanks, Matt.Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.Robert Moskow: Hi, thanks for the question.Mike Smith: Hey, Rob.Brendan Foley: Good morning. Rob.Robert Moskow: Good morning. I wanted to know about the guide -- the implied guide for organic sales growth in fourth quarter. It looks like it's about 3% and that marks a substantial deceleration from the first three quarters. And then even when we try to look at that on a four-year basis, just using like 2019 as the base, it's again, a big decline. We're all looking at the U.S. retail data in Nielsen and IRI, it's all decelerating. Are you taking that into account in your guide? And if so, it sounds a little like a disconnect from the expectations for a very strong holiday season.Mike Smith: Hey, Rob, just to clarify, you just mentioned the word -- number 3%. Our implied guide is in the midpoint is 3.7% to 11.2%, which implies 7.5%.Robert Moskow: I'm just trying to get to your -- I'm just trying to plug in a fourth quarter organic sales number to get to your midpoint of 5% to 7%, 6% for the year.Brendan Foley: Yeah, I think -- Rob, it's Brendan. The things to keep in mind, I think for the fourth quarter, it's our largest quarter. So, we're not able to provide a precise estimate, but I think some broad concepts to consider is we do expect some growth in China in Consumer in the fourth quarter. If you recall, we're lapping over a pretty severe lockdown at that time, this time a year ago overall. We still expect to have a reasonable impact from the DSD discontinuation in the Americas, heavier because it's during the holiday season. We still expect some softness in Flavor Solutions demand that will persist, that will certainly be there, but we will also lap the impact of the Kitchen Basics divestiture, as well as the Consumer business exit in Russia. So those are just some considerations I think when we take a look at fourth quarter sales.Mike Smith: Yeah, I think, Rob, just a follow up on my point before, from a reported basis, our implied fourth quarter guidance is 3.7% at the low end to 11.2%. That includes about a 2% FX favorable, because FX is back-loaded favorable this year. So, constant currency is 5% to 5.5% range. So, I'm not sure where the 3% is coming from for the fourth quarter you mentioned. Make it as a follow-up with Faten and Kasey, we can make sure your model is okay.Robert Moskow: That's fine. So, maybe that answers the question, Mike. So, you're not expecting any kind of decel in U.S. retail conditions in fourth quarter?Brendan Foley: No, in fact -- yeah. We do believe we're having again underlying improvement. We've mentioned this the last few quarters and we continue to progress there.Robert Moskow: Got it. Okay. Thank you.Mike Smith: Okay. Thanks.Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.Rob Dickerson: Great. Thank you so much. I just wanted to ask a question about the renovated SKUs. I think I heard you say in the prepared remarks that -- I think it's 40% of the renovated SKUs, maybe our own shelf. So, maybe just as a reminder, just curious kind of when you think about total SKU selection, it sounds like maybe it's more spice and seasoning, kind of what percent is being renovated? And then kind of what's the feedback so far as to why that's driving velocity? Is it just consumers are more attracted to different packaging or -- it doesn't sound like these are different SKUs. Thanks.Brendan Foley: Thanks for the question. Just to make sure I clarify what we said in the prepared remarks, about 40% of those SKUs are shipping and the SKUs we're talking about is part of our core herbs and spices line. These tend to be those straight fill items, meaning it's a bottle of cumin or a bottle of cinnamon, et cetera, so that's what we're calling those straight fill spices. And we have visibility to the SKUs that are being shipped. It's not as easy to track exactly what has hit shelf yet. And that's really dependent on the retailers' plans. But where we know it has, there's really been an improvement in velocity overall. And one of the drivers of that, just there's a lot of different benefits from this new package.We've talked about it before, but it is nitrogen-flushed, so there's even -- what we're providing there is just greater long-term freshness. Until you open up that package, we're really securing the freshness of that product. There's sort of a nice click and snap with the cap that really kind of tells the consumer, not only just through seeing but also listening, there's a real sort of snap to disclosure that kind of again creates to retain freshness. And the package is 50% post-consumer recycled plastic, so it also has a big sustainability benefit. It just has a great appearance on the shelf overall. And so, we knew that this was a strong packaging innovation because we've launched it in other markets around the world like in EMEA. And also, it's also going out to the Asia Pacific too.So, we have some experience with this package and how it performs. And we're seeing similar, if not better, velocity performance as we get started here on U.S. shelves. So that's a little bit of context around what we're seeing from that renovation in our product line.Mike Smith: Yeah, just to re-emphasize that 40% is really shipped. I mean, if you walk into a store today, it might be 10% of the items or 5% or 20% depending on the stores, but it depends sometimes on their supply chain, too. So, we see like a good tailwind into next year from this too.Rob Dickerson: Got it, Okay. Super. Thanks. And then maybe just quickly and kind of simplistically on SG&amp;A. Q3 you ran for total SG&amp;A about 22% of revenues. Clearly, that's up, but kind of inline-ish, right, relative to maybe the kind of prior four or five years. As we think about Q4 and then I guess kind of going forward, is like 22% of sales, is that kind of fair? Or could there be certain quarter-to-quarter movement? Thanks.Mike Smith: Yeah, I mean third quarter I think was a bit of a high watermark for SG&amp;A. We had a big incentive comp. As we talked about on the call, incentive comp got billed back for a couple reasons. And remember last year's third quarter was way down. So, the incentive comp was getting adjusted then. So, the build back this year was a big part of SG&amp;A on a smaller quarter than the fourth quarter. So, you got to think about it in makable terms too. And really then incentive comp was driven, not only by the EPS improvement, with everyone in the company, which is great. Within our regions, the mix of our regional underlying strength of Americas and EMEA region did drive it a bit more NIV -- excuse me, incentive comp, but also the great working capital performance.And people forget that sometimes, I mean we're an EVA, economic value-added company. We have a working capital charge component of our incentive compensation. So, last year when working capital wasn't great, we all got dinged for it. This year, we are doing great and coming through incentive comp. It is just another reason we are driving cash and those types of activities that help us lever down and things like that, which are really great. So, a bit more of that impact in the third quarter. And then, brand marketing, we mentioned up 8%. So really strong performance there. And for the year, we stick to our guide as low-single digit A&amp;P.Rob Dickerson: And maybe if I could just sneak one last one in. Asia-Pac, clearly understand what you're talking about in terms of just getting a slower China recovery. And I think you called out maybe a few kind of one-off drivers, but maybe it's more EMEA-driven. Kind of net-net, right, Asia-Pac in Consumer, it was still down a quarter, but clearly Asia-Pac in Flavor Solutions is doing better, and I realize, like, part of your China business is in Consumer, but maybe it's still somewhat foodservice. So, I'm just trying to understand kind of the comparison between kind of Asia-Pac Consumer versus Asia-Pac Flavor Solutions, and what's driving the delta? That's all. Thanks.Brendan Foley: Well, appreciate the question there, Rob, on China. It's probably worth unpacking that a little bit. I would say, though, despite the pace of recovery in this business having been slower than expected, we continue to believe in long-term growth trajectory of that business. And it's also when you step back on a constant currency basis, we are growing this business. Versus a year ago, we've grown sales in the high-single digits. So, yeah, we're disappointed that the pace of recovery wasn't what we expected it to be, but nevertheless, we are growing sales year-over-year. And even despite the volatility since 2019, we've grown our total China business at a 3% CAGR on a constant currency basis, which is kind of in line with the long-term algorithm.So, this is really an element of an economy that certainly is recovering more slowly than what we would have expected. And where we see that now, this kind of goes into sort of how we're thinking about Flavor Solutions versus Consumer. And part of that Consumer business is in the foodservice channel, but people are just simply not necessarily going out to a lot of the catering and outside dining events that we've seen in the past, and that's just been a slower recovery overall. We're also seeing that also happening in retail. Consumer spending is just soft right now overall in China, and we're seeing that play out. Where we start to see -- and this is actually more of a change in this quarter, just more of the typical promotional activity or limited time offers that we tend to see in the QSR segment have begun to come back a little bit more.So that gives us some reason to believe that this is just a slower recovery than what we planned, but the fundamentals that drive that business are still there and it's just going to take a little bit more time to get back to what we expect from this part of our business.Rob Dickerson: All right. Super. Thanks so much.Operator: Thank you. We've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call over to Faten Freiha for closing remarks.Faten Freiha: Thank you all for joining today's call.

This company, which is in the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.When looking at the last two reports, this company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 6.03%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the last reported quarter, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc came out with earnings of $3.36 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.31 per share, representing a surprise of 1.51%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $3.60 per share and it actually produced earnings of $3.98 per share, delivering a surprise of 10.56%.For The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc has an Earnings ESP of +1.66% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on October 13, 2023.When the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: American Water Works Co. Inc. AWK, Vistra Corp. VST, Pinnacle West Capital Corp. PNW, OGE Energy Corp. OGE and The Southern Co. SO.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:Add These 5 Utilities to Your Portfolio for Long-Term GainsVolatility has reappeared on Wall Street since August as U.S. stock markets have been witnessing a reversal of the impressive bull run in the first seven months of this year. Markets may remain volatile in the near future. Wall Street is currently in a “Catch 22 situation.”Weak economic data will indicate that the Fed’s aggressive interest rate hike policy for one and half years has started bearing fruits. On the other hand, this will also indicate a slowdown in economic activities.At this stage, it should be prudent to invest in defensive stocks like utilities with a favorable Zacks Rank to strengthen your portfolio. Out of the 11 broad sectors of the S&amp;P 500 Index, the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) suffered the most in 2023 as market participants’ thrust shifted from defensive to growth/momentum stocks. Year to date, XLU has plunged 19.5%. This also indicates that utility stocks are currently available at an attractive valuation.Utilities Immune to Vagaries of Economic Cycle   The Utilities sector is mature and fundamentally strong as demand for such services is generally immune to the changes in the economic cycle. Such companies provide basic services like electricity, gas, water and telecommunications, which are always in demand.Consequently, adding stocks from the utility basket usually lends more stability to a portfolio in an uncertain market condition. Moreover, the sector is known for the stability and visibility of its earnings and cash flows.  Stable earnings enable utilities to pay out consistent dividends that make them more attractive to income-oriented investors.Story continuesUtility companies enjoy a reputation for being safe given the regulated nature of their business. This lends their revenues a high level of certainty. These companies also benefit from the domestic orientation of their business, which shields them from foreign currency translation issues.Additionally, utilities are generally low-beta stocks (beta &gt;0 but &lt;1). At this stage, investment in low-beta stocks with a high dividend yield and a favorable Zacks Rank may be the best option.If the market’s northbound journey is reestablished, the favorable Zacks Rank of these stocks will capture the upside potential. However, if the market’s downturn continues, low-beta stocks will minimize portfolio losses and dividend payments will act as a regular income stream.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five low-beta utility stocks that are regular dividend payers. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions within the last 60 days and have good potential for the rest of 2023 and 2024. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.American Water Works Co. Inc. is gaining from the implementation of new water systems and contributions from military contracts. Investments to upgrade its infrastructure will allow AWK to provide quality services to its expanding customer base. AWK continues to expand operations through organic and inorganic initiatives. Cost management is boosting margins. Our model projects an increase in revenues for the 2023-2025 period.American Water Works Co. has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 2.6% and 6.6%, respectively, for next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last 60 days.  AWK has a beta of 0.60 and a current dividend yield of 2.42%.Vistra Corp. operates as an integrated retail electricity and power generation company.

183,546ecba4-9d37-32d4-87da-1df313700371,PNW,2023-10-06,Add These 5 Utilities to Your Portfolio for Long-Term Gains,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/add-5-utilities-portfolio-long-120300745.html,1696507380,STORY,"['AWK', 'VST', 'PNW', 'OGE', 'SO']","[Volatility has reappeared on Wall Street since August as U.S. stock markets have been witnessing a reversal of the impressive bull run in the first seven months of this year. Markets may remain volatile in the near future. Wall Street is currently in a “Catch 22 situation.”Weak economic data will indicate that the Fed’s aggressive interest rate hike policy for one and half years has started bearing fruits. On the other hand, this will also indicate a slowdown in economic activities.At this stage, it should be prudent to invest in defensive stocks like utilities with a favorable Zacks Rank to strengthen your portfolio. Out of the 11 broad sectors of the S&amp;P 500 Index, the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) suffered the most in 2023 as market participants’ thrust shifted from defensive to growth/momentum stocks. Year to date, XLU has plunged 19.5%. This also indicates that utility stocks are currently available at an attractive valuation.Utilities Immune to Vagaries of Economic Cycle   The Utilities sector is mature and fundamentally strong as demand for such services is generally immune to the changes in the economic cycle. Such companies provide basic services like electricity, gas, water and telecommunications, which are always in demand.Consequently, adding stocks from the utility basket usually lends more stability to a portfolio in an uncertain market condition. Moreover, the sector is known for the stability and visibility of its earnings and cash flows.  Stable earnings enable utilities to pay out consistent dividends that make them more attractive to income-oriented investors.Utility companies enjoy a reputation for being safe given the regulated nature of their business. This lends their revenues a high level of certainty. These companies also benefit from the domestic orientation of their business, which shields them from foreign currency translation issues.Additionally, utilities are generally low-beta stocks (beta &gt;0 but &lt;1). At this stage, investment in low-beta stocks with a high dividend yield and a favorable Zacks Rank may be the best option.Story continuesIf the market’s northbound journey is reestablished, the favorable Zacks Rank of these stocks will capture the upside potential. However, if the market’s downturn continues, low-beta stocks will minimize portfolio losses and dividend payments will act as a regular income stream.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five low-beta utility stocks that are regular dividend payers. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions within the last 60 days and have good potential for the rest of 2023 and 2024. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Of this cohort, Wedbush's work showed average student loan debt balances ranging from $0 to $50,000.Read more: Worried about when student loan repayments resume? These programs could helpThe Grinch balloon passes by windows of a building on Central Park West during Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York Thursday, Nov. 23, 2017. (Craig Ruttle/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)The categories that were most often cited as areas for spending pullbacks were restaurants, apparel, and electronics.Some of the most at-risk retailers from any spending slowdown are discretionary names such as Williams-Sonoma (WSM), Wayfair (W), and Best Buy (BBY) Nikic said.The restart of payments — after a crushing blow in June to President Biden's plan to forgive up to $20,000 in debt for millions of borrowers — has put the crippling amount of student debt on the books of many households back into the spotlight.The total amount of student debt in the US tallies a bloated $1.8 trillion, per the most recent data from the Federal Reserve. Student loan debt levels have tripled since 2008.An estimated 43 million people in the US have some amount of outstanding student loan debt, so a wide swath of the population could be poised to rein in consumption into year-end.Data from the Federal Reserve estimates that the typical student loan payment ranges from $200 to $299 a month. US consumers could now end up making an incremental $120 billion of student loan payments annually, estimates Nikic.Nikic's research computes that if consumers need to spend an incremental $120 billion annually on student loan payments, it could wipe off 2.5% of the total $5 trillion in discretionary spending done annually.That's brutal news for retailers still contending with high merchandise inflation, rampant theft, and a shift to demand for services.Story continues""With consumers now needing to divert some of their monthly income towards student loan payments, there is risk that this could 'crowd out' other spending items,"" Nikic explained. ""Furthermore, this comes at a time when U.S. consumers are increasingly feeling pressures from a variety of sources, including waning pandemic savings, rising gas prices, record-high credit card debt, and a continued normalization of spending on services vs. goods. Thus, these factors could combine to weigh on a variety of companies, including retailers of discretionary goods.""A customer pays for shoes with cash in a store at a shopping center during Black Friday sales, in Caracas, Venezuela, Nov. 25, 2022. (Leonardo Fernandez Viloria/REUTERS) (Leonardo Fernandez Viloria / reuters)In fact, discretionary retailers may be seeing the first round of effects that Nikic discussed.Macy's (M) said its second quarter credit card sales tanked 36% from the prior year to $150 million. Department store rival Nordstrom (JWN) voiced that it's seeing a similar trend.Interest on student loans began accruing once again on Sept. 1 after several COVID-related pauses.Read more: Can you pay student loans with a credit card?The rise in credit card payment delinquencies and weak credit sales prompted BofA to slash its profit estimates on both Macy's and Nordstrom last week.In turn, investors continue to approach shares of discretionary retailers cautiously into the start of the holiday shopping season.The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLY) has shed 7% in the past three months, worse than the 4.5% decline in the S&amp;P 500. Shares of Macy's and Nordstrom are down 32% and 30%, respectively, over the same stretch. Kohl's (KSS) is off by 23% while Target (TGT) has declined by 22%.Another new survey out this week from Morgan Stanley's Jeffrey Adelson found that only 24% of student borrowers can make their full monthly payment without reducing spending. That is down from 29% just three months ago.About 50% of student debt borrowers intend to begin paying their loans this month, meaning consumers' cash flows are getting ""tighter,"" Adelson pointed out.""Consumers are having an incrementally harder time making ends meet over the past several months,"" Adelson said.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

185,10e0b18a-8b16-32a5-a474-80d6b6acfdc5,TGT,2023-10-06,What’s behind the reports of ‘unprecedented’ retail theft,FreightWaves,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/behind-reports-unprecedented-retail-theft-110000099.html,1696503600,STORY,['TGT'],"[Target will close nine stores in urban locales like Seattle and San Francisco in October. The mega-chain says it's because of theft. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Marc Heath has worked in retail fraud prevention for more than three decades. He’s not used to hearing executives of mega-retailers discuss his line of work in earnings calls or on cable news. That’s changed since 2020. The last few years have made commonplace the once-niche term of “retail shrink,” which refers to products lost to internal or external theft, supply chain snafus or simply “unknown” causes.Big brands like Walmart and CVS have taken on unusual, costly tactics to combat this theft. Others have blamed retail theft as a key reason why sales have slumped. And the National Retail Foundation, a key industry group, is lobbying Congress to pass a bill that would devote more federal funds for combating organized retail crime.Most recently, Target announced it would close nine stores in four states “because theft and organized retail crime are threatening the safety of our team and guests, and contributing to unsustainable business performance.”“I’ve seen [retail theft become] more newsworthy,” said Heath, who is the CEO and founder of a Boston-based security company. “People are talking about it, especially senior operations people during their conference calls. They’re actually mentioning shrink and how it’s impacting the business.”Still, some aren’t entirely convinced the retail theft is really that bad. Industry data on the problem is hard to solidify, and it hasn’t exactly shown a massive upswing in shrink either. Others say retail theft, while certainly an issue, might be overstated as an excuse to write off mediocre sales — or harebrained strategy shifts. What’s more, historic inflation (from which, of course, mega-brands have benefited) might be a key reason why we’re seeing any theft bump at all.Despite cheery news from some commenters, the American consumer is struggling — as revealed by credit card loan delinquency rates. Delinquencies increased year over year by 50.88% in April. That’s the starkest increase we’ve seen since the Great Recession. (Chart: FreightWaves SONAR)While it’s fun and easy to come to a conclusion based on a gut reaction, let’s explore some of the reasons why the retail theft story isn’t quite as clear as it seems.Industry data doesn’t reveal an utterly astounding increase in overall shrinkA 2023 report from the National Retail Foundation, the leading retail trade association, surveyed 177 retail brands about their experiences with shrink. The rate of inventory lost to shrink increased from 1.4% in 2021 to a whopping … 1.6% in 2022.Story continuesOK, maybe your jaw is not thoroughly dropped. But the NRF pointed out that that 0.2 percentage point increase represents an uptick from $93.9 billion in 2021 to $112.1 billion in 2022. This is a 19.3% increase.External thefts accounted for about 36% of total shrink, the biggest category. As the report noted, that percentage is much higher for, say, convenience stores than, say, Tiffany &amp; Co., where everything is under a lock and key (although quite a few convenience stores nowadays are that way too).There’s plenty of theft that’s likely not captured as well. The NRF said the majority of respondents do not count e-commerce goods loss or supply chain loss in their shrink numbers. (Don’t worry, we will talk more about supply chain later …)The level of violence accompanying theft is concerning for retailersDavid Johnston, the vice president of asset protection and retail operations for the NRF, told FreightWaves in an interview that the current scale of theft is “unprecedented” in his 37 years in asset protection. What’s particularly unusual is that these crimes are just getting more violent, according to Jonathan Gold, who is the NRF’s vice president of supply chain and customs policy.“We’re hearing stories of these gangs of folks that go in and bust up the store and take everything,” Gold said. “They’re coming in with bear spray, pepper spray, they’re setting fires in stores to create a distraction.”Such blatant thefts go beyond, say, teens shoplifting for fun or even a desperate theft of a few essentials. Gold said missing inventory is often stolen en masse then sold online. Federal investigators say these organized groups are also involved in drug trafficking, human trafficking and even terrorism.Those sweet, pre-plexiglass days at the drugstore. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Heath said the violence is so bad that it’s sometimes no longer even sensible to recommend employees — or even on-duty security guards — to apprehend thieves. After all, merchandise can be replaced and evidence can be collected to potentially catch the criminal at a later state.“It’s not worth anybody’s safety or life, no matter what the impact is,” Heath said. “I think people understand that, but I also understand that the people that are stealing understand that they could get away with it.”The NRF hasn’t solidified any data around increased rates of organized retail theft or what percentage of external theft is organized crime. Retailers aren’t required to break down how much they actually lose to theft. This lack of solid data is especially important now that the NRF is campaigning for more federal spending to combat the issue. (CNBC’s Gabrielle Fonrouge broke that down in this August article, which I recommend giving a read.)Is this just excushrinkage?Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData Retail, said retail theft is a real issue. But he also noted that it’s a very convenient excuse for, well, maybe not the best business choices.Take Target’s store closures, for example. Saunders pointed out that Target says shrink is up but won’t specify how much of that is because of crime or simply pallets gone missing.“We all know that Target is not always the best at managing supply chains,” Saunders said. “We all know Target has a lot of out of stocks and various issues. We all know it has a much more complex multichannel operation than it used to and it’s much easier to lose things.”If Target said the fault was due to its omnichannel and not a looming, outside, societal issue, investors might not be as forgiving.“Theft is the ultimate excuse because it’s like, ‘Hey, look, it’s not our problem,’” Saunders said. “‘We try to prevent this but people come in and steal things.’”S&amp;P Global Ratings retail analysts said in a note that some retailers may be “overstating the contribution of theft this year.” Poor merchandise execution and inventory management could also be major contributors to the uptick in shrink.Drilling deeper into Target’s nine urban store closings, Saunders said it’s likely that other factors were at play in addition to theft. A key one is the fact that the urban store model is somewhat out of Target’s wheelhouse. The average basket size of a suburban big-box location is going to be much larger than a city one, where customers can’t load up their trunks with impulse buys galore. The impulse buys in a New York City Target must be limited to what you can carry home (or hastily stash in an Uber).The NRF experts told FreightWaves that employee safety being at risk is an undeniable reason to shutter any retail location. A Target spokesperson declined to answer specific FreightWaves questions on shoplifting and the company’s business strategy. He highlighted a Sept. 26 press release for more information.Costco says it’s managed to avoid some of the shrink challenges that its big-box competitors have seen. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)There are ways to defeat theft, as retailers like Lowe’s and Costco have found. Obviously, both have their advantages; it’s hard to steal, say, a massive trundle of plywood from a Lowe’s and Costco is members only.Brandon Rael, a retail operations consultant, told FreightWaves the retailers winning against shoplifting have something else in common, though: They just have good shopping experiences. That means no items locked behind plexiglass and human cashiers. That also probably means significantly more employees per square foot.“Having spent my entire adult life in retail, at every level, the one thing that I understand clearly is that the greatest deterrent for any theft activity is effective customer service and making sure that you have the right type of merchandising display,” Lowe’s CEO Marvin Ellison said at a recent investors conference.Increased theft might just be a result of our current economic climateWhile some chunk of these increased thefts may be because of the rise in terrifying-sounding organized retail crime, another is likely simply because things have become too expensive. We’re in an economy right now where some everyday staples have risen in price six times faster than the overall rate of inflation. Until July of this year, American paychecks grew at a slower rate than inflation as a whole.That applies to consumers and the actual workers of any retailer. The second largest contributor to retail shrink is, after all, internal theft. Associates of big-box retailers have increasingly challenging jobs (partially thanks to, well, having to deal with apprehending shoplifters).One Vox article from August depicts that well. Here’s one particularly jarring snippet:Over 7.3 million retail workers quit last year; one consulting firm reported a 75 percent turnover rate last year for hourly in-store positions, while a 2023 US News ranking of 190 jobs put retail salespeople at the very bottom. Sean Vanatta, an economic and social historian at the University of Glasgow, agreed.“You can see the way the retail economy has developed in the last 30 years has really focused on driving down labor costs,” Vanatta said. “It’s your workers who are also your consumers. That, then, is the core issue. If you’re not paying people enough to shop at your stores, what other options are they going to have? If the solution is always cut wages and bring in more police, what kind of society are you going to end up with?”Oh, there’s a trucking angle tooIncreasingly complex supply chains have made retail shrink more broadly a problem.One particularly sensitive area of theft along the supply chain, the NRF said, is when truck drivers are waiting at warehouses to be loaded or unloaded.

186,c43dcee8-ce32-352f-98f5-9339dc408667,ISRG,2023-10-06,15 Stocks Dumb Money’s Steve Cohen Is Betting On Now,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-stocks-dumb-money-steve-192850308.html,1696534130.0,STORY,"['ISRG', 'META', 'BSX', 'TTWO', 'D', 'ZBH', 'DELL', 'TSM', 'LW', 'AZO']","[Billionaire Steve Cohen, a prominent figure and founder of the Point72 Asset Management, has accumulated an estimated fortune of nearly $20 billion through a high-risk/high-reward strategy. Despite negative market trends in 2022, Point72 Asset Management produced a net gain of 10.3%, netting Steve Cohen $1.7 billion in gains. Cohen is also featured in the biographical movie ""Dumb Money,"" which details the famous GameStop short squeeze. In the film, Cohen and other big Wall Street names like Melvin Capital Management founder Gabe Plotkin are shown as being big investors who are shorting meme stocks sitting in pandemic hideouts while retail investors gathered on social media platforms to boost meme stocks that were shorted by them. In the movie, the hedge fund managers doubt the knowledge of retail investors. In one scene, when the fictional Cohen and Plotkin discover the videos promoting GameStop on Reddit, the fictional Plotkin questions their credibility, saying ""Retail traders always lose.” Meanwhile, the Cohen character responded, “Guess these guys have decided to ignore all of the obvious secular trends."" “Or are they...illiterate?"". It appears that Steve Cohen's high-risk/high-reward strategy has helped his firm make significant gains so far in 2023, given that Point72's $33 billion stock portfolio is heavily weighted towards high-growth tech, consumer discretionary, and communication companies, which were the best performers in the first half of 2023. At a private SALT conference event, Dumb Money's Steve Cohen suggested investors bet on the ""big wave"" of artificial intelligence rather than focusing on a recession. He emphasized that focusing too much on the likelihood of a recession may cause investors to overlook AI investment opportunities. Among the AI stocks in which Cohen's firm invested heavily in the second quarter were NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE). Point72 increased its stake in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) by 306% to $1.8 billion, while boosting its stakes in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) by 68% and 52%, respectively. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL), Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) are among the other AI stocks that Dumb Money's Steve Cohen is betting on now.Story continues""I'm making a prognostication — we're going up,"" he said, according to Bloomberg. ""I'm actually pretty bullish.""Aside from heavily investing in AI stocks, billionaire Steve Cohen has taken advantage of the volatility in healthcare and energy stocks during the second quarter. For instance, his firm significantly lifted its stake in Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D) by 151%, Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) by 96%, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) by 119% and Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (ZBH) by 120%. MethodologyAs Steve Cohen is one of the most prominent investors and founder of one of the world’s largest hedge funds, paying attention to Point72 Asset Management’s stock portfolio can help investors choose the right stocks. The following information is based on Point72 Asset Management’s second-quarter 13F filing. We track hedge funds like Bridgewater Associates because Insider Monkey research has shown that their consensus stock picks can deliver exceptional returns.15 Stocks Dumb Money’s Steve Cohen Is Betting On Now 15. Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D)Value of Point72 Asset Management’s 13F Position: $185 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 27Dumb Money's Steve Cohen used the selloff in Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D) stock price as a buying opportunity during the second quarter, increasing his stake in the company by 151%. Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D) operates in four segments: Dominion Energy Virginia, Gas Distribution, Dominion Energy South Carolina, and Contracted Assets. Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D) appears to be undervalued due to its low valuations and an expectation of sustainable earnings growth in the coming years. Its stock is currently trading at about 12 times forward earnings, compared to the sector median of 15 times. Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D) also offers a healthy over 6% dividend yield. According to Insider Monkey data, Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D) was in 27 hedge fund portfolios at the end of the second quarter. Diamond Hill Capital and Citadel Investment Group were the leading stakeholders in Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D). 14. Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX)Value of Point72 Asset Management’s 13F Position: $188.8 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 71Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) is one of the 15 stocks Dumb Money's Steve Cohen is betting on now. Steve Chohen's strategy of increasing his stake in Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) by 96% during the second quarter appears to be working, as the healthcare equipment provider's share price has soared in recent months, thanks to strong financial growth trends. Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) reported net sales of $3.5 billion in the second quarter, representing an 11% increase over the prior year period. Its GAAP net earnings per share of $0.18 rose from $0.17 per share a year ago.Baron Funds, an investment management firm, expressed confidence in Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) in its second-quarter investor letter because of its ability to grow revenue in the high single digits and earnings per share in the double digits. Here is what the firm stated Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX):“We re-established a position in Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX), a global developer, manufacturer, and marketer of medical devices that are used in a broad range of interventional medical specialties. We believe Boston Scientific can grow revenue reliably in the high single digits, driven by differentiated products in electrophysiology and structural heart. Coupled with cost discipline and over 50 basis points of annual operating margin expansion, we believe the company’s double-digit EPS growth profile makes Boston Scientific a compelling name within the large medical device universe.Within electrophysiology, we think Boston Scientific is well positioned as a leader in the emerging field of pulsed field ablation (PFA). Traditionally, physicians have used temperature-based methods (either hot or cold) to disable heart tissue responsible for irregular heartbeats. Temperature-based methods may damage surrounding tissue, however. Examples include damaging the esophagus (food tube) and the phrenic nerve (which controls breathing). PFA, in comparison, relies on electricity to damage aberrant tissue, and because different types of tissue have different electrical thresholds, the surrounding tissue can be selectively spared. Boston Scientific is ahead of the pack with high-quality, randomized controlled trial data (Advent) to come out in the back half of 2023. Electrophysiology is an $8 billion market growing 12%, and we believe Boston Scientific can grow significantly above this market rate as it takes share with its PFA program.Within structural heart, we like Boston Scientific’s position within left atrial appendage closure, which is a procedure that lowers stroke risk for atrial fibrillation patients. The company’s Watchman device continues to maintain dominant share (over 90%), and this is a $1 billion market growing over 25%. We are most excited about the potential for Watchman to expand into first-line therapy: currently patients would only get a Watchman if they cannot take anticoagulants because of bleeding risk; Boston Scientific is running the CHAMPION-AF trial to support Watchman as the first option. It has completed enrollment, and if the trial is successful, the company believes this has the potential to more than triple the addressable patients by 2027.”13.

Shares increased after Intuitive reported strong first-quarter financial results highlighted by a 26% increase in procedures and raised guidance for 2023.

During the quarter, the company reported earnings that showed a return to growth and healthy user engagement metrics. Most importantly, profitability appears to have stabilized and is poised to improve as significant cost reduction actions implemented over the past six months begin to have an impact. Separate from fundamental performance, there is excitement over AI’s potential to help the company’s business. While Meta’s technology prowess and massively scaled media platform certainly position the company to take advantage of AI, we believe it’s far too early to estimate any discrete tangible benefits. Overall, we view AI as one of several drivers that will contribute to Meta’s continued growth.”6. AutoZone, Inc.

(NASDAQ:ISRG) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical Is Intuitive Surgical Fairly Valued?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.19bUS$2.66bUS$2.59bUS$3.15bUS$3.41bUS$3.62bUS$3.80bUS$3.96bUS$4.10bUS$4.23bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 8.05%Est @ 6.28%Est @ 5.04%Est @ 4.17%Est @ 3.57%Est @ 3.14% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2% US$2.1kUS$2.4kUS$2.2kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$24bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.2b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.2%– 2.2%) = US$108bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$108b÷ ( 1 + 6.2%)10= US$59bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$83b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$290, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Intuitive Surgical as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Intuitive SurgicalStrengthCurrently debt free.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.ThreatRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a premium to intrinsic value?

The S&amp;P 500, which monitors the performance of the largest U.S.-listed companies, closed with a 4% decline, primarily due to substantial setbacks in both August and September.The market landscape grew increasingly worrisome as the Federal Reserve issued a warning about a looming 25 basis point rate hike by the year-end, signifying a prolonged period of elevated interest rates aimed at combating persistent inflation. This led to a significant selloff across major U.S. equity indices, all occurring against the backdrop of the enduring Russia-Ukraine conflict.Given the potential for sustained volatility in markets, astute investors are turning their attention to stocks demonstrating relative price strength. In this uncertain environment, the strategy of identifying and investing in promising opportunities is prudent, allowing investors to navigate the turbulent waters of the financial markets.Relative Price Strength StrategyEarnings growth and valuation multiples are indeed important for investors to determine a stock's ability to offer considerable returns. But these are also essential for determining whether a stock’s price performance is better than its peers or the industry average. If a stock’s performance is lacking that of the broader groups, despite impressive earnings growth or valuation multiples, then something must be wrong.It’s always advisable to stay away from these stocks and bet on those that are outperforming their respective industry or benchmark. This is because betting on a winner always proves to be lucrative. Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&amp;P 500 for 1 to 3 months at least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy.Finally, it is crucial to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings of these companies. In order to do this, we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter’s (Q1) earnings to our screen. When a stock undergoes an upward revision, it leads to additional price gains.Story continuesScreening ParametersRelative % Price change – 12 weeks greater than 0Relative % Price change – 4 weeks greater than 0Relative % Price change – 1 week greater than 0(We have considered those stocks that have been outperforming the S&amp;P 500 over the last 12 weeks, four weeks and one week.)% Change (Q1) Est. over 4 Weeks greater than 0: Positive current-quarter estimate revisions over the last four weeks.Zacks Rank equal to 1: Only Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks — that have returned more than 26% annually over the last 26 years and surpassed the S&amp;P 500 in 23 of the last 26 years — can get through.

HOOD.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:4 Cryptocurrency Stocks in Focus After a Volatile SummerWall Street had a solid run in the first seven months of the year before the rally came to a halt in August. Markets have since been volatile as inflation remains stubbornly high. This has made the Fed hint at another quarter percentage point interest rate hike this year. Moreover, the Fed also said that the higher interest rates are likely to continue for a longer period.Also, the central bank cut its rate cut forecast to two from four, which won’t come before September 2024. Higher interest rates negatively affect high-growth sectors like technology, consumer discretionary and cryptocurrencies.The Fed’s hawkish stance came as a major setback for the cryptocurrency market. Cryptocurrencies that made a solid turnaround this year after an unimpressive 2023 have also been suffering lately.Bitcoin ReboundsAugust and September have been particularly unimpressive for cryptocurrencies as the Fed’s hawkish stance saw treasury yields soar to multi-year highs. This has been taking a toll on all major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE).However, Bitcoin started October on a high as its price hit a four-week high. Bitcoin jumped 3% to $27,921 on Oct 2 after trading above the $28,000 mark for most of the session, its highest level since Aug 17. Also, Ethereum crossed the $1,700 mark on the same day before giving up most of its gains.Understandably, after a dull August and September, October is also expected to remain volatile as investors remain concerned about a slowing economy.Story continuesOther Factors Pose ChallengesInflation continues to be stubbornly high despite a sharp decline over the past year and much above the Fed’s target of 2%. To make things worse, crude oil prices have been rising over the past month.Crude oil prices reached their highest settlement level for the year in the last week of September.

V is well poised to grow on the back of higher payments, cross-border volumes and processed transactions. The steady cross-border travel and data processing growth will continue to aid its performance.Headquartered in San Francisco, Visa is a global payments technology mammoth. It has a market cap of $426 billion. Over the year-to-date period, shares of the company have gained 11.3%, outperforming the industry’s 8.4% rise. Courtesy of solid prospects, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock is worth adding to your portfolio at the moment.Let’s delve deeper.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for V’s current-year earnings is pegged at $8.65 per share, which indicates 15.3% year-over-year growth. The estimate remained stable over the past week. Visa beat on earnings in all the last four quarters, the average surprise being 5.2%.Visa Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseVisa Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseVisa Inc. price-eps-surprise | Visa Inc. QuoteThe consensus mark for current-year revenues stands at $32.6 billion, indicating 11.2% growth from a year ago. Our estimates for service revenues and data processing revenues indicate an 11.5% and 10.2% increase from a year ago, respectively, which will likely support its top-line growth.We expect fiscal 2023 processed transactions to rise more than 10% year over year. The company’s growing network is expected to boost volumes. We expect total payment volume to rise nearly 6% year over year. It strikes numerous partnerships to boost the usage of its network and technology.Its investments in technology are further boosting its already leading position in the payments market. This helps the company to minimize the impact of fraud, and protect consumer and merchant information. This is of huge importance as digital payment methods are rapidly gaining popularity.With the growing digitalization of economies, Visa’s technological prowess allows it to forge partnerships with countries and governments. These partnerships will position the company for long-term growth. Its ability to innovate and create financial products tailored to clients’ and customers’ needs is commendable.Story continuesHowever, there are a few factors that investors should keep an eye on. For example, the Credit Card Competition Act, a bipartisan bill, was reintroduced in both the House and the Senate in June with additional co-sponsors. The proposed measure will likely raise competition through the usage of alternative credit card processing networks. Also, the company’s rising expenses are concerning. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive its growth in the long term.Visa’s strong financial position with a healthy balance sheet and free cash flow generating ability enables it to make acquisitions, invest for long-term growth opportunities and boost shareholders’ value. It rewarded $3.9 billion to shareholders via share buybacks and dividends in the June quarter. As of Jun 30, 2023, the company had authorized funds of $8.8 billion remaining under its share buyback program.Other Top-Ranked PlayersSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services space are Shift4 Payments, Inc. FOUR, FirstCash Holdings, Inc. FCFS and Paysafe Limited PSFE. While Shift4 Payments currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), FirstCash and Paysafe carry a Zacks Rank #2 each. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Shift4 Payments’ current-year bottom line suggests 100.7% year-over-year growth. Based in Allentown, PA, FOUR beat earnings estimates in all the past four quarters, with an average surprise of 21.9%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FirstCash’s current-year earnings indicates a 6.7% year-over-year gain. Fort Worth, TX-based FCFS beat earnings estimates in all the past four quarters, with an average surprise of 7.3%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Paysafe’s current-year bottom line implies a 5.8% year-over-year rise.

The size of the delivery is enough to fill around 45 Panamax-size vessels.""We think Wilmar has already sold most, or even all, of that volume,"" said the first trader.""And China bought around 1.2 to 1.5 million tonnes.""The second trader estimated Wilmar' sales to China at around 1 million tons.""They sold it cheaper to have a large book,"" he said, indicating the Singapore-based trader will make a profit due to the very large volume.The fresh Chinese buying comes days after the country decided to resume sales of its sugar reserves - the first time it does it since 2016 - as stocks internally were running low and prices were high.Traders and analysts said that a combination of several factors led to the large delivery, including the record Brazilian crop, elevated interest rates and the reduced premium between the October and the March contracts at ICE.Story continues""With current interest rates, carrying sugar nowadays costs a lot of money,"" the second trader said, referring to the costs of storage and hedging.LOGISTICSIt will be a challenging logistic operation for Wilmar and the delivering parties, the traders said, as the rainy season is starting in the South American country and that can delay loading.A total of six commodities traders decided to deliver the sugar, including China's COFCO, Louis Dreyfus Co, Sucden and Viterra.According to ICE rules, deliverers have to bring the sugar to the ports, and the receiver needs to nominate the vessel.The second source said Wilmar has nominated the first six vessels this week. Most of the loading will take place in Santos and Paranagua ports.""This massive delivery shall create huge lineups with big waiting times in Oct-Nov when sugar vessels still compete with the grain exports and are also exposed to eventual delays related to the rainy season,"" said sugar analyst Claudiu Covrig.(Reporting by Marcelo Teixeira; Editing by Marguerita Choy)]"

(MAR): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-marriott-international-130011930.html,1696510811,STORY,['MAR'],"[Marriott International (MAR) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this hotel company have returned -3.8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -5.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Hotels and Motels industry, which Marriott falls in, has lost 5.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Marriott is expected to post earnings of $2.09 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +23.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4%.The consensus earnings estimate of $8.63 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +29%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.56 indicates a change of +10.7% from what Marriott is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Marriott is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Marriott, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $5.91 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +11.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $23.93 billion and $25.37 billion estimates indicate +15.2% and +6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMarriott reported revenues of $6.08 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.8%. EPS of $2.26 for the same period compares with $1.80 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.05 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.46%. The EPS surprise was +3.2%.Over the last four quarters, Marriott surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Marriott is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Marriott. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

They operate in an essential industry with high barriers to entry, owing to the significant capital expenditure required for infrastructure and network maintenance.At the same time, the recurring revenue model — where consumers pay monthly for services — ensures a consistent cash flow.As a result, established industry players can pay generous dividends to shareholders.Don't Miss:Warren Buffett once said, ""If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.""

Now you have an opportunity to invest in a startup that allows you to turn your phone usage into passive income.For instance, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) is one of the biggest players in the telecom arena, generating $136.8 billion in revenue in 2022. The company also has a track record of paying dividends consistently and increasing them over time.In the first half of 2023, Verizon paid shareholders $5.5 billion in dividends.Last month, the company's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 66.5 cents per share, representing a 1.9% increase from its previous payout. This marked Verizon's 17th consecutive annual dividend hike.At the current share price, the new dividend rate translates to an annual yield of 8.4%.Collecting Dividends From VerizonVerizon follows a quarterly distribution schedule. If you want to collect $1,000 per month from the company, you are looking at $3,000 per quarter. And that means you would need to own 4,511.28 shares of the company. This is calculated by dividing the $3,000 by the per-share quarterly payout of $0.665.Story continuesAnd because Verizon currently trades at $31.54 per share, 6,542.45 shares would mean about $142,286 worth of the stock.If you aim for a smaller target of earning $200 per month — or $600 per quarter — you would need 902.26 shares ($600/$0.665) or $28,457 worth of Verizon stock (902.26 x $31.54).Despite the company's solid dividend growth track record, shares can still be volatile.

With reports of interrupted service on the rise, Tom grabbed his hunting gear – a specialized RF signal finder – and went to work to identify and eliminate the interference for his customers.Radio waves ride over spectrum (think of spectrum like lanes on a highway in the sky), and the US government grants licenses to ensure people are using those lanes of spectrum for their intended purpose. From time to time, unauthorized RF signals appear in licensed spectrum bands and interfere with the operations in those bands. (To build on the analogy - it would be the equivalent of driving in the wrong lane and holding up the traffic that should be there.) The result? Signal interference and an inability for customers nearby to use their wireless devices.Enter Verizon RF Hunters.When these unauthorized stray interference signals appear, our RF Hunters, maniacal in their desire to provide Verizon’s very best possible experience for customers, use specialized equipment to hunt down the signal, and then work with the originator of the signal to shut it down, restoring clear, reliable service.That hunt took Tom to the coast of Seattle, where he found the stray RF signal. It originated from an old repeater on a local tugboat. The undauntable RF Hunter worked with the harbormaster to locate the boat owner and quickly turn off the unauthorized signals.Verizon engineers are obsessed with connecting their customers, and keeping them connected in moments big and small. They live and work in the same places their customers do. They shop at the same stores, visit the same parks, attend the same football games, boat in the same ocean and work in the same offices. They share the experience their customers share, so engineers are working every day, relentlessly, to make the Verizon network even better than it was the day before.Story continuesTake the network for a test driveIf you aren’t a Verizon customer yet and want the Verizon Test Force on your side, relentlessly providing you with reliable, fast and secure service, sign up for Verizon Free Trial and get unlimited premium data on 5G Ultra Wideband, our fastest 5G network for 30 days for free, without disrupting your existing service.

That's the future of math learning, thanks to augmented reality (AR).""Using AR helps make difficult content more digestible, so students can develop conceptual understanding,"" says Sylvia Diaz, superintendent in residence at McGraw Hill. ""Because it's experiential and hands-on, the app helps make the abstract and the complex simpler.""Using augmented reality features of the McGraw Hill AR app, available through Verizon Innovative Learning HQ, educators can bring 10 math concepts to life on their students' smartphone or tablet. Students can view and manipulate shapes and use animations to help them visually understand mathematics.Increased student engagement and excitement are the primary goals for embracing innovative tech curricula in the classroom, Diaz explains. ""Getting students to feel like they are good learners and have the capacity to learn and grow, even when things are challenging, is half the battle,"" she says. ""These types of applications bring joy into the environment. Kids get that feeling of success and accomplishment.""Renee Dawson, an educational technology specialist for Atlanta Public Schools and Verizon Innovative Learning Schools Coach, agrees. When she introduced the app to students, Dawson says, they were immediately drawn to the gamification of mathematical concepts and the app's ability to bring difficult concepts to life. ""Teachers see the benefits of this technology, too,"" she says. ""It lets them be creative in the classroom, which is a big motivator.""Story continuesDiaz says that having materials for Spanish-speaking students, such as activities, student resources and worksheets in Spanish, is extremely valuable, too. ""They empower students to strengthen their academic language and help them share information with their family about what they're learning,"" Diaz says. These Spanish-language materials are exclusively available on Verizon Innovative Learning HQ.5 free math lessons to let your students explore on the appSlope: In this activity, students determine the slopes of ski trails; they can also set the slopes of skateboard ramps for virtual riders. From there, students move on to calculate the slopes of triangles.Growth functions: Students compare the growth rates of linear, quadratic and exponential functions by evaluating the differences between terms in sequences and deciding if the growth is constant, accelerating or exponential. Students can see this growth in the form of dozens (and then thousands) of rabbits jumping out of a magician's hat.Reflections: Students manipulate the line of reflection in the AR environment and observe its impact on the reflected image.Solve equations: In this activity, students balance a scale to solve linear equations. The objective is to solve equations of the form y = x + b and y = mx, where m and b are whole numbers.Graph theory: Students will identify Euler paths and, by making bridges for a pirate on a deserted island, determine when a Euler path does not exist for a given graph.Learn more about the McGraw Hill AR app - as well as other free immersive education apps, hundreds of lessons and professional development courses that help K-12 educators learn new skills - by visiting Verizon Innovative Learning HQ.""Using AR helps make difficult content more digestible, so students can develop conceptual understanding.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Visa Inc. V, Block, Inc. SQ and Robinhood Markets, Inc. HOOD.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:4 Cryptocurrency Stocks in Focus After a Volatile SummerWall Street had a solid run in the first seven months of the year before the rally came to a halt in August. Markets have since been volatile as inflation remains stubbornly high. This has made the Fed hint at another quarter percentage point interest rate hike this year. Moreover, the Fed also said that the higher interest rates are likely to continue for a longer period.Also, the central bank cut its rate cut forecast to two from four, which won’t come before September 2024. Higher interest rates negatively affect high-growth sectors like technology, consumer discretionary and cryptocurrencies.The Fed’s hawkish stance came as a major setback for the cryptocurrency market. Cryptocurrencies that made a solid turnaround this year after an unimpressive 2023 have also been suffering lately.Bitcoin ReboundsAugust and September have been particularly unimpressive for cryptocurrencies as the Fed’s hawkish stance saw treasury yields soar to multi-year highs. This has been taking a toll on all major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE).However, Bitcoin started October on a high as its price hit a four-week high. Bitcoin jumped 3% to $27,921 on Oct 2 after trading above the $28,000 mark for most of the session, its highest level since Aug 17. Also, Ethereum crossed the $1,700 mark on the same day before giving up most of its gains.Understandably, after a dull August and September, October is also expected to remain volatile as investors remain concerned about a slowing economy.Story continuesOther Factors Pose ChallengesInflation continues to be stubbornly high despite a sharp decline over the past year and much above the Fed’s target of 2%. To make things worse, crude oil prices have been rising over the past month.Crude oil prices reached their highest settlement level for the year in the last week of September. This surge in oil prices has raised concerns among investors as it will impact transportation costs, leading to an overall increase in the aggregate price level.Soaring crude oil prices have made the Fed’s job even more difficult as it struggles to curb multi-decade high inflation.Stocks in FocusNVIDIA Corp. is a major player in the semiconductor industry and has been one of the standout success stories of 2023. As a leading designer of graphic processing units (GPUs), the value of the NVDA stock tends to surge in a thriving crypto market. This is primarily due to the crucial role that GPUs play in data centers, artificial intelligence and the mining or production of cryptocurrencies.NVIDIA’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 219.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 39.3% over the last 60 days. NVIDIA presently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

MMSI has been gaining from its strong product portfolio. The optimism led by solid second-quarter 2023 performance and international exposure are expected to contribute further. However, headwinds due to higher consolidation in the healthcare industry and stiff competition persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 13.6% compared with a 47.7% rise of the industry and 14.3% growth of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned medical device provider has a market capitalization of $3.85 billion. The company projects 11.5% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. It has delivered an earnings surprise of 15.8% for the past four quarters, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strong Product Portfolio: Merit Medical has continued to gain significant momentum on the back of new products. The company is upbeat about the product pipeline, including radio and electrophysiology products, raising investors’ optimism. It has several electrophysiology products that are either on track for release or in several other stages of development.In September, Merit Medical announced the U.S. commercial release of its Aspira Bottle.International Exposure: We are optimistic about Merit Medical’s worldwide product distribution network, which includes territories in Europe, the Middle East, Africa (EMEA) and Asia, among others. On the second quarter of 2023 earnings call, Merit Medical confirmed that growth in U.S. and international sales drove its overall top line.Per management, Asia Pacific (APAC) was the primary driver of better-than-expected results, although both the EMEA and Rest of World regions were at the upper end of Merit Medical’s growth expectations in the second quarter. APAC growth was driven by sales in China, which increased year over year as the improving trends in March continued into the second quarter.Strong Q2 Results: Merit Medical’s robust second-quarter 2023 results buoy optimism. The company witnessed a year-over-year uptick in the top and bottom lines. The company also saw revenue growth in both its segments and across all the product categories within its Cardiovascular unit. Robust performances in the United States and outside were also seen. The expansion of gross margin bodes well for the stock.Story continuesDownsidesHigher Consolidation in the Healthcare Industry: Healthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade. Thus, to provide healthcare solutions at a cheaper rate and eradicate competition, large-cap MedTech behemoths have started consolidating with mid-cap and small-cap companies. This enables the availability of healthcare products at cheap prices in the market.Per management, such trends compel Merit Medical’s customers to ask for price concessions in its products, which act against the ongoing business strategies. This may also exert a solid downward pressure on the prices of Merit Medical’s products and reduce the customer base.Stiff Competition: Merit Medical operates in highly competitive markets, where it faces competition from many companies with greater resources. The company competes globally in several market areas, including radiology and interventional cardiology. Such resources and market presence may enable the competitors to market competing products more efficiently or at reduced prices to gain market share.Estimate TrendMerit Medical is witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved a penny south to $2.88.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $306.3 million, suggesting a 6.6% rise from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc. DVA, McKesson Corporation MCK and Integer Holdings Corporation ITGR.DaVita, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 12.7%. DVA’s earnings surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, with an average surprise of 21.4%.

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the ""Value"" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and ""A"" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.One company value investors might notice is Axis Capital Holdings (AXS). AXS is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value.We also note that AXS holds a PEG ratio of 1.20. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. AXS's industry currently sports an average PEG of 2.50. Over the past 52 weeks, AXS's PEG has been as high as 2 and as low as 1.19, with a median of 1.42.We should also highlight that AXS has a P/B ratio of 1.04. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 1.35. AXS's P/B has been as high as 1.31 and as low as 1, with a median of 1.10, over the past year.If you're looking for another solid Insurance - Property and Casualty value stock, take a look at The Travelers Companies (TRV). TRV is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value score of A.Story continuesThe Travelers Companies is trading at a forward earnings multiple of 10.49 at the moment, with a PEG ratio of 1.05. This compares to its industry's average P/E of 26.26 and average PEG ratio of 2.50.TRV's price-to-earnings ratio has been as high as 14.22 and as low as 10.49, with a median of 11.81, while its PEG ratio has been as high as 2.85 and as low as 1.05, with a median of 1.31, all within the past year.The Travelers Companies sports a P/B ratio of 1.69 as well; this compares to its industry's price-to-book ratio of 1.35. In the past 52 weeks, TRV's P/B has been as high as 2.24, as low as 1.67, with a median of 1.83.These are just a handful of the figures considered in Axis Capital Holdings and The Travelers Companies's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that AXS and TRV is an impressive value stock right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In addition to cost advantages for customers, remanufacturing requires about 85% less energy than manufacturing a new engine, which reduces greenhouse gases (GHGs). Remanufacturing also reduces the use of raw materials, packaging and scrap metal.Reducing GHGs and using resources sustainably are major components of PLANET 2050, Cummins' environmental sustainability strategy. The new plant also aligns to the strategy in other ways. It features solar panels, charging points and a high-tech microbiological wash bay, which reuses 100% of the water on site.The new facility will increase Cummins' capacity to meet growing demand across several sectors for high horsepower engines, rebuilt and tested to the highest quality standards in a factory environment. This strategic move will enhance Cummins' services in Europe, meeting the needs of new and existing customers across the region. Cummins engine rebuilds go through a six-stage remanufacturing process that sees the engine disassembled, cleaned, inspected, re-machined, reassembled with genuine Cummins parts and tested.A Cummins rebuilt engine also has a much shorter lead time than a factory ordered engine and performs to the same specification as a new engine with a typical cycle time of 35 working days.The company chose to locate the facility in Krakow for several reasons. It is close to an international airport and major highway, centrally located within Cummins' European network, and near to several large-scale industrial operations, which are reliant on top-end Cummins power, as well as new customers. It also benefits from the highly skilled team that were based at Cummins' already existing Krakow site.Story continues""We're thrilled that this state-of-the-art facility has officially opened,"" said Ann-Kristin de Verdier, Executive Managing Director for Cummins' Europe Distribution Business. ""It is the result of a significant and strategic investment to deliver more choice to our customers across Europe, ultimately helping them to reduce costs and boost productivity.""View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cummins Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cummins Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cummins-inc Email: info@3blmedia.com SOURCE: Cummins Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/790563/new-engine-rebuild-facility-in-europe-aligns-with-cummins-environmental-goals]"

That investment has been put to the test this year.Most Read from BloombergThe 5% Bond Market Means Pain Is Heading Everyone’s WayThe Moral Case for No Longer Engaging With Elon Musk’s XIt's Done. The Future Is Battery-Powered Electric CarsAlmost Anyone Can Become the House Speaker, Except Donald TrumpOzempic Is Making People Buy Less Food, Walmart SaysEarnings at Candle Media, which Mayer and Staggs started in 2021, are expected to come in about 50% below what the companies they acquired had forecast for 2023, according to people familiar with the matter.The shortfall stems from Candle’s two biggest properties: actor Reese Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine and Moonbug Entertainment, owner of the YouTube kids entertainment sensation Cocomelon, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. Staggs and Mayer blamed the shortfall on an “unprecedented” set of obstacles, including a decline in advertising at YouTube, two Hollywood strikes and a pullback in spending across the entertainment industry.“It was a disappointing year for sure,” Mayer said in an interview. “But we like our position.” The company is profitable, he added, and grew this year despite the challenges.Mayer and Staggs, who worked together at Disney, created Candle as an independent producer of TV shows and movies for global streaming services. With money from Blackstone and borrowing, they spent as much as $4 billion buying companies that specialized in programming for adults, kids and viewers outside the US, along with short-form content for social media.Candle executed many of its deals at the peak of the market for production companies, when low interest rates and optimism about streaming TV’s growth attracted billions of dollars from investors.Story continuesBut the market crashed over the past 18 months as Hollywood’s biggest studios cut back on spending to reduce their losses from streaming and reassure investors.As a result, Candle’s profit this year is expected to come in at around $140 million to $170 million, according to the people. That’s below an earlier estimate of $330 million and also less than a more conservative forecast from management and Blackstone. Hello Sunshine is expected to deliver just 10% of projected earnings, while Moonbug is off about 30%.“Candle is a highly profitable, high-quality business with world-class talent and creative output that has had significant organic growth since our investments,” a spokesperson for Blackstone said in a statement. “As with virtually everyone else in this industry there has been an impact from once-in-a-generation strikes and the broader economic environment.”The situation has left Candle with a dilemma — what to do with the assets they’ve acquired. Of a half-dozen deals, only Moonbug generates a meaningful profit, and Candle needs that cash to service more than $1 billion in debt.Mayer and Staggs, meanwhile, are also back at Disney part time. They’re serving as consultants to help their former boss, Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger, find a potential strategic investor for ESPN.The two leaders said they remain confident in Candle’s investments and that the downturn is temporary. Moonbug and Hello Sunshine are growing, valuable assets and are attractive production partners for companies like Netflix Inc., Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.Both men had reason to believe they’d be running Disney one day. Staggs, a 26-year company veteran, was named chief operating officer in 2015, only to leave a year later when it became clear Iger wasn’t giving up the reins any time soon. Mayer was with Disney for over 20 years and served as a key lieutenant to Iger on the acquisitions of Marvel and Lucasfilm, as well as the rollout of the Disney+ streaming service.Since leaving Disney, both have taken a number of jobs. Mayer was briefly the CEO of TikTok and the chairman of the sports streaming service DAZN. He also advised Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. on its big merger.Mayer, 61, and Staggs, 62, joined forces to make deals. They backed two special purpose acquisition companies looking for businesses to take public. One merged with the fitness company Beachbody Co. It’s down 98%, trading at 34 cents. The other terminated a planned acquisition of Hyperloop Transportation Technologies in February.Blackstone approached Mayer and Staggs in late 2020 seeking advice. The company, which manages about $1 trillion in assets, wanted to make investments in media and entertainment, and turned to two of the industry’s most respected executives.Streaming services like Netflix were supplanting cable networks, spending billions of dollars on programming from independent production companies. The rise of streaming in music was boosting the value of catalogs to record heights.Enthusiasm about the streaming boom led to a frothy deal market for production companies. NBA star LeBron James’ SpringHill Co. raised money at a valuation of more than $700 million, while the Korean entertainment giant CJ ENM Co. bought an 80% stake in Killing Eve producer Endeavor Content, valuing the company at $800 million.Blackstone made two big bets. It teamed with music impresario Merck Mercuriadis on a $1 billion fund to buy music catalogs. And it tapped Mayer and Staggs to shop for film and TV companies.In August 2021, they bought a controlling stake in Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine, which produces The Morning Show and Little Fires Everywhere, in a deal that valued the business at $900 million.Witherspoon is a huge star and a successful producer who assembled a skilled executive team. Sunshine has made hit shows and is building other lines of business, like a book club. But even in an up market, the price was staggering for a company that owned very little.With one deal under their belts, Mayer and Staggs went on a shopping spree. They acquired Exile Content, a Latin media company, Faraway Road Productions, the producer of the Israeli drama Fauda, and ATTN, a digital media company. They spent $60 million for about 10% of Will and Jada Pinkett Smith’s company, just before the actor’s outburst at the Oscars got him banned from the ceremony for ten years. Their biggest deal was for Moonbug, home to Cocomelon, one of the most popular shows on YouTube and Netflix. Candle paid about $3 billion for Moonbug, outbidding Comcast Corp. and the private equity firm KKR &amp; Co.Some of these deals have worked out. Faraway Road and Exile cost very little and were done to bring their founders into the business. ATTN has beaten internal forecasts. But others have faltered. Candle paid about $10 million for a company selling nonfungible tokens that shut down about six months later.“We did not overpay for Hello Sunshine,” Mayer said at a conference in Singapore in late 2022, predicting the deal “will be a big winner.”Since that frenzy, Wall Street has begun to fall out of love with streaming. Rising interest rates and fear of a recession have adjusted investors’ priorities, with many now wanting to see profits from the streaming businesses.The future of Candle depends on its two biggest purchases, Moonbug and Hello Sunshine.While Moonbug hasn’t hit its numbers, it’s growing quickly. The company is likely to generate about $150 million in profit this year. It owns most of its intellectual property, including Cocomelon, a singing show for preschoolers which remains one of the most valuable children’s properties. It’s planning to expand abroad and into video games.Hello Sunshine is more of a quandary. The company doesn’t own most of its shows. It produces them for third parties and accepts fees, as well as some profit participation.When Candle bought Hello Sunshine, Witherspoon’s management projected the business would make more than $80 million in profit this year. Instead, it’s on track for less than $10 million, meaning some of the principals won’t be getting the earnouts they once expected.Almost everyone involved has Candle stock, relying on Mayer and Staggs to figure out the next big deal, whether it’s an initial public offering or a sale.But first, according to executives who work for Mayer and Staggs, they need to figure out what they want Candle to be. Their initial vision was for a media company that did a little bit of everything — programs for adults and kids, shows for Netflix and social media, NFTs too. That made more sense when interest rates were low, borrowing was easy and Hollywood was spending like mad.The two have time to figure it out. They said they’re staying the course, and still shopping for deals with Blackstone.“We are poised for sustainable growth next year and beyond,” Staggs said in the interview. “Everyone has to sharpen their focus and sharpen their pencils.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekAftermath of an Assassination: Inside the India-Canada CrisisCan AI Beat the Market?

Viacom is a joint venture between Reliance, Paramount Global and Uday Shankar’s investment firm Bodhi Tree Systems.A potential acquisition could complement Maran’s broadcasting company, Sun TV Network Ltd., while for the Adani Group, it could help expand its newly acquired New Delhi Television Ltd., the people said. They added that deliberations are still at a very preliminary stage and any deal may not happen.Story continuesRepresentatives for Disney in India declined to comment. Sun TV Network Group Chief financial Officer S L Narayanan said the group doesn’t comment on market rumours or speculation. A spokesperson for Adani also said they wouldn’t comment on market speculation.The discussions around the sale of Disney’s India unit show how the market dynamics have been disrupted ever since Ambani’s conglomerate scooped up the streaming rights to the Indian Premier League for $2.7 billion and chose to broadcast it for free earlier this year. Ambani scored another win by bagging a multi-year pact to broadcast Warner Bros Discovery Inc.’s HBO and other content that was previously with Disney.Disney is now using Reliance’s playbook and streaming the ongoing Cricket World Cup in India for free — a move aimed at clawing back some subscribers even if it means sacrificing revenue in the cricket-crazy nation of 1.4 billion people.Disney, however, is likely getting a boost as marquee global brands line up to tap India’s massive consumer base, with advertising slots being sold at $3,600 a second. Disney Star, which holds the exclusive TV broadcast rights for the event in India, said in a statement Wednesday that it’s partnering with 26 sponsors, including heavyweights like Booking.com BV and liquor company Diageo Plc.Cricket is by far the most popular sport in the South Asia nation and attracts more than $1.5 billion in sponsorship and media spending every year, according to research from Jefferies LLC, or about 85% of all sports-related spending in the country.Even as Disney Star has battled sliding subscriber numbers after losing the streaming rights to the Indian Premier League, the media group hasn’t ceded the entire cricket business, securing the television rights through 2027.Last year, Disney Star agreed to license the TV rights for International Cricket Council men’s matches to ZEE Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. for four years, with Disney+ Hotstar retaining the digital rights.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe War in Israel Shows How Social Media’s Idealistic Era Has EndedBusiness Schools Aim to Build Entrepreneurs With Expanded ProgramsWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money EraThe K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTSHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it implies the company is creating value for shareholders.

That was a rebound from the 8% slump of the past two sessions, although the US crude benchmark did make a fresh five-week low of $81.53 on the day.London-traded Brent for the most-active December contract settled up 54 cents, or 0.6%, at $84.58, returning to the green lane after also seeing a drop of some 8% between Wednesday and Thursday. Like WTI, the global crude benchmark printed a five week low in the latest session, falling to $83.50.For the week, WTI was down 9% while Brent fell 11%. That was the worst week since March for both.US rate hike odds double for Nov after blow-out Sept jobs numberRisk appetite returned to Wall Street, with the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq all rising on the day, despite the US Labor Department reporting 336,000 new non-farm payrolls for September. That was the highest since January’s 517,000, and way above the 187,000 seen in August and the average 170,000 forecast for last month by Wall Street economists.“This is a problem as it validates the recent move up in Treasury yields,” economist Adam Button wrote on the ForexLive forum. Following the release of the jobs number, money market traders assigned a 30% probability of the Federal Reserve hiking rates by a quarter point in November, double the odds they gave a week ago.The Fed has repeatedly pointed to an overheated labor market and wage growth, aside from soaring energy prices, as reasons for inflation remaining well above 3% per annum versus its target for 2%.The central bank has hiked interest rates 11 times between March 2022 and July 2023, adding 5.25 percentage points to a prior base rate of just 0.25%, to contend with inflation which reached 40-year highs of above 9% in June 2022.Story continuesBefore this week’s tumble, oil hit one-year highs of more than $97 a barrel for Brent and above $95 for WTI.While oil and stock prices rose on Friday, the dollar and Treasury yields saw limited moves, probably on profit-taking by currency and bond traders who had front-run the jobs numbers.The US Dollar Index, which pits the greenback against six other currencies, hovered at 106.2, up on the day, but off from the 11-month high of 107.35 earlier this week. Yields, benchmarked against the U.S. 10-year Treasury note reached a new 16-year high of 4.89.Oil's downside might not be entirely overBut some weren’t convinced that oil’s downside was over, particularly if the dollar and yields started ramping again on talk of a Fed rate hike on the back of September blow out number for non-farm payrolls.“Crude prices are trying to find a floor now that the macro backdrop shows the US economic resilience is not going away,” said Ed Moya. “Oil’s major correction is almost over but this last surge in the dollar post-NFP could see WTI crude eye the $80 level.”Sunil Kumar Dixit, commodities chartist at SKCharting.com, had a similar view. “If WTI doesn’t continue finding buyers next week, it could drop to $81, and the subsequent support level of $77.”(Peter Nurse contributed to this article)Related ArticlesOil rebounds from lows but still ends with worst week since MarchAnalysis-US would struggle to block Exxon's politically unpopular megadealOil prices rise, but post biggest weekly decline since March]"

It is worth considering Comcast (CMCSA), which belongs to the Zacks Cable Television industry.When looking at the last two reports, this cable provider has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 15.15%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the last reported quarter, Comcast came out with earnings of $1.13 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.98 per share, representing a surprise of 15.31%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.80 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.92 per share, delivering a surprise of 15%.Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Comcast lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Comcast has an Earnings ESP of +2.47% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on October 26, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Digital Navigators are trusted individuals who work at community organizations to help people sign up for internet service and learn digital skills. Starting November 2023, residents of Bucks, Chester, Delaware, and Montgomery counties will also be able to take advantage of support for questions about digital access and where to learn digital literacy skills by dialing 2-1-1. The service expansion is supported by a $317,000 grant from Comcast that is part of Project UP, the company's $1 billion commitment to advance digital equity.Representatives from Comcast, the United Way of Greater Philadelphia and Southern New Jersey and Digital Navigator Network organizations – which include ACLAMO, Beyond Literacy, Chester Education Foundation, Drexel ExCITe Center, Esperanza, Literacy Council of Norristown, Media Fellowship House and SEAMAAC.Comcast's partnership to scale the United Way's Digital Navigator Network builds on the company's long-standing commitment to bridge the digital divide in Pennsylvania. In addition to the grant, and to celebrate Digital Inclusion Week, Comcast donated 50 laptops each, 400 in total, to the eight nonprofit community organizations that are part of this network to support their critical digital navigation work.""In today's digital age, access to technology and the skills to navigate it are fundamental to success in school, work and beyond,"" said Bill Golderer, CEO &amp; President of United Way of Greater Philadelphia and Southern New Jersey. ""To bridge the digital divide, people often need different types of help, sometimes from different organizations, over months or years. To meet their needs, each digital navigator in our network brings complementary strengths and services to the network, ensuring 2-1-1 can connect callers to the organization best suited to meet their needs.""Story continuesDigital Navigators will help residents address the barriers that prevent some people from getting online – namely digital skills and access to devices. In addition, network organizations – which include: ACLAMO, Beyond Literacy, Chester Education Foundation, Drexel ExCITe Center, Esperanza, Literacy Council of Norristown, Media Fellowship House, and SEAMAAC – will collaborate, host educational events, raise awareness, and share resources and key learnings with each other to better address the needs of the community.""Thanks to the Digital Navigator network, I received the support I needed to successfully sign up for the Affordable Connectivity Program and Internet Essentials Plus from Comcast,"" said Sandra Speight, a Philadelphia retiree who had trouble navigating the process on her own. ""I am a long-time WDAS-FM listener and one day I heard a commercial for ACP and the 2-1-1 hotline. I called and was connected to a Digital Navigator from Beyond Literacy that I was able to meet with in person. I now have the connectivity I need, without the financial burden. I am so grateful for those resources. I wasn't alone thanks to the Digital Navigator network.""Dan Bonelli, Senior Vice President for Comcast's Freedom Region, said: ""Digital Navigators and their work at the neighborhood level building digital skills and awareness of resources to help get residents online are critical to closing the digital divide. We are proud to support this innovative effort to meet residents where they are and make it easy for them to reach out and get the help needed to take advantage of all that the Internet has to offer.""Additionally, to help residents who may face issues with affordability, Comcast is offering exclusive Internet deals and spreading the word about eligibility for the federal government's Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP). ACP provides qualifying individuals with a discount of up to $30/month toward their internet service. With it, eligible Comcast customers can purchase either Internet Essentials or Internet Essentials Plus at no cost once the Federal credit is applied. Internet Essentials customers can also add a line of unlimited 5G cellular data ($45) through Xfinity Mobile for as little as $24.95/month, after the ACP benefit is applied. As a result, the ACP benefit could save them up to $360 a year.Comcast is deeply committed to advancing digital equity in the communities it serves. The company's community partnerships in Pennsylvania over the past three years have totaled $144.7 million in cash and in-kind contributions to more than 646 local non-profits. This investment includes the installation of more than 190 Lift Zones in Pennsylvania, which provide free WiFi service to local community centers to expand access to digital skills learning opportunities.A similar Digital Navigator Network expansion to Pittsburgh area residents in Allegheny, Armstrong, Butler, Fayette, and Westmoreland counties and supported by Literacy Pittsburgh, Macedonia FACE, and YWCA of Westmoreland County is also being announced today. The model for these networks is the United Way Digital Navigator Network in Philadelphia that was developed through a grant from PHLConnectED, the City's initiative to provide free internet access to pre-K–12 students in need.

247,4ce61c80-9b5e-307d-a8f4-bdd739ba5691,YUM,2023-10-06,20 Countries That Have the Most Variety of Food,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-countries-most-variety-food-210315542.html,1696539795,STORY,"['DRI', 'QSR', 'YUM']","[In this article, we discuss the 20 countries that have the most variety of food. To skip the detailed analysis of the food industry, go directly to the 5 Countries That Have the Most Variety of Food.There are nearly 8 billion people in the world in around 195 countries with different beliefs, races, and cultural practices. Apart from technology, food might be the most important factor in bringing people around the world together, as humans can distinguish between nearly 10,000 flavors. Apart from the comfort and enjoyment that food brings, it is also one of the two most important necessities of life, the other one being water.With a growing population, the demand for food is also increasing. The global food production was around 9.8 billion tons in 2020 and is expected to double in 2050, according to Sysco Corp (NYSE:SYY). Additionally, the food industry is also quite important, as it is estimated to add  $9.43 trillion in revenue to the global economy and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.21% by 2027.Recent Developments in the IndustryOne of the most devastating blows to the global food industry was the COVID-19 pandemic. The labor shortages and supply chain disruptions dramatically affected the industry but also changed the industry for better or for worse. One of the changes that the industry has experienced is the surge in food delivery compared to take-out or dine-in. Between February and December 2020, food delivery transactions almost doubled. By 2021, the food delivery services tripled the 2017 levels to $150 billion. Some of the major companies that rose to fame were DoorDash, Inc. (NYSE:DASH) and Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), which account for 65% and 23% share of food delivery services in the United States, respectively.After the pandemic, when the global economy was recovering, the Russian invasion of Ukraine created another cause for concern which affected the food industry drastically. The war created a major shortage of some major food products, such as grains and oilseeds, which the two countries export. It also affected the food companies that have significant operations in both countries. For example, PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP) generated around 4.5% of its revenue from the two countries, and in the first 15 days of the war, the company’s stock price declined by around nearly 9%. Furthermore, the high energy prices also boosted the food prices, and in March 2022, they reached their peak. However, things have started to cool down, and between March 2022 and 2023, food prices saw 11 back-to-back price declines and experienced a decrease of 19%.Story continuesWhile we talk about the countries with the most variety of food in our list below, some companies that offer the most diverse foods are Restaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR), Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM), and Darden Restaurants, Inc. (NYSE:DRI). Restaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR) owns some of the largest restaurant chains, such as Burger King, Popeyes, and Tim Hortons. Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) is the top contender in diversity when it comes to fast food as it owns KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell, along with a few others. The company is also aggressively expanding as mentioned by its CEO, David Gibbs, in the company’s earnings call for the period ending June 30, 2023. He said:“Two of Yum!'s differentiated capabilities are bold restaurant development engine, including 1,025 gross new units in the current quarter; and our distinctive digital capabilities, which drove record digital sales, fueled the second quarter 13% growth in system sales.”Lastly, Darden Restaurants, Inc. (NYSE:DRI) offers one of the most diverse cuisines and food styles in the world. It owns three fine dining and six casual dining chains.

Firstly, we used Bott+Co’s list of the Top 50 Food Capitals in the World and checked the gastronomical diversity of the countries where the top 50 cities exist. Then we searched the culinary diversity of the countries in our article, 25 Most Diverse Countries in the World. To make the list more conclusive, we also researched the most diverse cuisines in each continent and then searched individual countries to see how diverse their cuisine is and added them to our list.20 Countries That Have the Most Variety of Food20. PhilippinesThe Philippines is one of the countries on our list with the most variety of food, as it has been inspired by dozens of ethnolinguistic groups that live around the Philippines archipelago. Apart from that, Spanish rule and colonialism also added many flavors to the country’s cuisine.While Philippines is one of the countries with the most varieties of food, companies like Restaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR), Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM), and Darden Restaurants, Inc. (NYSE:DRI) also offer a lot of diversity in their foods.19.  KenyaOverall, African food is highly diverse. However, Kenyan food diversity comes from the 42 tribes that call the country their home. They bring their unique styles, techniques, and ingredients to their cooking. On top of that, the colonial influence also shows in Kenyan cuisine, which makes the country’s food scene highly diverse.18. ItalyItaly might be the country with the best food in the world but it ranks 18th on our list of countries with the most diverse food because most Italian people are not receptive to changes in their traditional recipes, a common example would be their contempt for pineapple on pizza. However, Italy hosts many tourists over the year, leading to a remarkable amount of diversity in their food. One example would be Milan, which is one of the fashion capitals of the world and has 45 different national cuisines. Nevertheless, the diversity in the country’s 20 different regional cuisines is also enough to make it to our list of countries with the most diverse food cultures.17. MalaysiaThe Malaysian local cuisine has influences from all over Southeast Asia. The country also hosts several different national cuisines, including Chinese, Indian, and parts of Europe. Some of the major tourist cities of the country include Kuala Lumpur and Penang, which have some of the highest varieties of food. Kuala Lumpur alone has 43 national cuisines.16. MoroccoMoroccan food's diversity doesn’t come from international restaurants but from the influences of different cultures that have had their impact on the region at one point or another. The country’s food is inspired by Berbers, Italians, French, Spanish, and Arab people. Additionally, being an African country, its gastronomy also includes cuisines from sub-Saharan Africa.15. IsraelIsrael is one of the countries that have the most variety of food as over the centuries, the country has been invaded by several religious groups, mostly belonging to the Abrahamic faith. It is home to at least 15 diverse cultures that coexist. On top of that, a large amount of Jewish people from around the world immigrated to Israel since it became the State of Israel in 1948, and they brought their own ideas and techniques with them. Most of the influences that can be seen in the country’s food scene are from Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines.14. SpainSpanish food diversity is owed to several things, including geography, climate, and influences from cultures around the world. The Spanish cuisine shows Roman, Visigoth, Vandal, and Arab influences, which makes its food unique and highly varied. Moreover, Madrid and Barcelona are also known for offering a plethora of international cuisines with 53 and 48 national dishes, respectively.13. SwitzerlandSwitzerland is one of the most diverse countries in the world, which gives the amount of diversity to its culinary scene. In Geneva, there are close to 1,650 restaurants, and over 85% are international. The majority of restaurants in the country include Thai, French, Indian, Italian, and Chinese food.12. ThailandApart from Bangkok offering 48 national cuisines, Thai national food is also highly diverse and is inspired by Chinese, Indian, Malay, and Portuguese cultures. Furthermore, Thai street food is considered one of the most diverse and inexpensive compared to the rest of the world. Thailand also has an abundance of different ingredients that add something unique to their local cuisine.11. IndiaIndia’s local cuisine is diverse enough to put it on our list of countries with the most variety of food, mostly because of the country’s size, cultures, climates, and influences from around the world. Moreover, India is also home to people from several religions who have their own restrictions and preferred diets, which allows the country to show diversity in its food even in a single region. Apart from vast diversities in cultural food, the Persian conquests and English colonization also added to the already vast amount of flavors found in the country. Apart from these two cultures, Indian cuisine is also influenced by Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, and Thailand.10. ChinaEven though China might not have many restaurants with diverse foods from other nationalities, the sheer size of the country with its 14 different climate zones and varied cultures make Chinese food one of the most diverse cuisines in the world. While the mountainous North is full of ingredients such as wheat, barley, millet, soybeans, and corn, the Southern subtropical region sees an abundance of tropical fruits and vegetables. The Eastern part of the country loves its light seafood dishes, and the Western part of the country likes its food a little spicy.9. FranceFrance is an obvious pick in this list as its food culture is artistic, diverse, and technical. Apart from Paris hosting over 65 different national cuisines, the French local cuisines also have a significant amount of diversity. The Southwest of France loves cooking with duck meat, fats, and liver, along with mushrooms, and the Northwestern French people love the use of dairy products such as cream and butter. The Southeastern part of the country shows an Italian influence with the use of olive oil, herbs, and tomatoes, while the Northeastern part has German influence with sausages, beer, and lard.8. GermanyEven though German cuisine is diverse in itself, a high amount of immigrants have added legions of different foods to German gastronomy. Most of the influence comes from Italy and Turkey due to a significant amount of temporary workers joining the country’s workforce in the 1950s. Bigger cities of the country offer a much more diverse culinary scene with a lot of French, Indian, and Middle Eastern restaurants. Berlin alone offers 64 national cuisines.7. New ZealandNew Zealand is home to several different cultures, including the native Maori and Samoans, in addition to South Asian and Southeast Asian people who bring their flavors to the country’s gastronomy. Most diversity in the New Zealand food culture can be found in the city of Auckland which is home to 37 different national cuisines.6. United Arab EmiratesDubai, UAE, has emerged as one of the most diverse food capitals in the world, just like New York and London. The 1,590 square mile city is home to 62 different national cuisines. Even though Abu Dhabi is also home to countless national cuisines, its glamorous and glittery neighbor city is the one that brings the UAE to one of the top countries that have the most variety of food.Restaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR), Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM), and Darden Restaurants, Inc. (NYSE:DRI) also offer their services in the UAE.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Countries That Have the Most Variety of Food.Suggested articles:20 Most Overrated Cities in the US According to Reddit20 Biggest Logistics Companies in the USTop 20 Most Beautiful Island Countries in the WorldDisclosure.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can head straight to the 5 Cheapest Restaurant Franchises With Low Total Investment.The food service industry, commonly known as the restaurant sector, not only plays a pivotal role in our economy by providing employment opportunities but also holds a substantial financial share. Within this diverse industry, there exists a wide range of restaurant franchise opportunities.Restaurant industry market analysisThe global foodservice market, valued at USD 2,395 billion in 2022, is projected to reach USD 5,423.5 billion by 2030, with a CAGR of 10.79% during 2023-2030. This growth is driven by rising disposable incomes, increased fast food consumption, and the convenience factor, notably due to the growing number of working women worldwide.Franchising, embraced by industry leaders like Domino's, McDonald's, and KFC, continues to propel growth. McDonald's, for instance, has franchised over 38,000 restaurants in over 100 countries, serving nearly 68 million customers daily. This model allows large companies to expand into new markets, minimize costs and risks, and rapidly grow their global footprint.In the ever-evolving restaurant and food industry, one prominent trend that has gained substantial traction in recent years is the surge in popularity of the vegan diet. To cater to this surging demand, major players in the market are actively innovating and adapting. Notably, Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) and Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND) have entered into a strategic partnership to introduce plant-based chicken products in the US market. Beyond Fried Chicken, a product of this collaboration, was made available to consumers at Taco Bell, KFC, and Pizza Hut locations for a limited time.Moreover, major chains, including KFC, McDonald's, and Burger King, are introducing vegan menu items in response to increasing consumer demand for healthier and sustainable options.Story continuesAlso, the rise of shopping and dining malls has been a prominent trend in recent years, resulting in heightened consumer expenditure at restaurants and contributing substantially to market expansion.Notable Industry PlayersAs per IMARC Group's report, the fast-food industry, known as the Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) sector, exhibited robust resilience, boasting a valuation of $243.9 billion in 2022. Projections indicate that this industry is set to further expand, with an estimated value of $319.7 billion anticipated by 2028, reflecting a substantial Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 4.7% during this period. Adding to this, some of the largest food chains are part of the fast food industry. Among the notable players in the food service industry, the top three largest firms include McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), Subway, and Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM). Together, these industry giants collectively oversee an impressive network of nearly 150,000 branches worldwide. Analyzing their performance this year, it becomes evident that investors may have certain expectations for the economy. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) shares have surged by approximately 12% year-to-date, while Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) have experienced gains of around 4% and 8%, respectively. Furthermore, industry analysts anticipate robust profit reports from renowned restaurant chains like McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) and Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) in the latter half of 2023. Glancing at their recent financial results, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) delivered a robust second-quarter performance, exceeding expectations with an impressive 13.60% earnings per share (EPS) surprise. Similarly, Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) exceeded the estimated expectations by 13.70%, while Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) surpassed expectations with only 5.30% EPS surprise.What's driving the growth of these industry players? One key factor is their strategic marketing and the digital transformation of their business operations. For instance, McDonald's CEO, Chris Kempczinski, has echoed similar sentiments when discussing the reasons behind McDonald's growth in recent earning calls. He states: “Last quarter, I talked about consistency, consistency in our numbers, consistency in the drivers of our business and consistency in the excitement across the system about the opportunities ahead. This quarter, the theme is — well, if I’m being honest, the theme was Grimace. I mean, Grimace has been everywhere the past few months, all over the news and more than 3 billion views on TikTok. Not bad for a 52nd birthday. This viral phenomenon is yet another proof point of the power of marketing at McDonald’s today. Aside from Grimace, what really stood out about this past quarter was our continued consistency. In Q2, we delivered yet another quarter of strong performance, achieving global comparable sales of 11.7% with double digit comparable sales across each of our segments.” He further discussed digitizing the business operations and said: “Our success is fueling even greater ambitions. We’re continuing to double down on our existing growth pillars while evolving our strategy through accelerating the organization to stay front footed with an eye towards the future. As we’ve previously shared, accelerating the organization is an initiative to reimagine how we work to bring the full breadth of McDonald’s skills and experiences together to come up with the best solutions that can be scaled. We’re bringing this to life through One McDonald’s Way, horizontal ways of working and digitizing the organization. While we’re just beginning to change our ways of working, we’re already seeing early benefits.” With these details in mind, let’s now explore the cheapest restaurant franchises with low total investment. 15 Cheapest Restaurant Franchises With Low Total InvestmentSettawat Udom / Shutterstock.comOur Methodology: We compiled a list of the 15 cheapest restaurant franchises with low total investment by considering both initial payment fees and royalty fees.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Consumer Cyclical Stocks To Buy Now.What Are Consumer Cyclical Stocks?Consumer cyclical stocks include stocks relying on the business cycle and economic conditions, that is, their profitability and performance in a given financial year is highly dependent on market conditions throughout that year. These stocks are primarily found in sectors providing non-essential, even luxury, goods to consumers, such as the automotive sector, the travel and leisure sector, the entertainment sector, and the retail sector, among others. Since these stocks are heavily dependent on market conditions, a lot of investors might wish to avoid them because of their unpredictability. However, any investment portfolio requires a good balance of different categories of stocks, and for some investors, consumer cyclical stocks, with their volatility, can actually help achieve long-term wealth.The current state of the US market is heavily volatile and unpredictable, especially for consumer cyclical stocks in the automotive sector. This is primarily because of the United Auto Workers (UAW) strikes occurring nationwide. However, major automakers such as General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) that are impacted heavily by the strikes are continuing to hold on. On October 5, CNBC's Jim Cramer made some comments on Ford Motor Company's (NYSE:F) current approach to handling the UAW strikes. Here's what he said:""Ford is trying to prove that that they really aren't the same as the others. GM fired a huge number of United Auto Workers in the last, I don't know, in the last decade, but Ford didn't. And Ford's actually moved a lot of UAW workers from temporary to full, which is the only way to get them within the contract that they're operating under: more money. So, I know that Ford felt a little upset that Biden joined the picket line, but at the same time Ford is seeing some movement by Fain.""Story continuesAccording to Cramer's analysis, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) may be looking to shift a part of its production to Mexico while the strikes continue. He sees this move coming about in the next couple of weeks.At the same time, Paul Jacobson, the CFO at General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) also joined CNBC's ""Halftime Report"" on October 4 to discuss the company's announcement of a new line of credit worth $6 billion to help it cope with the financial effects of the UAW strikes, the cost of which had reached about $200 million at that time, according to CNBC. Such developments show that even in the face of adversity, reliable companies in the consumer cyclical space are continuing to hold on and ensure that they retain their profitability for the sake of their own revenues and the profits of their shareholders.How Are Other Areas Of The Market Performing?This cursory view of the automotive sector can make one wonder how cyclical stocks in other areas of the market are faring. CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" delved into the state of the retail sector on October 5, which can help investors see how other areas are performing. Here's what CNBC's Courtney Reagan had to say about the status of holiday toy sales in the retail sector:""While total toy sales are expected to fall year-over-year, there's something consumers find a way to buy - it's toys for Christmas. Good news for parents, or Santa, we should say, toy inventory is solid, so shortages aren't expected, and toy prices are down about 2.9% over last year.""All in all, you can't really say that consumer cyclical stocks like the ones mentioned above, and even others like NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) and The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), have it easy this year. However, efforts are being made to keep consumer sales up so these companies retain their profits. As such, we have compiled a list of some of the best cyclical stocks to buy now, particularly those that can be considered the best cyclical stocks in 2023.11 Best Consumer Cyclical Stocks To Buy NowSource:PixabayOur MethodologyWe used a stock screener to find consumer cyclical stocks and first selected 30 stocks for our list below.

(NYSE:LOW) in its first half of 2023 investor letter:Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) is a high-quality business with significant long-term earnings growth potential operated by a superb management team that has been successfully executing a multi-faceted business transformation. In recent quarters, industrywide sales have retrenched slightly, driven by record lumber deflation, moderation in DIY discretionary demand (particularly with big-ticket items), a mix-shift from large to smaller Pro-specific projects, and a general trend of consumers reallocating budgets from goods to services. Sales remain elevated relative to 2019 baseline levels driven by a combination of price and mix, while units have largely normalized. Against this backdrop, Lowe’s headline same-store-sales growth has been modestly negative, offset by material margin expansion and the benefits of Lowe’s best-in-class share buyback program positioning the company to generate roughly flat earnings growth in 2023.Lowe’s remains well positioned to manage through uncertainty. Nearly two-thirds of Lowe’s revenue comes from non-deferrable repair and maintenance activity, which is comparatively insulated from the macroeconomic environment. Lowe’s continues to make progress on various business initiatives that should aid the company’s ability to improve share and grow revenue even in challenging macro environments. Select initiatives for 2023 include the continued rollout of Lowe’s market-based delivery model (now &gt;60% complete, a critical component of Lowe’s business transformation objectives), a new 300-store rural localization merchandising program, and enhancements to Lowe’s MVP Pro Rewards program…” (Click here to read the full text)Like General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), NIKE, Inc.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can head straight to the 5 Cheapest Restaurant Franchises With Low Total Investment.The food service industry, commonly known as the restaurant sector, not only plays a pivotal role in our economy by providing employment opportunities but also holds a substantial financial share. Within this diverse industry, there exists a wide range of restaurant franchise opportunities.Restaurant industry market analysisThe global foodservice market, valued at USD 2,395 billion in 2022, is projected to reach USD 5,423.5 billion by 2030, with a CAGR of 10.79% during 2023-2030. This growth is driven by rising disposable incomes, increased fast food consumption, and the convenience factor, notably due to the growing number of working women worldwide.Franchising, embraced by industry leaders like Domino's, McDonald's, and KFC, continues to propel growth. McDonald's, for instance, has franchised over 38,000 restaurants in over 100 countries, serving nearly 68 million customers daily. This model allows large companies to expand into new markets, minimize costs and risks, and rapidly grow their global footprint.In the ever-evolving restaurant and food industry, one prominent trend that has gained substantial traction in recent years is the surge in popularity of the vegan diet. To cater to this surging demand, major players in the market are actively innovating and adapting. Notably, Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) and Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ:BYND) have entered into a strategic partnership to introduce plant-based chicken products in the US market. Beyond Fried Chicken, a product of this collaboration, was made available to consumers at Taco Bell, KFC, and Pizza Hut locations for a limited time.Moreover, major chains, including KFC, McDonald's, and Burger King, are introducing vegan menu items in response to increasing consumer demand for healthier and sustainable options.Story continuesAlso, the rise of shopping and dining malls has been a prominent trend in recent years, resulting in heightened consumer expenditure at restaurants and contributing substantially to market expansion.Notable Industry PlayersAs per IMARC Group's report, the fast-food industry, known as the Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) sector, exhibited robust resilience, boasting a valuation of $243.9 billion in 2022. Projections indicate that this industry is set to further expand, with an estimated value of $319.7 billion anticipated by 2028, reflecting a substantial Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 4.7% during this period. Adding to this, some of the largest food chains are part of the fast food industry. Among the notable players in the food service industry, the top three largest firms include McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), Subway, and Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM). Together, these industry giants collectively oversee an impressive network of nearly 150,000 branches worldwide. Analyzing their performance this year, it becomes evident that investors may have certain expectations for the economy. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) shares have surged by approximately 12% year-to-date, while Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) have experienced gains of around 4% and 8%, respectively. Furthermore, industry analysts anticipate robust profit reports from renowned restaurant chains like McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) and Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) in the latter half of 2023. Glancing at their recent financial results, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) delivered a robust second-quarter performance, exceeding expectations with an impressive 13.60% earnings per share (EPS) surprise. Similarly, Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) exceeded the estimated expectations by 13.70%, while Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) surpassed expectations with only 5.30% EPS surprise.What's driving the growth of these industry players? One key factor is their strategic marketing and the digital transformation of their business operations. For instance, McDonald's CEO, Chris Kempczinski, has echoed similar sentiments when discussing the reasons behind McDonald's growth in recent earning calls. He states: “Last quarter, I talked about consistency, consistency in our numbers, consistency in the drivers of our business and consistency in the excitement across the system about the opportunities ahead. This quarter, the theme is — well, if I’m being honest, the theme was Grimace. I mean, Grimace has been everywhere the past few months, all over the news and more than 3 billion views on TikTok. Not bad for a 52nd birthday. This viral phenomenon is yet another proof point of the power of marketing at McDonald’s today. Aside from Grimace, what really stood out about this past quarter was our continued consistency. In Q2, we delivered yet another quarter of strong performance, achieving global comparable sales of 11.7% with double digit comparable sales across each of our segments.” He further discussed digitizing the business operations and said: “Our success is fueling even greater ambitions.

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about McDonald's (MCD) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.McDonald's currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.59, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 28 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.59 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 28 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 18 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 64.3% and 10.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for MCDBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for MCDCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for McDonald's here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying McDonald's, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Should You Invest in MCD?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for McDonald's, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $11.52.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for McDonald's. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for McDonald's.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

259,7372a901-f602-36b3-afa7-17d7241fc7fc,MCD,2023-10-06,McDonald's Corporation (MCD) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mcdonalds-corporation-mcd-attracting-investor-130010582.html,1696510810,STORY,['MCD'],"[McDonald's (MCD) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this world's biggest hamburger chain have returned -7.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -5.5% change. The Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, to which McDonald's belongs, has lost 7.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.McDonald's is expected to post earnings of $2.99 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed 0%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.52 points to a change of +14.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.44 indicates a change of +8% from what McDonald's is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, McDonald's is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For McDonald's, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $6.57 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +11.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $25.46 billion and $27.36 billion estimates indicate +9.8% and +7.5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMcDonald's reported revenues of $6.5 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.6%. EPS of $3.17 for the same period compares with $2.55 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.23 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.31%. The EPS surprise was +14.44%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.McDonald's is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about McDonald's. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this package delivery service have returned -5.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -5.5% change. The Zacks Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo industry, to which UPS belongs, has lost 6.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, UPS is expected to post earnings of $1.67 per share, indicating a change of -44.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +6.8% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.37 points to a change of -27.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -2.4%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.21 indicates a change of +8.9% from what UPS is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.2%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for UPS.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For UPS, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $21.73 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -10.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $92.73 billion and $97.51 billion estimates indicate -7.6% and +5.2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUPS reported revenues of $22.06 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -11%. EPS of $2.54 for the same period compares with $3.29 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.88 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -3.61%. The EPS surprise was +1.2%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company could not beat consensus revenue estimates in any of the last four quarters.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.UPS is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about UPS. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and the dividend capture strategy, and go directly to read 5 Best October Dividend Stocks To Buy. Dividend payments around the world have been growing significantly because investors are increasingly interested in income-generating assets. This strong reputation of dividend stocks didn't happen overnight; it's based on historical data that demonstrates how these stocks have consistently performed better than other types of investments over the years. Companies that regularly increase their dividends are particularly attractive in this scenario. They are considered real winners because they not only garner appreciation from investors but also thrive in changing market conditions. According to a report by Morgan Stanley, dividends are a crucial investment for long-term investors. Stocks with high dividends typically do well when inflation is higher than usual but on a downward trend. These stocks are also considered safe and become even more appealing during uncertain economic times because they provide stability and reliable income.As mentioned above, global dividends have experienced significant growth this year. China's largest companies have paid out 1.5 trillion yuan ($206 billion) in dividends this year, which has already exceeded the 1.27 trillion yuan paid out in 2022, according to a report by Bloomberg. The major contributors to this increase are the largest state-owned banks, with PetroChina and Kweichow Moutai following closely behind. Similarly, Janus Henderson reported that 98% of US companies either increased their dividends or maintained them at the same level in the second quarter of 2023. This percentage is significantly higher than the global average.Dividend investing can be a sound strategy for long-term investors. Holding onto stocks with consistently increasing dividends can lead to higher yields on original investment over time. Regular dividend hikes often contribute to an increase in the stock's share price. According to a recent report by T. Rowe Price, between the end of 1985 to the close of 2022, dividend growers in the Russell 1000 Index performed better than the broader benchmark index. Furthermore, these dividend-growing stocks showed lower levels of price fluctuations or volatility. Some of the best dividend stocks in this regard are The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) as these firms have consistently increased their dividend payments for many years.Story continuesIn addition to long-term investors, dividend investing can be appealing to some short-term investors through a dividend capture strategy. It involves purchasing a stock just before it goes ex-dividend and then selling it shortly thereafter, typically after the dividend is received. This strategy aims to capture the dividend income while minimizing exposure to the stock's price fluctuations. To learn more about this investment approach, have a look at our article Dividend Capture Strategy Stocks To Buy.10 Best October Dividend Stocks To Buy Our Methodology:This list outlines the dividend capture strategy for selecting prominent dividend stocks that will trade ex-dividend in October 2023.

(NYSE: NI) today announced the launch of a multi-phase hydrogen blending project – one of the first in the United States to use a blending skid in a controlled setting to mix hydrogen and natural gas at precise levels to determine optimal blend percentages and their environmental and consumer benefits.Elected officials and community leaders joined NiSource President and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Yates and other company officials on Oct. 5, at the program’s launch at the Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania Training Center’s Safety Town in Monaca, Pa., where the hydrogen blending skid has been constructed, to tout the possible benefits of this clean energy solution.""At NiSource we believe that a balanced energy future is one where no one is left behind, and to achieve that goal, we must include a diverse portfolio of energy sources to meet our current and future energy needs,"" said Yates. ""Our existing natural gas infrastructure positions us well to bring our customers along into the energy of the future, and hydrogen blending is one promising solution we are exploring to enhance sustainability and to deliver a safe and reliable energy source to our customers.""Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, a subsidiary of NiSource, partnered with EN Engineering to construct the hydrogen blending skid, which allows for the controlled blending of hydrogen into Safety Town’s natural gas system at various percentages, ranging from two to 20 percent.To demonstrate the efficacy of the blended fuel, NiSource built a specially designed on-site model home equipped with natural gas appliances to simulate everyday usage in a residential home environment. Ongoing field confirmations are being evaluated hydrogen’s effect on the natural gas itself, equipment, piping, and the net change in carbon emissions from blending, with favorable results.Story continuesHydrogen is one of the most abundant elements on earth. It can be produced from a variety of energy sources, stored for future use, piped to where it is needed and converted into a clean source for heat and electricity. We believe that hydrogen can be a zero-carbon fuel because when combusted, hydrogen produces water vapor, not greenhouse gas emissions. We are exploring how hydrogen can be safely produced, transported, stored, and blended into the existing natural gas grid to help decarbonize natural gas pipelines.Throughout the multi-phase hydrogen blending project, NiSource will continue to evaluate the viability of hydrogen-natural gas blends for other applications such as factories and power plants. Based on the results and data collected, future phases of the program could include the introduction of a hydrogen-blend into a live-gas environment using the company’s existing gas distribution infrastructure that serves customers today.The blending program is one facet of NiSource’s overall Future of Energy strategy, which includes a dynamic range of clean energy solutions ranging from solar, wind, electricity and renewable natural gas to secure a sustainable energy future for all.""Integrating hydrogen into our energy future is complementary to renewable energy and could further enhance the global energy transition underway,"" said Yates. ""Our overall goal remains to lower emissions and ensure the availability of an array of environmentally sustainable energy sources while balancing affordability, reliability and other economic considerations for our customers.""About Columbia Gas of PennsylvaniaColumbia Gas of Pennsylvania delivers clean, affordable, and efficient natural gas to approximately 445,000 customers.

275,c43dcee8-ce32-352f-98f5-9339dc408667,ZBH,2023-10-06,15 Stocks Dumb Money’s Steve Cohen Is Betting On Now,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-stocks-dumb-money-steve-192850308.html,1696534130,STORY,"['ISRG', 'META', 'BSX', 'TTWO', 'D', 'ZBH', 'DELL', 'TSM', 'LW', 'AZO']","[Billionaire Steve Cohen, a prominent figure and founder of the Point72 Asset Management, has accumulated an estimated fortune of nearly $20 billion through a high-risk/high-reward strategy. Despite negative market trends in 2022, Point72 Asset Management produced a net gain of 10.3%, netting Steve Cohen $1.7 billion in gains. Cohen is also featured in the biographical movie ""Dumb Money,"" which details the famous GameStop short squeeze. In the film, Cohen and other big Wall Street names like Melvin Capital Management founder Gabe Plotkin are shown as being big investors who are shorting meme stocks sitting in pandemic hideouts while retail investors gathered on social media platforms to boost meme stocks that were shorted by them. In the movie, the hedge fund managers doubt the knowledge of retail investors. In one scene, when the fictional Cohen and Plotkin discover the videos promoting GameStop on Reddit, the fictional Plotkin questions their credibility, saying ""Retail traders always lose.” Meanwhile, the Cohen character responded, “Guess these guys have decided to ignore all of the obvious secular trends."" “Or are they...illiterate?"". It appears that Steve Cohen's high-risk/high-reward strategy has helped his firm make significant gains so far in 2023, given that Point72's $33 billion stock portfolio is heavily weighted towards high-growth tech, consumer discretionary, and communication companies, which were the best performers in the first half of 2023. At a private SALT conference event, Dumb Money's Steve Cohen suggested investors bet on the ""big wave"" of artificial intelligence rather than focusing on a recession. He emphasized that focusing too much on the likelihood of a recession may cause investors to overlook AI investment opportunities. Among the AI stocks in which Cohen's firm invested heavily in the second quarter were NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE). Point72 increased its stake in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) by 306% to $1.8 billion, while boosting its stakes in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) by 68% and 52%, respectively. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL), Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) are among the other AI stocks that Dumb Money's Steve Cohen is betting on now.Story continues""I'm making a prognostication — we're going up,"" he said, according to Bloomberg. ""I'm actually pretty bullish.""Aside from heavily investing in AI stocks, billionaire Steve Cohen has taken advantage of the volatility in healthcare and energy stocks during the second quarter. For instance, his firm significantly lifted its stake in Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D) by 151%, Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) by 96%, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) by 119% and Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (ZBH) by 120%. MethodologyAs Steve Cohen is one of the most prominent investors and founder of one of the world’s largest hedge funds, paying attention to Point72 Asset Management’s stock portfolio can help investors choose the right stocks. The following information is based on Point72 Asset Management’s second-quarter 13F filing. We track hedge funds like Bridgewater Associates because Insider Monkey research has shown that their consensus stock picks can deliver exceptional returns.15 Stocks Dumb Money’s Steve Cohen Is Betting On Now 15. Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D)Value of Point72 Asset Management’s 13F Position: $185 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 27Dumb Money's Steve Cohen used the selloff in Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D) stock price as a buying opportunity during the second quarter, increasing his stake in the company by 151%. Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D) operates in four segments: Dominion Energy Virginia, Gas Distribution, Dominion Energy South Carolina, and Contracted Assets. Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D) appears to be undervalued due to its low valuations and an expectation of sustainable earnings growth in the coming years. Its stock is currently trading at about 12 times forward earnings, compared to the sector median of 15 times. Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D) also offers a healthy over 6% dividend yield. According to Insider Monkey data, Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D) was in 27 hedge fund portfolios at the end of the second quarter. Diamond Hill Capital and Citadel Investment Group were the leading stakeholders in Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D). 14. Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX)Value of Point72 Asset Management’s 13F Position: $188.8 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 71Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) is one of the 15 stocks Dumb Money's Steve Cohen is betting on now. Steve Chohen's strategy of increasing his stake in Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) by 96% during the second quarter appears to be working, as the healthcare equipment provider's share price has soared in recent months, thanks to strong financial growth trends. Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) reported net sales of $3.5 billion in the second quarter, representing an 11% increase over the prior year period. Its GAAP net earnings per share of $0.18 rose from $0.17 per share a year ago.Baron Funds, an investment management firm, expressed confidence in Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) in its second-quarter investor letter because of its ability to grow revenue in the high single digits and earnings per share in the double digits. Here is what the firm stated Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX):“We re-established a position in Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX), a global developer, manufacturer, and marketer of medical devices that are used in a broad range of interventional medical specialties. We believe Boston Scientific can grow revenue reliably in the high single digits, driven by differentiated products in electrophysiology and structural heart. Coupled with cost discipline and over 50 basis points of annual operating margin expansion, we believe the company’s double-digit EPS growth profile makes Boston Scientific a compelling name within the large medical device universe.Within electrophysiology, we think Boston Scientific is well positioned as a leader in the emerging field of pulsed field ablation (PFA). Traditionally, physicians have used temperature-based methods (either hot or cold) to disable heart tissue responsible for irregular heartbeats. Temperature-based methods may damage surrounding tissue, however. Examples include damaging the esophagus (food tube) and the phrenic nerve (which controls breathing). PFA, in comparison, relies on electricity to damage aberrant tissue, and because different types of tissue have different electrical thresholds, the surrounding tissue can be selectively spared. Boston Scientific is ahead of the pack with high-quality, randomized controlled trial data (Advent) to come out in the back half of 2023. Electrophysiology is an $8 billion market growing 12%, and we believe Boston Scientific can grow significantly above this market rate as it takes share with its PFA program.Within structural heart, we like Boston Scientific’s position within left atrial appendage closure, which is a procedure that lowers stroke risk for atrial fibrillation patients. The company’s Watchman device continues to maintain dominant share (over 90%), and this is a $1 billion market growing over 25%. We are most excited about the potential for Watchman to expand into first-line therapy: currently patients would only get a Watchman if they cannot take anticoagulants because of bleeding risk; Boston Scientific is running the CHAMPION-AF trial to support Watchman as the first option. It has completed enrollment, and if the trial is successful, the company believes this has the potential to more than triple the addressable patients by 2027.”13. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)Value of Point72 Asset Management’s 13F Position: $188.9 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 125Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is one of the stocks in Point72’s portfolio that will benefit from the rising demand for artificial intelligence. With a stake worth $188.9 million, Dumb Money's Steve Cohen is betting big on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), up 48% from the previous quarter. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) manufactures and sells integrated circuits and other semiconductor devices in Taiwan, China, and around the world. NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) processors such as H100 and A100, which are used to power ChatGPT and data centres, are made exclusively by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM).Hedge fund positions in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) increased as well, rising from 104 in the first quarter to 125 in the second. 12. Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG)Value of Point72 Asset Management’s 13F Position: $192 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 68Additionally, Point72 increased its stake in healthcare equipment maker Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) by 119% during the second quarter. The firm appears to have benefited from its stake in Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), as the company's shares have risen around 10% year to date. Because Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) has been experiencing robust financial growth trends, the share price upside prospects appear promising. Its second-quarter revenue of $1.76 billion increased 16% year on year, while net income jumped 18%. Furthermore, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) raised its 2023 procedure growth rate forecast from 18%-21% to 20%-22%.In the second quarter investor letter, Baron Funds, an investment management company, presented several reasons that are likely to help Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) to outperform. Here is what the firm stated about Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG):“Strength in health care equipment was largely due to the outperformance of sleep apnea device company Inspire Medical Systems, Inc. and robotic surgery system pioneer Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG). Intuitive Surgical, Inc. manufactures and markets the da Vinci Surgical System, a robotic system used for minimally invasive procedures. Shares increased after Intuitive reported strong first-quarter financial results highlighted by a 26% increase in procedures and raised guidance for 2023. These results, which came in well above Street estimates, were driven by strength in general surgery procedures in the U.S. and non-urology procedures outside the U.S. We continue to believe Intuitive has a large opportunity to expand the use of robotic surgery over time.”11. Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW)Value of Point72 Asset Management’s 13F Position: $199.8 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 47Dumb Money's Steve Cohen, like Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX), and Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D), is bullish on Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW). In the second quarter, Point72 Asset Management increased its existing stake in Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW) by 40% to nearly $200 million. Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW) is a food and meat producer and distributor. Along with a steady share price upside potential, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW) also offers a dividend yield of around 1.50%. As of the end of the second quarter, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW) was in 47 hedge fund portfolios. Stockbridge Partners and Citadel Investment Group were the leading stakeholders in Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW).10. Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO)Value of Point72 Asset Management’s 13F Position: $216 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 58Despite selling 20% of his stake in Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO) in the second quarter to capitalize on the large share price gains, it remains in the list of the 15 stocks Dumb Money's Steve Cohen is betting on right now. As of the end of the second quarter, Point72 held $216 million worth of stake in Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO). Shares of Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO) have risen 35% year to date, and fundamentals support the continuation of the uptrend. Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO) expects net bookings to be in the range of $5.45-$5.55 billion for the full year. Moreover, in an earnings call, its CEO/Chairman Strauss Zelnick stated that the company will enter its next phase of growth in fiscal 2025, with the potential to deliver over $8B in net bookings.Hedge fund confidence in Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO) has also increased. Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO) was in 58 hedge fund portfolios at the end of the second quarter, up from 54 in the previous quarter. 9. Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL)Value of Point72 Asset Management’s 13F Position: $235 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 57Steve Cohen's strategy of increasing his stake in Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) appears to be working. The company's stock has appreciated nearly 65% year to date. The share price upside of Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) is backed by increasing AI demand. In an earnings call, Jeff Clarke, Chief Operating Officer of Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL), stated that AI is already showing its long-term tailwind, with continued demand growth across the portfolio. Analysts are also praising Dell Technologies Inc.'s (NYSE:DELL) robust growth prospects. Here is what Morgan Stanley’s analyst Erik Woodring said:""And with our checks suggesting DELL is aiming to build 15-25k AI servers - or about $5B at the midpoint - in 2023 and 2024, despite very little volumes going to enterprises (more below), we believe the AI servers story is still in its early days, and can remain an upside driver of revenue and EPS for several quarters."" Hedge fund confidence in the IT behemoth has also grown. Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) was in 57 hedge fund portfolios as of the end of the second quarter compared to 41 in the previous quarter. 8. Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ZBH)Value of Point72 Asset Management’s 13F Position: $238 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 48Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ZBH) is a provider of orthopaedic reconstructive products in the healthcare industry. Following a steady increase in share price in the first half, Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ZBH) shares have dropped in the last three months due to concerns that newer weight loss drugs known as GLP-1 receptor agonists may harm the company's knee implant business. However, Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ZBH) expects full-year revenue growth of 6.5%-7.0%, up from the previous forecast of 5.0%-6.0% YoY growth. Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ZBH) also pays a $0.24 per share quarterly dividend.As of the end of the second quarter, there were 48 hedge fund positions in Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ZBH). Point72 Asset Management became a leading shareholder in Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ZBH) after increasing its stake by 120% during the second quarter. 7. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)Value of Point72 Asset Management’s 13F Position: $240 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 231While Cohen's firm sold 67% of its stake in Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) during the second quarter to capitalize on massive share price gains, the firm still owned a $240 million stake in the company. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stock has soared 144% year to date, owing to increased ad revenue. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) reported an 11% year-over-year increase in revenue to $32 billion for the June quarter. The company's operating income increased by 12% year on year to $9.39 billion. Furthermore, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) anticipates third-quarter revenue of $32 billion to $34.5 billion, up from the previous forecast of $31.11 billion. In the second quarter investor letter, Artisan Partners, an investment management company, made comments about Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Here is what the firm stated about Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META:“Our best performing stocks this quarter were Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet and Heidelberg Materials. Meta was the largest contributor to performance. Its shares have almost fully recovered from last year’s declines, rising 35% during the quarter and 138% YTD. During the quarter, the company reported earnings that showed a return to growth and healthy user engagement metrics. Most importantly, profitability appears to have stabilized and is poised to improve as significant cost reduction actions implemented over the past six months begin to have an impact. Separate from fundamental performance, there is excitement over AI’s potential to help the company’s business. While Meta’s technology prowess and massively scaled media platform certainly position the company to take advantage of AI, we believe it’s far too early to estimate any discrete tangible benefits. Overall, we view AI as one of several drivers that will contribute to Meta’s continued growth.”6. AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO)Value of Point72 Asset Management’s 13F Position: $269 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 52During the second quarter, Dumb Money's Steve Cohen increased his stake in AutoZone, Inc.

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly. Top 5 Upgrades: Citi upgraded O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $1,040, up from $983. The firm thinks the recent pullback in the shares presents an attractive buying opportunity ""for the stable, defensive retail stock.""Needham upgraded Ceridian (CDAY) to Buy from Hold with an $82 price target. A positive customer conference confirmed the firm's recent HCM channel conversations on stabilizing sales churn and improved win rates in the enterprise customer segment, the firm tells investors in a research note.BofA upgraded Trane Technologies (TT) to Neutral from Underperform with a price target of $210, up from $187. The company continues to outperform peers on revenue, adjusted earnings and free cash flow conversion, the firm tells investors in a research note.BofA upgraded Parker-Hannifin (PH) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $475, up from $435. The firm calls Parker-Hannifin a ""good company for uncertain times"" and sees it having ""long runway"" for a re-rating of the shares.RBC Capital upgraded Beacon (BECN) to Outperform from Sector Perform with a price target of $94, up from $91. The firm's roofing industry checks point to upside to guidance driven by residential roofing.Top 5 Downgrades:Citi downgraded Tractor Supply (TSCO) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $207, down from $250. The operating environment is getting tougher for Tractor Supply as big-ticket weakness continues, disinflation weighs on same-store-sales, and home-related spending slows, the firm argues.Exane BNP Paribas downgraded Yeti (YETI) to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $42, down from $54. While the recall of soft coolers makes it hard to assess Yeti's underlying demand, the firm's work suggests the company's trends are slowing.Raymond James downgraded Clorox (CLX) to Market Perform from Outperform without a price target after the company provided an update on fiscal Q1 that was significantly worse than expected due to the recent cybersecurity attack.Citi downgraded Floor &amp; Decor (FND) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $90, down from $122. The firm believes it is prudent to shift to a Neutral rating given the threat of higher rates for longer to existing home sales and home improvement spending. Jefferies downgraded Marriott Vacations (VAC) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $112, down from $150. The concerns over the macroeconomic outlook, notably consumer credit and interest rates, ""are driving a separation of timeshare business merits from valuations,"" the firm says.Top 5 Initiations: BofA initiated coverage of Wingstop (WING) with a Buy rating and $218 price target. The firm set its price target based on steady state earnings power at 7,000 U.S. stores and thinks that with only 6% share that Wingstop should continue to outpace the LSR chicken segment.Rosenblatt initiated coverage of Fabrinet (FN) with a Buy rating and $230 price target. Fabrinet, which makes very-short reach active optical cables, or AOCs, with 800G transceivers for Nvidia (NVDA) is ""one of the earliest and most direct beneficiaries of the strong ramp"" of the AI 800G Optical supply chain, the firm tells investors.BofA reinstated coverage of Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) with a Neutral rating and $33 price target. The firm notes margins are being pressured near-term by the longer maturity curve and in addition to margin headwinds, and sees risk to topline growth from slower consumer spending and ""still somewhat untested brand portability."" BofA reinstated coverage of Jack in the Box (JACK) with a Buy rating and $85 price target. The company's data driven approach has translated into higher restaurant volumes and structurally higher franchisee returns, ""the linchpin of unit growth,"" the firm says.BofA initiated coverage of Shake Shack (SHAK) with a Neutral rating and $66 price target. Shake Shack's average unit volumes are stabilizing and pricing will likely moderate, the firm tells investors. ]"

In the film, Cohen and other big Wall Street names like Melvin Capital Management founder Gabe Plotkin are shown as being big investors who are shorting meme stocks sitting in pandemic hideouts while retail investors gathered on social media platforms to boost meme stocks that were shorted by them. In the movie, the hedge fund managers doubt the knowledge of retail investors. In one scene, when the fictional Cohen and Plotkin discover the videos promoting GameStop on Reddit, the fictional Plotkin questions their credibility, saying ""Retail traders always lose.” Meanwhile, the Cohen character responded, “Guess these guys have decided to ignore all of the obvious secular trends."" “Or are they...illiterate?"". It appears that Steve Cohen's high-risk/high-reward strategy has helped his firm make significant gains so far in 2023, given that Point72's $33 billion stock portfolio is heavily weighted towards high-growth tech, consumer discretionary, and communication companies, which were the best performers in the first half of 2023. At a private SALT conference event, Dumb Money's Steve Cohen suggested investors bet on the ""big wave"" of artificial intelligence rather than focusing on a recession. He emphasized that focusing too much on the likelihood of a recession may cause investors to overlook AI investment opportunities. Among the AI stocks in which Cohen's firm invested heavily in the second quarter were NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE). Point72 increased its stake in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) by 306% to $1.8 billion, while boosting its stakes in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) by 68% and 52%, respectively. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL), Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTWO), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) are among the other AI stocks that Dumb Money's Steve Cohen is betting on now.Story continues""I'm making a prognostication — we're going up,"" he said, according to Bloomberg. ""I'm actually pretty bullish.""Aside from heavily investing in AI stocks, billionaire Steve Cohen has taken advantage of the volatility in healthcare and energy stocks during the second quarter. For instance, his firm significantly lifted its stake in Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D) by 151%, Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) by 96%, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) by 119% and Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (ZBH) by 120%. MethodologyAs Steve Cohen is one of the most prominent investors and founder of one of the world’s largest hedge funds, paying attention to Point72 Asset Management’s stock portfolio can help investors choose the right stocks. The following information is based on Point72 Asset Management’s second-quarter 13F filing. We track hedge funds like Bridgewater Associates because Insider Monkey research has shown that their consensus stock picks can deliver exceptional returns.15 Stocks Dumb Money’s Steve Cohen Is Betting On Now 15. Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D)Value of Point72 Asset Management’s 13F Position: $185 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 27Dumb Money's Steve Cohen used the selloff in Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D) stock price as a buying opportunity during the second quarter, increasing his stake in the company by 151%. Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D) operates in four segments: Dominion Energy Virginia, Gas Distribution, Dominion Energy South Carolina, and Contracted Assets. Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D) appears to be undervalued due to its low valuations and an expectation of sustainable earnings growth in the coming years. Its stock is currently trading at about 12 times forward earnings, compared to the sector median of 15 times. Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D) also offers a healthy over 6% dividend yield. According to Insider Monkey data, Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D) was in 27 hedge fund portfolios at the end of the second quarter. Diamond Hill Capital and Citadel Investment Group were the leading stakeholders in Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D). 14. Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX)Value of Point72 Asset Management’s 13F Position: $188.8 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 71Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) is one of the 15 stocks Dumb Money's Steve Cohen is betting on now. Steve Chohen's strategy of increasing his stake in Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) by 96% during the second quarter appears to be working, as the healthcare equipment provider's share price has soared in recent months, thanks to strong financial growth trends. Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) reported net sales of $3.5 billion in the second quarter, representing an 11% increase over the prior year period. Its GAAP net earnings per share of $0.18 rose from $0.17 per share a year ago.Baron Funds, an investment management firm, expressed confidence in Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) in its second-quarter investor letter because of its ability to grow revenue in the high single digits and earnings per share in the double digits. Here is what the firm stated Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX):“We re-established a position in Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX), a global developer, manufacturer, and marketer of medical devices that are used in a broad range of interventional medical specialties. We believe Boston Scientific can grow revenue reliably in the high single digits, driven by differentiated products in electrophysiology and structural heart. Coupled with cost discipline and over 50 basis points of annual operating margin expansion, we believe the company’s double-digit EPS growth profile makes Boston Scientific a compelling name within the large medical device universe.Within electrophysiology, we think Boston Scientific is well positioned as a leader in the emerging field of pulsed field ablation (PFA). Traditionally, physicians have used temperature-based methods (either hot or cold) to disable heart tissue responsible for irregular heartbeats. Temperature-based methods may damage surrounding tissue, however. Examples include damaging the esophagus (food tube) and the phrenic nerve (which controls breathing). PFA, in comparison, relies on electricity to damage aberrant tissue, and because different types of tissue have different electrical thresholds, the surrounding tissue can be selectively spared. Boston Scientific is ahead of the pack with high-quality, randomized controlled trial data (Advent) to come out in the back half of 2023. Electrophysiology is an $8 billion market growing 12%, and we believe Boston Scientific can grow significantly above this market rate as it takes share with its PFA program.Within structural heart, we like Boston Scientific’s position within left atrial appendage closure, which is a procedure that lowers stroke risk for atrial fibrillation patients. The company’s Watchman device continues to maintain dominant share (over 90%), and this is a $1 billion market growing over 25%. We are most excited about the potential for Watchman to expand into first-line therapy: currently patients would only get a Watchman if they cannot take anticoagulants because of bleeding risk; Boston Scientific is running the CHAMPION-AF trial to support Watchman as the first option. It has completed enrollment, and if the trial is successful, the company believes this has the potential to more than triple the addressable patients by 2027.”13. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)Value of Point72 Asset Management’s 13F Position: $188.9 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 125Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is one of the stocks in Point72’s portfolio that will benefit from the rising demand for artificial intelligence. With a stake worth $188.9 million, Dumb Money's Steve Cohen is betting big on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), up 48% from the previous quarter. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) manufactures and sells integrated circuits and other semiconductor devices in Taiwan, China, and around the world. NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) processors such as H100 and A100, which are used to power ChatGPT and data centres, are made exclusively by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM).Hedge fund positions in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) increased as well, rising from 104 in the first quarter to 125 in the second. 12. Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG)Value of Point72 Asset Management’s 13F Position: $192 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 68Additionally, Point72 increased its stake in healthcare equipment maker Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) by 119% during the second quarter. The firm appears to have benefited from its stake in Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), as the company's shares have risen around 10% year to date. Because Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) has been experiencing robust financial growth trends, the share price upside prospects appear promising. Its second-quarter revenue of $1.76 billion increased 16% year on year, while net income jumped 18%. Furthermore, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) raised its 2023 procedure growth rate forecast from 18%-21% to 20%-22%.In the second quarter investor letter, Baron Funds, an investment management company, presented several reasons that are likely to help Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) to outperform. Here is what the firm stated about Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG):“Strength in health care equipment was largely due to the outperformance of sleep apnea device company Inspire Medical Systems, Inc. and robotic surgery system pioneer Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG). Intuitive Surgical, Inc. manufactures and markets the da Vinci Surgical System, a robotic system used for minimally invasive procedures. Shares increased after Intuitive reported strong first-quarter financial results highlighted by a 26% increase in procedures and raised guidance for 2023. These results, which came in well above Street estimates, were driven by strength in general surgery procedures in the U.S. and non-urology procedures outside the U.S. We continue to believe Intuitive has a large opportunity to expand the use of robotic surgery over time.”11. Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW)Value of Point72 Asset Management’s 13F Position: $199.8 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 47Dumb Money's Steve Cohen, like Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

(NYSE:DELL) appears to be working. The company's stock has appreciated nearly 65% year to date. The share price upside of Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) is backed by increasing AI demand. In an earnings call, Jeff Clarke, Chief Operating Officer of Dell Technologies Inc.

(NYSE:ZBH) is a provider of orthopaedic reconstructive products in the healthcare industry. Following a steady increase in share price in the first half, Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.

(NASDAQ:META) during the second quarter to capitalize on massive share price gains, the firm still owned a $240 million stake in the company. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stock has soared 144% year to date, owing to increased ad revenue. Meta Platforms, Inc.

Meta was the largest contributor to performance. Its shares have almost fully recovered from last year’s declines, rising 35% during the quarter and 138% YTD. During the quarter, the company reported earnings that showed a return to growth and healthy user engagement metrics. Most importantly, profitability appears to have stabilized and is poised to improve as significant cost reduction actions implemented over the past six months begin to have an impact. Separate from fundamental performance, there is excitement over AI’s potential to help the company’s business. While Meta’s technology prowess and massively scaled media platform certainly position the company to take advantage of AI, we believe it’s far too early to estimate any discrete tangible benefits. Overall, we view AI as one of several drivers that will contribute to Meta’s continued growth.”6. AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO)Value of Point72 Asset Management’s 13F Position: $269 millionNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 52During the second quarter, Dumb Money's Steve Cohen increased his stake in AutoZone, Inc.

ANGO reported adjusted loss per share of 12 cents for first-quarter fiscal 2024, wider than the year-ago loss of 6 cents per share. However, the adjusted loss per share was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 14 cents per share.Excluding Dialysis and BioSentry, on a pro-forma basis, adjusted loss per share in first-quarter fiscal 2024 was 13 cents, narrower than the adjusted loss per share of 15 cents in the prior-year period.GAAP earnings per share (EPS) was $1.15, up 0.9% from the year-ago period’s EPS of $1.14.Revenue DetailsRevenues in the fiscal first quarter totaled $78.7 million, down 3.5% year over year both on a reported basis and at constant exchange rate (CER).

This figure compares to our fiscal first-quarter International revenues’ projection of $12.8 million.Excluding sales of Dialysis and BioSentry, International revenues also totaled $14.3 million, up 25.7%.Segmental AnalysisAngioDynamics derives revenues from two businesses — Med Tech and Med Device.The Med Tech business’ net sales in the fiscal first quarter were $25.9 million, reflecting an uptick of 13.3% year over year. This was primarily on the back of increased net sales of Auryon amounting to $11.1 million (up 25.7%) and NanoKnife disposable sales of $4.3 million (up 34.5%) compared with the prior-year quarter. AlphaVac sales in the reported quarter were $1.8 million, up 1.8% year over year. However, the improvement in the Med Tech segment was partially offset by a decline of 7.7% in AngioVac sales, which amounted to $6.3 million in the quarter.

QuoteMargin AnalysisIn the quarter under review, AngioDynamics’ gross profit fell 5.3% to $40.1 million. The gross margin contracted 97 basis points to 50.9%. We had projected 49.4% of gross margin for first-quarter fiscal 2024.Sales and marketing expenses rose 3.1% to $27.4 million year over year.

The company used the proceeds from the divestiture of its Dialysis and BioSentry Tract Sealant System Biopsy businesses to extinguish its debt during the fiscal first quarter.Net cash used in operating activities was $25.9 million compared with $24.7 million a year ago.FY24 GuidanceAngioDynamics has reiterated its guidance for fiscal 2024.The company continues to expect its net sales in the range of $328 million-$333 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $328.6 million.AngioDynamics also continues to project its Med Tech and Med Device revenue growths in the range of 20-25% and 1-3%, respectively.The adjusted loss per share is continued to be projected between 28 cents and 34 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same currently stands at a loss of 33 cents.Our TakeAngioDynamics exited the first quarter of fiscal 2024 with better-than-expected results. The solid uptick in revenues and narrower adjusted loss per share (both on a pro forma basis) were impressive. Robust domestic revenues (on a pro forma basis) and international revenues (both reported and on a pro forma basis) were also encouraging. The company continued gaining from its Med Tech business, which was promising. Robust sales of Auryon and NanoKnife looked encouraging. Strength in the Med Device segment on a pro forma basis raised optimism.However, AngioDynamics’ dismal top-line and bottom-line performances on a reported basis and lower revenues from AngioVac sales in the fiscal first quarter were disappointing. Lower U.S. revenues and Med Device segment’s revenues on a reported basis were also worrying. The gross margin contraction does not bode well. Continued supply-chain disruptions and raw material inflationary pressures also raise apprehension.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksAngioDynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks from the broader medical space that are supposed to report earnings soon are DaVita Inc.

A high FCF yield indicates that the company is generating more cash than the market values it for, suggesting that the company is undervalued.Flexibility and Growth Potential: Companies with a strong FCF have the flexibility to invest in growth opportunities without depending on external financing. This can include expanding operations, entering new markets, investing in research and development, or launching new product lines.Enhanced Shareholder Returns: High FCF yield can lead to enhanced returns for shareholders. Companies might use their FCF for share buybacks, which can drive up the share price, or for dividend payments, providing a direct return to shareholders.Debt Repayment: A high FCF allows companies to pay down debt faster, reducing interest costs and further strengthening the company's financial position.Acquisition and Strategic Moves: With ample free cash flow, companies can make strategic acquisitions to expand their market presence, diversify their portfolio, or eliminate competition.Buffer Against Economic Downturns: Companies with a high FCF yield are better positioned to weather economic downturns. They can continue to operate without needing to access external financing, which might be expensive or unavailable during tough economic times.Attractiveness to Investors: From an investment perspective, high FCF yield can be an indicator of undervaluation, suggesting that the stock price might rise as the market corrects this undervaluation. This can make these companies attractive targets for both individual and institutional investors.Reduced Manipulation: While earnings can sometimes be manipulated by changing accounting practices, FCF is a more concrete measure of a company's profitability, making it a more reliable metric for investors.Story continuesApplied Industrial TechnologiesApplied Industrial Technologies is a leading industrial distributor that provides critical components, equipment, and value-added services to a wide range of industries, from manufacturing to utilities.

BlackBerry (BB) announces plans to spin off its IoT — Internet of Things — segment via an IPO. Lastly, consumers react to Chinese EV maker Lucid's (LCID) unveiling of a discount version of its Air sedan EV.Yahoo Finance Live co-hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton break down the day's top trending stocks.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: What ended up pulling stocks lower on the day. Coca-Cola played a role. One of the worst performers on Wall Street and closing near a two-year low. Consumer staples stocks overall have been under pressure. Analysts are warning about the effects of weight loss drugs like Ozempic causing shoppers to buy less snacks and food, perhaps. Also, the strengthening dollar potentially causing some headaches for these US multinationals when they bring that profit back home.Josh, if I take a look at the sectors in the S&amp;P 500 today on the YFi Interactive XLP. That is the consumer staples ETF, far and away the worst performer of the major averages along with materials here. Real estate, and health care faring a little bit better here. And then if you look at the individual food stocks, here they are on the day. You've got Coke there, but Pepsi also down even more. Mondelez down 5%. As we were just talking about with Burt Flickinger, is this thesis valid that there's going to be less demand for this stuff? It's questionable, maybe.JOSH LIPTON: A lot of challenges, as Burt was bringing up. Access, affordability, side effects, there's a lot of challenges. I think with staples, too, today, as we were talking about, Julie, it could be-- listen, it's higher rates and maybe some worries here about the consumer and the economy. ConAgra also reported missed on sales, so not great for the staples either.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: Right. Exactly. So a lot of different factors here, and maybe people are looking to point the finger at the GLP ones as the culprit, but maybe the picture is a little more complex.JOSH LIPTON: Yeah, always is. Blackberry under pressure today on news. It plans an IPO for its Internet of Things division. It's the part of the business focused on adding online capabilities into appliances like cars and everyday items. So Blackberry, Julie, of course, used to be a cell phone giant, now a security software provider. Spinning off this IoT business-- Internet of Things-- analysts value that IoT segment at $1.7 billion. And some analysts did like the news, but investors not so much.JULIE HYMAN: Man, this is the season of spinoffs, is it not? We have had so many splits--JOSH LIPTON: Kellogg, Intel.JULIE HYMAN: --and spinoffs happening over the past week or so. So this is just the latest. Blackberry actually began this review back in May, its review of this business. It's only about, what, $2, $2 and 1/2 billion company total at this point. So interesting that it is doing this spinoff. Initially when it announced this after the close yesterday-- or maybe before the open today-- the stock initially went up before the regular session, and then ended up going down.And in fact, just anecdotally, these spinoffs that we've been watching in the last week or so have been punished when they are enacting the spinoff-- or, in some cases, when they're announcing the spinoff. So it seems like it's unclear if it's just a general risk aversion, or if it's specific to this decision that Blackberry has made.JOSH LIPTON: Tough day for Blackberry, and tough year, too, for those investors.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. And then there's one more automaker that we are watching today. That is Lucid in addition to GM, which we talked about earlier. Lucid announcing that it's going to offer a new cheaper version of its luxury air sedan. Investors don't seem pleased with that. The EV startup's new version has rear wheel drive, starting price of $77,000-- about $5000 less than the current low-cost option. You can see the shares are down about 7%. It's a luxury vehicle, and you're not even getting the all wheel drive. It's unclear to me if this is exactly why the stock is down so much. Like Rivian, this is one of those where there are just a lot of questions about the profitability.JOSH LIPTON: You mentioned Rivian, which is a good point, because I wonder if Rivian get knocked around, I wonder if that's a domino ripple effect, maybe telling Lucid--JULIE HYMAN: Could be.JOSH LIPTON: And also, listen, when you bring out a relatively cheaper product, some investors might get nervous about what do you-- what does that say about demand potentially? So maybe that's weighing as well.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. It could certainly be.JOSH LIPTON: Rough session, down 7%.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah.]"

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Hershey (HSY) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.53 a share, just 29 days from its upcoming earnings release on November 3, 2023.HSY has an Earnings ESP figure of 2.21%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.53 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.48.HSY is just one of a large group of Consumer Staples stocks with a positive ESP figure. Coca-Cola (KO) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Slated to report earnings on October 24, 2023, Coca-Cola holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $0.70 a share 19 days from its next quarterly update.For Coca-Cola, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.69 is 1.45%.Story continuesHSY and KO's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

(NYSE:DVA) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 10% in that time. On the bright side the share price is up over the last half decade. However we are not very impressed because the share price is only up 33%, less than the market return of 63%.While this past week has detracted from the company's five-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment. View our latest analysis for DaVita There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, DaVita managed to grow its earnings per share at 5.2% a year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 6% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..A Different PerspectiveDaVita provided a TSR of 4.7% over the last twelve months. But that return falls short of the market. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 6% a year, over half a decade) look better. Maybe the share price is just taking a breather while the business executes on its growth strategy. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand DaVita better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should learn about the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with DaVita (including 1 which is a bit concerning) .Story continuesThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

MMSI has been gaining from its strong product portfolio. The optimism led by solid second-quarter 2023 performance and international exposure are expected to contribute further. However, headwinds due to higher consolidation in the healthcare industry and stiff competition persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 13.6% compared with a 47.7% rise of the industry and 14.3% growth of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned medical device provider has a market capitalization of $3.85 billion. The company projects 11.5% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. It has delivered an earnings surprise of 15.8% for the past four quarters, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strong Product Portfolio: Merit Medical has continued to gain significant momentum on the back of new products. The company is upbeat about the product pipeline, including radio and electrophysiology products, raising investors’ optimism. It has several electrophysiology products that are either on track for release or in several other stages of development.In September, Merit Medical announced the U.S. commercial release of its Aspira Bottle.International Exposure: We are optimistic about Merit Medical’s worldwide product distribution network, which includes territories in Europe, the Middle East, Africa (EMEA) and Asia, among others. On the second quarter of 2023 earnings call, Merit Medical confirmed that growth in U.S. and international sales drove its overall top line.Per management, Asia Pacific (APAC) was the primary driver of better-than-expected results, although both the EMEA and Rest of World regions were at the upper end of Merit Medical’s growth expectations in the second quarter. APAC growth was driven by sales in China, which increased year over year as the improving trends in March continued into the second quarter.Strong Q2 Results: Merit Medical’s robust second-quarter 2023 results buoy optimism. The company witnessed a year-over-year uptick in the top and bottom lines. The company also saw revenue growth in both its segments and across all the product categories within its Cardiovascular unit. Robust performances in the United States and outside were also seen. The expansion of gross margin bodes well for the stock.Story continuesDownsidesHigher Consolidation in the Healthcare Industry: Healthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade. Thus, to provide healthcare solutions at a cheaper rate and eradicate competition, large-cap MedTech behemoths have started consolidating with mid-cap and small-cap companies. This enables the availability of healthcare products at cheap prices in the market.Per management, such trends compel Merit Medical’s customers to ask for price concessions in its products, which act against the ongoing business strategies. This may also exert a solid downward pressure on the prices of Merit Medical’s products and reduce the customer base.Stiff Competition: Merit Medical operates in highly competitive markets, where it faces competition from many companies with greater resources. The company competes globally in several market areas, including radiology and interventional cardiology. Such resources and market presence may enable the competitors to market competing products more efficiently or at reduced prices to gain market share.Estimate TrendMerit Medical is witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved a penny south to $2.88.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $306.3 million, suggesting a 6.6% rise from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc. DVA, McKesson Corporation MCK and Integer Holdings Corporation ITGR.DaVita, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 12.7%.

ANGO reported adjusted loss per share of 12 cents for first-quarter fiscal 2024, wider than the year-ago loss of 6 cents per share. However, the adjusted loss per share was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 14 cents per share.Excluding Dialysis and BioSentry, on a pro-forma basis, adjusted loss per share in first-quarter fiscal 2024 was 13 cents, narrower than the adjusted loss per share of 15 cents in the prior-year period.GAAP earnings per share (EPS) was $1.15, up 0.9% from the year-ago period’s EPS of $1.14.Revenue DetailsRevenues in the fiscal first quarter totaled $78.7 million, down 3.5% year over year both on a reported basis and at constant exchange rate (CER). The top line topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.3%.On a pro forma basis, excluding sales of Dialysis and BioSentry, net sales were $78 million, up 5.7% (up 5.8% at CER) compared with the prior-year quarter.The company continued to see strong contributions from its Med Tech (which includes the Auryon peripheral atherectomy platform, the thrombus management platform and the NanoKnife irreversible electroporation platform) business during the quarter.Geographical AnalysisIn the quarter under review, U.S. net revenues totaled $64.4 million, down 6.7% year over year. This figure compares to our U.S. net revenues’ fiscal first-quarter projection of $64.8 million.Excluding sales of Dialysis and BioSentry, U.S. net revenues totaled $63.7 million, up 2.1%.International revenues came in at $14.3 million, up 14.1% from the year-ago quarter on a reported basis and up 14.4% at CER. This figure compares to our fiscal first-quarter International revenues’ projection of $12.8 million.Excluding sales of Dialysis and BioSentry, International revenues also totaled $14.3 million, up 25.7%.Segmental AnalysisAngioDynamics derives revenues from two businesses — Med Tech and Med Device.The Med Tech business’ net sales in the fiscal first quarter were $25.9 million, reflecting an uptick of 13.3% year over year. This was primarily on the back of increased net sales of Auryon amounting to $11.1 million (up 25.7%) and NanoKnife disposable sales of $4.3 million (up 34.5%) compared with the prior-year quarter. AlphaVac sales in the reported quarter were $1.8 million, up 1.8% year over year. However, the improvement in the Med Tech segment was partially offset by a decline of 7.7% in AngioVac sales, which amounted to $6.3 million in the quarter. This figure compares to our fiscal first-quarter’s Med Tech business’ net sales projection of $27.8 million.Story continuesMed Device revenues in the fiscal first quarter grossed $52.8 million, down 10% from the year-ago period. This figure compares to our fiscal first quarter’s Med Device business’ net sales projection of $49.8 million.Excluding sales of Dialysis and BioSentry, Med Device revenues totaled $52.1 million, up 2.3%.AngioDynamics, Inc.

QuoteMargin AnalysisIn the quarter under review, AngioDynamics’ gross profit fell 5.3% to $40.1 million. The gross margin contracted 97 basis points to 50.9%. We had projected 49.4% of gross margin for first-quarter fiscal 2024.Sales and marketing expenses rose 3.1% to $27.4 million year over year. Research and development expenses decreased 4.7% year over year to $7.9 million, whereas general and administrative expenses increased 7.5% year over year to $10.9 million. Adjusted operating expenses of $46.2 million increased 2.6% year over year.The adjusted operating loss totaled $6.1 million, wider than the prior-year quarter’s adjusted operating loss of $2.7 million.Cash PositionAngioDynamics exited first-quarter fiscal 2024 with cash and cash equivalents of $57.6 million compared with $44.6 million at the end of fiscal 2023. The company used the proceeds from the divestiture of its Dialysis and BioSentry Tract Sealant System Biopsy businesses to extinguish its debt during the fiscal first quarter.Net cash used in operating activities was $25.9 million compared with $24.7 million a year ago.FY24 GuidanceAngioDynamics has reiterated its guidance for fiscal 2024.The company continues to expect its net sales in the range of $328 million-$333 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $328.6 million.AngioDynamics also continues to project its Med Tech and Med Device revenue growths in the range of 20-25% and 1-3%, respectively.The adjusted loss per share is continued to be projected between 28 cents and 34 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same currently stands at a loss of 33 cents.Our TakeAngioDynamics exited the first quarter of fiscal 2024 with better-than-expected results. The solid uptick in revenues and narrower adjusted loss per share (both on a pro forma basis) were impressive. Robust domestic revenues (on a pro forma basis) and international revenues (both reported and on a pro forma basis) were also encouraging. The company continued gaining from its Med Tech business, which was promising. Robust sales of Auryon and NanoKnife looked encouraging. Strength in the Med Device segment on a pro forma basis raised optimism.However, AngioDynamics’ dismal top-line and bottom-line performances on a reported basis and lower revenues from AngioVac sales in the fiscal first quarter were disappointing. Lower U.S. revenues and Med Device segment’s revenues on a reported basis were also worrying. The gross margin contraction does not bode well. Continued supply-chain disruptions and raw material inflationary pressures also raise apprehension.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksAngioDynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks from the broader medical space that are supposed to report earnings soon are DaVita Inc.

GMED is gaining from strategically expanding its global presence to address the unmet demand for musculoskeletal devices. This business reports gains across expandables, biologics, MIS screws, 3D-printed implants, and cervical offerings. However, several macroeconomic issues are adversely affecting the company’s profit margins. A significant FX headwind is another downside.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has declined 18.4% compared with the 2.9% fall of the industry and a 13.3% increase of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned medical device company has a market capitalization of $7.08 billion. Globus Medical projects a long-term estimated earnings growth rate of 11.5% compared with 15.5% of the industry.Let’s delve deeper.UpsidesMusculoskeletal Prospects Strong: Globus Medical is gaining market share in the musculoskeletal solutions space, banking on the solid performance of implantable devices, biologics, accessories, and unique surgical instruments used in an expansive range of spinal, orthopedic and neurosurgical procedures.The company is particularly seeing notable gains across its product portfolio in expandables, biologics, MIS screws, 3D printed implants, and cervical offerings. In the past few quarters, this business has registered above-market growth driven by competitive rep recruiting from prior quarters and robotic pull-through. In the second quarter of 2023, Globus Medical launched three new products — REFLECT, MARVEL and Ossifuse.Prominent Trend Improvement: Since the beginning of 2023, continued market share gain within the U.S. Spine, higher sales of Enabling Technologies' robotic systems, new sales related to the rollout of the Excelsius3D imaging system, and continued growth within its trauma business contributed to this growth. Enabling Technology sales were up 54.5% during the first six months of 2023, driven by robotic and imaging system sales. The company expects increased interest in sales with significant international gains of ExcelsiusGPS in EMEA and Asia Pacific, leading to future implant pull-through and substantial market share gains.Story continuesIndustry Prospects Impressive: Per Transparency Market Research, with a substantial increase in the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders across the world, the global musculoskeletal diseases market has been witnessing a tremendous rise in size and valuation.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchA report by Industry ARC states that the Global Musculoskeletal Diseases market will witness a CAGR of almost 5.5% and post a modest revenue of $79.4 billion by 2023. Needless to add, these trends are expected to generate higher demand for Globus Medical’s core products.DownsidesMacroeconomic Concerns Curb Profit: Like other industry players, Globus Medical is currently grappled by negative trends in the global economy, including interest rate fluctuations, increases in inflation and financial market volatility. These factors are adversely affecting the company’s operations and financial performance. The global inflation, in particular, has led to a significant rise in the cost of raw materials for the company. In the second quarter, the company incurred an 11.7% rise in the cost of goods sold.Exposure to Currency Movement: Globus Medical records 14.8% of its sales from the international market. A significant portion of the company’s foreign revenues and expenses is generated in Japan, the Euro zone, the U.K. and Australia.  This makes it highly vulnerable to currency fluctuations. For 2022, the company reported a foreign currency transaction loss of $1.02 million.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings per share (EPS) has been constant at $2.31 in the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $1.13 billion. This suggests a 10.2% rise from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc.

After years of overpriced rent payments and being unable to purchase a home on the open market, Onisha says becoming a part of Habitat for Humanity's BuildBetter with Whirlpool program is a perfect fit.Owning a home will ""bring stability to me and my boys,"" she says. ""Not only that, but it will teach us that we can get anything in life as long as we try.""Onisha applied and was accepted into Habitat for Humanity of Horry County's homeownership program. Her affordable mortgage through Habitat's BuildBetter program gives Onisha the opportunity to provide a safe and stable home for her boys. Providing security through a new Habitat home will make a huge difference in the lives of everyone in her family.Raised by her grandmother and her aunt, Onisha says motherhood and faith hold even more importance in her life. Having experienced many personal trials and tribulations, she has kept God at the center of her life, never giving up hope. That positive outlook helped her to work through her local Habitat's homebuyer program with ease and determination. By fulfilling her 300 sweat-equity hours - the time future Habitat homeowners spend building their homes and the homes of others - she has learned how to install vinyl siding and other important skills.Onisha's three-bedroom, two-bathroom home has energy-efficient doors, windows, heating and cooling system, insulation, and more. The family also received an energy-efficient refrigerator and range, which Whirlpool Corporation donates to every Habitat-built home in North America. Onisha says the appliances her home was equipped with are the nicest she has ever had. She said that having clean appliances that work is a huge upgrade, and her energy bill has been reduced significantly since she moved into her new home. Through good times and difficult times, Onisha's family has been there to support her, and this includes her new Habitat family of volunteers and supporters. To Onisha, home is a place to live and enjoy life to its fullest. It's a place to feel safe.Story continuesThe BuildBetter with Whirlpool initiative is an expansion of Habitat's existing BuildBetter program, which will build more than 250 climate-resilient and energy-efficient homes across the country, with a goal of delivering an almost 15 percent increase in energy efficiency compared to conventional homes. The program will help hundreds of families in need of affordable housing over three years.View original content here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Whirlpool Corporation on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Whirlpool CorporationWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/whirlpool-corporationEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Whirlpool CorporationView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/790312/buildbetter-with-whirlpool-helps-family-find-safety-and-stability-in-a-new-habitat-home]"

Better yet, you'd like to see the share price move up more than the market average. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Cincinnati Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:CINF) share price is up 38% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. Looking at the last year alone, the stock is up 5.6%.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. See our latest analysis for Cincinnati Financial While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Cincinnati Financial managed to grow its earnings per share at 8.8% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 7% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock. The reasonably low P/E ratio of 11.66 also suggests market apprehension.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Cincinnati Financial, it has a TSR of 57% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveCincinnati Financial shareholders are up 8.6% for the year (even including dividends). But that return falls short of the market. If we look back over five years, the returns are even better, coming in at 9% per year for five years. It's quite possible the business continues to execute with prowess, even as the share price gains are slowing. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Cincinnati Financial , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Cincinnati Financial is not the only stock insiders are buying.

314,5120e5d9-2e88-3804-9eaf-f43088e918de,GE,2023-10-06,Wind Power by Country in 2023: Top 15,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wind-power-country-2023-top-081855816.html,1696580335,STORY,"['GE', 'EQNR']","[This article covers Wind Power by Country in 2023: Top 15, offering detailed insights into the countries dominating the wind energy market in the current year. You can skip this part and read Wind Power by Country in 2023: Top 5. Wind energy helps to avoid 329 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually, which is equivalent to the emissions of 71 million cars. These emissions can cause acid rain, smog, and greenhouse gases. In addition, wind power, being a renewable energy source, helps countries such as the United States reduce their reliance on fossil fuels. Global Wind Power DataAccording to the Global Wind Energy Council, 77.6 gigawatts (GW) of new wind power capacity was connected to power grids worldwide in 2022, bringing the total installed wind capacity to 906 GW, a 9% increase from 2021.The top five markets for new wind installations in 2022 were China, the United States, Brazil, Germany, and Sweden, which accounted for 71% of global wind installations last year, down 3.7% from 2021. This decline was primarily due to the world's two largest wind markets, China and the United States, losing a combined 5% market share compared to the previous year. This is the second consecutive year that both countries have lost market share.Meanwhile, the global grid-connected wind power capacity is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.1% to reach 2.38 terawatts (TW) by 2032, driven by increased activity in Western markets and Africa.This long-term growth in cumulative installed wind power capacity will occur despite short-term challenges that have caused a net downgrade of 10.1 gigawatts (GW) from 2023 to 2025. Moreover, the wind industry has proven to be a critical driver of local economic development, creating skilled jobs, maintaining essential infrastructure, and significantly reducing carbon emissions while providing clean, affordable, and reliable energy.The U.S. wind industry employs over 120,000 people across all 50 states, and this number is growing rapidly. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, wind turbine service technicians are the second-fastest-growing job in the U.S. Story continuesMeanwhile, Morocco is expected to create 75,000 new jobs in another part of the world and contribute $1.2 billion to the country's economy over the next four years, according to a report by the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC).Wind Power Installations and TechnologyCountries are building new renewable energy plants with the rising need to reduce emissions and reach their net-zero targets in the coming decades. Consequently, the United States and Europe aim to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, while Saudi Arabia and the UAE, the two largest economies in the Arab world, plan to reach the target by 2060 and 2050, respectively.As a result, the wind power sector is experiencing significant growth. For example, in August 2023, Equinor (NYSE:EQNR)'s Hywind Tampen wind farm, the world's largest floating offshore wind farm, opened with 11 wind turbines and a capacity of 88 MW, which meets about 35% of the annual power demand for oil and gas fields in the North Sea.Moreover, the wind farm is expected to reduce CO2 emissions by 200,000 tonnes annually. Experts believe that with Hywind Tampen, Equinor (NYSE:EQNR) has successfully demonstrated its ability to plan, build, and commission a large, floating offshore wind farm in the North Sea.Equinor (NYSE:EQNR) has an annual production of around 105 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of power. To utilize this power to its full potential, the company is considering expanding its portfolio in Poland by acquiring a 26 MW onshore wind farm. Meanwhile, the clean energy technologies market is expected to grow by $94.99 billion from 2022 to 2027 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.94%, according to Technavio. For this reason, the wind power sector is also leveraging the advancements in AI and technology to maximize potential. One example is General Electric (NYSE:GE), the American multinational conglomerate which developed a cutting-edge AI/ML tool in 2022. The tool was designed to help the global wind industry save billions of dollars in logistics costs over the next decade.Moreover, the General Electric (NYSE:GE) scientists who developed cutting-edge AI/ML technology won the prestigious Manufacturing Leadership Award (MLA) from the National Association of Manufacturers.With this new tool, General Electric (NYSE:GE) revealed that a digital twin of the wind turbine logistics process could accurately predict and optimize logistics costs. Based on current industry growth projections, this could enable a 10% reduction in logistics costs for the global wind industry, saving up to $2.6 billion annually by 2030.Wind Power by Country in 2023: Top 15A close up of a wind turbine producing electricity as the sun sets. Editorial photo for a financial news article. 8k. --ar 16:9MethodologyWe compiled a list of the top countries with wind power generation capacity. To determine the countries with the most wind power generation worldwide, we used two metrics as major indicators: installed wind power capacity (MW) in 2022 and share of wind power as total consumption.The share of wind power as total consumption is a metric that measures the percentage of electricity generated from wind energy relative to the overall electricity consumption in a given region or country. For example, if Ireland has a 34% share of wind power, 34% of the electricity consumed in Ireland comes from wind turbines.We wanted to find the countries that scored the highest on these indicators because of their wind power generation capacity and overall consumption. We assigned equal weights of 0.5 to each metric to reach accurate rankings. We then calculated a weighted average score for each country and ranked the countries with the highest scores on these metrics. We collected data on the relevant metrics from different websites. We got installed wind power capacity (MW) from 2022  from Irena.org and share of wind power as total consumption from Visual Capitalist. Below is our complete list of wind power by country in 2023: top 15. Wind Power by Country in 2023: Top 1515.

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether General Electric's current trading price of US$109 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at General Electric’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for General Electric What's The Opportunity In General Electric?Good news, investors! General Electric is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $153.90, but it is currently trading at US$109 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. What’s more interesting is that, General Electric’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of General Electric look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Though in the case of General Electric, it is expected to deliver a highly negative earnings growth in the next few years, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Although GE is currently undervalued, the adverse prospect of negative growth brings about some degree of risk. I recommend you think about whether you want to increase your portfolio exposure to GE, or whether diversifying into another stock may be a better move for your total risk and return.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on GE for a while, but hesitant on making the leap, I recommend you dig deeper into the stock. Given its current undervaluation, now is a great time to make a decision. But keep in mind the risks that come with negative growth prospects in the future.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing General Electric at this point in time.

The rise of meme stocks in the past has been a mix of ideology against hedge funds to more commonly, simply retail traders riding a wave of hype and FOMO, or the fear of missing out.The companies in this list are well-known meme stocks. However, there have been some recent developments for investors to consider, thus putting them back on the table for consideration. So here are the best meme stocks to buy as we close out September.AMC Entertainment (AMC)AMC IPO on New York Stock Exchange on December 18 in USA, New York. AMC is theater chain. AMC and APE StockSource: Elnur / Shutterstock.comAMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) has been a favorite among retail investors and has experienced significant volatility. The company has capitalized on its meme stock status by raising capital, improving its balance sheet, and investing in growth opportunities.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIn terms of operational performance, AMC reported improvements in Q2 earnings, with a net loss reduction and a 16% increase in sales. The company witnessed higher guest turnout and increased per-patron revenue from food and beverages. CEO Adam Aron also announced potential ventures like launching branded products, including “Great Ape Ale” beer and premium chocolate and candy.The company successfully raised $326 million through the sale of additional common shares, bolstering its financial position alongside its existing cash reserves and assets. The company also trades at undervalued levels when examining its fundamentals, which makes it one of those meme stocks to consider watching closely.GameStop (GME)GameStop (GME) sign on side of building in blue early morning lightSource: shutterstock.com/EchoVisualsGameStop (NYSE:GME) has undergone significant changes with a focus on e-commerce and has been at the center of its pivot. The company’s shift to digital sales, expansion of product offerings, and the potential for further strategic changes make it one of those meme stocks to watch.Story continuesIn its most recent quarterly result, GME stock reported a narrower loss than anticipated and provided an optimistic forward guidance. The recent earnings report suggests that GameStop has been prudent with its resources, aligning its costs more effectively with its addressable market and setting the stage for a potentially strong Q4 and holiday season.In Q2, GameStop reported net sales of $1.164 billion, a slight increase from $1.136 billion in the prior year’s quarter. SG&amp;A expenses were reduced to 27.7% of net sales from 34.1%, and net loss significantly decreased to $2.8 million from $108.7 million in the same quarter of the previous year.If these positive fundamentals are maintained, then it may pivot from a speculative meme stock to one value investors may find themselves holding.General Electric (GE)Company breakups: The General Electric GE logo on a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comIt may seem unusual for General Electric (NYSE:GE) to be on this list. However, after its historical prominence, it then largely fell into disfavor from investors, with the brunt of its criticism being directed toward what some describe as ineffective management. However, there are signs GE stock is turning a corner and is gaining a bit of a cult following.The company has been undergoing restructuring and focusing on its core industrial businesses, which could lead to improved financial performance. The stock’s recent momentum and potential for further growth make it a candidate for investors seeking opportunities in the industrial sector.Adding spice to the bullish brew is that Deutsche Bank recently predicted a 25% upside for GE’s stock from current levels. Aside from this recommendation, GE has been improving its balance sheet as well as improving its internal efficiency to lift its overall return on equity for investors. It’s developments like these that make GE stock one of those meme stocks to consider.On the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

317,e6b3d87b-cb99-3642-b8b2-54148c8187bf,VLO,2023-10-06,Valero Energy (VLO) Upgraded to Buy: Here's What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/valero-energy-vlo-upgraded-buy-160005355.html,1696521605,STORY,['VLO'],"[Valero Energy (VLO) could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Valero Energy basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.For Valero Energy, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for Valero EnergyThis oil refiner is expected to earn $26.45 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2023, which represents a year-over-year change of -9.3%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Valero Energy. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 19.3%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Valero Energy to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.CVR Energy (CVI) is a stock many investors are watching right now. CVI is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), as well as a Value grade of A.Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. CVI has a P/S ratio of 0.31. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.34.Finally, we should also recognize that CVI has a P/CF ratio of 3.97. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. CVI's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 4.84. Within the past 12 months, CVI's P/CF has been as high as 6.56 and as low as 2.74, with a median of 4.27.Investors could also keep in mind Valero Energy (VLO), an Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing stock with a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and Value grade of A.Shares of Valero Energy currently holds a Forward P/E ratio of 7.27, and its PEG ratio is 1.21. In comparison, its industry sports average P/E and PEG ratios of 7.40 and 0.85.Story continuesVLO's Forward P/E has been as high as 8.76 and as low as 4.41, with a median of 6.25. During the same time period, its PEG ratio has been as high as 1.46, as low as 0.73, with a median of 1.04.Furthermore, Valero Energy holds a P/B ratio of 1.69 and its industry's price-to-book ratio is 1.99. VLO's P/B has been as high as 2.31, as low as 1.39, with a median of 1.84 over the past 12 months.These are just a handful of the figures considered in CVR Energy and Valero Energy's great Value grade.

EL is grappling with a persistent inflationary environment. The leading skincare, makeup, fragrance and hair care product provider is seeing weakness in the Asia travel retail business. Unfavorable foreign currency headwinds are a concern.These factors hurt EL’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 profits. Margins also remained soft in the quarter. Management offered a dull view for the fiscal first quarter.  Shares of the Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock have slumped 42.6% year-to-date compared with the industry’s 31% decline. The stock has underperformed the Zacks Consumer Staples’s decline of 12% during this time.Let’s discuss further.Q4 Margins HurtIn fourth-quarter fiscal 2023, The Estee Lauder Companies’ adjusted gross profit came in at $2,467 million, down 3% year over year. The gross margin contracted to 67.8% from 71% reported in the year-ago quarter. The downside was caused by the under-absorption of overhead in its plants stemming from the pull-down of production during the year. The company’s operating income fell 66% to $71 million while its operating margin contracted 380 basis points (bps) to 2%. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased 70 bps, thanks to increased advertising and promotional activities.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVolatile Currency: A ConcernThanks to The Estee Lauder Companies’ solid international presence, it remains exposed to unfavorable currency fluctuations. Any adverse currency fluctuation will likely dent the company’s operating performance. For fiscal 2024, management projects an unfavorable currency impact of 1% on net sales. Currency headwinds will likely affect net earnings per share (EPS) by nearly 11 cents in fiscal 2024.Drab Q1 OutlookIn its last earnings call, management highlighted that it is cautious about economic hurdles in China, volatile inflation levels, foreign currency fluctuations and concerns surrounding recession (in several global markets). For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Estee Lauder anticipates reported and organic net sales to decline 12-10% year over year. The bottom line is envisioned in the band of a loss of 31 cents per share and a loss of 21 cents in the fiscal first quarter. On a constant-currency basis, the bottom line is likely to range between a loss of 29 cents and a loss of 19 cents per share.Story continuesFinal ThoughtsThe Estee Lauder Companies has a strong online business and the company expects it to be a major growth engine for the upcoming years. The company has a strong presence in emerging markets, which insulates it from the macroeconomic headwinds in the matured markets. Management is on track to expand its consumer reach in productive distribution across high-growth channels while strategically expanding brands into new countries.All said, whether these upsides can help the company keep its growth story alive amid hurdles is yet to be seen.Top 3 PicksInter Parfums IPAR, which manufactures, markets and distributes a range of fragrances and fragrance-related products, carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum.

It is worth considering Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), which belongs to the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry.This world's largest consumer products maker has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 3.79%.For the most recent quarter, P&amp;G was expected to post earnings of $1.32 per share, but it reported $1.37 per share instead, representing a surprise of 3.79%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.32 per share, while it actually produced $1.37 per share, a surprise of 3.79%.With this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for P&amp;G. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.P&amp;G has an Earnings ESP of +0.06% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on October 18, 2023.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and the dividend capture strategy, and go directly to read 5 Best October Dividend Stocks To Buy. Dividend payments around the world have been growing significantly because investors are increasingly interested in income-generating assets. This strong reputation of dividend stocks didn't happen overnight; it's based on historical data that demonstrates how these stocks have consistently performed better than other types of investments over the years. Companies that regularly increase their dividends are particularly attractive in this scenario. They are considered real winners because they not only garner appreciation from investors but also thrive in changing market conditions. According to a report by Morgan Stanley, dividends are a crucial investment for long-term investors. Stocks with high dividends typically do well when inflation is higher than usual but on a downward trend. These stocks are also considered safe and become even more appealing during uncertain economic times because they provide stability and reliable income.As mentioned above, global dividends have experienced significant growth this year. China's largest companies have paid out 1.5 trillion yuan ($206 billion) in dividends this year, which has already exceeded the 1.27 trillion yuan paid out in 2022, according to a report by Bloomberg. The major contributors to this increase are the largest state-owned banks, with PetroChina and Kweichow Moutai following closely behind. Similarly, Janus Henderson reported that 98% of US companies either increased their dividends or maintained them at the same level in the second quarter of 2023. This percentage is significantly higher than the global average.Dividend investing can be a sound strategy for long-term investors. Holding onto stocks with consistently increasing dividends can lead to higher yields on original investment over time. Regular dividend hikes often contribute to an increase in the stock's share price. According to a recent report by T. Rowe Price, between the end of 1985 to the close of 2022, dividend growers in the Russell 1000 Index performed better than the broader benchmark index. Furthermore, these dividend-growing stocks showed lower levels of price fluctuations or volatility. Some of the best dividend stocks in this regard are The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) as these firms have consistently increased their dividend payments for many years.Story continuesIn addition to long-term investors, dividend investing can be appealing to some short-term investors through a dividend capture strategy. It involves purchasing a stock just before it goes ex-dividend and then selling it shortly thereafter, typically after the dividend is received. This strategy aims to capture the dividend income while minimizing exposure to the stock's price fluctuations. To learn more about this investment approach, have a look at our article Dividend Capture Strategy Stocks To Buy.10 Best October Dividend Stocks To Buy Our Methodology:This list outlines the dividend capture strategy for selecting prominent dividend stocks that will trade ex-dividend in October 2023.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. SL Green (SLG) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.30 a share, just 13 days from its upcoming earnings release on October 18, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $1.30 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.28 Zacks Consensus Estimate, SL Green has an Earnings ESP of 1.45%.SLG is just one of a large group of Finance stocks with a positive ESP figure. HIVE Digital Technologies (HIVE) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.HIVE Digital Technologies is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on November 13, 2023. HIVE's Most Accurate Estimate sits at -$0.08 a share 39 days from its next earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HIVE Digital Technologies is -$0.13, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 36%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, SLG and HIVE could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-06-30, UDR Inc's dividend payout ratio is 1.47, which may suggest that the company's dividend may not be sustainable.UDR Inc's profitability rank, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers. GuruFocus ranks UDR Inc's profitability 8 out of 10 as of 2023-06-30, suggesting good profitability prospects. The company has reported positive net income for each of year over the past decade, further solidifying its high profitability.Looking Ahead: Growth Metrics of UDR IncTo ensure the sustainability of dividends, a company must have robust growth metrics. UDR Inc's growth rank of 8 out of 10 suggests that the company's growth trajectory is good relative to its competitors. UDR Inc's revenue has increased by approximately 5.30% per year on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 70.05% of global competitors. The company's 3-year EPS growth rate showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical component for sustaining dividends in the long run. During the past three years, UDR Inc's earnings increased by approximately -25.50% per year on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 17.6% of global competitors. Lastly, the company's 5-year EBITDA growth rate of -13.50%, which outperforms approximately 13.79% of global competitors.ConclusionIn conclusion, UDR Inc's consistent dividend payments, impressive growth rates, and strong profitability rank make it an attractive option for investors seeking dividend income. However, its high payout ratio raises questions about the sustainability of its dividends in the long run. Therefore, investors should closely monitor the company's earnings and growth metrics to make informed decisions.

Nevertheless, in the near term, the choppy office market conditions amid macroeconomic uncertainty and remote work may reduce the demand for office spaces, which could impact leasing activities. This challenge is further exacerbated by the elevated interest rates, adding to the company's current difficulties.Vornado's focus on having assets in a few select high-rent, high-barrier-to-entry geographic markets, along with a diversified tenant base that includes several industry bellwethers, is expected to drive steady cash flows and fuel its growth over the long term. Although we expect property rental revenues to be moderate in 2023 and 2024, the metric is estimated to exhibit a 6.2% year-over-year increase in 2025.The office-using job growth, enhanced space efficiency and the expansion of tech, finance and media firms are set to boost rental revenues in the upcoming periods. New York remains an attractive destination for office occupiers seeking to expand their workspace.Rents in recently built or excellently revitalized properties, featuring ample amenities in well-connected areas, have surged. Vornado, adept at providing premium office spaces, is poised to capitalize on this emerging trend effectively.The company is engaged in targeted expansions and divestitures, along with strategic business spin-offs. These strategic divestitures furnish it with the necessary resources to reinvest in advantageous development and revitalization projects. VNO entered into an agreement to dispose of four Manhattan retail properties for $100 million in late July 2023. In the same month, it disposed of The Armory Show in New York for $24.4 million.Vornado enjoys a strong balance sheet strength. It exited the second quarter of 2023 with $3.2 billion of liquidity. Moreover, VNO has been securing loan refinancing in recent times, enabling it to reduce interest rates on borrowings and extend debt maturities. A flexible financial position will enable it to take advantage of future investment opportunities and fund its development projects.Story continuesAnalysts also seem optimistic regarding VNO’s growth prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 and 2024 funds from operations (FFO) per share has been revised marginally upward over the past seven days. Further, VNO currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past six months, shares of VNO have rallied 39.3% against the industry's decline of 13.8%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, there is choppiness in the office market amid uncertain macroeconomic situation and the continuing remote work arrangement. This is expected to subdue demand for office properties in the near term, subsequently impacting leasing activities.A hike in interest rates is likely to increase borrowing costs, affecting the company’s ability to purchase or develop real estate. High interest expenses during the second quarter of 2023 marred the company’s FFO per share growth. For 2023, management expects an additional interest expense of roughly 40 cents per share due to rising interest rates. Moreover, with high interest rates in place, the dividend payout might seem to be less attractive than the yields on fixed-income and money market accounts.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Welltower WELL, EastGroup Properties EGP and Americold Realty Trust COLD. Each of these companies presently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Welltower’s current-year FFO per share has moved marginally northward over the past month to $3.55.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EastGroup’s 2023 FFO per share has moved nearly 1% upward in the past two months to $7.63.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Americold’s ongoing year’s FFO per share has been raised marginally upward over the past month to $1.26.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO), a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Durbin's queries come as major airlines have clashed with him over credit card fee legislation as well.Durbin, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, asked both airlines in a letter how they are ""ensuring that this profit is not earned at the expense of a fair, pleasant, and affordable travel experience for consumers?""Durbin also sought answers on how airlines are ensuring ""consumers are not saddled with excessive or unnecessary fees.""The Biden administration earlier this year asked Congress to mandate airlines to pay cash compensation for delays of three hours or more when carriers are responsible, and provide new requirements for transparency over fees such as for baggage when booking tickets.Congress has so far largely ignored those requests. A House aviation policy bill approved in July would bar airlines from charging family seating fees but would not set minimum seat sizes or impose new rules for compensation for delays.Durbin's letter also went to Nick Calio, who heads Airlines for America, an industry trade group. United, American and the trade group did not comment.Major airlines have heavily lobbied Congress in recent months to reject legislation co-sponsored by Durbin they say threatens their ability to offering rewards credit cards that give consumers frequent flyer miles for making transactions.Durbin says the bill would address ""outrageous"" fees charged by Visa and Mastercard, and boost competition by directing the Federal Reserve to ensure that large credit card-issuing banks offer a choice of at least two networks over which an electronic credit transaction may be processed.The bill would not apply to American Express. Delta Air, which has a frequent flyer credit card with American Express, did not receive a letter from Durbin.Airline unions oppose the bill they say ""would provide a massive competitive advantage to Delta.""

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly. Top 5 Upgrades: Citi upgraded O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $1,040, up from $983. The firm thinks the recent pullback in the shares presents an attractive buying opportunity ""for the stable, defensive retail stock.""Needham upgraded Ceridian (CDAY) to Buy from Hold with an $82 price target. A positive customer conference confirmed the firm's recent HCM channel conversations on stabilizing sales churn and improved win rates in the enterprise customer segment, the firm tells investors in a research note.BofA upgraded Trane Technologies (TT) to Neutral from Underperform with a price target of $210, up from $187. The company continues to outperform peers on revenue, adjusted earnings and free cash flow conversion, the firm tells investors in a research note.BofA upgraded Parker-Hannifin (PH) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $475, up from $435. The firm calls Parker-Hannifin a ""good company for uncertain times"" and sees it having ""long runway"" for a re-rating of the shares.RBC Capital upgraded Beacon (BECN) to Outperform from Sector Perform with a price target of $94, up from $91. The firm's roofing industry checks point to upside to guidance driven by residential roofing.Top 5 Downgrades:Citi downgraded Tractor Supply (TSCO) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $207, down from $250. The operating environment is getting tougher for Tractor Supply as big-ticket weakness continues, disinflation weighs on same-store-sales, and home-related spending slows, the firm argues.Exane BNP Paribas downgraded Yeti (YETI) to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $42, down from $54. While the recall of soft coolers makes it hard to assess Yeti's underlying demand, the firm's work suggests the company's trends are slowing.Raymond James downgraded Clorox (CLX) to Market Perform from Outperform without a price target after the company provided an update on fiscal Q1 that was significantly worse than expected due to the recent cybersecurity attack.Citi downgraded Floor &amp; Decor (FND) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $90, down from $122. The firm believes it is prudent to shift to a Neutral rating given the threat of higher rates for longer to existing home sales and home improvement spending. Jefferies downgraded Marriott Vacations (VAC) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $112, down from $150. The concerns over the macroeconomic outlook, notably consumer credit and interest rates, ""are driving a separation of timeshare business merits from valuations,"" the firm says.Top 5 Initiations: BofA initiated coverage of Wingstop (WING) with a Buy rating and $218 price target. The firm set its price target based on steady state earnings power at 7,000 U.S. stores and thinks that with only 6% share that Wingstop should continue to outpace the LSR chicken segment.Rosenblatt initiated coverage of Fabrinet (FN) with a Buy rating and $230 price target. Fabrinet, which makes very-short reach active optical cables, or AOCs, with 800G transceivers for Nvidia (NVDA) is ""one of the earliest and most direct beneficiaries of the strong ramp"" of the AI 800G Optical supply chain, the firm tells investors.BofA reinstated coverage of Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) with a Neutral rating and $33 price target. The firm notes margins are being pressured near-term by the longer maturity curve and in addition to margin headwinds, and sees risk to topline growth from slower consumer spending and ""still somewhat untested brand portability."" BofA reinstated coverage of Jack in the Box (JACK) with a Buy rating and $85 price target. The company's data driven approach has translated into higher restaurant volumes and structurally higher franchisee returns, ""the linchpin of unit growth,"" the firm says.BofA initiated coverage of Shake Shack (SHAK) with a Neutral rating and $66 price target. Shake Shack's average unit volumes are stabilizing and pricing will likely moderate, the firm tells investors. ]"

Street estimates stand at $10.31 for EPS and $4.06 billion for revenues.Orange gains following BofA’s double-upgrade Orange (NYSE:ORAN) shares rose more than 2% Wednesday after BofA upgraded the company by two notches - to Buy from Underperform - and raised its price target to $13 from $8.80.The analysts cited several thematic drivers and financial profiles that investors favor across the European telecom sector, such as improving competitive trends, a path to lower investment needs, in-market consolidation opportunities, infra ownership, and a route to growing dividend returns.""Orange’s investment case stands out, in our view, as one of the few in the sector that captures all these elements while still at an attractive valuation,"" wrote the analysts.Story continuesBofA pointed to a stabilizing domestic market with improved competition, a head start in the fiber roll-out, direct involvement in Spanish consolidation, and one of the last 100%-owned tower assets with ""Totem"" as factors they see driving the stock and company's performance.Olaplex stock surges on Barclays upgradeOlaplex (NASDAQ:OLPX) shares gained more than 5% Wednesday after Barclays upgraded the company to Equalweight from Underweight.The analysts believe that Olaplex can stabilize its business, which will likely limit further downside in the stock to some extent. However, they also find it challenging to see significant stock appreciation from this point. One of the key questions for Barclays is how EBITDA margins will ultimately shake out – in other words, they surmise, how much more will the company need to spend to consistently grow in line with the prestige hair care category?“We are hopeful that the company will be able to provide some degree of guardrails with respect to 2024 when it reports 3Q23 results in November,” wrote Barclays.***In fast-moving markets, every second counts - and InvestingPro subscribers are always one step ahead with lightning-quick updates.Related ArticlesAmerica Movil racks up 2 upgrades on dirt-cheap valuation: 4 big analyst picksDell forecasts 3-4% annual revenue growth over long termBofA sees potential 22% upside in Wingstop]"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: American Water Works Co. Inc. AWK, Vistra Corp. VST, Pinnacle West Capital Corp. PNW, OGE Energy Corp. OGE and The Southern Co. SO.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:Add These 5 Utilities to Your Portfolio for Long-Term GainsVolatility has reappeared on Wall Street since August as U.S. stock markets have been witnessing a reversal of the impressive bull run in the first seven months of this year. Markets may remain volatile in the near future. Wall Street is currently in a “Catch 22 situation.”Weak economic data will indicate that the Fed’s aggressive interest rate hike policy for one and half years has started bearing fruits. On the other hand, this will also indicate a slowdown in economic activities.At this stage, it should be prudent to invest in defensive stocks like utilities with a favorable Zacks Rank to strengthen your portfolio. Out of the 11 broad sectors of the S&amp;P 500 Index, the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) suffered the most in 2023 as market participants’ thrust shifted from defensive to growth/momentum stocks. Year to date, XLU has plunged 19.5%. This also indicates that utility stocks are currently available at an attractive valuation.Utilities Immune to Vagaries of Economic Cycle   The Utilities sector is mature and fundamentally strong as demand for such services is generally immune to the changes in the economic cycle. Such companies provide basic services like electricity, gas, water and telecommunications, which are always in demand.Consequently, adding stocks from the utility basket usually lends more stability to a portfolio in an uncertain market condition. Moreover, the sector is known for the stability and visibility of its earnings and cash flows.  Stable earnings enable utilities to pay out consistent dividends that make them more attractive to income-oriented investors.Story continuesUtility companies enjoy a reputation for being safe given the regulated nature of their business. This lends their revenues a high level of certainty. These companies also benefit from the domestic orientation of their business, which shields them from foreign currency translation issues.Additionally, utilities are generally low-beta stocks (beta &gt;0 but &lt;1). At this stage, investment in low-beta stocks with a high dividend yield and a favorable Zacks Rank may be the best option.If the market’s northbound journey is reestablished, the favorable Zacks Rank of these stocks will capture the upside potential. However, if the market’s downturn continues, low-beta stocks will minimize portfolio losses and dividend payments will act as a regular income stream.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five low-beta utility stocks that are regular dividend payers. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions within the last 60 days and have good potential for the rest of 2023 and 2024. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

This acquisition will add nearly 3,000 new water customers to the company’s customer base. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of 2024 after it receives all necessary approvals.Earlier this year, Aqua Pennsylvania signed a deal with the Greenville water system to acquire Greenville’s wastewater system.  Timely repairs and maintenance of aging water and wastewater infrastructure are essential to providing high-quality services to customers. Even though the water infrastructure is not very old, Aqua Pennsylvania has plans to invest more than $10 million in the water system within the next 10 years to meet regulatory, environmental and cybersecurity demands.Water Industry Needs Investments &amp; ConsolidationThe aging of water and wastewater infrastructure and delays in essential upgrades are concerns for the sewer service industry. Per the American Society of Civil Engineers, at present, nearly 50,000 water systems and 16,000 wastewater treatment systems in the United States are providing water solutions to customers. Small service provider operators have limited financial strength to carry out the essential, costly repairs on time, which leads to pipeline breakage and disruption of services and increases the possibility of contamination.Fragmentation in the water and wastewater industry is a headwind. Large water utility companies continue to acquire small players to ensure the extension of high-quality services to customers and the investments required to upgrade old and acquired assets.Per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, an estimated $744 billion investment is necessary to maintain and expand the drinking water and wastewater service to meet demand over the next 20 years.Essential Utilities is also making acquisitions to expand its operations. Since 2015, it has expanded utility operations by completing many water and wastewater acquisitions, adding 129,000 customers. The seven acquisitions completed in 2023 added more than 11,000 customers. The company is yet to close five acquisition agreements, which, when completed, will add 211,000 equivalent retail customers or equivalent dwelling units with nearly $354 million in purchase price.Essential Utilities plans to invest $1.1 billion annually in the 2023-2025 period to further strengthen its water and natural gas operations.American Water Works AWK, through its subsidiaries, is making systematic acquisitions and taking essential steps to upgrade the old infrastructure of its acquired assets. AWK has added 7,100 customers till Jun 30, 2023, by acquiring five companies. The pending acquisitions (as of Jun 30, 2023), when completed, will add another 74,800 customers to its customer base. In addition, AWK has long-term investment plans to upgrade and expand its water infrastructure and serve customers efficiently.California Water Service Group CWT is expanding operations through inorganic routes. In June 2023, California Water’s unit, New Mexico Water, received approval from the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission to acquire the assets of Monterey Water Company and provide regulated water utility service to Monterey’s customers.California Water Service is expected to invest $360 million and $365 million in 2023 and 2024, respectively, to upgrade its infrastructure and efficiently serve its expanding customer base.Story continuesPrice PerformanceOver the past month, shares of WTRG have lost 7.2% compared with the industry’s 8% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Ranks &amp; A Stock to ConsiderEssential Utilities currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Another top-ranked company from the same industry is Consolidated Water CWCO, currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

350,0f38fc87-c235-38d6-9503-80faf4042352,FCX,2023-10-06,Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 80%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/freeport-mcmoran-inc-nyse-fcx-130023222.html,1696510823,STORY,['FCX'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Freeport-McMoRan's stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsA total of 20 investors have a majority stake in the company with 51% ownership Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a businessIf you want to know who really controls Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 80% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Freeport-McMoRan. See our latest analysis for Freeport-McMoRan ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Freeport-McMoRan?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Freeport-McMoRan already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Freeport-McMoRan's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Freeport-McMoRan. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.3% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.5% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.5% by the third-largest shareholder.After doing some more digging, we found that the top 20 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Freeport-McMoRanThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that Freeport-McMoRan Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$253m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 20% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Freeport-McMoRan. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Freeport-McMoRan better, we need to consider many other factors.

351,2999ac5c-6643-3beb-9535-4e5f370befec,LNT,2023-10-06,Shareholders in Alliant Energy (NASDAQ:LNT) are in the red if they invested three years ago,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shareholders-alliant-energy-nasdaq-lnt-170412607.html,1696525452,STORY,['LNT'],"[As an investor its worth striving to ensure your overall portfolio beats the market average. But the risk of stock picking is that you will likely buy under-performing companies. We regret to report that long term Alliant Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:LNT) shareholders have had that experience, with the share price dropping 14% in three years, versus a market return of about 21%.Now let's have a look at the company's fundamentals, and see if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for Alliant Energy In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Alliant Energy saw its EPS decline at a compound rate of 0.4% per year, over the last three years. This reduction in EPS is slower than the 5% annual reduction in the share price. So it's likely that the EPS decline has disappointed the market, leaving investors hesitant to buy.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Alliant Energy's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Alliant Energy the TSR over the last 3 years was -5.7%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveInvestors in Alliant Energy had a tough year, with a total loss of 4.2% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 12%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 5% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Alliant Energy better, we need to consider many other factors. Even so, be aware that  Alliant Energy is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those is concerning...If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

""Now, everything we're going to be doing is in service of cereal. We're going to do things very, very differently, and we're confident we'll be able to drive substantial growth as we do it.""Nathaniel Donaker, 4, eats Kellogg's Frosted Flakes cereal at his home in Palo Alto, Calif., Thursday, April 28, 2011. (Paul Sakuma/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Kellogg searches for a new directionThe spin-off comes at a crossroads for the cereal industry, which is worth nearly $22 billion.The cereal craze that took off during the pandemic has dwindled as consumers have started to push back on higher prices. While revenue has risen in recent years, volumes have stayed roughly flat, according to data from Statista.Kellogg's Frosted Flakes trails behind General Mills' (GIS) Cheerios for the top spot in North American cereal brands, according to Zippia. There's still room for Kellogg to take market share, but the company faces competition from a few companies that, along with WK Kellogg, dominate the space: General Mills, Post (POST), and PepsiCo-owned (PEP) Quaker Oats.But that hasn't deterred WK Kellogg. The CEO emphasized that the independent company is ""now a 117-year-old startup"" that can balance its legacy as well as future growth.Founded in 1906 by William Keith Kellogg, whom the company is named after, the business got its start by selling toasted cornflakes that changed how people have eaten breakfast ever since.Story continuesKellogg was ""the original entrepreneur,"" Pilnick said, pointing to the company's history of innovation. Kellogg was the first to market breakfast cereals by putting prizes inside cereal boxes, and his well-known signature is found on Kellogg's products and the WK Kellogg Co logo today.Kellogg founder W.K. Kellogg holds the bridles of twin Arabian colts near Pomona, California, on Feb. 4, 1940. (Getty Images) (Bettmann via Getty Images)While WK Kellogg Co's branding pays homage to the history, there are opportunities to modernize the business to fit the wants of today's consumers. And the company is looking at two time horizons to achieve that.Kellogg plans to optimize its cereal business by moving five businesses under one umbrella in order to streamline operations. The businesses — tied to US retail, Canada, the Caribbean, food away from home, and Kashi and Bear Naked — previously operated separately.""Think about just the power of one business, harmonizing different things that are different across that business but also scaling up big ideas,"" Pilnick added. ""That was almost impossible before.""In the first three years, the company also aims to improve efficiency by investing $450 million to $500 million to update the company's supply chain and bring a ""meaningful amount of profit and cash"" for stakeholders.""We can take a business that we believe will have a 9% EBITDA margin at the end of 2023 and drive it an additional 500 basis points over the next three years,"" he said.That said, the company also continues to move past a nearly three-month-long strike among its factory workers in 2021 and a plant fire that same year at its Memphis location. Its five-year contract with union members is set to expire in 2026.A person walks by a display of Kellogg's cereals, owned by Kellogg Company, in a store in Queens, New York City, Feb. 7, 2022. (Andrew Kelly/REUTERS) (Andrew Kelly / reuters)Following that, the company plans to look ""beyond cereal,"" Pilnick said, with potential mergers and acquisitions on the table. ""We believe we'll be able to find M&amp;A targets where we would be the natural parent,"" Pilnick added.But Wall Street isn't yet sold on that strategy.Morningstar analyst Erin Lash wrote that the business shouldn't be so quick to jump into other categories considering its stated need to focus on cereal.""The firm’s aims to buoy its lackluster growth prospects through strategic tie-ups outside cereal in the medium to long term strikes us as perplexing, given this action runs counter to the stated benefits (enhanced focus on cereal) of the split with Kellogg’s global snacking business (now named Kellanova),"" Lash wrote in a note to clients. ""We think such a move could prove value destructive if it extends the firm beyond its core competencies.""Since the spin-off was completed on Monday, WK Kellogg Co stock is down over 23% while Kellanova has fallen 3.5%. Just four analysts have initiated coverage of WK Kellogg so far.Goldman Sachs initiated coverage with a Sell rating, citing potential hurdles in the near term.""We see near-term margin expansion potential on favorable input costs,"" the analysts wrote. ""We believe productivity programs are likely to be back-end weighted in FY26 and partially predicated on a manufacturing network rationalization that is currently impeded by the plant closure moratorium that it entered into with its unions in late 2021; this expires in 2026 when the contract is once again subject to renewal.""As for the market's reception so far, Pilnick is looking the other way.""We don't run our business day to day watching the stock market,"" Pilnick said.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and the dividend capture strategy, and go directly to read 5 Best October Dividend Stocks To Buy. Dividend payments around the world have been growing significantly because investors are increasingly interested in income-generating assets. This strong reputation of dividend stocks didn't happen overnight; it's based on historical data that demonstrates how these stocks have consistently performed better than other types of investments over the years. Companies that regularly increase their dividends are particularly attractive in this scenario. They are considered real winners because they not only garner appreciation from investors but also thrive in changing market conditions. According to a report by Morgan Stanley, dividends are a crucial investment for long-term investors. Stocks with high dividends typically do well when inflation is higher than usual but on a downward trend. These stocks are also considered safe and become even more appealing during uncertain economic times because they provide stability and reliable income.As mentioned above, global dividends have experienced significant growth this year. China's largest companies have paid out 1.5 trillion yuan ($206 billion) in dividends this year, which has already exceeded the 1.27 trillion yuan paid out in 2022, according to a report by Bloomberg. The major contributors to this increase are the largest state-owned banks, with PetroChina and Kweichow Moutai following closely behind. Similarly, Janus Henderson reported that 98% of US companies either increased their dividends or maintained them at the same level in the second quarter of 2023. This percentage is significantly higher than the global average.Dividend investing can be a sound strategy for long-term investors. Holding onto stocks with consistently increasing dividends can lead to higher yields on original investment over time. Regular dividend hikes often contribute to an increase in the stock's share price. According to a recent report by T. Rowe Price, between the end of 1985 to the close of 2022, dividend growers in the Russell 1000 Index performed better than the broader benchmark index. Furthermore, these dividend-growing stocks showed lower levels of price fluctuations or volatility. Some of the best dividend stocks in this regard are The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) as these firms have consistently increased their dividend payments for many years.Story continuesIn addition to long-term investors, dividend investing can be appealing to some short-term investors through a dividend capture strategy. It involves purchasing a stock just before it goes ex-dividend and then selling it shortly thereafter, typically after the dividend is received. This strategy aims to capture the dividend income while minimizing exposure to the stock's price fluctuations. To learn more about this investment approach, have a look at our article Dividend Capture Strategy Stocks To Buy.10 Best October Dividend Stocks To Buy Our Methodology:This list outlines the dividend capture strategy for selecting prominent dividend stocks that will trade ex-dividend in October 2023.

The GF Value Line provides an overview of the stock's fair trading value. If the stock price significantly deviates from the GF Value Line, it may be overvalued or undervalued, influencing its future return.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' stock is currently estimated to be modestly overvalued based on the GF Value calculation. This implies that the long-term return of its stock is likely to be lower than its business growth.Story continuesDecoding Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN)'s Valuation: Is It Truly Worth the Price?Link: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with strong financial strength reduces the risk of permanent loss of capital.

While each company gets the chance to lead the potential development and commercialization of product candidates for one target, the firm that is not leading development and commercialization will have the option to enter into a co-development and co-commercialization agreement for that target.Regeneron announced that the FDA has accepted for Priority Review the biologics license application (BLA) for odronextamab to treat adult patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma or R/R diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, who have progressed after at least two prior systemic therapies. The target action date is Mar 31, 2024.  The BLA was supported by data from a phase I and pivotal phase II trial (ELM-1 and ELM-2).Updates From Moderna:  Moderna MRNA announced positive interim results from the ongoing phase I/II study of mRNA-1083, its investigational combination vaccine against influenza and COVID-19, in older adults (50 years and older). The phase I/II study is a randomized, observer-blind study evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of mRNA-1083 compared to a standard dose influenza vaccine, Fluarix, in adults 50-64 years of age and against an enhanced influenza vaccine, Fluzone HD, in adults 65-79 years of age.Data from the study showed strong immunogenicity against influenza and COVID-19 compared to licensed standalone influenza and COVID-19 vaccines. Per management, mRNA-1083 generated antibodies similar to or greater than Fluarix and Fluzone HD. With regards to COVID-19, the vaccine generated neutralizing antibodies similar to the previously approved/authorized Spikevax bivalent booster.Based on this data, Moderna intends to advance mRNA-1083 to late-stage development. The company intends to start a phase III study in older adults before this year-end.PerformanceThe Nasdaq Biotechnology Index has lost 2.41% in the past five trading sessions. Among the biotech giants, Moderna has gained 4.85% during the period. Over the past six months, shares of Moderna have plunged 33.39%.

363,e93bd324-4e75-3c7a-98d1-07df9d6e6eac,REGN,2023-10-06,EYLEA® HD (aflibercept) Injection 8 mg Two-year Results from Pivotal PULSAR Trial in Wet Age-related Macular Degeneration Presented at EURETINA,GlobeNewswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eylea-hd-aflibercept-injection-8-134300152.html,1696513380,STORY,['REGN'],"[Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.First presentation of long-term results demonstrated sustained visual and anatomic improvements among EYLEA HD patients through two yearsTARRYTOWN, N.Y., Oct. 05, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) today announced the first presentation of positive two-year (96 weeks) results from the pivotal PULSAR trial investigating EYLEA® HD (aflibercept) Injection 8 mg with 12- and 16-week dosing regimens, compared to EYLEA® (aflibercept) Injection, in patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD). The results were presented with the 60-week results at the 23rd EURETINA Congress.“EYLEA HD was approved in the U.S. based in part on strong one-year efficacy and safety outcomes from PULSAR in wet age-related macular degeneration,” said Charles C. Wykoff, M.D., Ph.D., Director of Research at Retina Consultants of Texas and a trial investigator. “These two-year outcomes from PULSAR show that EYLEA HD can deliver sustained and consistent visual and anatomic benefits with extended dosing intervals in the longer-term – helping to reduce the treatment burden for patients with exudative retinal diseases and reinforcing the potential of EYLEA HD as a new standard of care.”PULSAR (N=1,009) is a double-masked, active-controlled pivotal trial evaluating non-inferiority of EYLEA HD 12-week (n=335) and 16-week (n=338) dosing regimens compared to an 8-week dosing regimen for EYLEA (n=336). All patients received three initial monthly doses. Patients receiving EYLEA HD could have their dosing intervals shortened to an every 8-week interval if protocol-defined criteria for disease progression were observed. Patients were only able to extend their dosing intervals in the second year by 4-week increments up to 24-weeks, if pre-specified criteria were met.The PULSAR trial met its primary endpoint, with EYLEA HD patients achieving clinically equivalent vision gains to EYLEA at 48 weeks. As previously announced, EYLEA HD demonstrated durable vision gains at extended dosing intervals at the end of two years, with the mean number of injections administered being 9.7 for the 12-week EYLEA HD group, 8.2 for the 16-week EYLEA HD group, and 12.8 for the EYLEA group. As presented at EURETINA, efficacy results for EYLEA HD patients who completed the two-year follow-up were as follows:Story continuesAmong all patients, 88% were on a ≥12-week dosing interval at the end of two years, with 71% meeting the extension criteria for ≥16-week dosing intervals.Of patients assigned to ≥16-week dosing regimen at baseline, 78% were eligible for ≥16-week dosing at the end of two years, with 53% eligible for ≥20-dosing week intervals.In PULSAR, the safety of EYLEA HD continued to be similar to EYLEA through two years and remained consistent with the known safety profile of EYLEA from previous clinical trials for wAMD. There were no cases of occlusive retinal vasculitis or endophthalmitis in the EYLEA HD groups. The rate of intraocular inflammation was 1.3% for the aflibercept 8 mg group and 2.1% for the EYLEA group. Anti-platelet trialists' collaboration-defined arterial thromboembolic treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 1.8% of patients treated with aflibercept 8 mg and 3.3% of patients treated with EYLEA.The full EURETINA presentation is available on the Regeneron website. The two-year data from the pivotal PHOTON trial for aflibercept 8 mg in diabetic macular edema (DME) and diabetic retinopathy (DR) were previously presented at the American Society of Retina Specialists annual meeting in July 2023.EYLEA HD is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Bayer AG. In the U.S., Regeneron maintains exclusive rights to EYLEA and EYLEA HD. Bayer has licensed the exclusive marketing rights outside of the U.S., where the companies share equally the profits from sales of EYLEA and EYLEA HD following any regulatory approvals.About the EYLEA HD Clinical Trial ProgramPULSAR in wAMD and PHOTON in DME/DR are double-masked, active-controlled pivotal trials that are being conducted in multiple centers globally. In both trials, patients were randomized into 3 treatment groups to receive either: EYLEA HD every 12 weeks, EYLEA HD every 16 weeks, or EYLEA every 8 weeks. The lead sponsors of the trials were Bayer for PULSAR and Regeneron for PHOTON.Patients treated with EYLEA HD in both trials had 3 initial monthly doses, and patients treated with EYLEA received 3 initial doses in PULSAR and 5 in PHOTON. In the first year, patients in the EYLEA HD groups could have their dosing intervals shortened down to an every 8-week interval if protocol-defined criteria for disease progression were observed. Intervals could not be extended until the second year of the study. Patients in all EYLEA groups maintained a fixed 8-week dosing regimen throughout their participation in the trials.About wAMD and Diabetic Eye DiseasewAMD is a retinal disease that may affect people as they age. It occurs when abnormal blood vessels grow and leak fluid under the macula, the part of the eye responsible for sharp central vision and seeing fine detail. This fluid can damage and scar the macula, which can cause vision loss. An estimated 1.4 million Americans have wAMD.DR is an eye disease characterized by microvascular damage to the blood vessels in the retina often caused by poor blood sugar control in people with diabetes. The disease generally starts as nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) and often has no warning signs or symptoms. NPDR may progress to proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), a stage of the disease in which abnormal blood vessels grow onto the surface of the retina and into the vitreous cavity, potentially causing severe vision loss.DME can occur at any stage of DR as the blood vessels in the retina become increasingly fragile and leak fluid, potentially causing visual impairment. In the U.S., approximately 1.5 million adults are diagnosed with DME, while approximately 6 million people have DR without DME.About Ophthalmology at RegeneronAt Regeneron, we relentlessly pursue groundbreaking innovations in eye care science to help maintain the eye health of the millions of Americans impacted by vision-threatening conditions. Over a decade ago, our breakthrough scientific research resulted in the development of EYLEA, a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor designed to block the growth of new blood vessels and decrease the ability of fluid to pass through blood vessels in the eye. EYLEA has since brought fundamental change to the retinal disease treatment landscape and is supported by a robust body of research that includes eight pivotal Phase 3 trials, 11 years of real-world experience, and more than 64 million EYLEA injections globally.Regeneron continues to advance our anti-angiogenesis expertise with new solutions with the aim of offering optimal flexibility for a broad group of patients and eye care professionals. This includes EYLEA HD, which has been developed with the aim of extending the time between injections, while maintaining the vision gains, anatomic benefits and safety previously observed with EYLEA.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION AND INDICATIONSINDICATIONSEYLEA HD (aflibercept) 8 mg is a prescription medicine approved for the treatment of patients with Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), and Diabetic Retinopathy (DR).EYLEA® (aflibercept) 2 mg is a prescription medicine approved for the treatment of patients with Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Macular Edema following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO), Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), and Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) (0.4 mg).IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION EYLEA HD and EYLEA are administered by injection into the eye. You should not use EYLEA HD or EYLEA if you have an infection in or around the eye, eye pain or redness, or known allergies to any of the ingredients in EYLEA HD or EYLEA, including aflibercept.Injections into the eye with EYLEA HD or EYLEA can result in an infection in the eye and retinal detachment (separation of retina from back of the eye) can occur. Inflammation in the eye has been reported with the use of EYLEA HD and EYLEA.In some patients, injections with EYLEA HD or EYLEA may cause a temporary increase in eye pressure within 1 hour of the injection. Sustained increases in eye pressure have been reported with repeated injections, and your doctor may monitor this after each injection.In infants with Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP), treatment with EYLEA will need extended periods of ROP monitoring.There is a potential but rare risk of serious and sometimes fatal side effects, related to blood clots, leading to heart attack or stroke in patients receiving EYLEA HD or EYLEA.The most common side effects reported in patients receiving EYLEA HD were cataract, increased redness in the eye, increased pressure in the eye, eye discomfort, pain, or irritation, blurred vision, vitreous (gel-like substance) floaters, vitreous detachment, injury to the outer layer of the eye, and bleeding in the back of the eye.The most common side effects reported in patients receiving EYLEA were increased redness in the eye, eye pain, cataract, vitreous detachment, vitreous floaters, moving spots in the field of vision, and increased pressure in the eye.The most common side effects reported in pre-term infants with ROP receiving EYLEA were separation of the retina from the back of the eye, increased redness in the eye, and increased pressure in the eye. Side effects that occurred in adults are considered applicable to pre-term infants with ROP, though not all were seen in clinical studies.You may experience temporary visual changes after an EYLEA HD or EYLEA injection and associated eye exams; do not drive or use machinery until your vision recovers sufficiently.Contact your doctor right away if you think you or your baby might be experiencing any side effects, including eye pain or redness, light sensitivity, or blurring of vision, after an injection.For additional safety information, please talk to your doctor and see the full Prescribing Information for EYLEA HD and EYLEA.You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.

The Neway-Quest collaboration will provide an alternative to the centralized lab model where the majority of dialysis programs in the U.S. transport specimens to a single laboratory for processing. By utilizing Quest's distributed lab network, Neway and its affiliated dialysis centers and their patients will experience faster testing and results reporting and lower transportation costs.Bryan Thompson, Neway Founder and CEO, said, ""The Neway solution exemplifies our dedication to bringing value, innovation, stewardship, and economies of scale to the unique dialysis industry. The centralized dialysis laboratory specimen testing model has been around since the early 1990s with limited innovation. The old model of generally relying on air transportation of dialysis laboratory specimens to a single U.S. location is costly and can takes days for results. The 'new way' for dialysis laboratory testing is a decentralized network of laboratory locations that spans the nation. This approach is good for dialysis patients, dialysis programs, insurance payers, and the entire dialysis industry. It is a win for everyone.""""As a leader in cardiometabolic diagnostic solutions, including in kidney disease, Quest understands the unique challenges patients with ESRD face and the criticality of rapid testing that never compromises on quality,"" said Mouris Saghir, PhD, Vice President and General Manager for the Quest Diagnostics National Cardiometabolic Center of Excellence at Cleveland HeartLab.
