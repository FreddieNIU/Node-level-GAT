For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best AI Stocks to Buy Now. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are at the heart of the technological revolution of late. These technologies, like smartphones, are near ubiquitous in their nature since they have the potential to affect nearly every major industry.Artificial intelligence involves using patterns in existing datasets to 'infer' or make decisions. It is most commonly referred to in the context of robots or smart assistants carrying out tasks that would normally be assigned to humans. The machines carry out these tasks by using predefined data sets that have classes and labels assigned to them and then use these classes to categorize new information or inputs through these parameters. This allows for decisions that mimic human behavior to an extent. A subset of artificial intelligence is machine learning, which also uses existing data sets to generate inferences and insights. There are two categories of machine learning, namely supervised and unsupervised learning. The former sees the researcher assign labels to the data for the machine to then use these labels to sort out new data, while the latter involves the computer generating the labels by itself.These techniques help industries such as healthcare, drug development, and oil and gas exploration generate new insights from their data to improve performance and create new products. Naturally, the applications also paint an optimistic future for the industry. A report from Fortune Business Insights shares that the artificial intelligence industry is worth $347 billion this year, and from now to 2029 it will grow at a mind blowing compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20.1% to sit at $1.3 trillion at the end of the forecast period.This makes artificial intelligence one of the few multibillion dollar industries that have a double digit CAGR. Fortune Business Insights highlights that practical applications such as those in the food and beverages industry, logistics, automotive, and retail will drive this growth. Additionally, it notes that healthcare will constitute the largest chunk of the growth, with an unbelievable 150% rate. Other drivers include the Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets and the growing use of robotics. North America represented nearly half of the market in 2020, and Asia Pacific will be the fastest growing region during the time period.Story continuesToday's list will look at some of the top artificial intelligence firms in the industry, and these range from software and hardware providers to firms that have made AI a centerpiece of their business model. Some big ticket names are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Amazon.com, Inc.

ERP is a software category that is particularly critical to business functions, and, therefore, has high retention rates even in times of economic stress. For the past several years, SAP has been going through several transitions, including moving to cloud-based SaaS (Software as a service) solutions and an initiative to better integrate its various software solutions. In recent quarters, we have seen increasing evidence that both transitions are being successfully executed, and the result should be a faster-growing, more consistent, higher margin, and more advantaged business. As investment costs from these transition programs wane, and as the benefits of higher growth continue, we expect that earnings will grow at a double-digit rate from next year (2023) onwards.

(CF) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cf-industries-holdings-inc-cf-140002089.html,1668780002,STORY,['CF'],"[CF Industries (CF) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this fertilizer maker have returned -2.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +7.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Fertilizers industry, which CF falls in, has gained 2.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, CF is expected to post earnings of $4.40 per share, indicating a change of +18.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -6.9% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $17.05 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +302.1%. This estimate has changed -13% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $15.11 indicates a change of -11.4% from what CF is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -7.9%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for CF.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CF _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of CF, the consensus sales estimate of $2.87 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +12.9%. The $11.43 billion and $9.83 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +74.8% and -14%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCF reported revenues of $2.32 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +70.4%. EPS of $2.55 for the same period compares with $0.96 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.3 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.74%. The EPS surprise was -20.06%.Over the last four quarters, CF surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.CF is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CF. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Moreover, the automaker can take advantage of the connected-car revolution by selling monthly subscriptions to many services, such as battery monitoring and security offerings.Story continuesDespite all of Ford’s positive attributes, the forward price-earnings ratio of F stock is a measly 7.8.Value Stocks to Buy: Tractor Supply (TSCO)IDEX stock: An electric tractor sits in a field on a sunny day with a wind turbine in the background.Source: Matthew Troke / Shutterstock.comTractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO) sells products that cater to rural Americans, including farmers. Among its offerings are products for horses, cattle, and pets, “maintenance products” for farm machinery, and other tools used by farmers. With American farmers benefiting from high food prices and elevated demand for food around the world due to the Russia-Ukraine war, Tractor Supply, unsurprisingly, has been reporting very strong financial results.Last quarter, for example, its top line climbed 8.3% year-over-year to $3.27 billion, it reported earnings per share of $2.10, and its comparable store sales surged 5.7% YOY.As of the end of Q3, there were over 27 million households in TSCO’s “neighbor’s club,” which seems to be similar to Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Prime program and Costco’s (NASDAQ:COST) membership program. Tractor Supply’s club, whose members generate about 75% of the company’s revenue, gives TSCO a large, loyal customer base. The company can easily and inexpensively market its new products to these consumers, leaving it well-positioned to continue to deliver strong sales growth.Value Stocks to Buy: Merck (MRK)Brown glass pill bottle on its side showing white pills inside, with other pill bottles behind it representing MACK stock.Source: shutterstock.com/ChampheiIn past columns, I’ve outlined the tremendous amount of revenue that Merck’s (NYSE:MRK) versatile cancer treatment, Keytruda, is generating for the giant drug maker.Keytruda was the biggest factor behind Merck’s strong third-quarter results, as the drug’s sales climbed 20% year-over-year to $5.3 billion. Merck’s overall top line increased an impressive 14% YOY to $15 billion. Moreover, the giant expects its 2022 earnings per share to come in at an impressive $7.32-$7.37, meaning that its price-earnings ratio, based on its 2022 EPS guidance, is a rather low 13.6. (100/$7.35)Also contributing to Merck’s strong Q3 results and its solid 2022 guidance are its “Human Papillomavirus vaccines.” Last quarter, the revenue generated by those shots climbed 15% YOY to $2.3 billion.Citing the strong sales of Merck’s key drugs, Cantor Fitzgerald on Oct. 28 raised its price target on the shares to $120 from $107 and said that the company’s strong outlook is “underappreciated” by the Street. Cantor maintained an “overweight” rating on the name.Dollar General (DG)Source: ShutterstockI’ve hypothesized that dollar stores will get a big boost as inflation squeezes working-class and poor Americans. Agreeing with that idea last month was research firm Placer.ai. In the words of Seeking Alpha, Placer.ai believes that “increasing pressure on middle and low-income consumers is promoting a trade-down to discount stores.” The firm added that “Dollar stores are seeing lower-income consumers trade down from traditional superstores such as Walmart.”  Dollar General (NYSE:DG) has benefited from that trend in the past and is likely to continue to do so in the future. In the second quarter, its top line increased 9% year-over-year to $9.43 billion, while its same-store sales rose 4.6% YOY and its Q2 earnings per share came in at $2.98. The retailer also increased its full-year sales growth guidance to 11% from 10%-10.5%, and it expected its earnings per share to rise 12%-14% in fiscal 2022. Despite its strong, positive catalysts, DG stock has a reasonable forward price-earnings ratio of 19.5.Quanta Services (PWR)electricity pylons and lines at duskSource: snvv18870020330 / Shutterstock.comAs I noted in a previous column, published on Sept. 29, Quanta (NYSE:PWR) “develops, repairs and maintains electric grids globally and renewable energy systems. It also carries out engineering projects for companies involved in the production of natural gas and oil prices.”I predicted that the company and PWR stock would get a lift from the electric-vehicle revolution, along with increased exploration for oil and gas amid high prices for those commodities. Quanta’s third-quarter results, reported on Nov 3, indicated that the company is indeed benefiting from those trends. Specifically, its sales jumped by a huge 33% year-over-year to $4.46 billion, while it generated $343 million of cash flow from operations. For all of 2022, the company expects its earnings per share to come in at $6.15-$6.39, excluding certain items, and its backlog at the end of Q3 stood at a very high $20.9 billion, which represented an all-time record for it.“Demand for our services continues to be driven by broad-based business strength from utility grid modernization and system hardening initiatives, as well as our reputation for solid and safe execution,” Quanta CEO Duke Austin, reported on the company’s Q3 earnings conference call. Given Quanta’s rapid growth and strong outlook, its forward price-earnings ratio of 20.3 is quite attractive.CF Industries (CF)A tractor spreading fertilizer over a farm field.Source: Fotokostic / Shutterstock.comLike Tractor Supply, CF Industries (NYSE:CF) is a fertilizer maker and is benefiting from high food prices brought about partly by the Russia-Ukraine War. Additionally, since Russia and Ukraine are both major exporters of fertilizer, the conflict has caused fertilizer prices to soar, benefiting CF and its peers.Last quarter, CF’s top line soared an incredible 70% year-over-year to $2.3 billion, while its EBITDA came in at an impressive $826 million. The fertilizer maker noted that geopolitical issues had increased the average selling prices of its products last quarter. Moreover, CF reported that it expects the supply-demand dynamics of one of its key offerings, nitrogen, to stay favorable “into 2025,” Seeking Alpha noted.“We expect to continue generating substantial free cash flow, which will enable us to invest prudently in high-return growth projects while at the same time returning significant capital to shareholders,” CF CEO Tony Will reported on the company’s Q3 earnings call.Despite its powerful growth and strong outlook, the forward price-earnings ratio of CF stock currently stands at 7.01.Motorola Solutions (MSI)communication technology for internet business. global world network and telecommunication on earthSource: greenbutterfly / Shutterstock.comMotorola Solutions (NYSE:MSI) appears to be benefiting from an important trend in the U.S.  that’s not discussed much in most media outlets: the huge crime wave that’s afflicting many American cities.Due to reforms in the criminal justice system, many more criminals are walking the streets than in prior years in multiple, major cities. That could explain why the demand for the company’s video-security products has surged. In the second quarter, for example, the revenue generated by its “Video security and access control” systems climbed 21% year over year, while its backlog soared 19% year over year to a “record $13.4 billion.”Last quarter, Motorola Solutions reported that ” increased demand for video security and land mobile radio technologies” helped boost its “Products and Systems Integration” sales by 15% year over year to a record level. For all of 2022, the company expects its sales to increase by 9.25%-9.5%, and it expects its earnings per share to come in at $10.17-$10.22.Analysts, on average, expect its 2023 EPS to come in at $11.19. That puts its forward price-earnings ratio at 22.4 (251/11.19), which is attractive given its strong growth and highly certain, strong outlook. Additionally, the shares have a dividend yield of 1.27%.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Let's take a look at some of the biggest movers of the week. A big theme this week-- we've been talking a lot about it-- it's retail. A number of the larger players reporting quarterly results. You can see some of those names on the screen right here. Walmart, Macy's, and Target. Well, taking a look at the retail heat map as we take a look at what the performance of a number of these larger names.I want to draw your attention to first Walmart because that's been a gainer this week. Up just about 5 and 1/2%. The company really getting an edge here in the current economic environment because consumers are trading down. We certainly saw that reflected in their results. And they outperformed in the most recent quarter.We're also looking at Macy's, up just around 6% on the week. Shares spiked about 15% earlier this week after the company reported better than expected earnings. But CEO Jeff Gannett did flag some uncertainty about the holiday season. At least for now, looks like Wall Street is able to shrug off some of that concern off.I also want to point out what we saw in Target because, on the other hand, a very different picture. Looking at losses over the past five days of just about 6%. The company highlighting the fact that consumers are starting to pull back on discretionary spending. Now, CEO Brian Cornell saying that, quote, ""clearly, it's an environment where consumers have been stressed."" And we saw that reflected in their results. The stock sold off as a result. Ending the week, though, off just about 6%. So well off the lows of the week.Let's talk about some of the other big stories of the week. One of those, of course, the collapse of FTX. That sent shockwaves throughout the crypto industry. Coinbase took a huge hit as a result. And taking a look at that stock over the last five days, we're looking at losses of just about 21%. Now, investors are worried about contagion. Bank of America downgrading the stock today, citing that risk.Story continuesBitcoin, on the other hand, has fared much better than Coinbase. Taking a look at the 5-day chart, Bitcoin actually closing the week to the upside, which I think took a lot of people by surprise. Up just about 2 and 1/2%. Let's take a look at Norwegian because that stock ending the week in the red, off just about 8%.Credit Suisse double downgrading the stock to underperform. They initially had an outperform rating on it, saying that its valuation premium to peers is likely unsustainable. Shares sold off on that move. We saw that reflected in the chart over the past of five days. Certainly, the stock has been under pressure so far this year. Year to date, shares off just about 21%.Let's round it out with NVIDIA. We heard from a number of chip makers over the past couple of days their quarterly results. Well, Nvidia shares ending the week off just about 5 and 1/2%. The company's third quarter revenue beat expectations. But earnings mixed. Guidance, it fell short. It's been certainly has been a very tough year for NVIDIA.Year to date, we're looking at losses of just about 47%. Now, the company cut its forecast multiple times amid a softening macroeconomic environment. We know Nvidia far from the only chip maker that has suffered so far this year. So investors now, and certainly analysts, are trying to gauge whether or not we have hit a bottom. Where we are today not too far from the 52-week lows we hit just about a week or so ago. Rachelle.]"
10,e61bdc2b-d981-37f4-8f50-b74f07f85a46,WMT,2022-11-19,Breaking Down Retail Earnings That Highlight Slowing Consumer Spending,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/breaking-down-retail-earnings-highlight-204008868.html,1668804008,STORY,"['WMT', '^GSPC', 'TGT']","[It is no surprise that the combined weight of elevated inflation, rising interest rates and uncertainty about the economy have forced consumers to change their spending behavior.The issue has undoubtedly been at play with lower-income households for some time now. But we can intuitively appreciate that it will not stay restricted to this consumer segment alone and will most likely move up the income chain in the days and weeks ahead.We saw some of that in the Walmart WMT report that showed the retailer benefiting from higher-income consumers ‘trading down’ to its stores in response to the aforementioned headwinds.The retail business is a tough and competitive space even in ‘normal’ times and these are anything but normal times. They need just the right amount of inventory, otherwise they will either lose sales if they don’t have enough merchandise as was the case earlier in the pandemic, or will need to offer steeper discounts and hurt margins if they have too much of it, as we saw with Walmart and Target TGT in the summer quarter.Retailers also need to make sure that they have the right type of merchandise, as we saw with Target and Walmart having too much stuff like patio furniture that consumers weren’t interested in buying any more after the initial pandemic boom. Keeping stores fully staffed in a tight labor market and ensuring just the right amount of price discounts are some of the other challenges that big-box operators like Walmart, Target and others face daily.It all comes down to execution and management effectiveness.With respect to the group’s Q3 earnings releases, it has been a mixed show overall. In a backdrop of moderating and shifting consumer spending behavior, some retailers have been more successful than others. Walmart was better, Target was not. Macy’s M, Foot Locker FL and Lowe’s LOW executed really well, but others didn’t.You can see some of this in the year-to-date performance of Walmart (blue line), Target (green line), Lowe’s (orange line) shares relative to the S&amp;P 500 index (red line).Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWith respect to the Retail sector 2022 Q3 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 29 of the 34 retailers in the S&amp;P 500 index.Unlike the official S&amp;P sector classifications that leaves retail sector players spread around different sectors, primarily Consumer Discretionary, Zacks’ stand-along Retail sector classification that houses conventional retailers, digital players and restaurants allows for a more granular understanding of trends in the space.Total Q3 earnings for these retailers are down -5.5% from the same period last year on +8.6% higher revenues, with 72.4% beating EPS estimates and 58.6% beating revenue estimates.The comparison charts below put the Q3 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see above, retailers have been struggling to come out with positive surprises thus far, though it’s a better showing relative to what we saw from the group 2022 Q2.With respect to the earnings and revenue growth rates, Amazon’s weak numbers play a significant role in the year-over-year growth rate for the sector (Amazon is part of the Zacks Retail sector, and not the Zacks Technology sector).The two comparison charts below show the Q3 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon’s results (left side chart) and without Amazon’s numbers (right side chart).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ3 Earnings Season Scorecard Including all of the results that came through Friday, November 18th, we now have Q3 results from 476 S&amp;P 500 members that combined account for 95.2% of the index’s total membership.For the 476 index members that have reported results already, total earnings are up +1.8% from the same period last year on +11.8% higher revenues, with 69.1% beating EPS estimates and 68.3% beating revenue estimates.Here is how the 2022 Q3 earnings and revenue growth rates for these companies compares across different periods.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHere is how the 2022 Q3 EPS and revenue beats percentages for these companies compare across different periods.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe EPS and revenue beats percentages are below what we had seen from this same group of companies in recent quarters, but otherwise within the historical range by now.Tracking Earnings Estimate RevisionsThe chart below that shows the blended earnings and revenue growth for 2022 Q3 relative to what we saw in the preceding four quarters and what is expected in the coming three periods.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis is no surprise, as the global economy is going through a synchronized slowdown, under the combined effects of rising interest rates in response to inflationary pressures, still-lingering logistical challenges that have started to ease up and China’s continuing zero-Covid restrictions.The orange bars in the chart above represent revenue growth. So, for 2022 Q3, revenues are on track to grow +11.6% from the same period last year even though earnings are only expected to be up only +1.6%. This seemingly elevated revenue growth is a direct function of pricing power, with companies able to pass on rising input costs to end consumers. We intuitively know that this can’t go on forever and current projections for the next three quarters bears out this intuition.The above chart shows that earnings in the current period (2022 Q4) are expected to be down -5.1% below the year-earlier level on +4.6% higher revenues.Estimates have been steadily coming down, in line with the trend that we saw ahead of the start of the Q3 earnings season.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEstimates for full-year 2023 have been coming down as well, with the negative revisions trend particularly notable on an ex-Energy basis. You can see this in the chart below that shows the aggregate 2023 earnings estimate on an ex-Energy basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSince mid-April, 2023 earnings estimates in the aggregate have come down by -8.6% for the S&amp;P 500 index as a whole and -11.5% on an ex-Energy basis.The cuts to estimates have been particularly notable for the Tech (down -18.9% since mid-April), Construction (-25.1%), Retail (-18.6%), Industrial Products (-14.3%), Consumer Discretionary (-19.3%) and Aerospace (-13.4%). Overall, estimates have been cut for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors.The chart below shows the overall earnings picture on an annual basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThere are some in the market who think that 2023 earnings should be below the 2022 level instead of the current expected +2.8% growth simply because the U.S. economy is expected to go through a moderate recession.I am not suggesting that 2023 earnings can’t be below the 2022 level; they can be, and based on the current revisions trend, are likely headed there. But it is wrong to expect moderate declines in ‘real’ GDP to automatically result in ‘nominal’ or non-inflation adjusted corporate earnings to also decline. Corporate revenues and earnings are ‘nominal’ values and will reflect the effects of inflation. Inflation is expected to come down in 2023, but nevertheless remain positive.For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Evaluating Further Downside Risks to Earnings Estimates   Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Further, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.3%.The top-line increase was driven by growing momentum across Alibaba’s China commerce and international commerce wholesale businesses.Strength across the local consumer services, Cainiao logistics services, cloud computing business, and digital media and entertainment contributed well.However, the overall China Commerce segment performed sluggishly in the reported quarter. Weak consumption demand due to the resurgence of COVID in China remained a major headwind. The slowdown of cross-border commerce as a result of increasing logistics costs and foreign currency volatility affected the quarterly results.We note that the disruptions triggered by the coronavirus pandemic are likely to remain a concern for Alibaba’s domestic businesses.Alibaba Group Holding Limited Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseAlibaba Group Holding Limited Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseAlibaba Group Holding Limited price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Alibaba Group Holding Limited QuoteRevenues by SegmentsChina Commerce (65% of total revenues): The segment comprises marketplaces operating in China’s retail and wholesale commerce markets.

However, declining AliExpress orders in Europe remained a headwind.International commerce wholesale (3% of total revenues):The business generated revenues of RMB 5 billion ($704 million), up 6% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s reported figure. Growth was attributed to a surge in revenues generated by cross-border-related value-added services.Local consumer services (6% of total revenues): Revenues grossed RMB 13.1 billion ($1.8 billion), up 21% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure.

(Goldman Sachs)The main culprit of the reduced spending intentions is none other than biting inflation, which continues to hammer household finances.Nearly 80% of consumers expect to adjust their behavior as a result of the inflationary environment, the survey found. About half of that 80% plan to trade down to cheaper products.In the uncertain economic environment, Goldman says Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT) will remain top shopping destinations this holiday season. Walmart CFO John David Rainey recently told Yahoo Finance Live his company is seeing higher-end consumers trade down to the discount retailer.""We expect consumers to hunt for promotions this holiday period (as there will be an abundance of them), which could limit the scope for a continuation of average unit retail price gains that have been a key offset for margins year to date,"" the analysts added.A street performer dressed as Dr. Seuss' the Grinch takes photos with tourists in Times Square on December 25, 2021, in New York City. (Photo by Roy Rochlin/Getty Images)To be sure, retailers will enter the holidays — their most important selling period of the year — with a number of economic headwinds.GDP rose 2.6% in the third quarter, but that marked the only positive quarter for growth in 2022 so far.Inflation remains stubbornly high and a major problem for American households. The October Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed that the overall cost of groceries is up by 12.4% annually. Consumer confidence, meanwhile, tanked several percentage points in November compared to October.Many household-name retailers were already rattled by a weakening economic environment in the third quarter.Story continuesThis week alone, Target missed on earnings by a country mile and warned about profits for the holiday quarter. Home goods retailer Williams-Sonoma also served up a lackluster fourth-quarter outlook as shoppers shunned discretionary purchases.""Sitting here today, if you look at some of the syndicated data that has been released, obviously you've seen a significant change in consumer shopping patterns as we ended October and moved into the month of November,"" Target Chairman and CEO Brian Cornell told Yahoo Finance. ""So clearly, it's an environment where consumers have been stressed. We know they're spending more dollars on food and beverage and household essentials. They're looking for promotions and are looking for that great deal. And I would expect that promotional focus will continue throughout the holidays.""Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

Let's take a look at some of the biggest movers of the week. A big theme this week-- we've been talking a lot about it-- it's retail. A number of the larger players reporting quarterly results. You can see some of those names on the screen right here. Walmart, Macy's, and Target. Well, taking a look at the retail heat map as we take a look at what the performance of a number of these larger names.I want to draw your attention to first Walmart because that's been a gainer this week. Up just about 5 and 1/2%. The company really getting an edge here in the current economic environment because consumers are trading down. We certainly saw that reflected in their results. And they outperformed in the most recent quarter.We're also looking at Macy's, up just around 6% on the week. Shares spiked about 15% earlier this week after the company reported better than expected earnings. But CEO Jeff Gannett did flag some uncertainty about the holiday season. At least for now, looks like Wall Street is able to shrug off some of that concern off.I also want to point out what we saw in Target because, on the other hand, a very different picture. Looking at losses over the past five days of just about 6%. The company highlighting the fact that consumers are starting to pull back on discretionary spending. Now, CEO Brian Cornell saying that, quote, ""clearly, it's an environment where consumers have been stressed."" And we saw that reflected in their results. The stock sold off as a result. Ending the week, though, off just about 6%. So well off the lows of the week.Let's talk about some of the other big stories of the week. One of those, of course, the collapse of FTX. That sent shockwaves throughout the crypto industry. Coinbase took a huge hit as a result. And taking a look at that stock over the last five days, we're looking at losses of just about 21%. Now, investors are worried about contagion. Bank of America downgrading the stock today, citing that risk.Story continuesBitcoin, on the other hand, has fared much better than Coinbase. Taking a look at the 5-day chart, Bitcoin actually closing the week to the upside, which I think took a lot of people by surprise. Up just about 2 and 1/2%. Let's take a look at Norwegian because that stock ending the week in the red, off just about 8%.Credit Suisse double downgrading the stock to underperform. They initially had an outperform rating on it, saying that its valuation premium to peers is likely unsustainable. Shares sold off on that move. We saw that reflected in the chart over the past of five days. Certainly, the stock has been under pressure so far this year. Year to date, shares off just about 21%.Let's round it out with NVIDIA. We heard from a number of chip makers over the past couple of days their quarterly results. Well, Nvidia shares ending the week off just about 5 and 1/2%. The company's third quarter revenue beat expectations. But earnings mixed. Guidance, it fell short. It's been certainly has been a very tough year for NVIDIA.Year to date, we're looking at losses of just about 47%. Now, the company cut its forecast multiple times amid a softening macroeconomic environment. We know Nvidia far from the only chip maker that has suffered so far this year. So investors now, and certainly analysts, are trying to gauge whether or not we have hit a bottom. Where we are today not too far from the 52-week lows we hit just about a week or so ago. Rachelle.]"

If we take a look at the sectors, consumer discretionary this week didn't do too well. You had the retailers that reported this week. You have Walmart, though, that is up for the week when we take a look at the Dow components. And over on the NASDAQ 100, we did see for the week that Amazon is down for the week, again, a consumer discretionary stock. Also Tesla down for the week as well.If we take a look at some of the semiconductors, some of the semiconductors for the week also performing a little bit on a mixed on a mixed level when we talk about the semiconductors. When we take a look also at gold today, gold is slightly lower. Looking at the bond market, we are seeing the US Treasury at 3.82% for the 10-year Treasury.

We want to bring in our guest here, as we've seen a lot of volatility this week. We have Bob Iaccino here. thank you for joining us this afternoon, Bob. So I want to first get your take on the market action so far.BOB IACCINO: Well, in general, there was a lot of options expiration. So we're talking about equities, it's pretty standard. We had now of 6 consecutive days in the S&amp;P without a 1% move in either direction. And I think that, with the options expiration combined on going into a holiday week next week, a shortened week for the US, it makes a little bit of sense.We also don't have any new direction. The market doesn't seem to be believing the recent Fed speakers. If we're talking about crude oil, crude oil is clearly pricing in slower economies globally, regardless of what China decides to do with their COVID Zero policy, which there were more headlines today that they're easing up on that policy.Supply is out there. Even though Saudi Arabia and the members of OPEC Plus have talked about production cuts, they've actually under-performed those cuts. So overall, the supply is therefore the demand, and the demand is expected to fall more and more as it becomes more and more likely that we're getting a global economic slowdown.- So Bob, what does all this mean for prices? Here we are today, below $80 a barrel. Are we headed even lower?BOB IACCINO: I almost hate that question, Seana, because I've been talking, probably the last time I was on with you I said it. I've been talking for a while that I thought we'd get to 65 before 105 and nothing has changed on that. I got a little nervous about that call about 10 days ago or so. But that still holds for me and I think $65 is kind of a stress point for OPEC and OPEC Plus.Story continuesThey're in the driver's seat in the short term, especially with the depletion of the SPR, because you can't go much lower than we've already gone. I mean, I guess you can, but it really puts national security at a threat if OPEC or any of the OPEC countries wanted to get actually nasty about it. So I'm still looking for that sort of, let's call it, $65 hit, and that's probably going to be the low we'll hold there.Crude oil has a characteristic. It moves sideways until there's a supply and demand disruption and the ranges of that sideways movement can be pretty wide. We're establishing a lower range now where we'll likely settle in, I'd call it between 70-85 until we figure out where that disruption is going to be, continued demand disruption or more supply disruptions that may drive prices higher.- Yeah, talking about driving prices higher, Bob, that was the big question I had for you, just in terms of the catalyst. If it's not supplies, what else can move prices to the upside?BOB IACCINO: I'm going to throw you guys a little curveball and tell you that it could be weather. Believe it or not, it could be weather. If we get a surprisingly cold winter across major parts of the globe, you're going to see demand for energy in general spike. And one of the things people don't know, we're still in a diesel supply shortage.Distillates, which diesel falls into distillates, are still 17% below their 5-year average in terms of inventory. Gasoline is not as tight, crude oil is not as tight but distillates are. And when you look at it from that perspective, heating oil, which a decent part of the US and major parts of the globe still uses to heat their homes outside of the natural gas spectrum, is made at the same time that diesel is. It's within that distillates range.So if you get a spike in demand for heating oil, the world of crude oil production and refineries will try to meet that and it'll slow the production of diesel fuel. And diesel fuel is already tight and it's a major part of the supply chain. So it really could cause a trickle down effect that nobody wants to see in the price of crude oil itself and subsequently the price of diesel and gasoline.- And Bob, as you mentioned the weather there, I know we've had guests on talking about how that's affecting some of the refineries down here as well. But also, as you look outside of the US, as we look at what's happening with China, they have a Zero COVID policy still in place. Trying to ease it has been spiking lately. So what does that do in terms of demand?BOB IACCINO: Well, I think, Rochelle, what you're going to see is they're going to step out of it, not sprint out of it. And that's one of the things that I think is being talked about now. The way to get out of COVID Zero, and all that does is bring in an extra trickle of demand, of which I would argue the supply is already there to satisfy.So that would probably get us toward the higher end of the range that I just mentioned that I think we're establishing, that's sort of $70-$85. But unless they all of a sudden say, no COVID Zero, we don't care if you're sick, which I don't see happening in China or really anywhere, you're not likely to see a huge spike off of lighter COVID restrictions in terms of COVID Zero policy. That could be a demand catalyst, but it won't be a large one, considering that I believe we're probably 800,000 barrels a day oversupplied at this point.- All right, Bob. Always great to get your perspective, especially on a week like this, when we saw such a downward move for crude. Thanks so much for joining us.]"

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Morgan Stanley The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Morgan StanleyOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Eric Grossman, for US$3.4m worth of shares, at about US$102 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$89.20. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.In total, Morgan Stanley insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Does Morgan Stanley Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Morgan Stanley insiders own about US$393m worth of shares (which is 0.3% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Morgan Stanley Insiders?The fact that there have been no Morgan Stanley insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Morgan Stanley insiders selling. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

(CRM): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-salesforce-inc-140002782.html,1668780002,STORY,['CRM'],"[Salesforce.com (CRM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this customer-management software developer have returned -5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +7.5% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Salesforce.com belongs, has gained 5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $1.21 per share, indicating a change of -4.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.73 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -1.1%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.54 indicates a change of +17.3% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.5%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Salesforce.com.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CRM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Salesforce.com, the consensus sales estimate of $7.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13.8%. The $30.93 billion and $35.29 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +16.8% and +14.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySalesforce.com reported revenues of $7.72 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +21.8%. EPS of $1.19 for the same period compares with $1.48 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.69 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.34%. The EPS surprise was +16.67%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Salesforce.com is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Salesforce.com. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It was looking to reopen it with funding from the initial phase of the Energy Department's $6 billion Civil Nuclear Credit program.""We fully understood that what we were attempting to do, restarting a shuttered nuclear plant, would be both a challenge and a first for the nuclear industry,"" said Patrick O'Brien, a spokesperson for Holtec.The decision presents a hurdle for President Joe Biden's administration which believes nuclear power is essential for combating climate change. Biden wants to make the power grid carbon free by 2035.The DOE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Nuclear power produces toxic waste, currently held at 28 plants across the country.ClearView Energy Partners, a nonpartisan research group, said in September that Palisades' closure was ""likely to be permanent."" Palisades was out of nuclear fuel, faced a control rod drive seal issue that needed to be fixed and likely needed a new company to operate it, as well as a buyer for the power it generates, ClearView said at the time.The CNC program, launched by the DOE this year, is intended for plants in states with competitive electricity markets and funded by the infrastructure bill that passed last year.The U.S. nuclear power industry's 92 reactors generate more than half of the country's carbon-free electricity. But about a dozen reactors have closed since 2013 in the face of competition from renewable energy and plants that burn plentiful natural gas.In the first phase of the CNC program, the DOE prioritized plants that had already shut or announced intentions to close. Power utility PG&amp;E Corp was the only other company to apply in the first phase, for its Diablo Canyon plant in California, slated to fully close by 2025. PG&amp;E did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the status of its application.

It’s also 8% below its Aug. high. Yet the unweighted S&amp;P 500 index is doing much better, down only 11% this year and just 4.5% off its Aug. high. The outperformance of the unweighted S&amp;P 500 indicates that investors should buy names aside from the big tech stocks that get the biggest weight in the regular S&amp;P 500 index. A good way to accomplish the latter goal is by finding some of the best value stocks to buyThe names featured in this column have low valuations, high profits, and strong growth. Moreover. they are likely to keep delivering high profits and exceptional growth for many years to come. As a result, sooner rather than later, these value stocks to buy are going to rally a great deal.FFord Motor$14.32TSCOTractor Supply$216.18MRKMerck$99.65DGDollar General$257.60PWRQuanta Services$144.82CFCF Industries$105.70MSIMotorola$250.36Value Stocks to Buy: Ford Motor (F)Ford dealership sign against a blue sky.Source: D K Grove / Shutterstock.comFord Motor’s (NYSE:F) auto sales have been weighed down by supply-chain issues that are starting to become less intense and should continue to do so over time. Nonetheless, the automaker reported strong third-quarter results, is generating solid profits and growth and has become a leader in the rapidly expanding U.S. electric-vehicle market. Moreover, F stock should be boosted meaningfully by the increased tax credits for consumer and commercial EVs that were passed by the U.S. Congress earlier this year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFor all of 2022, Ford expects its EBIT, excluding certain items, to climb 15% to roughly $11.5 billion, and it anticipates that its adjusted free cash flow will come in at $9.5 billion to $10.5 billion. Moreover, the automaker can take advantage of the connected-car revolution by selling monthly subscriptions to many services, such as battery monitoring and security offerings.Story continuesDespite all of Ford’s positive attributes, the forward price-earnings ratio of F stock is a measly 7.8.Value Stocks to Buy: Tractor Supply (TSCO)IDEX stock: An electric tractor sits in a field on a sunny day with a wind turbine in the background.Source: Matthew Troke / Shutterstock.comTractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO) sells products that cater to rural Americans, including farmers. Among its offerings are products for horses, cattle, and pets, “maintenance products” for farm machinery, and other tools used by farmers. With American farmers benefiting from high food prices and elevated demand for food around the world due to the Russia-Ukraine war, Tractor Supply, unsurprisingly, has been reporting very strong financial results.Last quarter, for example, its top line climbed 8.3% year-over-year to $3.27 billion, it reported earnings per share of $2.10, and its comparable store sales surged 5.7% YOY.As of the end of Q3, there were over 27 million households in TSCO’s “neighbor’s club,” which seems to be similar to Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Prime program and Costco’s (NASDAQ:COST) membership program. Tractor Supply’s club, whose members generate about 75% of the company’s revenue, gives TSCO a large, loyal customer base. The company can easily and inexpensively market its new products to these consumers, leaving it well-positioned to continue to deliver strong sales growth.Value Stocks to Buy: Merck (MRK)Brown glass pill bottle on its side showing white pills inside, with other pill bottles behind it representing MACK stock.Source: shutterstock.com/ChampheiIn past columns, I’ve outlined the tremendous amount of revenue that Merck’s (NYSE:MRK) versatile cancer treatment, Keytruda, is generating for the giant drug maker.Keytruda was the biggest factor behind Merck’s strong third-quarter results, as the drug’s sales climbed 20% year-over-year to $5.3 billion. Merck’s overall top line increased an impressive 14% YOY to $15 billion. Moreover, the giant expects its 2022 earnings per share to come in at an impressive $7.32-$7.37, meaning that its price-earnings ratio, based on its 2022 EPS guidance, is a rather low 13.6. (100/$7.35)Also contributing to Merck’s strong Q3 results and its solid 2022 guidance are its “Human Papillomavirus vaccines.” Last quarter, the revenue generated by those shots climbed 15% YOY to $2.3 billion.Citing the strong sales of Merck’s key drugs, Cantor Fitzgerald on Oct. 28 raised its price target on the shares to $120 from $107 and said that the company’s strong outlook is “underappreciated” by the Street. Cantor maintained an “overweight” rating on the name.Dollar General (DG)Source: ShutterstockI’ve hypothesized that dollar stores will get a big boost as inflation squeezes working-class and poor Americans. Agreeing with that idea last month was research firm Placer.ai. In the words of Seeking Alpha, Placer.ai believes that “increasing pressure on middle and low-income consumers is promoting a trade-down to discount stores.” The firm added that “Dollar stores are seeing lower-income consumers trade down from traditional superstores such as Walmart.”  Dollar General (NYSE:DG) has benefited from that trend in the past and is likely to continue to do so in the future. In the second quarter, its top line increased 9% year-over-year to $9.43 billion, while its same-store sales rose 4.6% YOY and its Q2 earnings per share came in at $2.98. The retailer also increased its full-year sales growth guidance to 11% from 10%-10.5%, and it expected its earnings per share to rise 12%-14% in fiscal 2022. Despite its strong, positive catalysts, DG stock has a reasonable forward price-earnings ratio of 19.5.Quanta Services (PWR)electricity pylons and lines at duskSource: snvv18870020330 / Shutterstock.comAs I noted in a previous column, published on Sept. 29, Quanta (NYSE:PWR) “develops, repairs and maintains electric grids globally and renewable energy systems. It also carries out engineering projects for companies involved in the production of natural gas and oil prices.”I predicted that the company and PWR stock would get a lift from the electric-vehicle revolution, along with increased exploration for oil and gas amid high prices for those commodities. Quanta’s third-quarter results, reported on Nov 3, indicated that the company is indeed benefiting from those trends. Specifically, its sales jumped by a huge 33% year-over-year to $4.46 billion, while it generated $343 million of cash flow from operations. For all of 2022, the company expects its earnings per share to come in at $6.15-$6.39, excluding certain items, and its backlog at the end of Q3 stood at a very high $20.9 billion, which represented an all-time record for it.“Demand for our services continues to be driven by broad-based business strength from utility grid modernization and system hardening initiatives, as well as our reputation for solid and safe execution,” Quanta CEO Duke Austin, reported on the company’s Q3 earnings conference call. Given Quanta’s rapid growth and strong outlook, its forward price-earnings ratio of 20.3 is quite attractive.CF Industries (CF)A tractor spreading fertilizer over a farm field.Source: Fotokostic / Shutterstock.comLike Tractor Supply, CF Industries (NYSE:CF) is a fertilizer maker and is benefiting from high food prices brought about partly by the Russia-Ukraine War. Additionally, since Russia and Ukraine are both major exporters of fertilizer, the conflict has caused fertilizer prices to soar, benefiting CF and its peers.Last quarter, CF’s top line soared an incredible 70% year-over-year to $2.3 billion, while its EBITDA came in at an impressive $826 million. The fertilizer maker noted that geopolitical issues had increased the average selling prices of its products last quarter. Moreover, CF reported that it expects the supply-demand dynamics of one of its key offerings, nitrogen, to stay favorable “into 2025,” Seeking Alpha noted.“We expect to continue generating substantial free cash flow, which will enable us to invest prudently in high-return growth projects while at the same time returning significant capital to shareholders,” CF CEO Tony Will reported on the company’s Q3 earnings call.Despite its powerful growth and strong outlook, the forward price-earnings ratio of CF stock currently stands at 7.01.Motorola Solutions (MSI)communication technology for internet business. global world network and telecommunication on earthSource: greenbutterfly / Shutterstock.comMotorola Solutions (NYSE:MSI) appears to be benefiting from an important trend in the U.S.  that’s not discussed much in most media outlets: the huge crime wave that’s afflicting many American cities.Due to reforms in the criminal justice system, many more criminals are walking the streets than in prior years in multiple, major cities. That could explain why the demand for the company’s video-security products has surged. In the second quarter, for example, the revenue generated by its “Video security and access control” systems climbed 21% year over year, while its backlog soared 19% year over year to a “record $13.4 billion.”Last quarter, Motorola Solutions reported that ” increased demand for video security and land mobile radio technologies” helped boost its “Products and Systems Integration” sales by 15% year over year to a record level. For all of 2022, the company expects its sales to increase by 9.25%-9.5%, and it expects its earnings per share to come in at $10.17-$10.22.Analysts, on average, expect its 2023 EPS to come in at $11.19. That puts its forward price-earnings ratio at 22.4 (251/11.19), which is attractive given its strong growth and highly certain, strong outlook. Additionally, the shares have a dividend yield of 1.27%.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

You can skip our detailed analysis of Gates' foundation and its performance over the years, and go directly to read Bill Gates' Top 5 Dividend Stocks. Founded in 2000, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust is one of America’s largest private charitable organizations. The fund has expanded its reach over the years by developing philanthropic institutions in low-income countries and areas around the world. Since its inception, the fund has spent over $53.8 billion in grants, donations, and other humanitarian activities. As of January 2022, the firm’s funding commitments to fight Covid-19 surpassed $2 billion. Mark Suzman is currently serving as the Chief Executive Officer of the firm.In one of her interviews with Bloomberg in September, Melinda Gates mentioned that the onset of the pandemic has hampered the progress of various issues, especially poverty and climate change. She further emphasized her commitment to this global platform to fight social inequities prevalent in the world today. Both Bill and Melinda Gates have shown their allegiance to the fund by funding work in over 144 countries. In addition to this, the Gates Foundation provided charitable support worth over $6.7 billion in 2021, covering various areas including global development, health, and gender equality. In July, Bill Gates announced to increase in the fund’s payout by 50% over pre-pandemic levels, to approximately $9 billion by 2026, up from $6 billion in pre-Covid times, as reported by Wall Street Journal.Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust has roughly $34 billion in assets under management as of Q3 2022, compared with $17.6 billion in the preceding quarter. The fund’s investments during the quarter are within the tech, services, finance, and industrial goods sectors. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Coupang, Inc. (NYSE:CPNG) are some of the firm’s major holdings in the third quarter. In this article, we will discuss some of the best dividend stocks in Bill Gates’ portfolio.Story continuesBill Gates' Top 10 Dividend StocksOur Methodology:For this list, we selected dividend stocks from Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation's Q3 2022 13F portfolio. The stocks are ranked according to their stake value in Bill Gates' portfolio.Bill Gates' Top 10 Dividend Stocks10. FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX)Bill Gates’ Stake Value: $227,807,000 Dividend Yield as of November 17: 2.71%FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) is an American transport company that specializes in e-commerce and related business services. During Q3 2022, The Gates Foundation purchased additional one million shares in the company, boosting its position by 188%. The fund's total FDX stake amounted to over $227.8 million. The company represented 2.71% of Bill Gates' portfolio.In addition to Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Coupang, Inc. (NYSE:CPNG), FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) is another prominent holding of Bill Gates in Q3 2022.FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.15 per share for a dividend yield of 2.71%, as of November 17. The company is one of the top dividend stocks on our list as it has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 21 years.In October, Jefferies initiated its coverage on FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) with a Hold rating and a $170 price target, highlighting the company's recent quarterly earnings.The number of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owning stakes in FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) stood at 63 in Q2 2022, growing from 52 in the previous quarter. These stakes hold a consolidated value of over $1.75 billion.Artisan Partners mentioned FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Earnings results at FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), a global shipping and logistics firm, disappointed due to slowing volumes—principally in its Express segment, which resulted in negative operating leverage—in addition to continued cost pressures. The Express business has been affected by trade disruptions in Asia from China’s COVID lockdowns, as well as the mix of global consumer spending trending back toward services and away from goods—a normalization of pandemic-driven consumer behavior. A key question for investors is how much of this demand slowdown is idiosyncratic and therefore less likely to repeat and how much is the start of a possible cyclical slowdown. To counter these headwinds, FedEx is looking to achieve cost reductions while it continues to implement multi-year structural cost reduction initiatives focused on technology investments and efficiency gains. Given a mixed track record and the recent earnings miss, there is a high degree of skepticism embedded in the current stock price as it sells for less than 8X our estimate of normalized earnings. While operating results can be choppy, the longer term business economics are highly favorable given the global shipping industry’s consolidated structure and massive barriers to entry that afford operators with pricing power to counter cost inflation and earn respectable returns on capital over the business cycle.”9. Waste Connections, Inc. (NYSE:WCN)Bill Gates’ Stake Value: $290,418,000 Dividend Yield as of November 17: 0.74%Waste Connections, Inc.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Waste Connections, Inc. (NYSE:WCN) is a solid waste company providing non-hazardous waste collection, transfer and disposal services, and recycling services in mostly exclusive and secondary markets throughout the United States and Canada. The company has operated well throughout the recent period of rising cost pressures by largely succeeding in passing through the majority of the elevated costs to customers. Investors also have appreciated the defensive characteristics inherent in the firm’s business model as we potentially approach a period of economic uncertainty.”8. Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V.

(NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance.

AQR Capital's trend-following strategies are racking up significant gains this year as quants win inflation-driven price patterns in almost all asset categories. AQR Capital’s Managed Futures Full Volatility Strategy, representing about $1 billion in assets, returned more than 9% to investors in the 30-day period ending October 6, which takes the total returns this year to 70%. Simultaneously, AQR’s $450 million Alternative Trend Strategy has posted a 47% gain in 2022. AQR’s primary strategy is to utilize derivatives to follow price trends in most asset classes, including stocks, bonds, commodities, and credit-default swaps. Bloomberg data suggests that a broad index tracking rule-based trend investing from Societe Generale SA is up 31%, marking one of the best gains for this year. Comparatively, AQR’s primary mutual fund has returned about 38% to investors this year. Yao Hua Ooi, principal at AQR, said in an interview: “If macroeconomic volatility stays high and asset classes continue to show big moves in the same direction, we expect to see continued high returns for these strategies.”As of the end of the third quarter of 2022, AQR Capital had discretionary assets under management of $145.45 billion, and the hedge fund managed a Q3 portfolio worth $41 billion. Some of the most notable stocks in the AQR portfolio include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc.

Securities filings for the third quarter of 2022 reveal that AQR Capital owns 2.6 million shares of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) worth about $357 million, representing 0.87% of the total portfolio. On November 15, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak reiterated an Equal Weight rating on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $100 from $105. Indicators of a soft ad market continued to increase through Q3 earnings season as 14 of 19 firms he covers in the sector either missed Q3 ad revenue estimates or slashed forward growth expectations, the analyst told investors.

(NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of the top stock picks of AQR Capital. Baron Funds made the following comment about Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Shares of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), the world’s largest social network, were down 16% during the quarter primarily due to broader digital advertising weakness and continued difficulties with advertising effectiveness as a result of Apple’s enhanced privacy features implemented in late 2021. We believe Meta will successfully resolve its short-term advertising technology issues by increasing AI adoption and by driving greater in-App user engagement with businesses, enabling it to grow its understanding of people’s interests based on first-party data. Longer term, we believe Meta will utilize its leadership in mobile advertising, massive user base, and technological scale to provide global advertisers targeted marketing capabilities at scale, with additional monetization opportunities ahead in newer areas such as Reels (Meta’s competing solution to TikTok) and e-commerce.”9. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67AQR Capital's Stake Value: $365,686,000CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is an American provider of health services in the United States. The company operates through Health Care Benefits, Pharmacy Services, and Retail/LTC segments.

For full-year 2022, CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) raised the adjusted EPS guidance range to $8.55-$8.65 from $8.40-$8.60, compared to an $8.55 consensus. The company lifted cash flow from operations guidance range to $13.5 billion-$14.5 billion from $12.5 billion-$13.5 billion. Raymond James analyst John Ransom on November 14 maintained an Outperform rating on CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $115 from $120 following Q3 results that were better-than-anticipated, supported by robust results in HCB, while the PBM and retail were comparatively in line. For 2024, the analyst sees risk to management's EPS estimate of low double-digit growth given the macro headwinds, but believes that it has already been priced into the shares. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 67 hedge funds were bullish on CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) at the end of the third quarter of 2022, compared to 65 funds in the preceding quarter. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is a significant position holder in the company, with more than 3 million shares worth $293.7 million. Here is what Vltava Fund has to say about CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“CVS is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years.We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt.This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”8. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75AQR Capital's Stake Value: $379,998,000Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), the American oil and gas supermajor, has consistently featured on the AQR portfolio since the last quarter of 2010, apart from a few breaks over the years.

This project will have the potential to store about 3 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide. On November 11, Piper Sandler analyst Ryan Todd raised the price target on Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) to $131 from $113 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares. The Q3 results were incrementally bullish for the integrated oil 2023 macro outlook, the analyst told investors in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 75 hedge funds were long Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 72 funds in the prior quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners held the largest stake in the company, comprising 33.8 million shares worth approximately $3 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, First Eagle Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Integrated oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) performed well in the second quarter as continued high prices for energy products supported the stock. As the largest refiner in the US, the company has benefitted from wide “crack spreads,” or the margin between the cost of crude oil and the petroleum products extracted from it. Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industry wide has been in steady decline since 2019. We are pleased that Exxon has been using its strong cash flows to reduce debt and to return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.”7. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88AQR Capital's Stake Value: $381,898,000AQR Capital has owned a position in Tesla, Inc.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) from the firm's ""Best Ideas"" list, citing his short-term view that things are ""increasingly becoming more challenged,"" though his longer-term bullish view of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) remains largely unchanged. He sees ""a very nervous few months ahead for Tesla investors"" as they ""remain the ones that have been punched again and again by the Musk Twitter antics,"" Ives said. However, the stock is ""deep in the investor penalty box until deliveries hit in early January,"" and the analyst maintained an Outperform rating on Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 88 funds reported owning stakes worth $7.4 billion in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) at the end of the third quarter of 2022, compared to 73 funds in the prior quarter worth $7.1 billion.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an electric vehicle manufacturer with a significant technological lead in its large and rapidly growing addressable market. Shares outperformed during the quarter despite covid 19 shutdowns at the company’s shanghai production plant early in the period. During this quarter, the company also ramped up production at its newer Germany and Texas plants. While investors were aware of these challenging variables, the company’s quarterly results exceeded expectations thanks to lower-than-expected operating expenses. Investors are aware that ramping up electric vehicle production is challenging and recognize it’s difficult to estimate production rates.”6. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 269AQR Capital's Stake Value: $422,010,000Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a long-term holding of AQR Capital. The hedge fund has owned a stake in the company since the last quarter of 2010, except for a few breaks over the years. In the third quarter of 2022, AQR held 3.7 million shares of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) worth $422 million, representing 1.02% of the total portfolio. On November 16, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced that its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services, would establish an infrastructure region in Spain and invest up to $2.6 billion in the country over the span of a decade. This will generate more than 1,300 full-time jobs in Spain and add approximately $1.8 billion to the country’s gross domestic product.MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Morton on November 15 assumed coverage of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) with an Outperform rating and a $118 price target. The analyst does not believe in the bear case scenario of peak e-commerce penetration and thinks e-commerce penetration growth will continue at the historical pace. He prefers market share gainers and finds it ""challenging to have an appetite for market share losers"" as he noted that the algorithm of the internet ""creates a self-fulfilling prophecy for continued share loss once it starts.""According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 269 hedge funds were long Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), up from 252 funds in the prior quarter. The collective stakes in Q3 increased to $34.6 billion from $30 billion in Q2. In addition to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is backed by AQR Capital and other elite hedge funds. Baron Funds made the following comment about Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world’s largest e-commerce retailer and cloud services provider. Shares of Amazon increased 6% in the quarter after the company reported strong results with 7% year-over-year revenue growth driven by 33% growth in Amazon Web Services (AWS), Amazon’s leading cloud computing service, while guiding for an acceleration in third quarter revenue growth, which is expected to be between 13% and 17% year-over-year. Amazon’s share of e-commerce is roughly 40%, far ahead of competition, yet domestic e-commerce accounted for only 14.5% of total retail sales (according to U.S. Census Bureau data for the second quarter of 2022), implying durable growth opportunities ahead. Internationally, the opportunity remains large as Amazon still has less than a 2% market share of international retail spending. Its advertising share is also only 3% and growing, underpinned by the structural closed-loop systems it enables (merchants know exactly whether their ad dollars resulted in a purchase since they are all done on the Amazon platform), which enables accurate targeting and measurement. Lastly, AWS has a good runway for growth as the industry still represents only 9.5% out of the $4.3 trillion of global IT spending according to Gartner. Areas such as logistics and health care present additional optionality.” Click to continue reading and see AQR Capital's Top 5 Stock Picks.  Suggested articles:Ken Fisher Strategy12 Most Active Stocks To BuyRay Dalio Stock Portfolio 2022 Q3 Disclosure: None. AQR Capital's Performance, AUM and Top Stock Picks is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

If you want to read about some more high short interest stocks, go directly to 5 Best High Short Interest Stocks to Buy Now.Stock markets have long provided opportunities for investors to raise capital and change the world for the better. Indeed, stocks are one of the most reliable vehicles for investors in terms of returns and profit gains. Stock markets in the US, the largest in the world, are a power hub of the country and generate revenues to strengthen the economy. Some of the top stocks at these markets include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB). In recent years, the rise of fintech has forced investors to reconsider investments in traditional stocks. In a volatile market, elite investors are shorting speculative bets to balance their risk portfolios. Some of these short bets might present an interesting short squeeze opportunity. At the beginning of 2021, retail investors had banded together and earned hundreds of millions by betting against hedge fund shorts. Since then, interest in stocks with high short interest, some of which offer solid long-term potential, has climbed rapidly. As a sense of normalcy returns to the market in light of recent inflation numbers and comments from top economic experts regarding the possibility of a recovery, these high short interest stocks are slowly making their way back into the spotlight. Our MethodologyThe companies that have a short interest of more than 20% were selected for the list. The short interest of each stock was taken from Yahoo Finance. The analyst ratings of these firms and the latest updates related to them are also discussed to provide some additional context. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Story continuesWe called them the ""best"" stocks to consider because despite the high short interest, several Wall Street analysts have given positive ratings to these firms. Some of these companies also show positive hedge fund sentiment. These stocks also have chances to ride the wave of short squeezes launched by Reddit investors.10 Best High Short Interest Stocks to Buy NowPhoto by Austin Distel on UnsplashBest High Short Interest Stocks to Buy Now10.

The company's shares saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at Sysco’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Sysco Is Sysco Still Cheap?Great news for investors – Sysco is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $139.74, but it is currently trading at US$84.10 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Sysco’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What does the future of Sysco look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Sysco's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 87%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since SYY is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on SYY for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy SYY. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.If you want to dive deeper into Sysco, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

(NASDAQ: AAPL), which has sold 1.3 billion iPhones since 2007 and reported a $19.4 billion profit last quarter?Or Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), which went from selling just 937 cars in 2009 to over 300,000 last year?Some savvy income investors might consider Altria Group Inc. (NYSE: MO). The tobacco giant, formerly Phillip Morris International Inc., has grown its dividends by 631% since 2002. That streak of dividend hikes is possible when you sell an addictive product to hundreds of millions of people.But there’s one little-known company that left these household names in the dust.The Unknown Stock That Beat Every Wall Street DarlingMonster Beverage Corp. (NASDAQ: MNST) is a company no one ever described as changing the world. It’s not putting an iPhone into every third human’s hand or solving climate change.Yet this energy drink company returned 87,560% from 2000 to 2020 — enough to turn every $1 invested into $876.Why was Monster Beverage able to dramatically outperform these world-changing companies?Part of the reason comes from its size — Monster Beverage recorded $92 million in revenue in 2002 while Apple reported $5.7 billion. A smaller company can grow revenue — and ultimately its earnings and share price — much faster than a company that’s already a behemoth.But there’s bigger factor at play. Apple spent $446 million on research and development in 2002 to stay ahead of its competitors and maintain its existing operations. By 2022, its annual operating costs had reached $274 billion.To keep the lights on, Apple had to spend $274 billion or the company could no longer make and sell products. By contrast, Monster Beverage spent just $4.6 billion on operating costs in 2022.It turns out that an energy-drink business is a lot less capital-intensive than a tech business — and this difference, compounded over the years, means that Monster Beverage had hundreds of billions of dollars more to plow into growing its business by expanding operations and claiming greater market share.Story continuesA similar dynamic benefitted Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO). If you’ve ever wondered why the ticker symbol is KO rather than CO or CC, it’s because Wall Street settled on an acronym for “knock out.” The sentiment was that investing in Coca-Cola was a slam dunk because the invaluable brand name commanded loyalty from hundreds of millions around the world. How could investors go wrong?Sure enough, $100 invested in Coca-Cola at the time of its 1919 initial public offering (IPO) would have turned into $1.25 million a century later. A lot of factors are behind that performance, but it’s not a coincidence that Coca-Cola had to pay just $24 billion in operating costs in 2020, or less that 10% of what Apple paid.Benzinga has a lot to say on the battles between tech giants to capture hundreds of billions of dollars in market share of revolutionary trends like blockchain technology, 5G and clean energy. But as stocks like Monster Beverage show, slow and steady can sometimes win the race.Benzinga is tracking one company with striking parallels to Monster Beverage. It also has a product designed to improve energy levels and performance. It’s already profitable, but with just $17 million in sales since 2012, is even smaller than Monster Beverage was at the turn of the century.Don't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

Shares have added about 16.8% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is PPG Industries due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.PPG Industries’ Q3 Earnings Miss Estimates, Sales BeatPPG Industries logged net income of $329 million or $1.39 per share in third-quarter 2022, down from the year-ago quarter’s profit of $344 million or $1.43 per share.Barring one-time items, adjusted earnings were $1.66 per share in the reported quarter, down from $1.69 logged in the year-ago quarter. The figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.67.Net sales rose roughly 2% year over year to $4,468 million. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,459.6 million. The top line was driven by higher selling prices. However, volumes were hurt by weaker demand in Europe, lower demand recovery in China on a sequential comparison basis and unfavorable currency swings. Organic sales rose more than 9%, aided by higher selling prices.Segment HighlightsPerformance Coatings: Net sales in the segment were $2,705 million in the reported quarter, down 2% year over year, as lower sales volumes, divestitures, the wind down of business in Russia and unfavorable currency impacts more than offset higher selling prices in all businesses. Sales volumes in the segment were down 6%. Selling prices rose 11% year over year.Segment income declined 11% year over year to $362 million. The downside was caused by raw material, logistics and labor cost inflation, unfavorable currency, higher manufacturing costs and lower sales volumes, partly offset by increased selling prices and restructuring cost savings.Industrial Coatings: Sales in the segment were $1,763 million, up 9% year over year. Sales rose due to higher selling prices across all businesses and increased sales volumes, partly offset by the wind down of business in Russia and unfavorable currency impacts. Sales volumes rose 2% year over year and selling prices were up 14% year over year.Segment income totaled $192 million, up 37% year over year. The upside was driven by increased selling prices and higher volumes, partly masked by higher raw material and energy costs and unfavorable currency translation.Story continuesFinancialsPPG Industries ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,029 million, down roughly 15% year over year. Long-term debt rose around 6% year over year to $6,478 million.OutlookMoving ahead, the company sees normal seasonal demand trends in the fourth quarter. Economic activity is predicted to remain weak in Europe and China. The company also envisions demand for architectural do-it-for-yourself paint products to continue to soften globally. The company also said that an additional cost-restructuring program is underway targeting $70 million in annualized savings upon full implementation.PPG Industries projects adjusted earnings per share (EPS) in the band of $1.05-$1.20 for fourth-quarter 2022, barring amortization expenses of 13 cents and costs related to earlier approved and communicated business restructuring of 2 cents. It also sees reported EPS of 90 cents to $1.05 for the quarter.The company also expects aggregate sales volumes to be down a mid-single-digit percentage on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.The consensus estimate has shifted -12.87% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, PPG Industries has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a C. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise PPG Industries has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:GS) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group Goldman Sachs Group Insider Transactions Over The Last YearNotably, that recent sale by Brian Lee is the biggest insider sale of Goldman Sachs Group shares that we've seen in the last year. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$380. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.In the last year Goldman Sachs Group insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At Goldman Sachs Group Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Goldman Sachs Group shares. Specifically, insiders ditched US$6.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Insider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Goldman Sachs Group insiders own about US$623m worth of shares (which is 0.5% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Goldman Sachs Group Tell Us?Insiders haven't bought Goldman Sachs Group stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. While conducting our analysis, we found that Goldman Sachs Group has 2 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore these.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

68,457f8d0a-7736-3b05-83da-3075a7419da8,SLB,2022-11-19,Are Robust Financials Driving The Recent Rally In Schlumberger Limited's (NYSE:SLB) Stock?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robust-financials-driving-recent-rally-140016163.html,1668780016,STORY,['SLB'],"[Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 42% over the last three months. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on Schlumberger's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Schlumberger How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Schlumberger is:17% = US$3.0b ÷ US$18b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.17.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Schlumberger's Earnings Growth And 17% ROETo begin with, Schlumberger seems to have a respectable ROE. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 11%. Despite this, Schlumberger's five year net income growth was quite low averaging at only 4.5%. This is generally not the case as when a company has a high rate of return it should usually also have a high earnings growth rate. Such a scenario is likely to take place when a company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures.Story continuesWhen you consider the fact that the industry earnings have shrunk at a rate of 4.4% in the same period, the company's net income growth is pretty remarkable.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for SLB? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Schlumberger Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?While Schlumberger has a decent LTM (or last twelve month) payout ratio of 28% (or a retention ratio of 72%), it has seen very little growth in earnings. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.Moreover, Schlumberger has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 29%. Regardless, the future ROE for Schlumberger is predicted to rise to 21% despite there being not much change expected in its payout ratio.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Schlumberger's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

BofA securities senior US media and entertainment analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich joins us now. Jessica, walk us through what you're expecting to come from Netflix, especially on this ad tier side, which is, what, about a month-- well, not a full month in, but it started already.JESSICA REIF EHRLICH: You're right. It's a few weeks in. Well, we initiated coverage. We took over the coverage from another analyst at the firm and have a really bullish view on two things, really, that are different. One is the AVOD, or the advertising platform. And the second thing is password sharing.So on advertising, Netflix's reach, their viewership dwarfs every other media company. I mean, they're almost twice as much as the next streaming service. And I'm including all of the companies that I cover, whether it's Paramount, Peacock, which is NBCU, Warner Brothers Discovery, Disney, et cetera.So they have massive reach, massive viewership. And obviously, they're not being monetized from an advertising perspective. And these are demographics that the advertisers want because they can't get them on linear TV. They're either cord cutters or cord nevers, or they're watching on streaming, but they tend to be younger. So they're highly attractive.The second thing is the ad load will be very light, four to five minutes an hour versus 15 minutes plus on linear. The ads will be addressable or targeted so they're more relevant. And it's just, the combination of all of these things makes the platform extremely attractive to advertisers. And if we kind of step back and think about it, when Peacock launched at the end of 2018, they had a billion dollars in advertising commitments with negligible subs. And that's not the case with Netflix.Story continuesSo they launched in 12 markets. The US is the biggest ad market. And we'll see, but they're only launching it on their basic tier, which is the lowest tier. And as they say, they want to walk-- no, I'm sorry-- crawl, walk, and run. So they started slow, and then they'll build from there. But we really think the demand will be huge.JULIE HYMAN: Maybe run, walk, crawl is what the stock has done, Jessica, in terms of the sentiment around this company, which has swung so incredibly from the highs to lows here, and now seems to be clawing back with more optimism coming in about this new ad tier. You've got a $370 price target on the stock. What do you think is going to be the catalyst or catalyst to get it there? Is it going to be some numbers starting to come out as they start this new tier?JESSICA REIF EHRLICH: Well, for one thing-- I mean, there's a couple of things. One is we think that the numbers have come down low enough across the Street. So there were some unpleasant surprises in the past year. And we think numbers have really been reset. Two is anything they say about advertising as they go forward. And again, they're starting with only a small portion of their base. They will eventually roll it out to standard and premium.We're 100% confident in that because they're hiring extremely well. They've hired across digital media companies. They've hired really well from everyone we talk to in the advertising industry. So they're really building for a reason. And of course, they have a Microsoft guarantee.So first thing is AVOD. Second thing, I would say the password sharing over the next one to two years is going to be a big deal. Netflix says there are 30 million you can subs who watch for free or not paying, or as they call it, borrowers, and 100 million worldwide. Who doesn't know a password sharer?So there are ways that they can crack down and cut off people who are not paying for the service. And so whether they get $2 because they are an extension of existing subs, or people really sign up with a full profile and pay a higher price, that is complete upside for them. And you can make assumptions, 25%, 50%, but it's significant.And I'd say another point, in our view, that's a really big deal is free cash flow is about to explode. This year, they've guided to a billion dollars in free cash. And our projection is that will reach $4 billion over the next three years. So it's really in just the beginning phases of the free cash flow growth.BRIAN SOZZI: Jessica, looking out a little bit longer term, do you think Netflix, just given its relationship with Microsoft, that's where Netflix might ultimately live, inside of Microsoft?JESSICA REIF EHRLICH: It's funny. People have asked what Netflix might buy, but it's interesting you ask it that way because we do think Netflix is an incredibly attractive target. And it could be Microsoft. It could be many other companies. I can think of many companies that would love to have that network-- I mean that Netflix platform.BRIAN SOZZI: All right, we'll leave it there. Jessica Reif Ehrlich, BofA securities senior US media and entertainment analyst, good to see you. Have a great weekend.JESSICA REIF EHRLICH: You, too.]"

77,6d281fd9-de3f-35ee-9c43-60ac83d4c8e0,PSX,2022-11-19,Phillips 66 (PSX) is a Great Momentum Stock: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/phillips-66-psx-great-momentum-170005143.html,1668790805,STORY,['PSX'],"[Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Phillips 66 (PSX), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Phillips 66 currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for PSX that show why this oil refiner shows promise as a solid momentum pick.Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor PSX, shares are up 7.56% over the past week while the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry is up 2.23% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 12.27% compares favorably with the industry's 8.53% performance as well.While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Shares of Phillips 66 have increased 16.97% over the past quarter, and have gained 48.87% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved -7.23% and -14.46%, respectively.Investors should also take note of PSX's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, PSX is averaging 3,495,620 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with PSX.Over the past two months, 4 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost PSX's consensus estimate, increasing from $16.37 to $21.00 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 6 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that PSX is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Phillips 66 on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

78,13e59fed-acfb-310e-8b6c-0f25a38afaa7,PSX,2022-11-19,Phillips 66 and Hertz Global have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/phillips-66-hertz-global-highlighted-145402406.html,1668783242,STORY,"['PSX', 'HTZ', 'OXY', 'HES']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – November 18, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares Phillips 66 PSX as the Bull of the Day and Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. HTZ as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Occidental Petroleum OXY, Hess Corporation HES and Marathon Oil MRO.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Phillips 66 is an oil and gas firm that topped our quarterly estimates in early November and boosted its guidance once again for 2022, and more importantly, for fiscal 2023.Phillips 66 shares have soared in 2022, yet its improved earnings outlook has kept its valuation levels very appealing. Plus, its strong dividend yield is much-needed as investors attempt to find ways to keep pace with inflation. And it said earlier this month that it will return an additional $10 billion to $12 billion to shareholders between mid-year 2022 and the end of 2024.Phillips 66 BasicsPhillips 66’s diversified energy portfolio includes midstream operations, which generally features the transport and storage of crude oil before it is refined and processed. The company also runs a refining segment that turns crude into everything from fuels for transpiration to lubricants and specialty products such as petroleum coke, solvents, and other products.On top of its chemicals, refining, and specialties segment, Phillips 66 runs a successful marketing segment. The company operates Phillips 66 branded gas stations and service stations around the U.S. and beyond. Phillips 66 is also making sure it’s prepared for the expansion and likely transition to alternative fuels and energy in the coming decades and beyond.Phillips 66’s emerging energy efforts include renewable fuels, batteries, carbon capture, and hydrogen. For instance, the company said recently that it’s converting its San Francisco refinery in Rodeo, California into “one of the world’s largest renewable fuels facilities,” with the project set to begin commercial operations in Q1 of 2024.Story continuesRecent Growth and OutlookPhillips 66 and others benefited immensely from rising oil and energy prices amid the huge rebound in demand as the U.S. and economies around the globe soared back to life after the covid crash. Travel, including air, has already mounted a serious comeback and broader energy demand is returning to pre-covid levels. Plus, the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine continues to negatively impact oil and gas supplies.Even though oil prices have come back down from their peaks of over $100 a barrel, they have hovered between roughly $80 and $90 a barrel for the last few months. Phillips 66’s revenue skyrocketed 74% last year, with its adjusted earnings up from a loss of -$0.89 per share to +$5.70 a share.Phillips 66 has topped our quarterly estimates by an average of 28% in the trailing four quarters, including a 30% third quarter beat on November 1. Management was able to raise their guidance once again for FY22 and fiscal 2023, which is no easy task amid the current environment that’s seen the wider S&amp;P 500 earnings picture fade.PSX’s four quarter and first quarter FY23 consensus estimates are now up 41% and 49%, respectively over the past 60 days. Phillips 66’s FY22 and FY23 EPS estimates have climbed by 28% and 30%, respectively during this same stretch. Zacks estimates call for its 2022 revenue to soar 47% to $169.32 billion to help boost its adjusted earnings by roughly 270% from under $6 a share all the way to $21.00 per share.Phillips 66 is currently projected to see its revenue and earnings decline on a YoY basis in 2023 as they come up against nearly impossible to compete against periods. But there is no guarantee that those estimates don’t continue to improve as they have over the last several months.Other FundamentalsThe so-called lost decade for oil and gas companies forced everyone in the industry to reevaluate every aspect of their business, slimming down operations to run more efficiently than ever. The cost-cutting measures are now paying off in a huge way amid rebounding oil and energy prices. The trimmed down operations will also help Phillips 66 and others keep margins relatively high going forward.Phillips 66 generated $3.1 billion in cash from operations in the third quarter. This helped the company return $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases last quarter. Better yet, PSX announced during its investor day on November 9 that it plans to return an additional $10 billion to $12 billion to shareholders between mid-year 2022 and the end of 2024 via buybacks and dividends.Additionally, Phillips 66 said it will start to roll out sustainable cost reductions of $1 billion through business transformations. With this in mind, Phillips 66’s 3.6% dividend yield blows away its industry’s 2% average, as well as oil and energy titan Exxon Mobil’s (XOM) 3.2%. The company also has a very sustainable 22% dividend payout ratio.Price and ValuationPSX shares have climbed 77% in the past two years to lag behind its highly-ranked industry’s 95% but blow away the S&amp;P 500’s 10% gain. More recently, Phillips 66 shares are up 10% in the last six months to hit new 52-week highs on November 14. And its current Zacks consensus price target offers 12% upside to the roughly $108 a share it trades at right now.On the valuation front, PSX trades at 7.2X forward 12-month earnings. This represents a 30% discount to its own 12-month median. Looking back further, the nearby chart showcases that Phillips 66 trades at a 35% discount to its own decade-long median and roughly in line with the Zacks Oil and Energy sector. And PSX trades not too far above its lows of 5.9X during this stretch.Bottom LinePhillips 66’s Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry ranks in the top 7% of over 250 Zacks industries. PSX also sports “A” grades for Value, Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system. Its commitment to boosting its dividend should help investors as they try to fight back against ongoing inflation. And investors looking for value during the current market and economic conditions would do well to consider Phillips 66 or other oil stocks.Phillips 66’s positive upward earnings revisions help it grab a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now. Plus, the broader oil and gas sector will likely remain a major backbone of economies around the world for decades to come. And let’s remember that Phillips 66 is already preparing for an alternative fuel and energy future.Bear of the Day:Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. is a rental car company that reemerged on the public markets after it filed for bankruptcy early in the pandemic. Hertz shares have gone on a wild, volatile ride in 2022 and are currently down 32%. And now Hertz’s earnings outlook is trending in the wrong direction.The BasicsHertz Global operates its namesake Hertz rental car company, as well as Dollar and Thrifty vehicle rental brands throughout North America, Europe, the Caribbean, Latin America, and beyond. The company is back on the public markets after it filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy relatively early in the pandemic in May 2020.The company’s CFO Kenny Cheung, who took over in September 2020, spoke to the Wall Street Journal earlier this month about how Hertz has been able to change. “The restructuring process we went through during chapter 11 had several long-term benefits for the business,” Cheung told the Wall Street Journal.“We made structural improvements to the business. This began with our contract mix where we walked away from unprofitable contracts. Then we looked at our segment mix and relocated cars away from unprofitable sectors and into more profitable ones such as the leisure traveler.”Near Term SetbacksHertz has benefitted from a major resurgence in travel. The company had also been the beneficiary of higher used car prices. HTZ and other rental car companies typically sell their vehicles when they reach a certain mileage or age. Those revenues are fading as used car prices start to normalize. Hertz said on its earnings call in late October that “residuals on used cars declined precipitously as Q3 progressed.”The company was still able to post solid results and it beat our bottom-line estimate for the fourth quarter in a row. And Zacks estimates call for its 2022 revenue to surge 19% to $8.73 billion as the travel market’s resurgence remains in full force. Hertz’s sales are then projected to climb another 4% higher in 2023.But the firm provided rather downbeat earnings guidance. Hertz’s Zacks consensus earnings estimate for FY22 is down 14% in the last 60 days, with FY23’s outlook 17% lower. With this in mind, its adjusted earnings are projected to fall 15% YoY to $3.71 per share and then slide 35% lower in FY23 to $2.42 per share.Bottom LineHertz’s downward earnings revisions help it land a Zack Rank #5 (Strong Sell) right now. And its Transportation – Services industry lands in the bottom 33% of over 250 Zacks industries. Plus, Hertz stock is down 32% in 2022 and it’s been on a rather volatile ride since it began trading again.Therefore, investors might want to find other opportunities to invest in the travel or transportation industries.Additional content:EIA Oil Supply Headlines: Crude Stocks Down, Fuel UpU.S. oil prices moved down on Nov 16 after government data showed a weekly build in gasoline and distillate supplies. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude futures settled at $85.59 a barrel yesterday — the lowest since Oct 25.Before going into the overall macro environment for oil, let's dig deep into the Energy Information Administration’s (""EIA"") Weekly Petroleum Status Report for the week ending Nov 11.Analyzing the Latest EIA ReportCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell 5.4 million barrels compared to expectations of a 400,000-barrel decrease per the analysts surveyed by S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights. The combination of a surge in exports, lower imports and higher refinery demand accounted for the big stockpile draw with the world’s biggest oil consumer.Total domestic stocks now stand at 435.4 million barrels — 0.6% more than the year-ago figure but 4% lower than the five-year average.The latest report also showed that supplies at the Cushing terminal (the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange) fell 1.6 million barrels to 25.6 million barrels.Meanwhile, the crude supply cover decreased from 28 days in the previous week to 27.4 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 28.5 days.Let’s turn to the products now.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies increased for the first time in five weeks. The 2.2 million-barrel rise was primarily attributable to a pullback in demand. Analysts had forecast that gasoline inventories would fall 800,000 barrels. At 207.9 million barrels, the current stock of the most widely used petroleum product is 1.9% less than the year-earlier level and 5% below the five-year average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) increased after dropping last week. The 1.1 million-barrel gain reflected a fall in demand. Meanwhile, the market looked for a supply draw of some 500,000 barrels. Despite last week’s build, current inventories — at 107.4 million barrels — are 13.2% below the year-ago level and 15% lower than the five-year average.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization, at 92.9%, rose 0.8% from the prior week.Final WordEven as fears revolving around high inflation and slowing growth somewhat cloud the outlook for Oil/Energy, it has remained the best S&amp;P 500 sector this year. The space has generated a total return of more than 66% in 2022 against the S&amp;P 500’s loss of around 17%. Apart from a positive fundamental picture, the sector is enjoying support from geopolitical uncertainty amid Russia’s military operations in Ukraine. In March, crude prices surged to multi-year highs of $130 on concerns about supplies from Russia, which is one of the world's largest producers of the commodity.Oil has pulled back from those lofty levels, with the conflict showing no sign of a quick resolution, the risk of dwindling inventory and the influential oil exporters’ group OPEC agreeing on a production curtailment means that the commodity has got enough reasons to stay elevated in the near-to-medium term.Consequently, three of the top four gainers of the S&amp;P 500 this year are all energy-related names: Occidental Petroleum, Hess Corporation and Marathon Oil.Occidental Petroleum: OXY is the top-performing S&amp;P 500 stock in 2022, with a gain of 148%. Occidental Petroleum beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 12.7%, on average.OXY has a projected earnings growth rate of 289.4% for this year. Occidental Petroleum is valued at around $68 billion.Hess Corp.: Hess shares have appreciated 98% so far in 2022. HES has a projected earnings growth rate of 231.1% for this year.Hess, with a market capitalization of $46 billion, enjoys a Zacks Growth Style Score of A. HES beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters, the average being 8.1%.Marathon Oil: This stock is among the best performers on the S&amp;P 500 Index, with shares having appreciated 92% in 2022. MRO, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has a projected earnings growth rate of 190.5% for this year.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Marathon Oil beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters. MRO has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 13.9%, on average.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

84,a7c9af3d-024f-3d44-b69a-e1ac90a60e45,NEM,2022-11-19,Newmont Corporation (NEM) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/newmont-corporation-nem-attracting-investor-140002915.html,1668780002,STORY,['NEM'],"[Newmont Corporation (NEM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this gold and copper miner have returned +8.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +7.5% change. The Zacks Mining - Miscellaneous industry, to which Newmont belongs, has gained 13.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Newmont is expected to post earnings of $0.48 per share, indicating a change of -38.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -24.2% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $1.89 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -36.2%. This estimate has changed -15.9% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.25 indicates a change of +18.7% from what Newmont is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -7%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Newmont.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NEM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Newmont, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.92 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -13.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $11.81 billion and $12.04 billion estimates indicate -3.4% and +2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNewmont reported revenues of $2.63 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -9%. EPS of $0.27 for the same period compares with $0.60 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.79 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -5.59%. The EPS surprise was -6.9%.Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Newmont is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Newmont. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Let's take a look at some of the biggest movers of the week. A big theme this week-- we've been talking a lot about it-- it's retail. A number of the larger players reporting quarterly results. You can see some of those names on the screen right here. Walmart, Macy's, and Target. Well, taking a look at the retail heat map as we take a look at what the performance of a number of these larger names.I want to draw your attention to first Walmart because that's been a gainer this week. Up just about 5 and 1/2%. The company really getting an edge here in the current economic environment because consumers are trading down. We certainly saw that reflected in their results. And they outperformed in the most recent quarter.We're also looking at Macy's, up just around 6% on the week. Shares spiked about 15% earlier this week after the company reported better than expected earnings. But CEO Jeff Gannett did flag some uncertainty about the holiday season. At least for now, looks like Wall Street is able to shrug off some of that concern off.I also want to point out what we saw in Target because, on the other hand, a very different picture. Looking at losses over the past five days of just about 6%. The company highlighting the fact that consumers are starting to pull back on discretionary spending. Now, CEO Brian Cornell saying that, quote, ""clearly, it's an environment where consumers have been stressed."" And we saw that reflected in their results. The stock sold off as a result. Ending the week, though, off just about 6%. So well off the lows of the week.Let's talk about some of the other big stories of the week. One of those, of course, the collapse of FTX. That sent shockwaves throughout the crypto industry. Coinbase took a huge hit as a result. And taking a look at that stock over the last five days, we're looking at losses of just about 21%. Now, investors are worried about contagion. Bank of America downgrading the stock today, citing that risk.Story continuesBitcoin, on the other hand, has fared much better than Coinbase. Taking a look at the 5-day chart, Bitcoin actually closing the week to the upside, which I think took a lot of people by surprise. Up just about 2 and 1/2%. Let's take a look at Norwegian because that stock ending the week in the red, off just about 8%.Credit Suisse double downgrading the stock to underperform. They initially had an outperform rating on it, saying that its valuation premium to peers is likely unsustainable. Shares sold off on that move. We saw that reflected in the chart over the past of five days. Certainly, the stock has been under pressure so far this year. Year to date, shares off just about 21%.Let's round it out with NVIDIA. We heard from a number of chip makers over the past couple of days their quarterly results. Well, Nvidia shares ending the week off just about 5 and 1/2%. The company's third quarter revenue beat expectations. But earnings mixed. Guidance, it fell short. It's been certainly has been a very tough year for NVIDIA.Year to date, we're looking at losses of just about 47%. Now, the company cut its forecast multiple times amid a softening macroeconomic environment. We know Nvidia far from the only chip maker that has suffered so far this year. So investors now, and certainly analysts, are trying to gauge whether or not we have hit a bottom. Where we are today not too far from the 52-week lows we hit just about a week or so ago. Rachelle.]"

Also, both Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury brands performed impressively in the said quarter.Shares of Macy’s increased 15% in the trading hours on Nov 17, following the better-than-expected results. Over the past three months, the stock has fallen 5.4% compared with the industry’s decline of 19.2%.Sales &amp; Earnings PictureThis currently Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) Macy’s reported adjusted earnings of 52 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents and our estimate of 20 cents. However, the bottom line declined sharply from the adjusted earnings of $1.23 reported in the year-ago fiscal period.Macy's, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMacy's, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMacy's, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Macy's, Inc. QuoteNet sales of $5,230 million came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,172 million and our estimate of $5,192.4 million. However, the top line decreased 3.9% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure. Comparable sales fell 3.1% on an owned basis and 2.7% on an owned-plus-licensed basis from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s tally. The metric fared better than our estimate of a 4.2% fall on an owned basis and a 4% decline on an owned-plus-licensed basis.Macy’s’ digital sales dropped 9% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s level. Approximately 65% of digital demand sales came from mobile devices. Stores fulfilled 29% of digital sales in the quarter.Digital penetration was 31%, 35% and 19% at Macy’s, Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury brands, respectively, during the quarter under discussion.Net credit card revenues amounted to $206 million, down 3.3% from the year-ago fiscal period’s level. The metric represented 3.9% of sales, flat with the year-ago fiscal quarter’s level.Story continuesBrand-Wise DetailsComparable sales across Macy’s declined 4.4% on an owned basis and 4% on an owned-plus-licensed basis. On a trailing 12-month basis, 43.6 million active customers shopped the Macy’s brand, up 2% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s level. M continued witnessing a stellar performance in occasion-based categories, including career and tailored sportswear, fragrances, shoes, dresses and luggage.At the Bloomingdale brand, comparable sales increased 5.3% on an owned basis and 4.1% on an owned-plus-licensed basis. Management informed that 4.1 million active customers shopped the Bloomingdale’s brand on a trailing 12-month basis, reflecting an increase of 9% from the year-ago fiscal period’s level. Under the Bloomingdale banner, growth was driven by the robust performance in women’s, men’s and kid’s contemporary and dressy apparel, women’s shoes and luggage.Comparable sales at the Bluemercury brand were up 14% on an owned and owned-plus-licensed basis. About 650,000 active customers shopped the Bluemercury brand on a trailing 12-month basis, representing a 15% increase from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s level.MarginsThe gross margin came in at 38.7%, down from 41% in the prior-year fiscal quarter’s level. The decline from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s level was due to a 230-basis point contraction in the merchandise margin as a result of increased permanent markdowns within the Macy’s brand to sell through slow-moving categories like casual apparel, soft home and warmer weather seasonal goods. Delivery expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were consistent with the year-ago fiscal period’s 4.3% as a rise in fuel costs more than offset the decrease in digital penetration and a fall in cost per package.SG&amp;A expenses increased 4.3% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s reported figure to $1,981 million. As a percentage of net sales, SG&amp;A expenses increased 300 basis points year over year to 39.3%.Macy’s reported an adjusted EBITDA of $439 million, down significantly from an adjusted EBITDA of $765 million in the year-ago fiscal quarter. We note that the adjusted EBITDA margin shriveled 570 basis points to 8.4% from the prior-year fiscal period’s level.Other Financial AspectsMacy’s ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $326 million, a long-term debt of $2,996 million and shareholders' equity of $3,475 million. M’s inventories were 4% higher than the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported level.Year to date, M repurchased shares worth $600 million and paid out $130 million as dividends. Macy’s has $1.4 billion remaining under its share repurchase authorization.During the 39-week period ended Oct 29, 2022, Macy’s generated cash flow from operating activities of $488 million and incurred capital expenditures of $983 million. It generated a negative free cash flow of $373 million. Management expects capital expenditures of $1.2 billion for fiscal 2022.A Sneak Peek of GuidanceMacy’s continues to envision fiscal 2022 net sales in the bracket of $24,340-$24,580 million. It projected comparable owned-plus-licensed sales to be flat to up 1%. Management forecast credit card revenues, net, to be 3.4% of net sales, up from the previous expectation of 3.3% of net sales. Digital sales are likely to be roughly 33% of net sales.Macy’s foresees the fiscal 2022 gross margin rate to contract approximately 150 basis points from the last fiscal year’s level. It expects the SG&amp;A expense rate to deteriorate 120 basis points from the prior fiscal year’s level. It now estimates the fiscal 2022 adjusted EBITDA margin to be 10.5% compared with 13.6% recorded in fiscal 2021.Macy’s now envisions fiscal 2022 adjusted earnings between $4.07 and $4.27 per share, up from the prior projection of $4.00-$4.20. The current view indicates a decline from the adjusted earnings of $5.31 per share reported in fiscal 2021.For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, management anticipates net sales between $8,161 million and $8,401 million compared with the net sales of $8,340 million reported in the year-ago fiscal period. It projected adjusted earnings of $1.47-$1.67 a share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, suggesting a decrease from $1.87 reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Macy’s expects the gross margin rate to shrivel not more than 270 basis points from the prior-year fiscal period’s level, implying the impacts of markdowns and a promotional environment.3 More Stocks Hogging the LimelightWe highlighted three other top-ranked stocks, namely Tecnoglass TGLS, GMS GMS and Wingstop WING.Tecnoglass manufactures and sells architectural glass and windows, and aluminum products for the residential and commercial construction industries.

The award has been offered by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Detroit Arsenal, MI.Valued at $146.7 million, the contract is estimated to be completed by Nov 30, 2024.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?Military tanks are the primary offensive weapons in land missions. An efficient armored military tank enables the army to carry out any mission by direct fire. The recent clash between Ukraine and Russia has accelerated the pace of upgrading the defense landscape with technologically advanced arms and ammunitions, which, in turn, has led to increased investments in military tanks.In this context, it is imperative to mention that the increased focus on technologically advanced combat vehicles is likely to benefit General Dynamics as its Land System business unit is a prime contractor of land combat vehicles like Stryker. It provides innovative design, engineering, technology, production and full life-cycle support for land combat vehicles worldwide.General Dynamics’ expertise and in-depth experience in building and supporting combat vehicles, coupled with a customer-first focus and a seasoned supply-chain network, have been helping it to win multiple contracts from the U.S. Army and its allies. The latest contract win is a bright example of that, which in turn should boost GD’s revenue generation prospects in the coming days.Growth ProspectsThe changing dynamics of the military landscape and the rising geopolitical tension make it mandatory for a country to continuously evolve and strengthen its defense structure. To this end, military tanks form an integral part of any military missions and arm them in their land warfare affairs.In this context, per a report from Markets and Markets, the global armored vehicle market is projected to witness a CAGR of 3.1% during the 2022-2027 period. Such abounding growth trends indicate ample growth opportunities for General Dynamics as it enjoys a lucrative position in the armored vehicle market.Story continuesA few defense primes that can reap the gains from the expanding armored vehicle market are BAE Systems BAESY, Northrop Grumman NOC and Raytheon Technologies RTX.BAE System’s Challenger 2 is heavily armored and highly mobile, designed for use in the direct fire zone. Its primary role is to destroy or neutralize the armor. It also has the ability to engage both hard and soft targets and can operate across a spectrum of high-intensity conflicts, counter insurgencies and peacekeeping roles.The long-term earnings growth rate of BAESY is pegged at 13.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BAESY’s 2022 sales implies an improvement of 17%.Northrop Grumman is the world’s top producer of medium-caliber live and training ammunition and gun systems, with more than five million units built in the last five years. It specializes in innovating low-cost, highly reliable precise weapons and ammunition for artillery and mortar systems, medium-caliber weapon platforms, battle tanks and individual soldiers.Northrop Grumman has a long-term earnings growth rate of 2.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC’s 2022 sales implies an improvement of 1.9%.Raytheon is currently teaming up with American Rheinmetall Vehicles to meet the U.S. Army’s current requirement for a true, next-generation Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle, namely the Lynx Infantry Fighting Vehicle. The Lynx Infantry Fighting Vehicle is a next-generation, tracked, armored fighting vehicle designed to address the critical challenges of the future battlefield.Raytheon’s long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 9.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RTX’s 2022 sales indicates an improvement of 4.3%.Price PerformanceShares of General Dynamics have rallied 25.6% in the past 12 months against the industry’s decline of 7.4%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankGeneral Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

If any of those projects do not achieve commercial operation by Nov. 30, 2023, NextEra Energy Partners will have the right to require the seller to repurchase the ownership interests in such projects for the same purchase price paid by NextEra Energy Partners. Following the acquisition and all of the projects achieving commercial operation, the portfolio of assets is expected to contribute adjusted EBITDA of approximately $210 million to $230 million and CAFD of approximately $62 million to $72 million, each on a five-year average annual run-rate basis, beginning Dec. 31, 2023.Creation of a new portfolioImmediately following the acquisition, NextEra Energy Partners will contribute its interests in the newly acquired projects to a new portfolio alongside six of the partnership's existing wind assets: Alta Wind VIII, Brady Wind, Brady Wind II, Golden West Wind, Osborn Wind and Oliver Wind III.Financing detailsIn conjunction with the acquisition and creation of the new portfolio, NextEra Energy Partners has entered into a convertible equity portfolio financing agreement of approximately $805 million with Ontario Teachers' (the investor).

NextEra Energy Partners has the right to pay 100% of the buyout amount in NextEra Energy Partners common units, issued at no discount to the then-current market price.OutlookFrom a base of its fourth quarter 2021 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.83, NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect 12% to 15% growth per year in limited partner distributions per unit as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2025, subject to the usual caveats. NextEra Energy Partners expects the annualized rate of the fourth-quarter 2022 distribution that is payable in February 2023 to be in a range of $3.17 to $3.25 per common unit.NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect year-end 2022 run-rate adjusted EBITDA and CAFD in the ranges of $1.785 billion to $1.985 billion and $685 million to $775 million, respectively, reflecting calendar year 2023 contributions from the forecasted portfolio at the end of 2022.NextEra Energy Partners also continues to expect Dec. 31, 2023, run-rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA in a range of $2.220 billion to $2.420 billion and CAFD in a range of $770 million to $860 million, reflecting calendar year 2024 expectations for the portfolio at year-end 2023.These expectations are subject to the usual caveats and include the impact of incentive distribution rights (IDR) fees, as these fees are treated as an operating expense.This news release refers to adjusted EBITDA and CAFD expectations.

Projected revenue as used in the calculations of projected EBITDA represents the sum of projected (a) operating revenues plus (b) a pre-tax allocation of production tax credits, plus (c) a pre-tax allocation of investment tax credits plus (d) earnings impact from convertible investment tax credits and plus (e) the reimbursement for lost revenue received pursuant to a contract with NextEra Energy Resources.CAFD is defined as cash available for distribution and represents adjusted EBITDA less (1) a pre-tax allocation of production tax credits, less (2) a pre-tax allocation of investment tax credits, less (3) earnings impact from convertible investment tax credits, less (4) debt service, less (4) maintenance capital, less (5) income tax payments less, (6) other non-cash items included in adjusted EBITDA if any.

Please see the accompanying cautionary statements for a list of the risk factors that may affect future results. Adjusted EBITDA and CAFD do not represent substitutes for net income, as prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Forward-looking statements are not statements of historical facts, but instead represent the current expectations of NextEra Energy Partners, LP (together with its subsidiaries, NEP) regarding future operating results and other future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of NEP's control. Forward-looking statements in this news release include, among others, statements concerning adjusted EBITDA, cash available for distribution (CAFD) and unit distribution expectations, as well as statements concerning NEP's future operating performance, financing needs and results of acquisitions.

The future results of NEP and its business and financial condition are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause NEP's actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties could require NEP to limit or eliminate certain operations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: NEP's ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders is affected by wind and solar conditions at its renewable energy projects; operation and maintenance of renewable energy projects and pipelines involve significant risks that could result in unplanned power outages, reduced output or capacity, personal injury or loss of life; NEP's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects can be materially adversely affected by weather conditions, including, but not limited to, the impact of severe weather; NEP depends on certain of the renewable energy projects and pipelines in its portfolio for a substantial portion of its anticipated cash flows; NEP may pursue the repowering of wind projects or the expansion of natural gas pipelines that would require up-front capital expenditures and could expose NEP to project development risks; terrorist acts, cyberattacks or other similar events could impact NEP's projects, pipelines or surrounding areas and adversely affect its business; the ability of NEP to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be materially adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, as well as the financial condition of insurers. NEP's insurance coverage does not provide protection against all significant losses; NEP relies on interconnection, transmission and other pipeline facilities of third parties to deliver energy from its renewable energy projects and to transport natural gas to and from its pipelines. If these facilities become unavailable, NEP's projects and pipelines may not be able to operate or deliver energy or may become partially or fully unavailable to transport natural gas; NEP's business is subject to liabilities and operating restrictions arising from environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, compliance with which may require significant capital expenditures, increase NEP's cost of operations and affect or limit its business plans; NEP's renewable energy projects or pipelines may be adversely affected by legislative changes or a failure to comply with applicable energy and pipeline regulations; Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) may claim certain immunities under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and Mexican law, and the Texas pipeline entities' ability to sue or recover from Pemex for breach of contract may be limited and may be exacerbated if there is a deterioration in the economic relationship between the U.S. and Mexico; NEP does not own all of the land on which the projects in its portfolio are located and its use and enjoyment of the property may be adversely affected to the extent that there are any lienholders or land rights holders that have rights that are superior to NEP's rights or the U.S. Bureau of Land Management suspends its federal rights-of-way grants; NEP is subject to risks associated with litigation or administrative proceedings that could materially impact its operations, including, but not limited to, proceedings related to projects it acquires in the future; NEP's operations require NEP to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and Mexico; NEP is subject to risks associated with its ownership interests in projects that are under construction, which could result in its inability to complete construction projects on time or at all, and make projects too expensive to complete or cause the return on an investment to be less than expected; NEP relies on a limited number of customers and is exposed to the risk that they may be unwilling or unable to fulfill their contractual obligations to NEP or that they otherwise terminate their agreements with NEP; NEP may not be able to extend, renew or replace expiring or terminated power purchase agreements (PPA), natural gas transportation agreements or other customer contracts at favorable rates or on a long-term basis; if the energy production by or availability of NEP's renewable energy projects is less than expected, they may not be able to satisfy minimum production or availability obligations under their PPAs; NEP's growth strategy depends on locating and acquiring interests in additional projects consistent with its business strategy at favorable prices; reductions in demand for natural gas in the United States or Mexico and low market prices of natural gas could materially adversely affect NEP's pipeline operations and cash flows; government laws, regulations and policies providing incentives and subsidies for clean energy could be changed, reduced or eliminated at any time and such changes may negatively impact NEP's growth strategy; NEP's growth strategy depends on the acquisition of projects developed by NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE) and third parties, which face risks related to project siting, financing, construction, permitting, the environment, governmental approvals and the negotiation of project development agreements; acquisitions of existing clean energy projects involve numerous risks; NEP may continue to acquire other sources of clean energy and may expand to include other types of assets. Any further acquisition of non-renewable energy projects may present unforeseen challenges and result in a competitive disadvantage relative to NEP's more-established competitors; NEP faces substantial competition primarily from regulated utilities, developers, independent power producers, pension funds and private equity funds for opportunities in North America; the natural gas pipeline industry is highly competitive, and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect NEP's business; NEP may not be able to access sources of capital on commercially reasonable terms, which would have a material adverse effect on its ability to consummate future acquisitions and pursue other growth opportunities; restrictions in NEP and its subsidiaries' financing agreements could adversely affect NEP's business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders; NEP's cash distributions to its unitholders may be reduced as a result of restrictions on NEP's subsidiaries' cash distributions to NEP under the terms of their indebtedness or other financing agreements; NEP's subsidiaries' substantial amount of indebtedness may adversely affect NEP's ability to operate its business, and its failure to comply with the terms of its subsidiaries' indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on NEP's financial condition; NEP is exposed to risks inherent in its use of interest rate swaps; widespread public health crises and epidemics or pandemics may have material adverse impacts on NEP's business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders; NEE has influence over NEP; under the cash sweep and credit support agreement, NEP receives credit support from NEE and its affiliates. NEP's subsidiaries may default under contracts or become subject to cash sweeps if credit support is terminated, if NEE or its affiliates fail to honor their obligations under credit support arrangements, or if NEE or another credit support provider ceases to satisfy creditworthiness requirements, and NEP will be required in certain circumstances to reimburse NEE for draws that are made on credit support; NextEra Energy Resources, LLC (NEER) or one of its affiliates is permitted to borrow funds received by NEP's subsidiaries and is obligated to return these funds only as needed to cover project costs and distributions or as demanded by NextEra Energy Operating Partners, LP (NEP OpCo). NEP's financial condition and ability to make distributions to its unitholders, as well as its ability to grow distributions in the future, is highly dependent on NEER's performance of its obligations to return all or a portion of these funds; NEER's right of first refusal may adversely affect NEP's ability to consummate future sales or to obtain favorable sale terms; NextEra Energy Partners GP, Inc. (NEP GP) and its affiliates may have conflicts of interest with NEP and have limited duties to NEP and its unitholders; NEP GP and its affiliates and the directors and officers of NEP are not restricted in their ability to compete with NEP, whose business is subject to certain restrictions; NEP may only terminate the Management Services Agreement among, NEP, NextEra Energy Management Partners, LP (NEE Management), NEP OpCo and NextEra Energy Operating Partners GP, LLC (NEP OpCo GP) under certain limited circumstances; if the agreements with NEE Management or NEER are terminated, NEP may be unable to contract with a substitute service provider on similar terms; NEP's arrangements with NEE limit NEE's potential liability, and NEP has agreed to indemnify NEE against claims that it may face in connection with such arrangements, which may lead NEE to assume greater risks when making decisions relating to NEP than it otherwise would if acting solely for its own account; NEP's ability to make distributions to its unitholders depends on the ability of NEP OpCo to make cash distributions to its limited partners; if NEP incurs material tax liabilities, NEP's distributions to its unitholders may be reduced, without any corresponding reduction in the amount of the IDR fee; holders of NEP's units may be subject to voting restrictions; NEP's partnership agreement replaces the fiduciary duties that NEP GP and NEP's directors and officers might have to holders of its common units with contractual standards governing their duties and the NYSE does not require a publicly traded limited partnership like NEP to comply with certain of its corporate governance requirements; NEP's partnership agreement restricts the remedies available to holders of NEP's common units for actions taken by NEP's directors or NEP GP that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duties; certain of NEP's actions require the consent of NEP GP; holders of NEP's common units currently cannot remove NEP GP without NEE's consent and provisions in NEP's partnership agreement may discourage or delay an acquisition of NEP that NEP unitholders may consider favorable; NEE's interest in NEP GP and the control of NEP GP may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent; NEP may issue additional units without unitholder approval, which would dilute unitholder interests; reimbursements and fees owed to NEP GP and its affiliates for services provided to NEP or on NEP's behalf will reduce cash distributions from NEP OpCo and from NEP to NEP's unitholders, and there are no limits on the amount that NEP OpCo may be required to pay; increases in interest rates could adversely impact the price of NEP's common units, NEP's ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and NEP's ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders; the liability of holders of NEP's units, which represent limited partnership interests in NEP, may not be limited if a court finds that unitholder action constitutes control of NEP's business; unitholders may have liability to repay distributions that were wrongfully distributed to them; the issuance of securities convertible into, or settleable with, common units may affect the market price for NEP's common units, will dilute common unitholders' ownership in NEP and may decrease the amount of cash available for distribution for each common unit; NEP's future tax liability may be greater than expected if NEP does not generate net operating losses (NOLs) sufficient to offset taxable income or if tax authorities challenge certain of NEP's tax positions; NEP's ability to use NOLs to offset future income may be limited; NEP will not have complete control over NEP's tax decisions; and, distributions to unitholders may be taxable as dividends. NEP discusses these and other risks and uncertainties in its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 and other Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, and this news release should be read in conjunction with such SEC filings made through the date of this news release.

96,27fb8060-ce4b-3296-991d-9a26768fd8df,TSN,2022-11-19,Analyzing Tyson Foods (TSN) Stock After Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analyzing-tyson-foods-tsn-stock-000712823.html,1668816432,STORY,"['TSN', 'HRL', '^GSPC']","[Tyson Foods TSN fiscal Q4 report was much looked to for insights into the larger food industry and how wholesalers will be able to perform amid rising inflation and economic downturn. As more consumers stick to the essentials, food consumption is expected to hold up better than other areas of consumer spending.Let’s see what’s going on with Tyson Foods after earnings.Q3 ResultsHistorically investors have sought out food companies like Tyson Foods during challenging economic times and market uncertainty for defensive protection. Unfortunately for TSN stock, this has not been the case. Investors were hoping a strong fiscal Q4 report could give a boost to TSN’s performance this year.Tyson stock has actually lost momentum this week, down roughly -3% since reporting. The nearby chart shows that industry competitor Hormel Foods HRL has climbed over the last year and acted more defensive, while TSN shares have lagged the S&amp;P 500.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn its fiscal Q4 results, TSN missed earnings expectations by -4% with EPS of $1.63. This represented a -29% YoY drop from Q4 2021 and a -16% decline from the previous quarter. The company was able to beat top line expectations with sales of $13.73 billion. This was up 7% from a year ago and 2% from the previous quarter.The company delivered record sales and earnings for the full year, which CEO Donnie King attributed to a diverse portfolio and continued strength in consumer demand for protein. Another highlight of the quarter was Tyson Foods’ improvement in its chicken segment with chicken supply previously one of the biggest issues facing the company. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchChicken segment sales jumped 19% YoY, with chicken prices up 18%. This boosted the chicken segment’s operating income to $340 million compared to a loss of -$136 million in Q4 2021. However, total operating income was down -60% at $766 million compared to $1.90 billion in the prior-year quarter.Story continuesThe decline is mostly attributed to a hard to follow record year in beef sales. However, earnings estimate revisions for TSN have continued to trend down following the report. The company gave guidance for FY23 sales between $55-$57 billion, with the Zacks Estimate at 54.04 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) outlook for FY23 also indicated domestic protein production (beef, port, chick, and turkey) should decrease by 1% compared to fiscal 2022 levels. It is important to note this could affect supply and raise costs for the broader industry with competitor Hormel Foods seeing declining earnings estimates as well.OutlookYear over year, TSN earnings are now expected to drop -24% in its current fiscal 2023 at $6.63 per share. FY24 earnings are projected to decline another -3% to $6.45 a share.Sales are now expected to be up 1% in fiscal 2023 and rise another 2% in FY24 to $55.37 billion. Sales estimates have gone up following the report indicating that operating costs are expected to affect the company’s bottom line as earnings revisions have declined.   Performance &amp; ValuationTSN is now down -25% YTD. This has underperformed the S&amp;P 500’s -18% and its peer group’s -20% decline. Over the last decade, TSN is still up an impressive +299% when including its dividend to beat the benchmark and its peer group’s +139%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTrading around $65 a share, TSN trades at 9.5X earnings after its recent drop. This is slightly above the industry average P/E of 8.8X. TSN trades below its decade-high of 17.2X and the median of 12.2X. The stock trades attractively relative to its past but FY23 earnings estimates continue to decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineTSN lands a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) as earnings estimate revisions continue to fall following the company’s fiscal Q4 report. Tyson Foods stock trades reasonably relative to its past, but a strong fiscal Q4 report and even stronger guidance could have been crucial for the stock. With the company unable to provide either, investors may want to be cautious even with the stock near 52-week lows.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But a new report from Expedia says travelers remain undeterred. Joining us now to discuss is Expedia CEO Peter Kern. Peter, good to see you again here live in the flesh. How do you think this holiday season will play out for travel?PETER KERN: It's going to be busy. Everything's booked up. Travel's going to be crazy, I think. And now with the weather coming in on the East Coast, it's going to create a little bit of mess. But I think it's going to be a very good travel season. People are going to be flying around. Europe's gotten cheaper with the dollar improving, so we'll see people maybe do a little more international, but it's going to be a good one.BRAD SMITH: Admittedly faithful Expedia user. Should have already booked my travel, though, for the holidays.PETER KERN: Totally should have already done that. But there's still opportunities. I mean, there's places. There's a lot of talk about high airfare around. But if you look, like, Miami, San Diego, there are still spots that are relatively cheaper. And in Europe, Southern Europe, Spain and Italy are cheaper. So you can find the spots, and then, of course, you can package with hotels and do other things. There's opportunities, particularly in Europe now, so it's getting better.JULIE HYMAN: We've been talking a lot about customers pulling back in certain areas, a lot of the times, because they want to travel. But are you seeing anything at the margins, any change in consumer behavior in terms of the choices that they're making, or even, are lower income travelers just not traveling right now? Are they making other choices?Story continuesPETER KERN: Yeah, so far, we haven't really seen anything in the data. I know it's hard to believe. You sit here all day talking about the economic woes or future woes or potential woes. But in travel, we haven't really seen it. And that's why you've heard it from company after company. I think, as you've said, people have bought enough stuff, bought enough pots and pans maybe.BRIAN SOZZI: Not Julie. Never enough pots and pans.PETER KERN: I like pots and pans, too. But and, you know, and they've saved up for travel. And I think there's also sort of an existential thing. It wasn't just like I didn't get my two trips. It was, wow, life is terrible when I'm stuck at home, and I can't do anything. And I'm going to go live a little bit. So I think that's continuing to play out. And I think we'll continue to see it for a while. Who knows if the economies of the world get really bad? But so far, no real cracks.BRIAN SOZZI: How about forward bookings? Any insights in there?PETER KERN: Forward bookings into next year continue to be better than they were. We said that earnings better than they were last year. And you guys may be booking already for next year. You should book for next year.BRIAN SOZZI: [INAUDIBLE]PETER KERN: Get ahead of that one. But yeah, they've been strong. There are some changing trends, but, like, events are coming back, festivals are back. So the things-- some of the things that didn't happen during COVID, still haven't happened, are happening next year. World Pride Day in Sydney, Sydney is going to be really huge then, and all kinds of things. So it's still looking really good.JULIE HYMAN: And you guys also released some tips for travelers, things like travel on a Sunday or a Wednesday, right? Why do those things change over time, right? Why isn't that sort of consistent?PETER KERN: Well, there are some consistencies. I can go back 10 years and say, like, oh, it's better to travel on Christmas Day than on the day before. Like, those things don't change. But I think it depends really on supply and demand. And the airplanes aren't always finding the same routes at the same capacity. Demand isn't always the same. Trends change as to what people are into.But broadly, they're pretty similar. And I think what you see now is you have high demand. You don't quite have all the supply back, particularly the international supply. And all of that's continuing to drive price. But there's plenty of opportunity. As an experienced Expedia user, you can package hotels. We have member discounts. There's lots of ways to still get savings. So I think there's a lot of opportunity for customers to still find a good deal out there with the right trip.JULIE HYMAN: And I imagine you probably travel a lot. Like, what's your personal top travel tip?PETER KERN: Personal top travel trip-- sleep on the plane, I think.BRAD SMITH: Yes.PETER KERN: If I could always sleep on the plane, I'd be much more successful.JULIE HYMAN: I like that.BRAD SMITH: When you think about what you've seen in terms of the bookings and especially on the hotel side, where people are booking accommodations, even, where have you seen those stays or those accommodations bookings start to kind of differentiate a little bit?We were just talking with the Airbnb CEO just yesterday about their winter release. They're trying to get more hosts online. Hotels are trying to bring more rooms online at the same time. So clearly, the demand is there, but it's just the type of stay that customers might be up in the air about.PETER KERN: Yeah, I think Brian and I, longstanding during COVID, I was saying cities would be back. Everything would sort of come back to normal. And I think that's broadly what we've seen. Now there's definitely a few trend changes.People discovered the Mountain West in the US, and there's definitely an increase for Vrbo for our homestay business is going great in the West. And it's up, like, 30% over 2019. So there's a few breaks in where people are finding, or opportunities they're finding. And it's not just Yellowstone. It's all across the mountain states. So that's kind of cool.But by and large, you're seeing it come back. And yeah, hotels aren't necessarily open to full capacity, and they're working on that. Labor is expensive. Things have changed. The supply chain costs are up. So there's been some changes in that. But by and large, everything's open again. Cities are back in a big way. And I don't think that's going to change.BRAD SMITH: Within the Vrbo side of the business, we had also talked about fee transparency, too, and how much people have to clean before they even leave one of the homestay experiences, even. Is that going to be updated any time soon? Do you see any material changes?PETER KERN: I think we're all working towards a clear-- we're all about not even for Vrbo, but for all our brands, creating greater transparency, greater understanding of value for money for our customers. So we've introduced a bunch of capabilities even in the hotel side, even in Expedia, where you have smart shopping so it's easier to compare what you get in a hotel.Sometimes hotel names have, like, queen superior or king something, and you don't know what the differences are. So we've broken that all down so customers can see the differences. We've given-- we're using machine learning and AI to help them get to the right thing.So that whole line of work, it's not just about transparency to make it nice for everybody. It's really about so customers get what they expect and get value for money, whatever that is. If it's six stars or two stars, we want them to know what they're getting.JULIE HYMAN: Transparency, that's always a good thing. Peter, thank you so much. Peter Kern, Expedia CEO. Thanks for coming in. Appreciate it.PETER KERN: Happy to be here. Good to see you.]"

Sourced from the company's first-party data and from custom research of thousands of travellers and industry professionals across 17 countries, these top travel trends prove there is no ""one-size-fits-all"" travel in 2023.i Instead, these trends point to a year defined by the ""no-normal.""Expedia Group Travel Trends 2023""When we look at Expedia, Hotels.com, and Vrbo data together, we see a detailed and robust picture of travel into 2023,"" said Jon Gieselman, president, Expedia Brands. ""We're seeing a surge in trips to culture capitals, a new wave of interest in wellness retreats and a spike in demand for outdoor destinations beyond just beaches and mountains — not a new normal but people branching out to unexpected trends in what we're calling the 'no normal.'""Unexpected Travel Trends in 2023:Set-JettersBooking a trip after binging a popular new series will become serious business in 2023. Expedia research confirms that streaming movies and TV shows are becoming more popular as sources of travel inspiration (22%), closing the gap on the most popular source, social media (30%).  Furthermore, the small screen is now considered on par with recommendations from friends and family when it comes to travel inspiration.In Canada, more than half (60%) of travellers considered visiting a destination that was featured on a show or movie on a streaming platform, and 27% went and booked a trip.Top destinations include the UK and New Zealand, with its landscapes featured this year in a major fantasy epic, Paris and New York also ranked highly, as well as the stunning beach resorts of Hawaii.Culture CapitalsNational parks and outdoor spaces had big moments over the past two years. Now, it's time for cities to see a comeback. Based on traveller demand, most of the destinations seeing the largest increases are all culture-rich cities where arts and cultural festivities are getting back to full swing.Story continuesCheck out the Edinburgh Fringe in Scotland, plan a trip to WorldPride in Sydney or drink in the cherry blossoms in Tokyo. In 2023, culture capitals are calling:1Edinburgh, ScotlandLisbon, PortugalTokyo, JapanDublin, IrelandNew York, USASydney, AustraliaDubai, UAEMontréal, CanadaMunich, GermanyBangkok, ThailandThree-star SuperstarsTravellers are seeking smarter ways to see the world, without compromising on comfort or cool factor. In Canada, 41% of travellers admit they are more concerned with value for money than ever before. Hotels.com data shows interest in three-star hotels2 is up more than 20% globally.In 2023, 28% of Canadian travellers plan to stay in 1-3 star hotels and 40% plan to book a vacation with added value inclusions, such as toiletries or free breakfast. Showing a shift in mindset from the post-pandemic bucket-list mentality and moving towards a more spontaneous approach, a third would rather go on more trips in three-star properties than splurge on one big luxury getaway. Fewer stars do not mean lower standards, however. Many properties, such as Una Vida in Mexico, or Mama Shelter in Paris, still offer excellent amenities, stylish interiors and unique vibes as standard.New Wave WellnessOut with the old, in with the new wave wellness. Almost half (45%) of travellers are more open to wellness breaks than ever before but cite boredom with traditional wellness retreats and an urge to experience something more exciting in 2023.To capture this awakened market, hotels such as the Loire Valley Lodge in France and Whitepod in Switzerland are innovating and offering advanced rejuvenation programs and hands-on activities that encourage travellers to get up close and personal with nature. The quirkier the activity the better; Sylvotherapy, or forest bathing, and fruit harvesting are more popular than classic activities.Hot new hotel openings around the worldNew hotels that cater to evolving traveller needs are opening around the world. These properties offer far more than a place to sleep, with destination restaurants, co-working spaces, and beautiful interiors as standard. From an art-filled social hub in London to unbridled luxury in Rome, these are the most exciting hotels to have on your radar in the year ahead.La Palma | Capri, Italy100 Princes Street | Edinburgh, UKIkos Odisia | Corfu, GreeceCelestial Suites | Kefalonia, Greece1 Hotel Hanalei Bay | Princeville, KauaiFour Seasons Resort Tamarindo | Tamarindo, MexicoAlila Kothaifaru Maldives | Maldives, Indian OceanSix Senses | Rome, ItalyAtlantis The Royal | Dubai, UAEart'otel London Battersea Power Station | London, Great BritainFoodie-menitiesKitchen credentials are a must, with travellers looking to plate up whenever they please in their private escape. Almost half of Canadian travellers (41%) feel that cooking is a great family or group activity. Cooking at home can also be cost-efficient, with 38% of Canadian travellers plating at-home meals to cut down on costs. And, when the best chef's table is within a private Vrbo vacation rental, the top three culinary amenities sought after by Canadians are an outdoor kitchen or grilling area, a professional coffee maker, and an air fryer. Ranch RetreatsRustic getaways are on the rise, as travellers crave whole, private vacation homes (the only accommodation available through Vrbo) with abundant space and exhilarating views. Cue ranch retreats, offering an intimate escape in the rugged wilderness. Think log-lined cabins, flickering fires and sweeping vistas.Travellers can live out their western fantasies by booking a luxurious lodge, ranch retreat or farmhouse that fits the whole crew. Destinations across the prairie provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba spring readily to mind, but the ranch retreat is not confined only to Canada. For a home on the range in Europe, travellers are booking converted barns and farmhouses in the countryside of Italy, Spain, France and the UK. Thrill-seekers can also embrace their western wanderlust in Australia, where farmhouses in the outback overlook acres of wineries and wild brush.Hidden GemsTravellers are also exploring unassuming locales and new places. Demand for Vrbo's private vacation homes in each of these destinations has increased by more than 30% or more since September 2021:3Cape Breton, NSChaudière, QCCharlottetown, PEICanmore, ABCalgary, ABPrince Edward County, ONWinnipeg, MBQuébec City, QCCowichan Valley, BCSaanich, BCTravel in 2023 will be about saying ""no"" to normal, breaking routines and searching for experiences without compromises. Whether it's flying to those once-in-a-lifetime events or hosting group celebrations at a holiday home, travellers are no longer adapting to the next new normal, but creating their own status quo altogether.An optimistic industry pushes forwardFor the first time, the 2023 travel trends are being released at the same time as insights from industry professionals, from airlines to hotels to vacation rental hosts and more. In a tailored report for travel partners, Expedia Group reveals the ways that the pandemic forever changed travel. The research shows the highest levels of optimism since 2020. Most professionals expect leisure (71%) and business (70%) travel to return to pre-2020 levels within two years. While travellers looking for a change of scenery kept the industry afloat during the pandemic, all eyes are on the return of international and business travel. In fact, more than half (51%) in the industry say business is their organization's highest priority in 2023.Another insight from industry professionals shows travellers are choosing options aligned with their personal values such as sustainability, inclusivity, and accessibility. Most travel businesses (60%) made changes in the last year to ensure their services are inclusive and accessible. In fact, sustainability is tied with marketing as the highest area of investment for 2023, with one in five industry professionals saying they plan to invest in sustainability next year.For the full industry report on insights and actions for travel partners, download the Traveler Value Index 2023For the full consumer report on The No-Normal; Unexpected Travel Trends in 2023, go to https://www.expedia.ca/2023traveltrendsAbout Expedia Group Expedia Group, Inc. companies power travel for everyone, everywhere through our global platform.

The award has been provided by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL.Valued at $97.1 million, the contract is projected to be completed by May 19, 2023. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will provide highly specialized technical support for the PAC-3 Missile Field Surveillance Program and missile post-production activities.A Brief Note on PAC-3 Missile SystemThe PAC-3 is a long-range, air-defense and medium- to high-altitude guided missile system. It is designed to counter tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and advanced aircraft. The system’s radar set provides tactical functions of airspace surveillance, target detection, identification, classification, tracking, missile guidance and engagement support.The PAC-3 Missile is a high-velocity interceptor that defeats incoming targets by a direct, body-to-body impact. PAC-3 missiles, when deployed in a Patriot battery, significantly increase the Patriot system’s firepower. The company anticipates demand for this advanced missile system to be high, particularly in politically tense regions of the Middle East.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?Increasing geopolitical and socioeconomic turmoil worldwide has prompted nations, both developed and developing, to expand their respective military arsenal, with missiles constituting a significant portion of that inventory.Lockheed’s Missiles and Fire Control business unit develops, manufactures and supports advanced combat missiles and rockets for military customers, including the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, NASA and dozens of foreign allies. Some of its prominent products include the PAC-3 missile, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile, JASSM, LRASM and many more.Lockheed frequently wins contracts from Pentagon and other U.S. allies involving its variant missile programs, like the latest one, which boost its revenue growth.Story continuesGrowth ProspectsThe global rocket and missiles market is projected to reach $82.0 billion by 2031, witnessing a CAGR of 4.2% from 2022 to 2031, per a report by Allied Market Research firm.Such projections reflect increased growth opportunities for major missile players like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon RTX, Northrop Grumman NOC and Boeing BA in the aforementioned market.Notably, Raytheon offers a variety of combat-proven missile defense systems, including the Patriot missile, Standard Missile-6, Standard Missile-3, Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile, Evolved Seasparrow Missile, Tomahawk cruise missile and a few more.Raytheon boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.5%.

The problem is that we're not vaccinating, reaching, the people who haven't yet gotten vaccines,"" Krause said Thursday at a Hepatitis B Foundation event in Pennsylvania.Jigsaw puzzle needs the final piece as a solution to a problem or challenge.The CDC estimates 20% of the U.S. population has yet to receive one dose and a little over 30% have not completed the primary series.""To me, the fact that we still have several hundred people a day dying of COVID is a serious public health problem,"" he told Yahoo Finance following the event.Krause, who left the FDA prior to booster authorizations along with colleague Dr. Marion Gruber, has been steadfast in this belief since leaving the agency last November.In a November 2021 op-ed with Gruber and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's Dr. Paul Offit, a top vaccine expert, the trio emphasized the need to target the unvaccinated and noted that only those at highest risk of severe disease or death from the virus should be the focus of the booster campaign.""We don’t think boosters for all are necessary, even with the emergence of the omicron variant,"" the trio said.Jerald Bagley, 57, receives the Moderna coronavirus disease (COVID-19) booster vaccine targeting BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron sub variants at Skippack Pharmacy in Schwenksville, Pennsylvania, U.S., September 8, 2022. REUTERS/Hannah BeierOffit has previously told Yahoo Finance that he believes the emphasis on boosters should largely be on the older or more vulnerable populations in the U.S. — a point Krause agrees with.""Boosters can increase your own cellular immunity...which is responsible chiefly for protection against mild disease, and it's fairly short-lived. Boosters have never been shown to reduce transmission,"" Krause said.And by pushing boosters onto a population that doesn't need it, it affects ""the worldwide supply of vaccines and may prolong the pandemic,"" he added.Story continuesThe U.S. averages more than 35,000 COVID cases daily and more than 2,000 deaths weekly. And the CDC's projections show a rise in hospitalizations in coming weeks.But the message of boosting, and universal boosters, has already undermined confidence in the original vaccine series — two doses of an mRNA of either Moderna (MRNA) or Pfizer/BioNTech (PFE/BNTX) vaccines, or two doses of Novavax (NVAX), or one dose of Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) — even though they remain protective against variants, Krause told Yahoo Finance.To get the focus back on the unvaccinated will require a heavy lift of public health messaging.""I think who the message comes from is actually very important and to reach the people who haven't been vaccinated, it's important to engage people who believe in the the value of the vaccines and amplify their message among people who trust them,"" Krause said.That doesn't mean that boosting isn't important for some, but the messages will interfere with each other at the broader population level, he explained. And the amount of attention on the boosting message has drowned out efforts to get the unvaccinated vaccinated.Still, Krause is pleased to see that one year later, the idea is starting to catch on.""More people are recognizing the futility of continuously boosting people and the importance of refocusing on getting the unvaccinated, vaccinated. And so, while it's taken a long time to get there, I'm pleased that the conversation is at least moving along,"" he said.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

If you want to see more of billionaire Cliff Asness' dividend stocks, go directly to Billionaire Cliff Asness' Top 5 Dividend Stocks.Billionaire Cliff Asness is the founder of AQR Capital Management, one of the largest hedge funds in the world. In 1998, Asness, along with several of his Goldman Sachs colleagues, founded AQR Capital Management after they ran $7 billion for Goldman Sachs Asset Mangement's quantitative research group that realized substantial success.At AQR Capital Management, which stands for 'Applied Quantitative Research Capital Management', Asness and his colleagues did similar things where they took substantial market data, processed it, and applied it to the markets. Given AQR Capital Management's track record since its founding, the fund now has a 13F portfolio worth over $41 billion as of the end of September.Although the fund had a challenging 2018 to 2020, the fund had a strong 2021. In terms of 2022, some of AQR's most famous funds are up this year as of April 2022.2022 has been challenging given the high inflation and central bank tightening. Given the interest rate increases, U.S. Treasury yields have increased substantially and many dividend stocks are not as attractive to some investors as they were before as a result.Nevertheless, October's inflation data shows that inflation could be peaking. If inflation has peaked, interest rates might not rise that much further and high quality blue chip dividend stocks could potentially be attractive in the long term given the lower valuations.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.AQR CAPITAL MANAGEMENTCliff Asness of AQR Capital ManagementMethodologyFor our list of Billionaire Cliff Asness' Top 10 Dividend Stocks, we took 10 stocks from Cliff Asness' AQR Capital Management's top holdings in its 13F portfolio at the end of Q3 2022 that paid dividends and we ranked them based on AQR Capital Management's stake in the stocks.Story continuesBillionaire Cliff Asness' Top 10 Dividend Stocks10.

Given that the company has been well run and it has substantial pricing power, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has raised its annual dividend for over 60 years. Despite the strong dollar and high inflation, the company's recent results have been strong. For Q3, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) reported adjusted earnings of $2.55 per share on sales of $23.8 billion versus estimates of $2.48 on revenue of $23.4 billion. AQR Capital Management has a stake of over $326 million in the giant as of the end of September.Alongside Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) shares are up 11.5% in the last month thanks to the broader market rally. Shares of the computer network product maker also have a dividend yield of 3.42% as of 11/17. With inflation potentially peaking, there's hope that interest rates won't go up as much as expected. If interest rates don't go up as much, valuations for big tech companies like Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) could benefit. AQR Capital Management has a stake of over $335 million in Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) at the end of Q3.8. Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

(NYSE:MRK) is also a dividend stock given its yield of 2.76% as of 11/17. With a stake of over $338 million at the end of September 30, AQR Capital Management's 13F portfolio has likely benefited from Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)'s recent rise from $86.12 on 9/30 to $102.31 as of 11/17. One reason for the rally could be higher expected earnings. According to Barron's, analysts expect Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

As of 9/30, AQR Capital Management was a substantial holder of the stock with a stake value of over $365 million. For FY22, the company sees adjusted EPS guidance range of $8.55-$8.65 and full year 2022 cash flow from operations guidance range to $13.5 billion to $14.5 billion.Vltava Fund commented on CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in a Q3 2022 investor letter,“CVS is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years. We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt. This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”Like CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc.

If you want to read about some more dividend stocks, go directly to 5 Best Stocks to Increase Your Dividend Income. Investors have long discussed whether a healthy business that pays a reliable dividend payout will also generate the highest capital returns over the long term. Value investors generally concur with this point of view while growth investors argue in favor of the opposite. According to a study of dividend paying stocks published by Hartford Funds, companies that grew or initiated a dividend have experienced the highest returns relative to other stocks since 1973. They have also experienced significantly less volatility. Companies that pay dividends usually return the profit they have made to shareholders while those that do not pay dividends reinvest that profit for growth in the business. Stocks like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) usually lie in the latter category. Even though these firms have been popular on Wall Street in the past few years, the Hartford Study claims that 84% of the total return of the S&amp;P 500 Index since 1960 can be attributed to reinvested dividends. A Brief History of Dividend Versus Growth StocksThe study has outlined how dividend players performed over each decade going back to before the Great War. In the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, the dividend payouts of companies played a large role in their total returns. The average total return through these decades was around 10%. However, as the average total returns jumped from the 1960s onwards, the role of dividends started to diminish. During the 1990s, dividends were largely marginalized as companies preferred growth rather than focusing on returns to shareholders. However, at the turn of the millennium, the dotcom bubble burst, forcing investors away from growth firms towards reliable dividend players. The benchmark index posted negative returns in the first decades of the new millennium. Per the study, between 1960 and 2021, the median dividend yield for the market was around 2.90%. The yield peaked in the 1980s and bottomed in the 2000s. After the 2010s, growth stocks once again became popular as the social media and ecommerce age dawned. Story continuesAs inflation climbs and the Fed prepares a further rise in interest rates, investors at the stock market have once again shifted their focus towards dividend stocks to weather the upcoming storm. Our MethodologyThe companies that have a solid track record of dividend payouts were selected for the list. The business fundamentals and analyst ratings of these firms are also discussed to provide further context. Hedge fund sentiment was included as a classifier as well. Data from around 920 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey was used to quantify the hedge fund sentiment around each stock. 10 Best Stocks to Make $500 Per Month in Dividends10.

122,b78284fe-37b6-38cb-a55e-617faac421b9,MDT,2022-11-19,What's in the Cards for Medtronic (MDT) in Q2 Earnings?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-cards-medtronic-mdt-q2-173205669.html,1668792725,STORY,"['MDT', 'AMN', 'MCK']","[Medtronic plc MDT is scheduled to report second-quarter and fiscal 2023 results on Nov 22, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.89%. Medtronic surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed in one, the average surprise being 0.35%.Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayMedtronic has been witnessing an adverse trend of procedure volume across its core business over the past few quarters, impacted by the choppy macroeconomic scenario globally and a severe shortage of health professional labor. Per the company’s August 2022 update, the full impact of inflation with increased freight expense will be realized in Q2 of fiscal 2023. Further, challenges related to the extended COVID-led restrictions in selective geographies, including China and Japan, are expected to have impacted the company’s major business lines.Added to this, the company is apprehensive about the inflation and currency headwinds affecting margins. Considering how inflation of raw materials and freight has become severe over the past quarter, Medtronic, on the first-quarter earnings call, stated that it would prioritize R&amp;D investments for future growth. This might have once again caused margin pressure in fiscal Q2.Medtronic PLC Price and EPS SurpriseMedtronic PLC Price and EPS SurpriseMedtronic PLC price-eps-surprise | Medtronic PLC QuoteThe company had stated that in terms of EPS, the full impact of inflation on raw material and direct labor costs would be realized in the fiscal second quarter as inventory rolls off the balance sheet.Overall, in the second quarter, Medtronic expects organic revenue growth in the range of 3% to 3.5%, implying strong sequential acceleration, driven by improved product availability based on new launches. The fiscal second quarter would have a currency headwind between $365 million and $415 million, per the company. Second-quarter EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.26 to $1.30, per Medtronic.Story continuesThe company’s Cardiovascular portfolio is expected to have gained in Q2 fiscal 2023 on thelimited U.S. market release of the Evolut FX valve, which has been receiving strong customer response. Further, the Evolut PRO+ launch in Europe and Evolut PRO launch in China too are expected to have contributed to the company’s fiscal Q3 top line. In cardiac rhythm management, the AURORA extravascular ICD is expected to have registered strong sales. The company earlier expected cardiovascular business revenues to grow in the range of 5% to 5.5% in Q2.In the neuroscience portfolio, the company is expected to have increased market share in Cranial and Spinal technologies. Demand for the company’s new spine implants is expected to have contributed to the growth. Strong adoption of AI-enabled surgical planning platform among the U.S. user base, the launch of the Catalyft expandable titanium interbody system and the rollout of enabling technologies are expected to have contributed to Q2 growth. The Mazor robotics system and StealthStation navigation system, particularly, are expected to have performed strongly in the to-be-reported quarter.In Neuromodulation, over the past few months, Medtronic has been witnessing strong momentum from new products in both Pain Stim and Brain Modulation. The company earlier expected its neuroscience revenues to grow in the range of 5.5% to 6% in Q2.In Medical Surgical and surgical robotics, Medtronic remains focused on the limited market release of the Hugo robot while it scales production. The company recently completed Hugo installations in several geographies like Denmark, France, and Italy, which are likely to have added to the company’s Q2 top-line growth within this arm. However, according to Medtronic, given increased volume-based procurement in many of the Chinese provinces, medical surgical revenues are expected to be down 0.25 point to up 0.25 point in Q2.In Diabetes, MDT might have faced some competitive pressure in the United States in Q2, which might have impacted growth severely. However, the company is expected to have seen significant growth in markets outside the United States on the increasing user base of the MiniMed 780G insulin pump, combined with the Guardian 4 sensor. According to Medtronic, Diabetes is expected to be down 3% to 6% on an organic basis in fiscal Q2.Q2 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Medtronic’s fiscal second-quarter total revenues of $7.72 billion suggests a 1.7% decline from the prior-year reported number. The consensus mark for earnings of $1.28 per share implies a 3.03% drop from the year-ago reported figure.What Our Quantitative Model PredictsPer our proven model, a stock needs to have the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to deliver an earnings surprise. But this is not the case here as you will see below.Earnings ESP: Medtronic has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

123,161041c0-4bc7-3f89-af78-69d4253dd043,CCI,2022-11-19,Crown Castle (CCI) Up 5.4% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Continue?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crown-castle-cci-5-4-163004293.html,1668789004,STORY,['CCI'],"[It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Crown Castle (CCI). Shares have added about 5.4% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Crown Castle due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Crown Castle Beats on Q3 FFO &amp; Revenues, Hikes DividendCrown Castle reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted FFO (AFFO) per share of $1.85, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.83.The net revenues of $1.75 billion, too, exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.74 billion.Reported AFFO per share compared favorably with the year-ago period’s $1.77. Net revenues climbed 7.9% from the prior-year quarter’s $1.62 billion.The rise in site-rental revenues amid elevated tower space demand aided CCI’s year-over-year top-line growth. It also announced a hike in its quarterly cash dividend payment.Per Jay Brown, chief executive officer of the company, “We delivered strong results in the third quarter and increased our annualized common stock dividend by 6.5% to $6.26 per share. I believe we remain in the early stages of 5G development in the U.S., providing a long runway of growth in demand for our comprehensive communications infrastructure offering across towers, small cells and fiber.”Quarter in DetailDuring the third quarter, CCI’s site-rental revenues came in at $1.57 billion, up 8.1% year over year. The organic contribution of $67 million to the site rental revenues reflected 5.3% growth. Furthermore, services and other revenues climbed 6.6% to $178 million.CCI’s quarterly operating expenses increased 4.8% year over year to $1.14 billion. The operating income climbed 14.4% to $602 million. The quarterly adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion marked a 10.3% year-over-year increase primarily due to growth in site rental revenues and higher services contribution.Crown Castle reported capital expenditures of $337 million in the quarter. This comprised discretionary capital expenditures of $314 million and sustaining capital expenditures of $23 million. Discretionary capital expenditures primarily attributable to Fiber were around $267 million, and that to Towers was roughly $42 million.Story continuesBalance SheetCrown Castle exited third-quarter 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $174 million, down from $281 million reported as of Jun 30, 2022.Debt and other long-term obligations aggregated $20.7 billion, down from $21.2 billion witnessed as of Jun 30, 2022.GuidanceCrown Castle maintained its outlook for 2022.It expects AFFO per share in the range of $7.31-$7.41.Site rental revenues are expected to lie between $6.242 billion and $6.287 billion while the adjusted EBITDA is projected in the band of $4.329-$4.374 billion.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.VGM ScoresCurrently, Crown Castle has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a C. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Crown Castle has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more of billionaire Cliff Asness' dividend stocks, go directly to Billionaire Cliff Asness' Top 5 Dividend Stocks.Billionaire Cliff Asness is the founder of AQR Capital Management, one of the largest hedge funds in the world. In 1998, Asness, along with several of his Goldman Sachs colleagues, founded AQR Capital Management after they ran $7 billion for Goldman Sachs Asset Mangement's quantitative research group that realized substantial success.At AQR Capital Management, which stands for 'Applied Quantitative Research Capital Management', Asness and his colleagues did similar things where they took substantial market data, processed it, and applied it to the markets. Given AQR Capital Management's track record since its founding, the fund now has a 13F portfolio worth over $41 billion as of the end of September.Although the fund had a challenging 2018 to 2020, the fund had a strong 2021. In terms of 2022, some of AQR's most famous funds are up this year as of April 2022.2022 has been challenging given the high inflation and central bank tightening. Given the interest rate increases, U.S. Treasury yields have increased substantially and many dividend stocks are not as attractive to some investors as they were before as a result.Nevertheless, October's inflation data shows that inflation could be peaking. If inflation has peaked, interest rates might not rise that much further and high quality blue chip dividend stocks could potentially be attractive in the long term given the lower valuations.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.AQR CAPITAL MANAGEMENTCliff Asness of AQR Capital ManagementMethodologyFor our list of Billionaire Cliff Asness' Top 10 Dividend Stocks, we took 10 stocks from Cliff Asness' AQR Capital Management's top holdings in its 13F portfolio at the end of Q3 2022 that paid dividends and we ranked them based on AQR Capital Management's stake in the stocks.Story continuesBillionaire Cliff Asness' Top 10 Dividend Stocks10.

Given that the company has been well run and it has substantial pricing power, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has raised its annual dividend for over 60 years. Despite the strong dollar and high inflation, the company's recent results have been strong. For Q3, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) reported adjusted earnings of $2.55 per share on sales of $23.8 billion versus estimates of $2.48 on revenue of $23.4 billion. AQR Capital Management has a stake of over $326 million in the giant as of the end of September.Alongside Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a dividend stock owned by billionaire Cliff Asness' AQR Capital Management at the end of Q3 2022.9. Cisco Systems, Inc.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) shares are up 11.5% in the last month thanks to the broader market rally. Shares of the computer network product maker also have a dividend yield of 3.42% as of 11/17. With inflation potentially peaking, there's hope that interest rates won't go up as much as expected. If interest rates don't go up as much, valuations for big tech companies like Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) could benefit. AQR Capital Management has a stake of over $335 million in Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) at the end of Q3.8. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)AQR Capital Management's Stake Value as of 9/30: $338,191,000Percentage of AQR Capital Management's 13F Portfolio as of 9/30: 0.82%Dividend Yield as of 11/17: 2.76%Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) has been one of the best performing large capitalization stocks in 2022 with shares up 33% year to date. Furthermore, Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is also a dividend stock given its yield of 2.76% as of 11/17. With a stake of over $338 million at the end of September 30, AQR Capital Management's 13F portfolio has likely benefited from Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)'s recent rise from $86.12 on 9/30 to $102.31 as of 11/17. One reason for the rally could be higher expected earnings. According to Barron's, analysts expect Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) to earn on average $7.37 in EPS for 2022, $7.53 for 2023, and $8.69 for 2024.7. Gilead Sciences, Inc.

(NYSE:MRK), Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) shares have performed well in 2022 with shares up 15.2% year to date. With AQR Capital Management owning over $340 million worth of Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) at the end of September 30, the fund has likely benefited from the stock's rise from $61.69 at the end of September to $83.62 as of November 17. In November, Jasper Hellweg of Argus raised his price target to $100 from $70 and kept a 'Buy' rating on Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) citing pipeline and regulatory progress. As of 11/17, Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) shares have a dividend yield of 3.52%.6. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)AQR Capital Management's Stake Value as of 9/30: $365,686,000Percentage of AQR Capital Management's 13F Portfolio as of 9/30: 0.89%Dividend Yield as of 11/17: 2.29%CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is a dividend stock given its yield of 2.29% as of 11/17. As of 9/30, AQR Capital Management was a substantial holder of the stock with a stake value of over $365 million. For FY22, the company sees adjusted EPS guidance range of $8.55-$8.65 and full year 2022 cash flow from operations guidance range to $13.5 billion to $14.5 billion.Vltava Fund commented on CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in a Q3 2022 investor letter,“CVS is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years. We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt. This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”Like CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc.

Boeing, for example, has struggled to stabilize 737 production at 31 jets per month.""Starting in September, cash flows were impacted as Howmet Aerospace carried higher inventory due to customer schedule rebalances, which we expect to persist in the fourth quarter,"" the company said last month.Story continuesSome suppliers are also stocking parts in anticipation of jet output hikes next year as they look to speed up their recovery from one of the worst crises the industry has faced in modern times.An inventory build opens up the possibility that companies may struggle in the event of a downturn but aerospace executives maintain demand is strong. Industry observers also note long backlogs at Boeing and Airbus will offer protection.""Our analysis indicates healthy growth in aircraft deliveries even through a severe recession,"" CFRA Research senior equity analyst Colin Scarola said.(Reporting by Abhijith Ganapavaram in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)]"

What is Illumina doing to address these issues? Aravanis: The amount of data generated from next-generation sequencing is rapidly expanding. To reach the full potential of genomics in health care, we need not only accessible sequencing and data creation but also advanced systems to easily analyze that data, systems to optimize the storage, and innovative solutions to reduce the environmental footprint of the workflows.In 2021, we made significant improvements to our platforms and product pipeline to provide highly accurate, comprehensive, and efficient analysis of this data. We launched Illumina Connected Analytics, a secure genomics data platform to operationalize informatics and drive scientific insights. It empowers customers to manage, analyze, and explore large volumes of multiomic data in a scalable and flexible environment with security and privacy at its core. Illumina Connected Analytics provides users access to DRAGEN secondary analysis pipelines, enabling custom analyses and resulting in 16X faster mapping/variant calling for whole genome sequencing compared to traditional open-source methods. Additionally, DRAGEN Original Read Archive (ORA) technology provides data compression in the cloud, reducing our customers' carbon footprint up to 5 times.The amount of genetic data that we securely store in the cloud has grown tremendously-from 1 petabyte to 100 petabytes in just eight years. We anticipate that our stored data will continue to grow, so we turned our attention to finding solutions that securely optimize our data storage and reduce its associated carbon footprint.Story continuesVidal: Illumina has been using Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) for over 10 years and we've recently begun using the Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class. Tell us about some of the initial impacts you've observed.Aravanis: We learned that Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering would automate storage cost savings by moving data when access patterns change, while still maintaining data security. It also improves sustainability by storing less volatile data on technologies designed for efficient long-term storage.Usually, our customers keep a copy of the genomic data they generate and rarely delete data that might be useful in future analyses. Some of that data is not being accessed, but our total data footprint keeps growing as a result. Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering moves data to the most cost-effective access tier with no impact to performance. In large-scale tests on our own data, we've seen a 60% reduction in data storage costs. Illumina is currently working to apply these techniques to customer data both in BaseSpace Sequence Hub and Connected Analytics. In addition to our DRAGEN compression technology, this will allow us to provide our customers with near-instant access to hundreds of thousands of whole genome sequences at a low, competitive cost.Vidal: Can you tell us about some of the sustainability wins associated with this project and how they support Illumina's climate action plans?Aravanis: In addition to improved performance, we've seen a substantial decrease in our environmental footprint. Since implementing this project in 2021, there has been a 90% reduction in our carbon emissions associated with genomic data storage on the cloud. We continue to work with AWS to optimize our data storage so that we can further reduce carbon emissions while enabling accessible data analysis for our customers.Last year, we announced our net zero by 2050 target as part of our climate action plan to positively impact not only our direct operations but also our value chain. Considering our mission to improve human health and our commitment to operate responsibly and sustainably, this initiative was a win for us and a win for our customers. We know that to achieve a more sustainable future, we will need partners like AWS to find innovative solutions. If we work together on our collective goals, we can bring genomics for good to all.Read more about how Illumina and AWS are working together to optimize genomic data storage and analysis on the cloud.Illumina, Friday, November 18, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Illumina on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: IlluminaWebsite: https://www.illumina.com/company/about-us/corporate-social-responsibility.htmlEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: IlluminaView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/727020/QA-With-the-CTO-Storing-Growing-Data-While-Reducing-Environmental-Impact]"

It’s also 8% below its Aug. high. Yet the unweighted S&amp;P 500 index is doing much better, down only 11% this year and just 4.5% off its Aug. high. The outperformance of the unweighted S&amp;P 500 indicates that investors should buy names aside from the big tech stocks that get the biggest weight in the regular S&amp;P 500 index. A good way to accomplish the latter goal is by finding some of the best value stocks to buyThe names featured in this column have low valuations, high profits, and strong growth. Moreover. they are likely to keep delivering high profits and exceptional growth for many years to come. As a result, sooner rather than later, these value stocks to buy are going to rally a great deal.FFord Motor$14.32TSCOTractor Supply$216.18MRKMerck$99.65DGDollar General$257.60PWRQuanta Services$144.82CFCF Industries$105.70MSIMotorola$250.36Value Stocks to Buy: Ford Motor (F)Ford dealership sign against a blue sky.Source: D K Grove / Shutterstock.comFord Motor’s (NYSE:F) auto sales have been weighed down by supply-chain issues that are starting to become less intense and should continue to do so over time. Nonetheless, the automaker reported strong third-quarter results, is generating solid profits and growth and has become a leader in the rapidly expanding U.S. electric-vehicle market. Moreover, F stock should be boosted meaningfully by the increased tax credits for consumer and commercial EVs that were passed by the U.S. Congress earlier this year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFor all of 2022, Ford expects its EBIT, excluding certain items, to climb 15% to roughly $11.5 billion, and it anticipates that its adjusted free cash flow will come in at $9.5 billion to $10.5 billion. Moreover, the automaker can take advantage of the connected-car revolution by selling monthly subscriptions to many services, such as battery monitoring and security offerings.Story continuesDespite all of Ford’s positive attributes, the forward price-earnings ratio of F stock is a measly 7.8.Value Stocks to Buy: Tractor Supply (TSCO)IDEX stock: An electric tractor sits in a field on a sunny day with a wind turbine in the background.Source: Matthew Troke / Shutterstock.comTractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO) sells products that cater to rural Americans, including farmers. Among its offerings are products for horses, cattle, and pets, “maintenance products” for farm machinery, and other tools used by farmers. With American farmers benefiting from high food prices and elevated demand for food around the world due to the Russia-Ukraine war, Tractor Supply, unsurprisingly, has been reporting very strong financial results.Last quarter, for example, its top line climbed 8.3% year-over-year to $3.27 billion, it reported earnings per share of $2.10, and its comparable store sales surged 5.7% YOY.As of the end of Q3, there were over 27 million households in TSCO’s “neighbor’s club,” which seems to be similar to Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Prime program and Costco’s (NASDAQ:COST) membership program. Tractor Supply’s club, whose members generate about 75% of the company’s revenue, gives TSCO a large, loyal customer base. The company can easily and inexpensively market its new products to these consumers, leaving it well-positioned to continue to deliver strong sales growth.Value Stocks to Buy: Merck (MRK)Brown glass pill bottle on its side showing white pills inside, with other pill bottles behind it representing MACK stock.Source: shutterstock.com/ChampheiIn past columns, I’ve outlined the tremendous amount of revenue that Merck’s (NYSE:MRK) versatile cancer treatment, Keytruda, is generating for the giant drug maker.Keytruda was the biggest factor behind Merck’s strong third-quarter results, as the drug’s sales climbed 20% year-over-year to $5.3 billion. Merck’s overall top line increased an impressive 14% YOY to $15 billion. Moreover, the giant expects its 2022 earnings per share to come in at an impressive $7.32-$7.37, meaning that its price-earnings ratio, based on its 2022 EPS guidance, is a rather low 13.6. (100/$7.35)Also contributing to Merck’s strong Q3 results and its solid 2022 guidance are its “Human Papillomavirus vaccines.” Last quarter, the revenue generated by those shots climbed 15% YOY to $2.3 billion.Citing the strong sales of Merck’s key drugs, Cantor Fitzgerald on Oct. 28 raised its price target on the shares to $120 from $107 and said that the company’s strong outlook is “underappreciated” by the Street. Cantor maintained an “overweight” rating on the name.Dollar General (DG)Source: ShutterstockI’ve hypothesized that dollar stores will get a big boost as inflation squeezes working-class and poor Americans. Agreeing with that idea last month was research firm Placer.ai. In the words of Seeking Alpha, Placer.ai believes that “increasing pressure on middle and low-income consumers is promoting a trade-down to discount stores.” The firm added that “Dollar stores are seeing lower-income consumers trade down from traditional superstores such as Walmart.”  Dollar General (NYSE:DG) has benefited from that trend in the past and is likely to continue to do so in the future. In the second quarter, its top line increased 9% year-over-year to $9.43 billion, while its same-store sales rose 4.6% YOY and its Q2 earnings per share came in at $2.98. The retailer also increased its full-year sales growth guidance to 11% from 10%-10.5%, and it expected its earnings per share to rise 12%-14% in fiscal 2022. Despite its strong, positive catalysts, DG stock has a reasonable forward price-earnings ratio of 19.5.Quanta Services (PWR)electricity pylons and lines at duskSource: snvv18870020330 / Shutterstock.comAs I noted in a previous column, published on Sept. 29, Quanta (NYSE:PWR) “develops, repairs and maintains electric grids globally and renewable energy systems. It also carries out engineering projects for companies involved in the production of natural gas and oil prices.”I predicted that the company and PWR stock would get a lift from the electric-vehicle revolution, along with increased exploration for oil and gas amid high prices for those commodities. Quanta’s third-quarter results, reported on Nov 3, indicated that the company is indeed benefiting from those trends. Specifically, its sales jumped by a huge 33% year-over-year to $4.46 billion, while it generated $343 million of cash flow from operations. For all of 2022, the company expects its earnings per share to come in at $6.15-$6.39, excluding certain items, and its backlog at the end of Q3 stood at a very high $20.9 billion, which represented an all-time record for it.“Demand for our services continues to be driven by broad-based business strength from utility grid modernization and system hardening initiatives, as well as our reputation for solid and safe execution,” Quanta CEO Duke Austin, reported on the company’s Q3 earnings conference call. Given Quanta’s rapid growth and strong outlook, its forward price-earnings ratio of 20.3 is quite attractive.CF Industries (CF)A tractor spreading fertilizer over a farm field.Source: Fotokostic / Shutterstock.comLike Tractor Supply, CF Industries (NYSE:CF) is a fertilizer maker and is benefiting from high food prices brought about partly by the Russia-Ukraine War. Additionally, since Russia and Ukraine are both major exporters of fertilizer, the conflict has caused fertilizer prices to soar, benefiting CF and its peers.Last quarter, CF’s top line soared an incredible 70% year-over-year to $2.3 billion, while its EBITDA came in at an impressive $826 million. The fertilizer maker noted that geopolitical issues had increased the average selling prices of its products last quarter. Moreover, CF reported that it expects the supply-demand dynamics of one of its key offerings, nitrogen, to stay favorable “into 2025,” Seeking Alpha noted.“We expect to continue generating substantial free cash flow, which will enable us to invest prudently in high-return growth projects while at the same time returning significant capital to shareholders,” CF CEO Tony Will reported on the company’s Q3 earnings call.Despite its powerful growth and strong outlook, the forward price-earnings ratio of CF stock currently stands at 7.01.Motorola Solutions (MSI)communication technology for internet business. global world network and telecommunication on earthSource: greenbutterfly / Shutterstock.comMotorola Solutions (NYSE:MSI) appears to be benefiting from an important trend in the U.S.  that’s not discussed much in most media outlets: the huge crime wave that’s afflicting many American cities.Due to reforms in the criminal justice system, many more criminals are walking the streets than in prior years in multiple, major cities. That could explain why the demand for the company’s video-security products has surged. In the second quarter, for example, the revenue generated by its “Video security and access control” systems climbed 21% year over year, while its backlog soared 19% year over year to a “record $13.4 billion.”Last quarter, Motorola Solutions reported that ” increased demand for video security and land mobile radio technologies” helped boost its “Products and Systems Integration” sales by 15% year over year to a record level. For all of 2022, the company expects its sales to increase by 9.25%-9.5%, and it expects its earnings per share to come in at $10.17-$10.22.Analysts, on average, expect its 2023 EPS to come in at $11.19. That puts its forward price-earnings ratio at 22.4 (251/11.19), which is attractive given its strong growth and highly certain, strong outlook. Additionally, the shares have a dividend yield of 1.27%.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

A copy of the same can be downloaded here. The results in October were excellent, and its LRT Economic Moat strategy returned 7.38%. In addition, you can check the top 5 holdings of the fund to know its best picks in 2022.LRT Capital discussed stocks like Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) in the investor letter. Headquartered in Falls Church, Virginia, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is a global aerospace and defense company. On November 16, 2022, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) stock closed at $505.13 per share. One-month return of Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) was -1.43% and its shares gained 43.74% of their value over the last 52 weeks.  Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) has a market capitalization of $77.746 billion.LRT Capital made the following comment about Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) in its October investor letter:""Based in Virginia, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is one of the world’s largest defense contractors with annual revenue more than $30 billion. The company operates in a cozy oligopoly, that after decades of consolidation the US defense market is now controlled by five large companies: The Boeing Company (BA), General Dynamics Corporation (GD), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC), and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (RTX).Industry barriers to entry are immense, government procurement cycles are extremely long, and the consolidated industry structure reflects this. This industry structure has allowed Northrop to earn stable mid-teens returns on invested capital (ROIC) and grow earnings per share at a rate of over 13% per year in the past decade, despite a topline that has grown only in-line with inflation. Even after the recent run-up in the stock price, it trades at approximate 15x, next year’s earnings estimates, far below the S&amp;P 500 index, despite being an above average company.

PAC-3 missiles, when deployed in a Patriot battery, significantly increase the Patriot system’s firepower. The company anticipates demand for this advanced missile system to be high, particularly in politically tense regions of the Middle East.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?Increasing geopolitical and socioeconomic turmoil worldwide has prompted nations, both developed and developing, to expand their respective military arsenal, with missiles constituting a significant portion of that inventory.Lockheed’s Missiles and Fire Control business unit develops, manufactures and supports advanced combat missiles and rockets for military customers, including the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, NASA and dozens of foreign allies. Some of its prominent products include the PAC-3 missile, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile, JASSM, LRASM and many more.Lockheed frequently wins contracts from Pentagon and other U.S. allies involving its variant missile programs, like the latest one, which boost its revenue growth.Story continuesGrowth ProspectsThe global rocket and missiles market is projected to reach $82.0 billion by 2031, witnessing a CAGR of 4.2% from 2022 to 2031, per a report by Allied Market Research firm.Such projections reflect increased growth opportunities for major missile players like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon RTX, Northrop Grumman NOC and Boeing BA in the aforementioned market.Notably, Raytheon offers a variety of combat-proven missile defense systems, including the Patriot missile, Standard Missile-6, Standard Missile-3, Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile, Evolved Seasparrow Missile, Tomahawk cruise missile and a few more.Raytheon boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.5%.

The award has been offered by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Detroit Arsenal, MI.Valued at $146.7 million, the contract is estimated to be completed by Nov 30, 2024.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?Military tanks are the primary offensive weapons in land missions. An efficient armored military tank enables the army to carry out any mission by direct fire. The recent clash between Ukraine and Russia has accelerated the pace of upgrading the defense landscape with technologically advanced arms and ammunitions, which, in turn, has led to increased investments in military tanks.In this context, it is imperative to mention that the increased focus on technologically advanced combat vehicles is likely to benefit General Dynamics as its Land System business unit is a prime contractor of land combat vehicles like Stryker. It provides innovative design, engineering, technology, production and full life-cycle support for land combat vehicles worldwide.General Dynamics’ expertise and in-depth experience in building and supporting combat vehicles, coupled with a customer-first focus and a seasoned supply-chain network, have been helping it to win multiple contracts from the U.S. Army and its allies. The latest contract win is a bright example of that, which in turn should boost GD’s revenue generation prospects in the coming days.Growth ProspectsThe changing dynamics of the military landscape and the rising geopolitical tension make it mandatory for a country to continuously evolve and strengthen its defense structure. To this end, military tanks form an integral part of any military missions and arm them in their land warfare affairs.In this context, per a report from Markets and Markets, the global armored vehicle market is projected to witness a CAGR of 3.1% during the 2022-2027 period. Such abounding growth trends indicate ample growth opportunities for General Dynamics as it enjoys a lucrative position in the armored vehicle market.Story continuesA few defense primes that can reap the gains from the expanding armored vehicle market are BAE Systems BAESY, Northrop Grumman NOC and Raytheon Technologies RTX.BAE System’s Challenger 2 is heavily armored and highly mobile, designed for use in the direct fire zone. Its primary role is to destroy or neutralize the armor. It also has the ability to engage both hard and soft targets and can operate across a spectrum of high-intensity conflicts, counter insurgencies and peacekeeping roles.The long-term earnings growth rate of BAESY is pegged at 13.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BAESY’s 2022 sales implies an improvement of 17%.Northrop Grumman is the world’s top producer of medium-caliber live and training ammunition and gun systems, with more than five million units built in the last five years. It specializes in innovating low-cost, highly reliable precise weapons and ammunition for artillery and mortar systems, medium-caliber weapon platforms, battle tanks and individual soldiers.Northrop Grumman has a long-term earnings growth rate of 2.9%.

The Lynx Infantry Fighting Vehicle is a next-generation, tracked, armored fighting vehicle designed to address the critical challenges of the future battlefield.Raytheon’s long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 9.5%.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Wells Fargo &amp; Company, Honeywell International Inc. and Northrop Grumman Corporation. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Wells Fargo shares have outperformed the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry over the past six-month period (+9.7% vs. +5.2%). The Zacks analyst believes that the company’s progress on efficiency initiatives propelled expense control and savings, which are likely to support its bottom line in the upcoming period. Strength in the deposit balance will aid the bank’s liquidity position. The company’s solid liquidity position will help to meet its debt obligations if the economic situation worsens. Also, capital deployment activities seem sustainable.However, due to legal hassles, Wells Fargo has been penalized with business restrictions and a monetary fine. Restrictions on asset growth will continue to limit loan expansion ability. A decline in originations might limit mortgage banking income.(You can read the full research report on Wells Fargo here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Honeywell International shares have gained +2.7% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Diversified Operations industry’s loss of -16.1%. The Zacks analyst believes that healthy demand, orders and backlog bode well for Honeywell’s growth. Recovery in commercial flight hours is driving revenues at the Aerospace segment, while the Building Technologies segment is benefiting from commercial actions and strength in building products and building solutions. The company’s measures to reward its shareholders through dividends and share buybacks are encouraging.Story continuesHowever, supply chain constraints, labor market challenges and inflationary pressures are hurting the company’s operations. Weakness in the Safety and Productivity Solutions sales due to lower personal protective equipment and warehouse automation volume is an added concern. Also, adverse foreign currency movements are affecting the company’s bottom line.(You can read the full research report on Honeywell International here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Northrop Grumman shares have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the year-to-date period (+30.5% vs. -1.6%). The Zacks analyst believes that Northrop Grumman has developed into one of the top largest U.S. defense contractors in terms of revenues, with a major platform-centric focus. It continues to witness strong demand for its products, driven by programs like the F-35, Triton and SABR radar Global Hawk and the E-2D program. Solid U.S. budgetary provisions make one confident about a solid inflow of contracts from the Pentagon for it. It also holds a strong solvency position, at least in the short term. Its shares have outperformed the industry in the past year.However, a comparative analysis of the stock’s trailing 12-month EV/Sales ratio reflects a relatively gloomy picture that might be a cause of concern. It fears that the continued spread of COVID-19 may cause extended disruption in its supply chain.(You can read the full research report on Northrop Grumman here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include The Travelers Companies, Inc. and GSK plc.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

Earlier this year, Foot Locker said the amount of Nike product in its stores would be significantly less as the Swoosh accelerated its shift towards DTC sales. While this move initially caused the retailer to post a bleak outlook for 2022, it has recently encouraged Foot Locker to lean into other high-demand brands.By 10 AM ET on Friday, shares of Foot Locker were up more than 12%.“Choice and variety is something that consumers demand,” said Foot Locker CEO Mary Dillon in a Friday call with analysts. The newly minted CEO said she is shifting the company from being product-led to being consumer-led, adding that most top Foot Locker customers tend to shop three or more brands.Dillon noted the momentum of “non-Nike” sales in brands such as Adidas, Puma, Hoka, On, Crocs and New Balance.Earlier this week, Foot Locker announced an expansion of its partnership with Puma to bring in more basketball product and produce exclusive collections for the retailer, which includes continued exclusive access to the signature shoes of NBA star LaMelo Ball, such as the MB.02, which released in October.Puma sales at Foot Locker grew in the high single digits in Q3.Adidas, which announced an expanded partnership with Foot Locker in May, grew in the mid-single digits in Q3 as well. Ugg sales grew almost 50% and Crocs, Converse and New Balance sales were also up. Momentum in On and Hoka has persisted as well, which has helped bring more female runners and sneakerheads into the mix of shoppers.Story continuesOverall, total sales in Q3 were up 3.3% on a constant currency basis. Comparable-store sales increased 0.8% over 2021 and earnings per share were $1.01 and non-GAAP EPS were $1.27.To be sure, Foot Locker is still seeing success with the Nike brand and Dillon expects to end the year with a higher mix of Nike sales than initially anticipated. But sales are not dependent on the Swoosh alone.Given the strong quarter, Foot Locker raised its outlook for Q4 and the full-year and now expects 2022 sales to be down 4% to 5% for the year, citing strong demand trends and inventory availability. 2022 EPS is expected to be between $4.42 and $4.50, compared to prior range of $4.25 to $4.45.]"

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best AI Stocks to Buy Now. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are at the heart of the technological revolution of late. These technologies, like smartphones, are near ubiquitous in their nature since they have the potential to affect nearly every major industry.Artificial intelligence involves using patterns in existing datasets to 'infer' or make decisions. It is most commonly referred to in the context of robots or smart assistants carrying out tasks that would normally be assigned to humans. The machines carry out these tasks by using predefined data sets that have classes and labels assigned to them and then use these classes to categorize new information or inputs through these parameters. This allows for decisions that mimic human behavior to an extent. A subset of artificial intelligence is machine learning, which also uses existing data sets to generate inferences and insights. There are two categories of machine learning, namely supervised and unsupervised learning. The former sees the researcher assign labels to the data for the machine to then use these labels to sort out new data, while the latter involves the computer generating the labels by itself.These techniques help industries such as healthcare, drug development, and oil and gas exploration generate new insights from their data to improve performance and create new products. Naturally, the applications also paint an optimistic future for the industry. A report from Fortune Business Insights shares that the artificial intelligence industry is worth $347 billion this year, and from now to 2029 it will grow at a mind blowing compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20.1% to sit at $1.3 trillion at the end of the forecast period.This makes artificial intelligence one of the few multibillion dollar industries that have a double digit CAGR. Fortune Business Insights highlights that practical applications such as those in the food and beverages industry, logistics, automotive, and retail will drive this growth. Additionally, it notes that healthcare will constitute the largest chunk of the growth, with an unbelievable 150% rate. Other drivers include the Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets and the growing use of robotics. North America represented nearly half of the market in 2020, and Asia Pacific will be the fastest growing region during the time period.Story continuesToday's list will look at some of the top artificial intelligence firms in the industry, and these range from software and hardware providers to firms that have made AI a centerpiece of their business model. Some big ticket names are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).Our MethodologyWe picked the most popular AI stocks among the 920 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey as of the end of the third quarter of 2022.Best AI Stocks to Buy Now12. SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 17 SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) is a German company that provides enterprise resource planning software.

Despite a slowing macroeconomic environment, SAP SE (NYSE:SAP)'s cloud computing revenues grew by a strong 36% annually in its third fiscal quarter, and are further estimated to grow at a 17.9% CAGR between 2022 and 2027.By the end of this year's third quarter, 17 out of the 920 hedge funds polled by Insider Monkey had invested in SAP SE (NYSE:SAP).Out of these, Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management is SAP SE (NYSE:SAP)'s largest investor. It owns 6.7 million shares that are worth $549 million.Polen Capital mentioned the company in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:“SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) is Europe’s largest software company and the global leader in enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. ERP is a software category that is particularly critical to business functions, and, therefore, has high retention rates even in times of economic stress. For the past several years, SAP has been going through several transitions, including moving to cloud-based SaaS (Software as a service) solutions and an initiative to better integrate its various software solutions. In recent quarters, we have seen increasing evidence that both transitions are being successfully executed, and the result should be a faster-growing, more consistent, higher margin, and more advantaged business. As investment costs from these transition programs wane, and as the benefits of higher growth continue, we expect that earnings will grow at a double-digit rate from next year (2023) onwards. In light of this, we believe the valuation is very attractive for longterm investors.”Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc.

(NYSE:PATH) due to a change to our original thesis as we believe a new go-to-market strategy for its automation software could impact near-term execution. While we think process automation is a growing market, in a slowing macro environment single solutions may be more vulnerable than the platform solutions of software providers who can bundle products to meet a wide range of needs. In addition, the company has a material component of sales sourced in Europe where the economy is more vulnerable.”10. Verisk Analytics, Inc.

Shares have added about 8.3% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Comerica Incorporated due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Comerica Q3 Earnings Beat, Revenues &amp; Costs Rise Y/YComerica reported third-quarter earnings per share of $2.60, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.57. The bottom line reflects a rise of 36.8% from the prior-year quarter.Results have been primarily aided by increased NII, supported by higher interest rates and loan growth. However, a decline in non-interest income, higher expenses and increased provisions were the undermining factors.Net income attributable to common shares was $343 million, up 34.5% year over year.Revenues Improve, Expenses RiseTotal revenues were $985 million, up 30.5% year over year. Further, the top line beat the consensus estimate of $961.5 million.NII increased 48.8% on a year-over-year basis to $707 million. NIM rose 127 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.50%.Total non-interest income was $278 million, down 1% on a year-over-year basis. The decrease was due to a fall in card fees, commercial lending fees and other non-interest income.Non-interest expenses totaled $502 million, up 8% year over year. The rise was due to an increase in salaries and benefits expenses, occupancy expenses, FDIC insurance expenses and other non-interest expenses.The efficiency ratio was 50.75% compared with the prior-year quarter’s 61.13%. A decrease in the ratio indicates higher profitability.Balance Sheet Position RobustAs of Sep 30, 2022, total assets and shareholders' equity were $84.14 billion and $5.07 billion, respectively, compared with $86.89 billion and $6.44 billion, as of Jun 30, 2022.Total loans increased marginally on a sequential basis to $51.71 billion. However, total deposits declined 3.6% from the prior quarter to $73.02 billion.Story continuesCredit Quality: Mixed BagTotal non-performing assets decreased 11.5% year over year to $262 million. The allowance for credit losses was $624 million, down 2.3% from the prior-year quarter. The allowance for credit losses to total loans ratio was 1.21% as of Sep 30, 2022, down from 1.33% as of Sep 30, 2021.However, the company recorded net credit-related charge-offs of $13 million for the quarter under review, up from $2 million in the prior-year quarter. A provision for credit losses of $28 million was recorded in the reported quarter against a benefit of $42 million in the prior-year quarter.Capital Position WeakensAs of Sep 30, 2022, Comerica’s tangible common equity ratio was 4.82%, down from 7.20% in the prior-year quarter. The total capital ratio was 12.40%, declining from 12.57% in the year-ago quarter.Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio was 9.92%, falling from 10.27% in the prior-year quarter.OutlookFourth-Quarter 2022The expectations are on a sequential basis.Average loans are expected to grow 1%. Average deposits are expected to decline 5%.NII is anticipated to increase 4-5%, while fee income is expected to decrease 3%. Non-interest expenses are estimated to rise 2-3%.2022Average loans (excluding PPP) are expected to grow 7%. Average deposits are expected to decline 3%.NII is expected to jump more than 33% year over year. Non-interest income is likely to decline 6%. Non-interest expenses are estimated to rise 5%.CET1 is targeted to be 10%. The tax rate for 2022 is anticipated to be 22-23%, excluding discrete items.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.VGM ScoresAt this time, Comerica Incorporated has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a C. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift.

The problem is that we're not vaccinating, reaching, the people who haven't yet gotten vaccines,"" Krause said Thursday at a Hepatitis B Foundation event in Pennsylvania.Jigsaw puzzle needs the final piece as a solution to a problem or challenge.The CDC estimates 20% of the U.S. population has yet to receive one dose and a little over 30% have not completed the primary series.""To me, the fact that we still have several hundred people a day dying of COVID is a serious public health problem,"" he told Yahoo Finance following the event.Krause, who left the FDA prior to booster authorizations along with colleague Dr. Marion Gruber, has been steadfast in this belief since leaving the agency last November.In a November 2021 op-ed with Gruber and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's Dr. Paul Offit, a top vaccine expert, the trio emphasized the need to target the unvaccinated and noted that only those at highest risk of severe disease or death from the virus should be the focus of the booster campaign.""We don’t think boosters for all are necessary, even with the emergence of the omicron variant,"" the trio said.Jerald Bagley, 57, receives the Moderna coronavirus disease (COVID-19) booster vaccine targeting BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron sub variants at Skippack Pharmacy in Schwenksville, Pennsylvania, U.S., September 8, 2022. REUTERS/Hannah BeierOffit has previously told Yahoo Finance that he believes the emphasis on boosters should largely be on the older or more vulnerable populations in the U.S. — a point Krause agrees with.""Boosters can increase your own cellular immunity...which is responsible chiefly for protection against mild disease, and it's fairly short-lived. Boosters have never been shown to reduce transmission,"" Krause said.And by pushing boosters onto a population that doesn't need it, it affects ""the worldwide supply of vaccines and may prolong the pandemic,"" he added.Story continuesThe U.S. averages more than 35,000 COVID cases daily and more than 2,000 deaths weekly. And the CDC's projections show a rise in hospitalizations in coming weeks.But the message of boosting, and universal boosters, has already undermined confidence in the original vaccine series — two doses of an mRNA of either Moderna (MRNA) or Pfizer/BioNTech (PFE/BNTX) vaccines, or two doses of Novavax (NVAX), or one dose of Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) — even though they remain protective against variants, Krause told Yahoo Finance.To get the focus back on the unvaccinated will require a heavy lift of public health messaging.""I think who the message comes from is actually very important and to reach the people who haven't been vaccinated, it's important to engage people who believe in the the value of the vaccines and amplify their message among people who trust them,"" Krause said.That doesn't mean that boosting isn't important for some, but the messages will interfere with each other at the broader population level, he explained. And the amount of attention on the boosting message has drowned out efforts to get the unvaccinated vaccinated.Still, Krause is pleased to see that one year later, the idea is starting to catch on.""More people are recognizing the futility of continuously boosting people and the importance of refocusing on getting the unvaccinated, vaccinated. And so, while it's taken a long time to get there, I'm pleased that the conversation is at least moving along,"" he said.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

Shares have added about 13.9% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is IBM due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.IBM Tops Q3 Earnings Estimates on Solid Hybrid Cloud DemandIBM reported solid third-quarter 2022 results, wherein both the bottom and the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Net IncomeOn a GAAP basis, the net loss from continuing operations was $3,214 million or a loss of $3.55 per share against restated net income of $1,037 million or $1.14 per share in the year-ago quarter. The sharp decline was primarily attributable to a one-time, non-cash pension settlement charge of $5.9 billion ($4.4 billion net of tax) during third-quarter 2022.Excluding non-recurring items, non-GAAP net income was $1.81 per share compared with the restated tally of $1.84 per share in the prior-year quarter. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents.Quarter DetailsQuarterly total revenues increased to $14,107 million from the restated figure of $13,251 million in the prior year, backed by strong demand for hybrid cloud and AI, driving growth in Software and Consulting. The top line surpassed the consensus estimate of $13,734 million.Gross profit was $7,430 million compared with $7,106 million in the prior-year quarter, resulting in respective gross margins of 52.7% and 53.6%. Total expenses increased significantly to $11,931 million from $6,293 million, owing to a non-cash pension settlement charge of $5.9 billion.Segmental PerformanceSoftware: Revenues improved to $5,811 million from $5,406 million, driven by growth in Hybrid Platform &amp; Solutions and Transaction Processing. Segment pre-tax income from continuing operations was $1,306 million compared with $990 million in the year-ago quarter for respective margins of 22.5% and 18.3%. The company is witnessing healthy hybrid cloud adoption by clients, adding more than 200 clients in the third quarter, bringing the tally of hybrid cloud clients to more than 4,000.Consulting: Revenues were $4,700 million, up from $4,457 million, led by pervasive growth driven by demand for digital transformation, growing revenues and signings at double-digit rates across all business lines and regions. Segment pre-tax income was $462 million compared with $466 million in the year-ago quarter for respective margins of 9.8% and 10.5%.Infrastructure: Revenues were $3,352 million, up from $2,921 million, due to higher Hybrid Infrastructure revenues and continuous adoption of z16 mainframe – an open, agile platform that integrates into a hybrid cloud environment with industry-leading security, data privacy and latency. Segment pre-tax income was $280 million compared with $209 million in the year-ago quarter for respective margins of 8.3% and 7.1%.Financing: Revenues were $174 million, down from $184 million due to the challenging macroeconomic environment. Segment pre-tax income was $79 million compared with $132 million in the year-ago quarter for respective margins of 45.4% and 71.7%.Story continuesCash Flow &amp; LiquidityDuring the third quarter, IBM generated $1,901 million in cash from operations compared with $2,713 million in the year-ago quarter, bringing the respective tallies for the first nine months of  2022 and 2021 to $6,470 million and $10,252 million.

As of Sep 30, 2022, the company had $7,816 million in cash and cash equivalents with $44,942 million of long-term debt.OutlookFor full-year 2022, the company expects revenue growth above the mid-single-digit range. Free cash flow is estimated to be in the vicinity of $10 billion.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.The consensus estimate has shifted -5.42% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, IBM has a subpar Growth Score of D, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with an F.

That’s lifted the broader market as well, but chip stocks, among the most cyclical part of the tech industry, have outperformed as investors speculated a deep recession may be avoided.The disclosure that legendary value investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. bought a roughly $5 billion stake in Taiwan Semiconductor Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. also helped lift spirits. The world’s biggest contract manufacturer of chips, which counts Apple Inc. among its biggest customers, advanced 10% in US trading this week.In Europe, shares of chip-tool bellwether ASML Holding NV have rallied 45% from their October low. The Dutch company this month touted strong demand for its cutting-edge machine both in the near and medium term, while seeing limited direct impact from the US curbs on chip exports.European semiconductor stocks probably will start outperforming the broader market in this quarter, with the group poised for a recovery in 2023, Bank of America Corp. analysts said this week. They cited light positioning in the stocks, a likely bottoming in the smartphone market this quarter and in the broader semiconductor market in the second half of next year, and peaking inventories.Falling EstimatesOf course, not everyone thinks the industry’s pain is over. Barclays Plc said Micron’s outlook shows demand isn’t improving as quickly as expected, especially when accounting for troubling signs of deterioration in industrial markets and slowing growth in cloud computing.“The whole semi group has gotten over their skis with this move higher,” analysts Tom O’Malley and Blayne Curtis said.Chip-industry profit estimates for 2023 have fallen more than 20 percentage points this year, a much bigger drop than the rest of the tech sector. Earnings for semiconductor companies in the S&amp;P 500 are now projected to shrink 13% next year, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.The chip benchmark is now priced at less than 18 times projected earnings, around the average over the past 10 years.“We believe there has been enough bad news,” Credit Suisse Group AG analysts wrote in a report this week. “Semiconductors are in a period of sustained long-term growth, with factors such as AI, cloud computing and automotive all driving growth that’s more diversified versus the past.”Tech Chart of the DayInternational Business Machines Corp. is a bright spot in tech this year, easily outperforming the overall sector as investors rotate into companies with consistent earnings and strong dividend yields. The stock has rallied six straight days, closing Thursday ats its highest since February 2020. IBM has returned 15% this year including dividends, compared with a 24% loss for the S&amp;P 500 tech sector, with recent gains coming in the wake of strong results. On Thursday, IBM’s CEO said that unless there’s a “catastrophic recession,” corporate spending on technology should continue to increase.Top Tech StoriesElon Musk gave Twitter Inc. employees an ultimatum to either commit to the company’s new “hardcore” work environment or leave. Many more workers declined to sign on than he expected, potentially putting Twitter’s operations at risk, according to people familiar with the matter.Musk’s $44 billion takeover of Twitter is still facing US government scrutiny over national-security concerns that his foreign partners may be able to access user data, people familiar with the matter said.Musk tweeted out an upbeat message saying Twitter beat its all-time high in usage late Thursday, on a day when many employees decided to leave the company.Twitter on Thursday said it was temporarily closing its offices after Musk issued employees an ultimatum: Stay with the company “working long hours at high intensity” or quit with three months’ severance pay.Amazon.com Inc.

160,7babf795-4340-3b9a-927c-96c64f26242f,IBM,2022-11-19,Investors Heavily Search International Business Machines Corporation (IBM): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-international-business-140002947.html,1668780002,STORY,['IBM'],"[IBM (IBM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this technology and consulting company have returned +13.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +7.5% change. The Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, to which IBM belongs, has gained 13.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.IBM is expected to post earnings of $3.57 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5.4%.The consensus earnings estimate of $9.12 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +15%. This estimate has changed -1.8% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.69 indicates a change of +6.2% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.2%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for IBM.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for IBM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For IBM, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $15.49 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -7.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $59.32 billion and $59.89 billion estimates indicate -16.2% and +1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIBM reported revenues of $14.11 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -19.9%. EPS of $1.81 for the same period compares with $2.52 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.73 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.72%. The EPS surprise was +1.69%.Over the last four quarters, IBM surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.IBM is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about IBM. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best AI Stocks to Buy Now. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are at the heart of the technological revolution of late. These technologies, like smartphones, are near ubiquitous in their nature since they have the potential to affect nearly every major industry.Artificial intelligence involves using patterns in existing datasets to 'infer' or make decisions. It is most commonly referred to in the context of robots or smart assistants carrying out tasks that would normally be assigned to humans. The machines carry out these tasks by using predefined data sets that have classes and labels assigned to them and then use these classes to categorize new information or inputs through these parameters. This allows for decisions that mimic human behavior to an extent. A subset of artificial intelligence is machine learning, which also uses existing data sets to generate inferences and insights. There are two categories of machine learning, namely supervised and unsupervised learning. The former sees the researcher assign labels to the data for the machine to then use these labels to sort out new data, while the latter involves the computer generating the labels by itself.These techniques help industries such as healthcare, drug development, and oil and gas exploration generate new insights from their data to improve performance and create new products. Naturally, the applications also paint an optimistic future for the industry. A report from Fortune Business Insights shares that the artificial intelligence industry is worth $347 billion this year, and from now to 2029 it will grow at a mind blowing compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20.1% to sit at $1.3 trillion at the end of the forecast period.This makes artificial intelligence one of the few multibillion dollar industries that have a double digit CAGR. Fortune Business Insights highlights that practical applications such as those in the food and beverages industry, logistics, automotive, and retail will drive this growth. Additionally, it notes that healthcare will constitute the largest chunk of the growth, with an unbelievable 150% rate. Other drivers include the Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets and the growing use of robotics. North America represented nearly half of the market in 2020, and Asia Pacific will be the fastest growing region during the time period.Story continuesToday's list will look at some of the top artificial intelligence firms in the industry, and these range from software and hardware providers to firms that have made AI a centerpiece of their business model. Some big ticket names are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).Our MethodologyWe picked the most popular AI stocks among the 920 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey as of the end of the third quarter of 2022.Best AI Stocks to Buy Now12. SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 17 SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) is a German company that provides enterprise resource planning software.

Despite a slowing macroeconomic environment, SAP SE (NYSE:SAP)'s cloud computing revenues grew by a strong 36% annually in its third fiscal quarter, and are further estimated to grow at a 17.9% CAGR between 2022 and 2027.By the end of this year's third quarter, 17 out of the 920 hedge funds polled by Insider Monkey had invested in SAP SE (NYSE:SAP).Out of these, Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management is SAP SE (NYSE:SAP)'s largest investor. It owns 6.7 million shares that are worth $549 million.Polen Capital mentioned the company in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:“SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) is Europe’s largest software company and the global leader in enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. ERP is a software category that is particularly critical to business functions, and, therefore, has high retention rates even in times of economic stress. For the past several years, SAP has been going through several transitions, including moving to cloud-based SaaS (Software as a service) solutions and an initiative to better integrate its various software solutions. In recent quarters, we have seen increasing evidence that both transitions are being successfully executed, and the result should be a faster-growing, more consistent, higher margin, and more advantaged business. As investment costs from these transition programs wane, and as the benefits of higher growth continue, we expect that earnings will grow at a double-digit rate from next year (2023) onwards. In light of this, we believe the valuation is very attractive for longterm investors.”Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are met by SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) in our list of top artificial intelligence (AI) firms.11. UiPath Inc. (NYSE:PATH) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 26 UiPath Inc.

(NYSE:PATH) due to a change to our original thesis as we believe a new go-to-market strategy for its automation software could impact near-term execution. While we think process automation is a growing market, in a slowing macro environment single solutions may be more vulnerable than the platform solutions of software providers who can bundle products to meet a wide range of needs. In addition, the company has a material component of sales sourced in Europe where the economy is more vulnerable.”10. Verisk Analytics, Inc.

Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Marathon Petroleum is expected to post earnings of $6.62 per share, indicating a change of +409.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +30.2% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $25.27 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +931.4%. This estimate has changed +7.9% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.53 indicates a change of -34.6% from what Marathon Petroleum is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +25.5%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Marathon Petroleum.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MPC _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Marathon Petroleum, the consensus sales estimate of $35.55 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -0.2%. The $171.37 billion and $134.81 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +41.7% and -21.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMarathon Petroleum reported revenues of $47.24 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +44.8%. EPS of $7.81 for the same period compares with $0.73 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $35.67 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +32.43%. The EPS surprise was +14.85%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Marathon Petroleum is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Marathon Petroleum. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

GM raised the bottom end and lowered the top end of its 2022 adjusted EBIT to $13.5 billion to 14.5 billion, compared to its previous guidance of a range of $13 billion to $15 billion.NEW YORK, NEW YORK - NOVEMBER 17: A GM company banner is seen displayed at the New York Stock Exchange during morning trading on November 17, 2022 in New York City. Stocks are expected to fall as the stock market opened with interest rates rising as Federal Reserve officials signal more interest rate hikes to continue to slow down inflation. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Looking head to 2023 – 2025, GM now expects revenue to grow at a 12% compound annual rate through 2025, reaching more than $225 billion as EV volumes and software revenue grow. The company expects revenue from EVs to be more than $50 billion in 2025.As for its EV game plan, the automaker says its EV portfolio will be “solidly profitable in 2025” in North America, as the company scales EV capacity to more than 1 million units annually. GM seeing the EV business as profitable by 2025 is years ahead of schedule, when it originally expected margins for EVs to be comparable to gas-powered cars by 2030.The company is citing the effect of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and its incentives to build EVs and batteries in North America.“It’s clear these credits are going to help usher in a new era of technology innovation and job creation that’s going to achieve what was intended,” GM CEO Mary Barra said during a presentation at the company's investor day in New York. “It will be good for the American economy. It’ll be good for American families. It’ll be good for the environment, and frankly, General Motors is well poised.”But GM's profit boost isn't all the result of the IRA. The company is also improving operationally to boost profitability in the near term and fund EV initiatives for the future.""We've retooled our ICE portfolio, to fund the transition to an all-electric in the future in the out years,"" GM President Mark Reuss told Yahoo Finance from GM's investor day. Reuss noted changes to its pickup truck business, where GM is number one with its Silverado and Sierra sales combined and with its SUV offerings such as the Terrain and Equinox helping the bottom line. GM is also launching production of its updated mid-size pickup trucks, which is a growing segment, at its Wentzville, Missouri, plant.Story continuesMichael Simcoe, General Motors VP of Global Design and Lenny Kravitz introduce the Cadillac Celestiq electric-sedan during its unveiling in Los Angeles, California on October 17, 2022. - The ultra-luxury low-volume Celestiq features a host of 3D-printed parts for extensive customization and is the second EV in Cadillac's lineup. (Photo by Frederic J. BROWN / AFP) (Photo by FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP via Getty Images)GM is also changing the way customers will order cars, with a new streamlined process in which customers will eventually purchase them online, with GM providing delivery through its own distribution network. Reuss says the new ""buy your way"" strategy will save GM around $2,000 for every vehicle sold.GM is also innovating on how it plans to make next generation of vehicles. Take the $300,000 Cadillac CELESTIQ for example. It is essentially a handmade car, using bespoke parts, with Cadillac designers working hand in hand with clients to make these one-off cars. At low volume it would be very expensive to make, but Cadillac is implementing new production techniques, like the use of additive manufacturing, which is similar to 3D-printing.""We've installed a complete additive manufacturing facility with lots of machines, whether its metallic or non-metallic, at our tech center in Warren,"" Reuss said. Even custom requests, like fusing a client's flowers into laminates for the car's interior panels or guitar strings in the center console for musician Lenny Kravitz's CELASTIQ, are possible.""A lot of that is enabled by the true bespoke nature of additive manufacturing, and as an engineer that's incredible exciting for me,"" Reuss said.—Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Copa Holdings CPA, Azul AZUL, United Airlines UAL, JetBlue Airways JBLU and Allegiant Travel Company ALGT.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:Airline Stock Roundup: Q3 Earnings &amp; MoreIn the past week, Azul reported a wider-than-expected loss for third-quarter 2022 due to high costs. Another Latin American carrier, Copa Holdings delivered better-than-expected earnings per share in the third quarter, riding on the upbeat air-travel demand scenario. More earnings-related news is available in the past week’s write-up.Coming back to this week’s write-up, United Airlines expects to make the most of the buoyant air-travel demand scenario this Thanksgiving travel period. Anticipating high passenger volume, UAL expects to transport 12% more passengers from the 2021 levels during the Thanksgiving travel period. An expansion-related update from JetBlue Airways was also available in the past week.Recap of the Latest Top Stories1.Azul incurred a loss (excluding $1.52 from non-recurring items) of 72 cents per share in the third quarter of 2022, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 68 cents. Loss per share, however, narrowed year over year. Total revenues of $835.6 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $849 million but increased 60.7% year over year as air-travel demand improved. With more people preferring air-travel, Azul’s passenger revenues, contributing 93.1% to the top line, surged 69.7% year over year. Cargo and other revenues declined 4.7% year over year due to a reduction in international cargo capacity.Cost per ASK (CASK) increased 28.8% from the third-quarter 2021 reported figure to 38.39 cents, mainly due to higher jet fuel prices. Fuel cost per liter increased 85.3% from the third-quarter 2021 level. CASK excluding fuel inched up 1.9% to 20.02 cents. Average fare surged 49.3% from the third-quarter 2021 figure.

Quarterly revenues of $809.4 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $816.2 million but surged 81.9% year over year, courtesy of the skyrocketed air-travel demand.Copa Holdings, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), expects the fourth-quarter operating margin to be 22%.

United Airlines reportedly anticipates transporting 5.5 million passengers during the Thanksgiving travel period. The projected passenger volume is roughly the same as the 2019 actuals (pre-coronavirus era). To meet this expected demand swell, UAL intends to operate 3,700 plus flights (on average) daily during the Nov 18-30 time frame. UAL believes that passenger volume will be the maximum on Nov 27 (the Sunday after Thanksgiving) since the start of the pandemic. More than 460,000 passengers are expected to travel on UAL flights that day. United Airlines will operate roughly 275 extra flights on the said date to meet the anticipated demand upsurge.4. To expand its footprint in Europe, JetBlue intends to launch flights to Paris next summer. Paris will be the second transatlantic destination after London for JetBlue. JBLU started operating flights on the New York-London route in August 2021. JBLU believes that its operations on the transatlantic routes, dominated by large carriers, will help slash ticket prices by intensifying competition.Expressing delight at JBLU’s impending flight services to Paris, the most visited city across Continental Europe, chief executive officer Robin Hayes said, “JetBlue is offering something completely unique to what you get from the big global legacy airlines on these routes – where a single high-fare joint venture operates nearly three-quarters of the flying. The response to our London service is proof that combining great service with low fares works.”JBLU also has plans to start flights from Boston to Paris. With the Rugby world cup slated to be held in France next year apart from the 2024 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games scheduled to be hosted by Paris, JBLU’s decision to add flights to the city sounds prudent. The routes are likely to invite significant traffic, in turn bolstering JBLU’s top line.5. To cater to the surge in air-travel demand, Allegiant Travel Company decided to introduce routes to Nashville early next year. ALGT intends to commence operating flights to Nashville from Provo, UT on Feb 15. One-way fare for travel on the route is as low as $59. Flights to Nashville from Akron, OH will also be operational on Feb 15. One-way fare for travel on this route is kept as low as $37. To avail this low fare, tickets have to be purchased by Nov 17, 2022, for travel by Aug 13, 2023.PerformanceEven though almost all the airline stocks have traded in the red over the five trading days, the losses were muted in nature. As a result, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has increased, albeit marginally, to $60.67 over the past five trading days.

Nonetheless, the reported figure jumped 46% year over year.NII, on a taxable-equivalent basis, surged 74% year over year to $1.7 billion.

Lower mortgage banking revenues mainly led to the fall.The non-interest expenses totaled $1.3 billion, flaring up 42%.

Excluding non-operating charges, the non-interest operating expenses were $1.2 billion.The efficiency ratio was 53.6%, down from 57.7% in the year-earlier quarter. A lower ratio indicates a rise in profitability.Loans and leases, net of unearned discount, were $128.2 billion at the end of the reported quarter, relatively stable from the prior quarter.

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.One stock to keep an eye on is Pinnacle West Capital (PNW). PNW is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value.Another notable valuation metric for PNW is its P/B ratio of 1.30. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 2.14. Over the past year, PNW's P/B has been as high as 1.50 and as low as 1.06, with a median of 1.33.Finally, investors should note that PNW has a P/CF ratio of 5.45. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. PNW's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 12.38. Within the past 12 months, PNW's P/CF has been as high as 6.37 and as low as 4.44, with a median of 5.80.Investors could also keep in mind RWE AG (RWEOY), an Utility - Electric Power stock with a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy) and Value grade of A.Story continuesShares of RWE AG are currently trading at a forward earnings multiple of 10.25 and a PEG ratio of 7.07 compared to its industry's P/E and PEG ratios of 14.99 and 2.09, respectively.Over the last 12 months, RWEOY's P/E has been as high as 20.53, as low as 8.72, with a median of 17.53, and its PEG ratio has been as high as 7.07, as low as 2.45, with a median of 3.97.RWE AG sports a P/B ratio of 2.78 as well; this compares to its industry's price-to-book ratio of 2.14. In the past 52 weeks, RWEOY's P/B has been as high as 2.96, as low as 1.14, with a median of 2.31.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Pinnacle West Capital and RWE AG are likely undervalued currently. And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook, PNW and RWEOY sticks out as one of the market's strongest value stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Pick Your DayBecause most Targets mark down certain departments on specific days for clearance, knowing the schedule can help you find the best Target deals.""For instance, you'll find the best deals on clearance electronics on a Monday and sporting good clearance on Thursday,"" said Christy Palmer, founder of the All Things Target blog.Here's a schedule Palmer said is good for most Targets:Monday: Electronics, accessories, kids' clothing, books, baby, stationeryTuesday: Domestic goods, women's clothing, pets, market (food items)Wednesday: Men's clothing, health &amp; beauty, diapers, lawn &amp; garden, furnitureThursday: Houseware, lingerie, shoes, toys, sporting goods, decor &amp; luggageFriday: Auto, cosmetics, hardware, jewelryTake Our Poll: How Much of a Tax Refund Do You Expect in 2023?Shutterstock.com2. Check for Price AdjustmentsHere's a moment everyone has felt and no one likes: You finally buy that dress you've been wanting only to see it go on sale the next day. Well, at Target, you can get the difference between what you paid and the new sale price refunded, said Palmer.So, if an item you bought goes on sale within 14 days of purchase, just bring in your receipt and Target will adjust the price for you. Some exclusions do apply, so make sure you read Target's policy before requesting a price adjustment.Hadrian / Shutterstock.com3. Shop AmazonWait, you can shop on Amazon to save money at Target? Correct, because Target is one of many retailers with a price match guarantee.Story continuesAs expected, there are some rules and restrictions. But in general, Target will match the lower price from select online or local retailers.Shutterstock.com4. Know the Clearance CodesClearance items are some of the best deals at Target, Palmer said, and they are marked down to certain levels in a certain order. ""First, items will get marked down to 15% or 30% off, then to 50% off and finally end up at 70% off,"" she said.If you're on the hunt for clearance items, they should be marked down in red or yellow stickers, according to Palmer. The new price and the percentage of the markdown will be in the top right-hand corner without a percent symbol.""Check the number in the upper-right corner of the price tag,"" said Palmer. ""If it says '70,' it's been marked down to 70% off.""If a price ends in $0.04, this usually indicates it's reached its lowest markdown.Shutterstock.com5. Shop for the Holidays Early -- or LateWant Halloween or Christmas decorations, Easter baskets or back-to-school items that are practically free? Wait a few days or a few weeks after the holiday to buy them.Holiday items will be cut by 50% the day after the holiday -- 30% for candy. But wait a week or so, and products could go down to 70% off. Then, a few days later, if anything is left, they'll go to 90% off, which is practically free.Here's a list of days and times of year that Target offers holiday sale prices, according to All Things Target:Valentine's DayEasterSummerBack-to-SchoolHalloweenChristmasShutterstock.com6. Stack 'Em and SaveIf you've done your pre-Target-run prep properly, you might have more than one coupon for a single item. No problem: Target lets you stack coupons.Don't be shy about handing the checkout person a Target coupon, a manufacturer's coupon and even a third coupon, such as a Target Cartwheel discount for the same item.Shutterstock.com7. Use a Cashback App or WebsiteTo save even more money at Target, sign up for an Ibotta, Ebates or BeFrugal account. These online programs and smartphone apps give you money back for selected items you buy at Target or other participating stores.Every service is slightly different, but the bottom line is you receive cash back for the items you buy.Shutterstock.com8. Use Target's Wedding Registry -- Even If You're Not Getting MarriedEven if you're not actually getting married or having a baby, creating a wedding or baby registry is a sneaky way you can save on big-ticket items.""What I do to save money at Target is that I create a registry for items that I need,"" said Becky Beach, founder of MomBeach.com. ""After the date of the registry [event, Target gives you a coupon] for 15% off [the remaining items]. That's how I was able to get a brand new TV set cheaper after our toddler broke the one we had.""Stack the 15% off deal with the 5% you get for shopping with a REDcard and any Cartwheel discounts, and you can save big bucks.Shutterstock.com9. Buy Discount Gift CardsYou can shave even more off your bill by buying discount gift cards at sites like Gift Card Granny or Raise. The cards are real gift cards that you use like cash, so the bonus is that the gift card savings are in addition to any savings with coupons or sales.Shutterstock.com10. Don't Rely on AdvertisementsPeriodically, Target might have unadvertised markdowns on items. These bargains will be labeled with red and white sale signs, and the signs will have dates on the bottom telling you how long the sales are valid, Palmer said.""Some are valid longer than a week, some sale prices will last a month or more,"" she said.kirin_photo / Getty Images11. Go Green, Get PaidBring in your own reusable bags, and Target will give you a 5-cent discount at checkout for each reusable. It's not much, but it can add up -- especially on those big shopping days.filadendron / Getty Images12. Shop Online Instead of In-Store""My advice to save money at Target that most people don't know -- and that Target does not talk about -- is that online prices are cheaper than in the store,"" said Vanessa Valiente, a San Diego-based personal shopper and creator of the fashion blog V-Style. ""To get the online price in-store and save time, order the items online and then click on the 'pick up in store' option. If you are already in a Target store and want to get the online price, you can look up the item online and then have the cashier price match the item.""lechatnoir / Getty Images13. Compare Prices at Multiple Store LocationsAn item might be on clearance at one store and not another. To find the best price at different Targets in your area, use BrickSeek.com's Target inventory checker, said Collin Morgan, CEO at the frugal living site Hip2Save.com.""One of the things I love about Target is that if you wait long enough to purchase an item you love, it will eventually go on clearance,"" said Morgan.

Let's take a look at some of the biggest movers of the week. A big theme this week-- we've been talking a lot about it-- it's retail. A number of the larger players reporting quarterly results. You can see some of those names on the screen right here. Walmart, Macy's, and Target. Well, taking a look at the retail heat map as we take a look at what the performance of a number of these larger names.I want to draw your attention to first Walmart because that's been a gainer this week. Up just about 5 and 1/2%. The company really getting an edge here in the current economic environment because consumers are trading down. We certainly saw that reflected in their results. And they outperformed in the most recent quarter.We're also looking at Macy's, up just around 6% on the week. Shares spiked about 15% earlier this week after the company reported better than expected earnings. But CEO Jeff Gannett did flag some uncertainty about the holiday season. At least for now, looks like Wall Street is able to shrug off some of that concern off.I also want to point out what we saw in Target because, on the other hand, a very different picture. Looking at losses over the past five days of just about 6%. The company highlighting the fact that consumers are starting to pull back on discretionary spending. Now, CEO Brian Cornell saying that, quote, ""clearly, it's an environment where consumers have been stressed."" And we saw that reflected in their results. The stock sold off as a result. Ending the week, though, off just about 6%. So well off the lows of the week.Let's talk about some of the other big stories of the week. One of those, of course, the collapse of FTX. That sent shockwaves throughout the crypto industry. Coinbase took a huge hit as a result. And taking a look at that stock over the last five days, we're looking at losses of just about 21%. Now, investors are worried about contagion. Bank of America downgrading the stock today, citing that risk.Story continuesBitcoin, on the other hand, has fared much better than Coinbase. Taking a look at the 5-day chart, Bitcoin actually closing the week to the upside, which I think took a lot of people by surprise. Up just about 2 and 1/2%. Let's take a look at Norwegian because that stock ending the week in the red, off just about 8%.Credit Suisse double downgrading the stock to underperform. They initially had an outperform rating on it, saying that its valuation premium to peers is likely unsustainable. Shares sold off on that move. We saw that reflected in the chart over the past of five days. Certainly, the stock has been under pressure so far this year. Year to date, shares off just about 21%.Let's round it out with NVIDIA. We heard from a number of chip makers over the past couple of days their quarterly results. Well, Nvidia shares ending the week off just about 5 and 1/2%. The company's third quarter revenue beat expectations. But earnings mixed. Guidance, it fell short. It's been certainly has been a very tough year for NVIDIA.Year to date, we're looking at losses of just about 47%. Now, the company cut its forecast multiple times amid a softening macroeconomic environment. We know Nvidia far from the only chip maker that has suffered so far this year. So investors now, and certainly analysts, are trying to gauge whether or not we have hit a bottom. Where we are today not too far from the 52-week lows we hit just about a week or so ago. Rachelle.]"
185,e61bdc2b-d981-37f4-8f50-b74f07f85a46,TGT,2022-11-19,Breaking Down Retail Earnings That Highlight Slowing Consumer Spending,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/breaking-down-retail-earnings-highlight-204008868.html,1668804008,STORY,"['WMT', '^GSPC', 'TGT']","[It is no surprise that the combined weight of elevated inflation, rising interest rates and uncertainty about the economy have forced consumers to change their spending behavior.The issue has undoubtedly been at play with lower-income households for some time now. But we can intuitively appreciate that it will not stay restricted to this consumer segment alone and will most likely move up the income chain in the days and weeks ahead.We saw some of that in the Walmart WMT report that showed the retailer benefiting from higher-income consumers ‘trading down’ to its stores in response to the aforementioned headwinds.The retail business is a tough and competitive space even in ‘normal’ times and these are anything but normal times. They need just the right amount of inventory, otherwise they will either lose sales if they don’t have enough merchandise as was the case earlier in the pandemic, or will need to offer steeper discounts and hurt margins if they have too much of it, as we saw with Walmart and Target TGT in the summer quarter.Retailers also need to make sure that they have the right type of merchandise, as we saw with Target and Walmart having too much stuff like patio furniture that consumers weren’t interested in buying any more after the initial pandemic boom. Keeping stores fully staffed in a tight labor market and ensuring just the right amount of price discounts are some of the other challenges that big-box operators like Walmart, Target and others face daily.It all comes down to execution and management effectiveness.With respect to the group’s Q3 earnings releases, it has been a mixed show overall. In a backdrop of moderating and shifting consumer spending behavior, some retailers have been more successful than others. Walmart was better, Target was not. Macy’s M, Foot Locker FL and Lowe’s LOW executed really well, but others didn’t.You can see some of this in the year-to-date performance of Walmart (blue line), Target (green line), Lowe’s (orange line) shares relative to the S&amp;P 500 index (red line).Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWith respect to the Retail sector 2022 Q3 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 29 of the 34 retailers in the S&amp;P 500 index.Unlike the official S&amp;P sector classifications that leaves retail sector players spread around different sectors, primarily Consumer Discretionary, Zacks’ stand-along Retail sector classification that houses conventional retailers, digital players and restaurants allows for a more granular understanding of trends in the space.Total Q3 earnings for these retailers are down -5.5% from the same period last year on +8.6% higher revenues, with 72.4% beating EPS estimates and 58.6% beating revenue estimates.The comparison charts below put the Q3 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs you can see above, retailers have been struggling to come out with positive surprises thus far, though it’s a better showing relative to what we saw from the group 2022 Q2.With respect to the earnings and revenue growth rates, Amazon’s weak numbers play a significant role in the year-over-year growth rate for the sector (Amazon is part of the Zacks Retail sector, and not the Zacks Technology sector).The two comparison charts below show the Q3 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon’s results (left side chart) and without Amazon’s numbers (right side chart).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ3 Earnings Season Scorecard Including all of the results that came through Friday, November 18th, we now have Q3 results from 476 S&amp;P 500 members that combined account for 95.2% of the index’s total membership.For the 476 index members that have reported results already, total earnings are up +1.8% from the same period last year on +11.8% higher revenues, with 69.1% beating EPS estimates and 68.3% beating revenue estimates.Here is how the 2022 Q3 earnings and revenue growth rates for these companies compares across different periods.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHere is how the 2022 Q3 EPS and revenue beats percentages for these companies compare across different periods.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe EPS and revenue beats percentages are below what we had seen from this same group of companies in recent quarters, but otherwise within the historical range by now.Tracking Earnings Estimate RevisionsThe chart below that shows the blended earnings and revenue growth for 2022 Q3 relative to what we saw in the preceding four quarters and what is expected in the coming three periods.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis is no surprise, as the global economy is going through a synchronized slowdown, under the combined effects of rising interest rates in response to inflationary pressures, still-lingering logistical challenges that have started to ease up and China’s continuing zero-Covid restrictions.The orange bars in the chart above represent revenue growth. So, for 2022 Q3, revenues are on track to grow +11.6% from the same period last year even though earnings are only expected to be up only +1.6%. This seemingly elevated revenue growth is a direct function of pricing power, with companies able to pass on rising input costs to end consumers. We intuitively know that this can’t go on forever and current projections for the next three quarters bears out this intuition.The above chart shows that earnings in the current period (2022 Q4) are expected to be down -5.1% below the year-earlier level on +4.6% higher revenues.Estimates have been steadily coming down, in line with the trend that we saw ahead of the start of the Q3 earnings season.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEstimates for full-year 2023 have been coming down as well, with the negative revisions trend particularly notable on an ex-Energy basis. You can see this in the chart below that shows the aggregate 2023 earnings estimate on an ex-Energy basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSince mid-April, 2023 earnings estimates in the aggregate have come down by -8.6% for the S&amp;P 500 index as a whole and -11.5% on an ex-Energy basis.The cuts to estimates have been particularly notable for the Tech (down -18.9% since mid-April), Construction (-25.1%), Retail (-18.6%), Industrial Products (-14.3%), Consumer Discretionary (-19.3%) and Aerospace (-13.4%). Overall, estimates have been cut for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors.The chart below shows the overall earnings picture on an annual basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThere are some in the market who think that 2023 earnings should be below the 2022 level instead of the current expected +2.8% growth simply because the U.S. economy is expected to go through a moderate recession.I am not suggesting that 2023 earnings can’t be below the 2022 level; they can be, and based on the current revisions trend, are likely headed there. But it is wrong to expect moderate declines in ‘real’ GDP to automatically result in ‘nominal’ or non-inflation adjusted corporate earnings to also decline. Corporate revenues and earnings are ‘nominal’ values and will reflect the effects of inflation. Inflation is expected to come down in 2023, but nevertheless remain positive.For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Evaluating Further Downside Risks to Earnings Estimates   Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(Goldman Sachs)The main culprit of the reduced spending intentions is none other than biting inflation, which continues to hammer household finances.Nearly 80% of consumers expect to adjust their behavior as a result of the inflationary environment, the survey found. About half of that 80% plan to trade down to cheaper products.In the uncertain economic environment, Goldman says Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT) will remain top shopping destinations this holiday season. Walmart CFO John David Rainey recently told Yahoo Finance Live his company is seeing higher-end consumers trade down to the discount retailer.""We expect consumers to hunt for promotions this holiday period (as there will be an abundance of them), which could limit the scope for a continuation of average unit retail price gains that have been a key offset for margins year to date,"" the analysts added.A street performer dressed as Dr. Seuss' the Grinch takes photos with tourists in Times Square on December 25, 2021, in New York City. (Photo by Roy Rochlin/Getty Images)To be sure, retailers will enter the holidays — their most important selling period of the year — with a number of economic headwinds.GDP rose 2.6% in the third quarter, but that marked the only positive quarter for growth in 2022 so far.Inflation remains stubbornly high and a major problem for American households. The October Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed that the overall cost of groceries is up by 12.4% annually. Consumer confidence, meanwhile, tanked several percentage points in November compared to October.Many household-name retailers were already rattled by a weakening economic environment in the third quarter.Story continuesThis week alone, Target missed on earnings by a country mile and warned about profits for the holiday quarter. Home goods retailer Williams-Sonoma also served up a lackluster fourth-quarter outlook as shoppers shunned discretionary purchases.""Sitting here today, if you look at some of the syndicated data that has been released, obviously you've seen a significant change in consumer shopping patterns as we ended October and moved into the month of November,"" Target Chairman and CEO Brian Cornell told Yahoo Finance. ""So clearly, it's an environment where consumers have been stressed. We know they're spending more dollars on food and beverage and household essentials. They're looking for promotions and are looking for that great deal. And I would expect that promotional focus will continue throughout the holidays.""Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

The stock is up 16% here this morning. And one analyst says-- Michael Binetti over at Credit Suisse says gross margin is going to turn positive year over year for the first time since the second quarter of 2021 in this company's third quarter.So if that's the case, then that would be quite a turnaround in this environment here. And the company's fourth quarter forecast leaves it a little room to either beat or miss, but it looks like the third quarter is really what folks are paying attention to here.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, those third quarter results above their expectations, saying that they had stronger values throughout their stores. And that value play is what some consumers, and I would argue many consumers, to your point, are looking for.If you only have or are hearing about the affluent consumer being the most resilient right now-- and even that's starting to kind of bleed into their own balance sheets as well and their financials-- then what does that mean for the consumers who are already pinching pennies, and have been doing that for months now?]"

And he's currently working toward a master's degree from James Madison University.Lowery values each of the diplomas he's earned, but it's his 2019 graduation from another institution that he credits with transforming his life.""All doors have opened since then,"" Lowery said.The program? Goodwill University.""We focus on job training that leads to careers,"" said Raquel Lynch, chief program officer with Goodwill Industries of the Southern Piedmont, a nonprofit headquartered in Charlotte serving 18 counties in North and South Carolina. ""This is a program that combines the classroom with practical, industry-specific experiences.""The Regions Foundation, a nonprofit initiative primarily funded by Regions Bank, is helping to ensure that hands-on learning lab happens for participants like Lowery by granting $25,000 to Goodwill of the Southern Piedmont's Workforce Services Program.""We focus on job training that leads to careers. This is a program that combines the classroom with practical, industry-specific experiences.""Raquel Lynch, chief program officer with Goodwill Industries of the Southern Piedmont""Skilled trade professionals have always been highly needed, and the need today is especially great due to the pandemic's labor shortage,"" said Marta Self, executive director of the Regions Foundation. ""Workforce programs like Goodwill University are opening new doors through specialized skills training and by providing participants with a clear path to sustainable, rewarding and in-demand careers.""For Lowery, that in-demand career is in home appliance repair. Lowery enrolled in the Renewable Energy and Efficiency Workforce (RENEW) Training Program, delivered at the Goodwill Construction Skills Training Center. Through the RENEW program, Lowery completed a 16-week training course that teaches the fundamentals of construction through an introductory course, in addition to advanced training in Heating, Ventilation and Air Condition (HVAC) and Electrical Training.Story continues""It offered me the chance to learn two different things at one time,"" said the lifelong student.Goodwill's Workforce Services Program offers numerous learning opportunities through seven tracks covering everything from computer basics and customer service to construction and trade skills. Interested in entering the supply chain field? Goodwill conducts a Warehouse, Inventory and Logistics program. Looking to gain expertise in piloting commercial drones? Yep, they have that covered too. Class sizes average 15 students to offer a more personalized learning experience, with all training provided at no charge.Goodwill Industries of the Southern Piedmont chief advancement officer LaRita Barber says the nonprofit relies on a village of collaborators to ensure their training program remains affordable, valuable and relevant for participants.""We believe we can't do this work alone,"" said Barber. ""Our mission is not one that can be accomplished in a vacuum, it requires a community of support. When people ask, ‘What's your ‘secret sauce?', it's really about relationships.""In addition to funders like the Regions Foundation, those relationships include local employers who offer insights to participants and career opportunities to graduates.""We have ‘Mentor Mondays' where employers come to the classroom and explain what it's like to work in the industry,"" said Lynch. ""We also have an Employment Engagement team that coordinates tours to offer participants on-site access.""Goodwill is also committed to building other skills training into each course's design for participants to apply - both on the job and off.""We don't call them soft skills, we've named them essential skills,"" Lynch describes of communication, time management, teamwork and the added abilities participants gain. ""A lot of people take them for granted. But in construction, you have to work in teams. You have to be able to ask for clarity. On a construction site, the ability to communicate effectively could be a life-saving skill. It could literally save somebody's life.""This isn't the first time Lowery has understood the weight of being responsible for other's lives. In 1987, he enlisted in the U.S. Army. Following his deployment to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Lowery served during Desert Storm and Desert Shield.""I was on special assignment in an underground bunker monitoring air space,"" Lowery explained. ""My role involved observing and monitoring anything that moved at an Air Force base, friend or foe. It made me see things differently, from different points of view.""Lowery learned valuable life lessons from his military service. Now, more than two decades later, he's learned more thanks to Goodwill University. What did he discover about himself through this training?""I've learned that if I apply myself, I can do it. Also, you've got to have patience. There is no shortcut to success.""Maurice LoweryLowery shares those thoughts and more as a testimonial presenter for Goodwill, speaking to students in classrooms where he once sat and to donors during fundraisers.""Anybody I can talk to, Goodwill can always call me,"" he said.His key message?Gratitude.""My favorite part is letting people know their money is really appreciated,"" Lowery said. ""I wouldn't have been able to go through the program without that support. I have to thank someone for giving … $20, $50 - it doesn't take a lot to help someone accomplish a dream or a goal.""LaRita Barber, Raquel Lynch and the entire Goodwill team see the magic of graduates achieving those dreams and goals every day, nearly 300 just from the Construction and Trades Program since 2019.""Maurice is not an exception, we hope his experience happens for every single person,"" said Barber. ""Our shared purpose is to help people see possibilities, seize opportunities and to prosper. We're here to help people tap into their own greatness. Goodwill is not the hero in this … we're just here to help our participants along their journey.""View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Regions Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Regions BankWebsite: profiles/regions-bankEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Regions BankView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/727070/All-Doors-Have-Opened-Since-Then]"

This is shown in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesVisaVisa is a payments technology company that provides transaction processing services (primarily authorization, clearing, and settlement) to financial institutions and merchant clients.Visa reported free cash flow of $5.6 billion in its latest quarter, penciling in an 11% sequential uptick and a solid 48% Y/Y change.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company’s annual dividend currently yields 0.8%, a few ticks below its Zacks Business Services sector average of roughly 1%.While the yield may be lower than its sector’s average, Visa’s 15% five-year annualized dividend growth rate helps to pick up the slack in a big way.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor the cherry on top, V has consistently impressed with its quarterly results, exceeding earnings and revenue expectations in 11 consecutive quarters.In its latest release, V exceeded earnings expectations by 3.8% and revenue estimates by 3.1%. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUnitedHealth UnitedHealth provides a wide range of healthcare products and services, including health maintenance organizations (HMOs), point of service plans (POS), preferred provider organizations (PPOs), and managed fee-for-service programs.Over the last several months, analysts have been bullish in their earnings outlook regarding UNH’s current and next fiscal year, helping land the stock into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn its latest print, UNH’s free cash flow was reported at a sizable $17.8 billion, reflecting a massive 180% sequential uptick and a 150% Y/Y increase.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUnitedHealth’s current annual dividend yield of 1.3% is below its Zacks Medical sector average. Still, similar to Visa, UNH’s 17.5% five-year annualized dividend growth rate makes up for the shortfall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOther Noteworthy Cash GeneratorsNow, for those seeking exposure to tech, several companies within the realm also have inspiring free cash flow, including the legendary Microsoft MSFT and everybody’s favorite, Apple AAPL.In Apple’s latest release, free cash flow came in at $20.8 billion, reflecting a 22.7% Y/Y uptick.And in Microsoft’s latest print, free cash flow was reported at $16.9 billion, representing a 9% Y/Y decline.Bottom LineA company displaying free cash flow strength has freedom for growth opportunities, can consistently shell out dividends, and wipe out debt easily.And when investors are scouting for potential investments, it’s undoubtedly a metric worth paying serious attention to.For those seeking companies with strong free cash flow, all three stocks above – Visa V, UnitedHealth Group UNH, and Exxon Mobil XOM – could be considered.Now, for those seeking exposure to tech, Apple AAPL and Microsoft MSFT also generate substantial cash, providing additional options for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Let's take a look at some of the biggest movers of the week. A big theme this week-- we've been talking a lot about it-- it's retail. A number of the larger players reporting quarterly results. You can see some of those names on the screen right here. Walmart, Macy's, and Target. Well, taking a look at the retail heat map as we take a look at what the performance of a number of these larger names.I want to draw your attention to first Walmart because that's been a gainer this week. Up just about 5 and 1/2%. The company really getting an edge here in the current economic environment because consumers are trading down. We certainly saw that reflected in their results. And they outperformed in the most recent quarter.We're also looking at Macy's, up just around 6% on the week. Shares spiked about 15% earlier this week after the company reported better than expected earnings. But CEO Jeff Gannett did flag some uncertainty about the holiday season. At least for now, looks like Wall Street is able to shrug off some of that concern off.I also want to point out what we saw in Target because, on the other hand, a very different picture. Looking at losses over the past five days of just about 6%. The company highlighting the fact that consumers are starting to pull back on discretionary spending. Now, CEO Brian Cornell saying that, quote, ""clearly, it's an environment where consumers have been stressed."" And we saw that reflected in their results. The stock sold off as a result. Ending the week, though, off just about 6%. So well off the lows of the week.Let's talk about some of the other big stories of the week. One of those, of course, the collapse of FTX. That sent shockwaves throughout the crypto industry. Coinbase took a huge hit as a result. And taking a look at that stock over the last five days, we're looking at losses of just about 21%. Now, investors are worried about contagion. Bank of America downgrading the stock today, citing that risk.Story continuesBitcoin, on the other hand, has fared much better than Coinbase. Taking a look at the 5-day chart, Bitcoin actually closing the week to the upside, which I think took a lot of people by surprise. Up just about 2 and 1/2%. Let's take a look at Norwegian because that stock ending the week in the red, off just about 8%.Credit Suisse double downgrading the stock to underperform. They initially had an outperform rating on it, saying that its valuation premium to peers is likely unsustainable. Shares sold off on that move. We saw that reflected in the chart over the past of five days. Certainly, the stock has been under pressure so far this year. Year to date, shares off just about 21%.Let's round it out with NVIDIA. We heard from a number of chip makers over the past couple of days their quarterly results. Well, Nvidia shares ending the week off just about 5 and 1/2%. The company's third quarter revenue beat expectations. But earnings mixed. Guidance, it fell short. It's been certainly has been a very tough year for NVIDIA.Year to date, we're looking at losses of just about 47%. Now, the company cut its forecast multiple times amid a softening macroeconomic environment. We know Nvidia far from the only chip maker that has suffered so far this year. So investors now, and certainly analysts, are trying to gauge whether or not we have hit a bottom. Where we are today not too far from the 52-week lows we hit just about a week or so ago. Rachelle.]"

Medtronic surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed in one, the average surprise being 0.35%.Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayMedtronic has been witnessing an adverse trend of procedure volume across its core business over the past few quarters, impacted by the choppy macroeconomic scenario globally and a severe shortage of health professional labor. Per the company’s August 2022 update, the full impact of inflation with increased freight expense will be realized in Q2 of fiscal 2023. Further, challenges related to the extended COVID-led restrictions in selective geographies, including China and Japan, are expected to have impacted the company’s major business lines.Added to this, the company is apprehensive about the inflation and currency headwinds affecting margins. Considering how inflation of raw materials and freight has become severe over the past quarter, Medtronic, on the first-quarter earnings call, stated that it would prioritize R&amp;D investments for future growth. This might have once again caused margin pressure in fiscal Q2.Medtronic PLC Price and EPS SurpriseMedtronic PLC Price and EPS SurpriseMedtronic PLC price-eps-surprise | Medtronic PLC QuoteThe company had stated that in terms of EPS, the full impact of inflation on raw material and direct labor costs would be realized in the fiscal second quarter as inventory rolls off the balance sheet.Overall, in the second quarter, Medtronic expects organic revenue growth in the range of 3% to 3.5%, implying strong sequential acceleration, driven by improved product availability based on new launches. The fiscal second quarter would have a currency headwind between $365 million and $415 million, per the company. Second-quarter EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.26 to $1.30, per Medtronic.Story continuesThe company’s Cardiovascular portfolio is expected to have gained in Q2 fiscal 2023 on thelimited U.S. market release of the Evolut FX valve, which has been receiving strong customer response. Further, the Evolut PRO+ launch in Europe and Evolut PRO launch in China too are expected to have contributed to the company’s fiscal Q3 top line. In cardiac rhythm management, the AURORA extravascular ICD is expected to have registered strong sales. The company earlier expected cardiovascular business revenues to grow in the range of 5% to 5.5% in Q2.In the neuroscience portfolio, the company is expected to have increased market share in Cranial and Spinal technologies. Demand for the company’s new spine implants is expected to have contributed to the growth. Strong adoption of AI-enabled surgical planning platform among the U.S. user base, the launch of the Catalyft expandable titanium interbody system and the rollout of enabling technologies are expected to have contributed to Q2 growth. The Mazor robotics system and StealthStation navigation system, particularly, are expected to have performed strongly in the to-be-reported quarter.In Neuromodulation, over the past few months, Medtronic has been witnessing strong momentum from new products in both Pain Stim and Brain Modulation. The company earlier expected its neuroscience revenues to grow in the range of 5.5% to 6% in Q2.In Medical Surgical and surgical robotics, Medtronic remains focused on the limited market release of the Hugo robot while it scales production. The company recently completed Hugo installations in several geographies like Denmark, France, and Italy, which are likely to have added to the company’s Q2 top-line growth within this arm. However, according to Medtronic, given increased volume-based procurement in many of the Chinese provinces, medical surgical revenues are expected to be down 0.25 point to up 0.25 point in Q2.In Diabetes, MDT might have faced some competitive pressure in the United States in Q2, which might have impacted growth severely. However, the company is expected to have seen significant growth in markets outside the United States on the increasing user base of the MiniMed 780G insulin pump, combined with the Guardian 4 sensor. According to Medtronic, Diabetes is expected to be down 3% to 6% on an organic basis in fiscal Q2.Q2 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Medtronic’s fiscal second-quarter total revenues of $7.72 billion suggests a 1.7% decline from the prior-year reported number. The consensus mark for earnings of $1.28 per share implies a 3.03% drop from the year-ago reported figure.What Our Quantitative Model PredictsPer our proven model, a stock needs to have the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to deliver an earnings surprise.

Sales of animal care products, including supplements, vitamin injectables, and companion animal parasiticides, also improved year over year, enhanced by the September 2021 acquisition of CAPInnoVet.The growth was also driven by year-over-year increases across the company’s biosecurity portfolio, including an uptick in insect control products, and in cleaners and disinfectants. Neogen’s genomics business (reported through the Animal Safety segment) also recorded robust year-over-year increase in the fiscal first quarter.Price PerformanceNeogen stock has lost 64.5% over the past year compared with the industry’s 47.3% decline and the S&amp;P 500's 17.5% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, Neogen carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

231,05ff9fd9-b6be-3d88-99cc-32cc6577f184,TRV,2022-11-19,Travelers (TRV) Up 7.1% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Continue?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/travelers-trv-7-1-since-163004823.html,1668789004,STORY,['TRV'],"[A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Travelers (TRV). Shares have added about 7.1% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Travelers due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Travelers’ Q3 Earnings and Revenues Beat EstimatesThe Travelers Companies, Inc. reported third-quarter 2022 core income of $2.20 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 24.3%. The bottom line however decreased 15.4% year over year.The quarter witnessed higher net written premiums, improved combined ratio and higher underwriting gain.Behind Q3 HeadlinesTravelers’ total revenues increased 6.8% from the year-ago quarter to $9.4 billion, primarily due to higher premiums and fee income. The top-line figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.5%.Net written premiums increased 110% year over year to $9.2 billion, driven by increased new business, strong retention rates and positive renewal premium changes across all the segments.Net investment income decreased 23% year over year to $593 million pre-tax, primarily due to a decrease in income from the non-fixed income investment portfolio.Underwriting gain of $115 million increased 53.3% year over year in the reported quarter.  The combined ratio improved 40 basis points (bps) year over year to 98.2 due to net favorable prior-year reserve development and lesser impact from catastrophe losses. It was partially offset by a higher underlying combined ratio.Total claims and expenses increased 9.4% year over year to $8.8 billion, primarily due to higher claims and claim adjustment expenses, amortization of deferred acquisition costs, general and administrative expenses and interest expense.At the end of the third quarter, statutory capital and surplus were $23.4 billion. The debt-to-capital ratio (excluding after-tax net unrealized investment gains included in shareholders’ equity) was 21.8% and within the insurer’s target range of 15% to 25%.Adjusted book value per share (excluding net unrealized investment gains/losses) was $111.90, up 7% year over year. Core return on equity was 7.9%, down 220 bps year over year.Story continuesSegment UpdateBusiness Insurance: Net written premiums increased 9% year over year to about $4.4 billion. The upside was due to strong renewal premium change, strong retention and higher levels of new business. The combined ratio improved 120 bps year over year to 96.3 due to lower net unfavorable prior year reserve development and a lower underlying combined ratio. It was partially offset by higher catastrophe losses.Segment income decreased 15.6% year over year to $471 million. The downside was due to lower net investment income and higher catastrophe losses. It was partially offset by lower net unfavorable prior year reserve development and a higher underlying underwriting gain.Bond &amp; Specialty Insurance: Net written premiums rose 8% year over year to $964 million, primarily driven by strong production in surety and strong renewal premium change, retention and new business in management liability. The combined ratio improved 860 bps year over year to 72.5 due to a lower underlying combined ratio and higher net favorable prior-year reserve development. It was partially offset by higher catastrophe losses.Segment income improved 39.1% year over year to $242 million, primarily due to higher underlying underwriting gain and higher net favorable prior-year reserve development.Personal Insurance: Net written premiums of $3.9 billion increased 13% year over year due to higher pricing in both Domestic Automobile and Domestic Homeowners and Other. The combined ratio deteriorated 260 bps year over year to 107.2 due to a higher underlying combined ratio and lower net favorable prior-year reserve development. It was partially offset by lower catastrophe losses.Segment loss was $111 million after-tax wider than the segment loss of $2 million after-tax in the prior-year quarter. The loss increased primarily due to lower underlying underwriting results and lower net investment income. It was partially offset by lower catastrophe losses.Dividend and Share Repurchase UpdateThis property &amp; casualty insurer returned $722 million in the reported quarter. It bought back shares worth $501 million. It had about $2.5 billion of capacity remaining under its share repurchase authorization as of Sep 30, 2022. Travelers’ board also declared a regular quarterly dividend of 93 cents per share. The dividend will be paid out on Dec 30 to shareholders of record at the close of business as of Dec 9, 2022.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.The consensus estimate has shifted -5.19% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Travelers has an average Growth Score of C, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Travelers has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerTravelers belongs to the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry.

(NYSE:APD) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/85-ownership-shares-air-products-130024310.html,1668776424,STORY,['APD'],"[If you want to know who really controls Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 85% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Air Products and Chemicals. See our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Air Products and Chemicals?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Air Products and Chemicals already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Air Products and Chemicals' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Air Products and Chemicals is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.2% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 6.6% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.8% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 22 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Air Products and ChemicalsThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$229m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 14% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Air Products and Chemicals. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Air Products and Chemicals   you should know about.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Robinson (CHRW) Rewards Investors With 11% Dividend Hike,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/c-h-robinson-chrw-rewards-181706576.html,1668795426,STORY,"['CHRW', 'TNK', 'ATSG']","[In a shareholder-friendly move, C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.CHRW announced a hike in its dividend payout. CHRW’s board of directors has approved a dividend hike of 11%, thereby raising its quarterly cash dividend from 55 cents per share to 61 cents.The raised dividend will be paid out on Jan 3, 2023, to all its shareholders of record as of Dec 2, 2022. The move reflects CHRW’s intention to utilize free cash for enhancing its shareholders’ returns.Prior to the dividend hike, CHRW paid out a quarterly dividend of 55 cents ($2.20 annualized) per share, which gives it a 2.37% yield at the current stock price. This company’s payout ratio is 27%, with a five-year dividend growth rate of 3.70%. These metrics indicate that CHRW has a solid dividend growth track record over the past five years.C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Dividend Yield (TTM)C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Dividend Yield (TTM)C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. dividend-yield-ttm | C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. QuoteLast year too (in December 2021), C.H. Robinson hiked its dividend to 55 cents per share (annually: $2.20) from 51 cents (annually: $2.04). The company’s board has also boosted the share repurchase authorization by an additional 20 million shares.C.H. Robinson is consistently making efforts in rewarding its shareholders through dividends and share buybacks which are encouraging. During the first nine months of 2022, CHRW rewarded its shareholders through a combination of cash dividends ($216.3 million) and share repurchases ($1,023.6 million).Continuing the shareholder-friendly approach, the company returned approximately $886 million to shareholders through a combination of dividends ($277 million) and share buybacks ($609 million) during 2021.Dividend-paying stocks not only provide a solid income stream but also have fewer chances of experiencing wild price swings. Dividend stocks, like CHRW, are safe bets for creating wealth, as the payouts generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty like the current scenario.Story continuesCHRW’s management’s decision to increase its quarterly dividend payout in the current turbulent scenario reflects CHRW’s commitment toward boosting shareholder value apart from underlining confidence in its business.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderC.H.

Comments coming in from an important Fed official suggested policy tightening was far from over and further rate hikes were on the way. 2-year and 10-year treasury yields rose on the news. All three major indexes ended slightly in the red.How Did The Benchmarks Perform?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 0.02% or 7.51 points to end at 33,546.32 points. Seventeen components of the 30-stock index ended in the positive territory, while 13 ended in the negative.The S&amp;P 500 lost 0.3% or 12.23 points to close at 3,946.56 points. Nine of the 11 broad sectors of the benchmark index ended in negative territory. The Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU), the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) and the Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB) decreased 1.8%, 1.2% and 1%, respectively, while the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) gained 0.2%.The tech-heavy Nasdaq declined 0.4% or 38.70 points to finish at 11,144.96 points.The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) decreased 0.8% to 23.93. A total of 10.3 billion shares were traded on Thursday, lower than the last 20-session average of 12.1 billion. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 2.06-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.65-to-1 ratio favored the decliners.Important Fed Official Turns HawkishIn recent sessions, the market has been energized and driven by various dovish comments coming in from Fed officials suggesting that the central bank would start to revisit its policy of hiking interest rates at a rapid pace to tackle inflation. The underlying reason behind them turning dovish has been the fact that recent string of economic data has suggested that the Fed’s policy has started taking effect and demand has contracted. However, this notion took a hit on Thursday with St. Louis Fed President James Bullard expressing his views at an economic event in Louisville, Kentucky.Bullard said the Fed needs to keep raising rates because according to him policy tightening had so far had only limited effects on observed inflation. The target policy needs to rise to at least a range between 5.00% and 5.25% from the current level of just below 4.00% to be sufficiently restrictive.Story continuesHowever, on the question of immediate steps to be taken in the Fed meeting slated for the 13th and 14th of December, Bullard would leave it upto Fed Chair Jerome Powell. ""On the question of how much to do at any particular meeting, I would leave that up to the Chair,"" Bullard said. ""If you do more now, you have less to do in the first quarter (of 2023). If you do less now, then you have more to do in the first quarter. Generally speaking, it probably does not make a lot of difference in terms of the macroeconomics.""This is being perceived as a pushback from the Fed’s recent stance of trying to reassure the markets that it would slacken its stringent policy measures to avoid a hard-landing of the economy, and stocks fell on the news. Treasury yields rose in apprehension of an imminent economic slowdown if policy tightening were to continue. The benchmark 10-year treasury yield increased nearly 8 basis points to 3.773%, while the 2-year treasury yield went up to of 4.450%, thereby having an adverse impact on growth stocks.Consequently, shares of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.

244,6cdc4d89-3bb0-3c40-9bc9-ad9528df84b4,MTB,2022-11-19,M&T Bank (NYSE:MTB) Has Affirmed Its Dividend Of $1.20,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/m-t-bank-nyse-mtb-125908225.html,1668862748,STORY,['MTB-PH'],"[The board of M&amp;T Bank Corporation (NYSE:MTB) has announced that it will pay a dividend on the 30th of December, with investors receiving $1.20 per share. Based on this payment, the dividend yield will be 2.8%, which is fairly typical for the industry. View our latest analysis for M&amp;T Bank M&amp;T Bank's Payment Expected To Have Solid Earnings CoverageWhile it is always good to see a solid dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is feasible.Having distributed dividends for at least 10 years, M&amp;T Bank has a long history of paying out a part of its earnings to shareholders. Based on M&amp;T Bank's last earnings report, the payout ratio is at a decent 46%, meaning that the company is able to pay out its dividend with a bit of room to spare.Over the next 3 years, EPS is forecast to expand by 77.4%. Analysts forecast the future payout ratio could be 29% over the same time horizon, which is a number we think the company can maintain.historic-dividendM&amp;T Bank Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2012, the annual payment back then was $2.80, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $4.80. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 5.5% a year over that time. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.Dividend Growth May Be Hard To AchieveThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Unfortunately, M&amp;T Bank's earnings per share has been essentially flat over the past five years, which means the dividend may not be increased each year. Growth of 1.1% may indicate that the company has limited investment opportunity so it is returning its earnings to shareholders instead. While this isn't necessarily a negative, it definitely signals that dividend growth could be constrained in the future unless earnings start to pick up again.Story continuesWe should note that M&amp;T Bank has issued stock equal to 34% of shares outstanding. Trying to grow the dividend when issuing new shares reminds us of the ancient Greek tale of Sisyphus - perpetually pushing a boulder uphill. Companies that consistently issue new shares are often suboptimal from a dividend perspective.We Really Like M&amp;T Bank's DividendIn summary, it is good to see that the dividend is staying consistent, and we don't think there is any reason to suspect this might change over the medium term. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. For example, we've picked out 2 warning signs for M&amp;T Bank that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this oil and gas exploration company have returned -1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +7.5% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, to which Devon Energy belongs, has gained 7.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Devon Energy is expected to post earnings of $2.12 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +52.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -9.7%.The consensus earnings estimate of $8.77 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +148.4%. This estimate has changed -2% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.15 indicates a change of +4.3% from what Devon Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -4.9%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Devon Energy.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for DVN _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Devon Energy, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $5.01 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +17.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $19.84 billion and $20 billion estimates indicate +66.5% and +0.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDevon Energy reported revenues of $5.43 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +56.7%.

Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Devon Energy is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Devon Energy.

These technologies, like smartphones, are near ubiquitous in their nature since they have the potential to affect nearly every major industry.Artificial intelligence involves using patterns in existing datasets to 'infer' or make decisions. It is most commonly referred to in the context of robots or smart assistants carrying out tasks that would normally be assigned to humans. The machines carry out these tasks by using predefined data sets that have classes and labels assigned to them and then use these classes to categorize new information or inputs through these parameters. This allows for decisions that mimic human behavior to an extent. A subset of artificial intelligence is machine learning, which also uses existing data sets to generate inferences and insights. There are two categories of machine learning, namely supervised and unsupervised learning. The former sees the researcher assign labels to the data for the machine to then use these labels to sort out new data, while the latter involves the computer generating the labels by itself.These techniques help industries such as healthcare, drug development, and oil and gas exploration generate new insights from their data to improve performance and create new products. Naturally, the applications also paint an optimistic future for the industry. A report from Fortune Business Insights shares that the artificial intelligence industry is worth $347 billion this year, and from now to 2029 it will grow at a mind blowing compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20.1% to sit at $1.3 trillion at the end of the forecast period.This makes artificial intelligence one of the few multibillion dollar industries that have a double digit CAGR. Fortune Business Insights highlights that practical applications such as those in the food and beverages industry, logistics, automotive, and retail will drive this growth. Additionally, it notes that healthcare will constitute the largest chunk of the growth, with an unbelievable 150% rate. Other drivers include the Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets and the growing use of robotics. North America represented nearly half of the market in 2020, and Asia Pacific will be the fastest growing region during the time period.Story continuesToday's list will look at some of the top artificial intelligence firms in the industry, and these range from software and hardware providers to firms that have made AI a centerpiece of their business model.

Here is what the fund said:“SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) is Europe’s largest software company and the global leader in enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. ERP is a software category that is particularly critical to business functions, and, therefore, has high retention rates even in times of economic stress. For the past several years, SAP has been going through several transitions, including moving to cloud-based SaaS (Software as a service) solutions and an initiative to better integrate its various software solutions. In recent quarters, we have seen increasing evidence that both transitions are being successfully executed, and the result should be a faster-growing, more consistent, higher margin, and more advantaged business. As investment costs from these transition programs wane, and as the benefits of higher growth continue, we expect that earnings will grow at a double-digit rate from next year (2023) onwards. In light of this, we believe the valuation is very attractive for longterm investors.”Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc.

(NYSE:PATH) due to a change to our original thesis as we believe a new go-to-market strategy for its automation software could impact near-term execution. While we think process automation is a growing market, in a slowing macro environment single solutions may be more vulnerable than the platform solutions of software providers who can bundle products to meet a wide range of needs.

(NASDAQ:MU). The company's shares led the NASDAQGS gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Micron Technology’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Micron Technology What Is Micron Technology Worth?Good news, investors! Micron Technology is still a bargain right now according to my price multiple model, which compares the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 7.35x is currently well-below the industry average of 17.14x, meaning that it is trading at a cheaper price relative to its peers. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Micron Technology’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What kind of growth will Micron Technology generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. However, with an extremely negative double-digit change in profit expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth is certainly not a driver of a buy decision. It seems like high uncertainty is on the cards for Micron Technology, at least in the near future.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Although MU is currently trading below the industry PE ratio, the negative profit outlook does bring on some uncertainty, which equates to higher risk. Consider whether you want to increase your portfolio exposure to MU, or whether diversifying into another stock may be a better move for your total risk and return.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on MU for a while, but hesitant on making the leap, I recommend you research further into the stock. Given its current price multiple, now is a great time to make a decision. But keep in mind the risks that come with negative growth prospects in the future.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

But with the slightly better consumer price index (CPI) and producer price index (PPI) numbers out in the past two weeks, analysts are beginning to warm up to the REIT sector.Here are three REITs that have had analyst upgrades within the last few weeks:Prologis Inc. (NYSE: PLD) is a San Francisco-based industrial REIT that owns and manages industrial logistics properties across the U.S. and 18 other countries. Founded in 1983, Prologis has been a leader in appreciation among REIT stocks. Although Prologis has an annual dividend of $3.16, it’s more growth- than income-oriented, and the annual dividend yield of 2.8% is usually well below other REITs in its peer group.From October 2017 to April 2022, Prologis gained approximately 210%. Very few REITs matched that performance. But interest rate hikes slammed Prologis’s stock price from $174 to a low of $98 in mid-October. It recently closed at $113.65.On October 17, Scotiabank analyst Nicholas Yulico upgraded Prologis from Sector Perform to Sector Outperform but still lowered his price target from $137 to $116. At the time, Prologis was trading around $105. Other analysts have recently reinstated Buy and Overweight ratings on Prologis while projecting target prices as high as $140.Kite Realty Group Trust (NYSE: KRG) is an Indianapolis-based retail REIT with open-air and mixed-use properties from Vermont to California. Its strip malls are mostly grocery store-anchored. Other tenants include CVS Pharmacy Inc., The Fresh Market, Best Buy Co. Inc., Burlington, Ross Stores Inc. and Costco Wholesale.Kite Realty recently declared a dividend of $0.24 per share, an increase of 9% from the previous quarter. Forward funds from operation (FFO) of $1.89 easily covers the $0.96 annual dividend and presently yields 4.4%.Story continuesOn Nov. 9, Bank of America Securities analyst Craig Schmidt upgraded Kite Realty Group Trust from Neutral to Buy, while simultaneously raising his price target from $22 to $25. The 52-week range is $16.42 to $23.35, and the most recent closing price was $21.62.Americold Realty Trust Inc. (NYSE: COLD) is a storage REIT that uses advanced technology to cold store food for supermarkets, food producers and international food and beverage organizations. It has 249 locations with different temperature zones. Its motto is, “From farm to fork and every step in between.” Its multifaceted network looks like this:americold realty trustOn Nov. 3, Americold Realty Trust delivered its third-quarter operating results. FFO of $0.29 per share was higher year-over-year and exceeded analysts’ views by $0.04, but the company missed analyst expectations on revenue by 1.3%.Nevertheless, on Nov. 14, Bank of America Securities analyst Joshua Dennerlein upgraded Americold Realty Trust from Neutral to Buy and raised his price target from $27.50 to $33.50. In June, Dennerlein also upgraded Americold Realty Trust from Underperform to Neutral. No other analyst has upgraded it in 2022.Americold Realty Trust has a 52-week range of $21.49 to $33.50. Its recent closing price was $28.95. The annual dividend is $0.88, and the current yield is 3.03%. Another positive is dividend growth, as Americold Realty Trust has raised its dividend by 57% over the past five years.REIT investors will be hoping to see more analyst upgrades reported in the months ahead, especially on companies that can continue improving FFO numbers.REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it’s too late.

(NYSE:PLD) stock at an average sell price of US$164 during the past year. The company’s market cap plunged by US$5.6b after price dropped by 5.1% last week but insiders were able to limit their loss to an extent.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Prologis The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At PrologisThe Lead Independent Director, Irving Lyons, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$7.3m worth of shares at a price of US$165 each. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$112). So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.In total, Prologis insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insider Ownership Of PrologisMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that Prologis insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$110m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Prologis Insiders?The fact that there have been no Prologis insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Prologis, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. For example, Prologis has 4 warning signs (and 2 which can't be ignored) we think you should know about.Story continuesOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

And American Express is partnering with TikTok to launch what we're calling the-- as we take a look here, we're taking a look at the #ShopSmallAccelerator. The initiative is meant to help small businesses become effective TikTok marketers as well. Now we're joined by Marianne Rausch, American Express vice president of Small Business Saturday and Shop Small. Thank you for joining us. So for people who are trying to get their head around this context wise, talk about the economic impact of small businesses.MARIANNE RAUSCH: Absolutely. So thank you so much for having me. American Express founded Small Business Saturday back in 2010 because we recognize the critical importance of small businesses to our communities. They are really the lifeblood of our neighborhood. They boost the local economy. And they enrich our neighborhoods.So to continue that rich tradition of small business support and to really bring it into the things that are most relevant and important for small business owners in 2022, we are partnering with TikTok to launch a shop small accelerator, which is really going to help small business owners with best practices, tools, and resources to create the types of marketing and content that are really going to help them break through and stand out on the platform.- Marianne, you're talking to small businesses all the time. Just what are you hearing from them just about the importance of a presence on social media and how you hope that carries through Small Business Saturday and beyond over the next couple of years?MARIANNE RAUSCH: Absolutely. So there were two clear themes that we were hearing about from small businesses as we began to plan for this Small Business Saturday. First, it was the interest in really understanding-- or just the criticality of reaching a younger audience, particularly that Gen-Z and millennial audience of customers. And then secondly, the just importance of social media in general for getting in front of that audience.Story continuesSo 88% of small business owners said that in the past year social media has helped them find new customers. And 63% of them are saying that it's so important that they're able to market to and attract that younger audience of customers that we know are on social in general and TikTok in particular.- So Marianne, what kind of skills are needed to really translate views into purchases, especially when it comes to TikTok?MARIANNE RAUSCH: I think that's really the beauty of TikTok and why we felt like it was such a perfect platform for us to partner with, which is that the type of content that does really well on TikTok really lends itself to the type of stories small business owners can and should tell. So it's a lot of behind the scenes content, really real authentic content that is the lo-fi. And people just want to hear the emotional authentic story about what makes these small businesses so unique and the interesting contributions that they're making to their community.- Marianne, what are you expecting sales to look like this year? And I guess just talk to us about the importance of Small Business Saturday, especially coming out of the pandemic when so many small businesses, if they did survive, they barely did.MARIANNE RAUSCH: Absolutely. So we know that small businesses are continuing to feel post-pandemic challenges, including, of course, right now the macroeconomic pressures, most notably inflation. We heard from 72% of small business owners that they are feeling real concern about the impacts of inflation for their businesses this holiday season. So we want to make sure that we are helping them address and work through that.We also know from an American Express study that consumers are thinking about operating on a budget this holiday season and are going to be thinking about budgeting when they make their holiday purchases. So we think it's more important than ever that we're keeping it really top of mind that when you're making those holiday purchasing decisions to make sure that you're considering and thinking about ways you can support small businesses.- And we know that word of mouth and trust plays a big role, especially when it comes to small businesses. And we know that, according to your survey here, nearly 2/3 of consumers prefer shopping with businesses that give them the option to shop online as well as in person. When you sort of tie that all together, how much harder is it for a small business in this sort of environment versus, say, a big giant like a Walmart, who's also trying to clamor for these customers as well?MARIANNE RAUSCH: I think it is inherently harder for small businesses to break through and compete in our sort of digital first world of commerce that we live in now, which is exactly why we felt like it was so important for us to partner with TikTok and really empower small businesses to both understand how to be effective marketers in this digital and social first world and also then provide them with really tangible resources to take those learnings and put them into practice, which is one of the reasons that the accelerator includes a $100 advertising credit on the TikTok platform. So we want to help you learn what to do and then help you actually put it into play.- Marianne, given the conversations that you've had with so many small business owners, give us a sense of the biggest challenges that they are facing. Because we talk about it all the time. The economy is slowing. We also have a labor shortage we know a number of businesses have also faced issues with supply chain. And most recently, that continues today.MARIANNE RAUSCH: Yes. I think you're really hitting on, honestly, the core issues there. I would say that they're feeling the forces of inflation. They continue to feel supply chain shortages, which we know are leading consumers to shop earlier this year for the holiday season. So I think some of the things that we're encouraging small business owners to do or to think about making sure that they're putting their holiday marketing out there even earlier and making sure that it's going to be getting to consumers at the time when they're making those maybe more limited holiday purchases this year.- And so, Marianne, what is your expectation for this holiday spending that you might see for consumers?MARIANNE RAUSCH: So I think that we do feel that it will continue to be a strong season. I don't have a crystal ball, unfortunately. I think wallets will be tighter. But I think people are going to continue to get out and support small businesses. And we are continuing to remind consumers that even though they're being more careful about where they spend their money, to keep in mind that every time you spend $1 at a local small business, $0.68 of that dollar stays in the community. So just to be mindful of when you have to make decisions about where to put that money, putting it into a small business can have returns for your entire community.- It certainly does. All right. Marianne Rausch, great to have you. Thanks so much.]"

It’s also 8% below its Aug. high. Yet the unweighted S&amp;P 500 index is doing much better, down only 11% this year and just 4.5% off its Aug. high. The outperformance of the unweighted S&amp;P 500 indicates that investors should buy names aside from the big tech stocks that get the biggest weight in the regular S&amp;P 500 index. A good way to accomplish the latter goal is by finding some of the best value stocks to buyThe names featured in this column have low valuations, high profits, and strong growth. Moreover. they are likely to keep delivering high profits and exceptional growth for many years to come. As a result, sooner rather than later, these value stocks to buy are going to rally a great deal.FFord Motor$14.32TSCOTractor Supply$216.18MRKMerck$99.65DGDollar General$257.60PWRQuanta Services$144.82CFCF Industries$105.70MSIMotorola$250.36Value Stocks to Buy: Ford Motor (F)Ford dealership sign against a blue sky.Source: D K Grove / Shutterstock.comFord Motor’s (NYSE:F) auto sales have been weighed down by supply-chain issues that are starting to become less intense and should continue to do so over time. Nonetheless, the automaker reported strong third-quarter results, is generating solid profits and growth and has become a leader in the rapidly expanding U.S. electric-vehicle market. Moreover, F stock should be boosted meaningfully by the increased tax credits for consumer and commercial EVs that were passed by the U.S. Congress earlier this year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFor all of 2022, Ford expects its EBIT, excluding certain items, to climb 15% to roughly $11.5 billion, and it anticipates that its adjusted free cash flow will come in at $9.5 billion to $10.5 billion. Moreover, the automaker can take advantage of the connected-car revolution by selling monthly subscriptions to many services, such as battery monitoring and security offerings.Story continuesDespite all of Ford’s positive attributes, the forward price-earnings ratio of F stock is a measly 7.8.Value Stocks to Buy: Tractor Supply (TSCO)IDEX stock: An electric tractor sits in a field on a sunny day with a wind turbine in the background.Source: Matthew Troke / Shutterstock.comTractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO) sells products that cater to rural Americans, including farmers. Among its offerings are products for horses, cattle, and pets, “maintenance products” for farm machinery, and other tools used by farmers. With American farmers benefiting from high food prices and elevated demand for food around the world due to the Russia-Ukraine war, Tractor Supply, unsurprisingly, has been reporting very strong financial results.Last quarter, for example, its top line climbed 8.3% year-over-year to $3.27 billion, it reported earnings per share of $2.10, and its comparable store sales surged 5.7% YOY.As of the end of Q3, there were over 27 million households in TSCO’s “neighbor’s club,” which seems to be similar to Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Prime program and Costco’s (NASDAQ:COST) membership program. Tractor Supply’s club, whose members generate about 75% of the company’s revenue, gives TSCO a large, loyal customer base. The company can easily and inexpensively market its new products to these consumers, leaving it well-positioned to continue to deliver strong sales growth.Value Stocks to Buy: Merck (MRK)Brown glass pill bottle on its side showing white pills inside, with other pill bottles behind it representing MACK stock.Source: shutterstock.com/ChampheiIn past columns, I’ve outlined the tremendous amount of revenue that Merck’s (NYSE:MRK) versatile cancer treatment, Keytruda, is generating for the giant drug maker.Keytruda was the biggest factor behind Merck’s strong third-quarter results, as the drug’s sales climbed 20% year-over-year to $5.3 billion. Merck’s overall top line increased an impressive 14% YOY to $15 billion. Moreover, the giant expects its 2022 earnings per share to come in at an impressive $7.32-$7.37, meaning that its price-earnings ratio, based on its 2022 EPS guidance, is a rather low 13.6. (100/$7.35)Also contributing to Merck’s strong Q3 results and its solid 2022 guidance are its “Human Papillomavirus vaccines.” Last quarter, the revenue generated by those shots climbed 15% YOY to $2.3 billion.Citing the strong sales of Merck’s key drugs, Cantor Fitzgerald on Oct. 28 raised its price target on the shares to $120 from $107 and said that the company’s strong outlook is “underappreciated” by the Street. Cantor maintained an “overweight” rating on the name.Dollar General (DG)Source: ShutterstockI’ve hypothesized that dollar stores will get a big boost as inflation squeezes working-class and poor Americans. Agreeing with that idea last month was research firm Placer.ai. In the words of Seeking Alpha, Placer.ai believes that “increasing pressure on middle and low-income consumers is promoting a trade-down to discount stores.” The firm added that “Dollar stores are seeing lower-income consumers trade down from traditional superstores such as Walmart.”  Dollar General (NYSE:DG) has benefited from that trend in the past and is likely to continue to do so in the future. In the second quarter, its top line increased 9% year-over-year to $9.43 billion, while its same-store sales rose 4.6% YOY and its Q2 earnings per share came in at $2.98. The retailer also increased its full-year sales growth guidance to 11% from 10%-10.5%, and it expected its earnings per share to rise 12%-14% in fiscal 2022. Despite its strong, positive catalysts, DG stock has a reasonable forward price-earnings ratio of 19.5.Quanta Services (PWR)electricity pylons and lines at duskSource: snvv18870020330 / Shutterstock.comAs I noted in a previous column, published on Sept. 29, Quanta (NYSE:PWR) “develops, repairs and maintains electric grids globally and renewable energy systems. It also carries out engineering projects for companies involved in the production of natural gas and oil prices.”I predicted that the company and PWR stock would get a lift from the electric-vehicle revolution, along with increased exploration for oil and gas amid high prices for those commodities. Quanta’s third-quarter results, reported on Nov 3, indicated that the company is indeed benefiting from those trends. Specifically, its sales jumped by a huge 33% year-over-year to $4.46 billion, while it generated $343 million of cash flow from operations. For all of 2022, the company expects its earnings per share to come in at $6.15-$6.39, excluding certain items, and its backlog at the end of Q3 stood at a very high $20.9 billion, which represented an all-time record for it.“Demand for our services continues to be driven by broad-based business strength from utility grid modernization and system hardening initiatives, as well as our reputation for solid and safe execution,” Quanta CEO Duke Austin, reported on the company’s Q3 earnings conference call. Given Quanta’s rapid growth and strong outlook, its forward price-earnings ratio of 20.3 is quite attractive.CF Industries (CF)A tractor spreading fertilizer over a farm field.Source: Fotokostic / Shutterstock.comLike Tractor Supply, CF Industries (NYSE:CF) is a fertilizer maker and is benefiting from high food prices brought about partly by the Russia-Ukraine War. Additionally, since Russia and Ukraine are both major exporters of fertilizer, the conflict has caused fertilizer prices to soar, benefiting CF and its peers.Last quarter, CF’s top line soared an incredible 70% year-over-year to $2.3 billion, while its EBITDA came in at an impressive $826 million. The fertilizer maker noted that geopolitical issues had increased the average selling prices of its products last quarter. Moreover, CF reported that it expects the supply-demand dynamics of one of its key offerings, nitrogen, to stay favorable “into 2025,” Seeking Alpha noted.“We expect to continue generating substantial free cash flow, which will enable us to invest prudently in high-return growth projects while at the same time returning significant capital to shareholders,” CF CEO Tony Will reported on the company’s Q3 earnings call.Despite its powerful growth and strong outlook, the forward price-earnings ratio of CF stock currently stands at 7.01.Motorola Solutions (MSI)communication technology for internet business. global world network and telecommunication on earthSource: greenbutterfly / Shutterstock.comMotorola Solutions (NYSE:MSI) appears to be benefiting from an important trend in the U.S.  that’s not discussed much in most media outlets: the huge crime wave that’s afflicting many American cities.Due to reforms in the criminal justice system, many more criminals are walking the streets than in prior years in multiple, major cities. That could explain why the demand for the company’s video-security products has surged. In the second quarter, for example, the revenue generated by its “Video security and access control” systems climbed 21% year over year, while its backlog soared 19% year over year to a “record $13.4 billion.”Last quarter, Motorola Solutions reported that ” increased demand for video security and land mobile radio technologies” helped boost its “Products and Systems Integration” sales by 15% year over year to a record level. For all of 2022, the company expects its sales to increase by 9.25%-9.5%, and it expects its earnings per share to come in at $10.17-$10.22.Analysts, on average, expect its 2023 EPS to come in at $11.19. That puts its forward price-earnings ratio at 22.4 (251/11.19), which is attractive given its strong growth and highly certain, strong outlook. Additionally, the shares have a dividend yield of 1.27%.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

276,13e59fed-acfb-310e-8b6c-0f25a38afaa7,OXY,2022-11-19,Phillips 66 and Hertz Global have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/phillips-66-hertz-global-highlighted-145402406.html,1668783242,STORY,"['PSX', 'HTZ', 'OXY', 'HES']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – November 18, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares Phillips 66 PSX as the Bull of the Day and Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. HTZ as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Occidental Petroleum OXY, Hess Corporation HES and Marathon Oil MRO.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Phillips 66 is an oil and gas firm that topped our quarterly estimates in early November and boosted its guidance once again for 2022, and more importantly, for fiscal 2023.Phillips 66 shares have soared in 2022, yet its improved earnings outlook has kept its valuation levels very appealing. Plus, its strong dividend yield is much-needed as investors attempt to find ways to keep pace with inflation. And it said earlier this month that it will return an additional $10 billion to $12 billion to shareholders between mid-year 2022 and the end of 2024.Phillips 66 BasicsPhillips 66’s diversified energy portfolio includes midstream operations, which generally features the transport and storage of crude oil before it is refined and processed. The company also runs a refining segment that turns crude into everything from fuels for transpiration to lubricants and specialty products such as petroleum coke, solvents, and other products.On top of its chemicals, refining, and specialties segment, Phillips 66 runs a successful marketing segment. The company operates Phillips 66 branded gas stations and service stations around the U.S. and beyond. Phillips 66 is also making sure it’s prepared for the expansion and likely transition to alternative fuels and energy in the coming decades and beyond.Phillips 66’s emerging energy efforts include renewable fuels, batteries, carbon capture, and hydrogen. For instance, the company said recently that it’s converting its San Francisco refinery in Rodeo, California into “one of the world’s largest renewable fuels facilities,” with the project set to begin commercial operations in Q1 of 2024.Story continuesRecent Growth and OutlookPhillips 66 and others benefited immensely from rising oil and energy prices amid the huge rebound in demand as the U.S. and economies around the globe soared back to life after the covid crash. Travel, including air, has already mounted a serious comeback and broader energy demand is returning to pre-covid levels. Plus, the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine continues to negatively impact oil and gas supplies.Even though oil prices have come back down from their peaks of over $100 a barrel, they have hovered between roughly $80 and $90 a barrel for the last few months. Phillips 66’s revenue skyrocketed 74% last year, with its adjusted earnings up from a loss of -$0.89 per share to +$5.70 a share.Phillips 66 has topped our quarterly estimates by an average of 28% in the trailing four quarters, including a 30% third quarter beat on November 1. Management was able to raise their guidance once again for FY22 and fiscal 2023, which is no easy task amid the current environment that’s seen the wider S&amp;P 500 earnings picture fade.PSX’s four quarter and first quarter FY23 consensus estimates are now up 41% and 49%, respectively over the past 60 days. Phillips 66’s FY22 and FY23 EPS estimates have climbed by 28% and 30%, respectively during this same stretch. Zacks estimates call for its 2022 revenue to soar 47% to $169.32 billion to help boost its adjusted earnings by roughly 270% from under $6 a share all the way to $21.00 per share.Phillips 66 is currently projected to see its revenue and earnings decline on a YoY basis in 2023 as they come up against nearly impossible to compete against periods. But there is no guarantee that those estimates don’t continue to improve as they have over the last several months.Other FundamentalsThe so-called lost decade for oil and gas companies forced everyone in the industry to reevaluate every aspect of their business, slimming down operations to run more efficiently than ever. The cost-cutting measures are now paying off in a huge way amid rebounding oil and energy prices. The trimmed down operations will also help Phillips 66 and others keep margins relatively high going forward.Phillips 66 generated $3.1 billion in cash from operations in the third quarter. This helped the company return $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases last quarter. Better yet, PSX announced during its investor day on November 9 that it plans to return an additional $10 billion to $12 billion to shareholders between mid-year 2022 and the end of 2024 via buybacks and dividends.Additionally, Phillips 66 said it will start to roll out sustainable cost reductions of $1 billion through business transformations. With this in mind, Phillips 66’s 3.6% dividend yield blows away its industry’s 2% average, as well as oil and energy titan Exxon Mobil’s (XOM) 3.2%. The company also has a very sustainable 22% dividend payout ratio.Price and ValuationPSX shares have climbed 77% in the past two years to lag behind its highly-ranked industry’s 95% but blow away the S&amp;P 500’s 10% gain. More recently, Phillips 66 shares are up 10% in the last six months to hit new 52-week highs on November 14. And its current Zacks consensus price target offers 12% upside to the roughly $108 a share it trades at right now.On the valuation front, PSX trades at 7.2X forward 12-month earnings. This represents a 30% discount to its own 12-month median. Looking back further, the nearby chart showcases that Phillips 66 trades at a 35% discount to its own decade-long median and roughly in line with the Zacks Oil and Energy sector. And PSX trades not too far above its lows of 5.9X during this stretch.Bottom LinePhillips 66’s Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry ranks in the top 7% of over 250 Zacks industries. PSX also sports “A” grades for Value, Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system. Its commitment to boosting its dividend should help investors as they try to fight back against ongoing inflation. And investors looking for value during the current market and economic conditions would do well to consider Phillips 66 or other oil stocks.Phillips 66’s positive upward earnings revisions help it grab a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now. Plus, the broader oil and gas sector will likely remain a major backbone of economies around the world for decades to come. And let’s remember that Phillips 66 is already preparing for an alternative fuel and energy future.Bear of the Day:Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. is a rental car company that reemerged on the public markets after it filed for bankruptcy early in the pandemic. Hertz shares have gone on a wild, volatile ride in 2022 and are currently down 32%. And now Hertz’s earnings outlook is trending in the wrong direction.The BasicsHertz Global operates its namesake Hertz rental car company, as well as Dollar and Thrifty vehicle rental brands throughout North America, Europe, the Caribbean, Latin America, and beyond. The company is back on the public markets after it filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy relatively early in the pandemic in May 2020.The company’s CFO Kenny Cheung, who took over in September 2020, spoke to the Wall Street Journal earlier this month about how Hertz has been able to change. “The restructuring process we went through during chapter 11 had several long-term benefits for the business,” Cheung told the Wall Street Journal.“We made structural improvements to the business. This began with our contract mix where we walked away from unprofitable contracts. Then we looked at our segment mix and relocated cars away from unprofitable sectors and into more profitable ones such as the leisure traveler.”Near Term SetbacksHertz has benefitted from a major resurgence in travel. The company had also been the beneficiary of higher used car prices. HTZ and other rental car companies typically sell their vehicles when they reach a certain mileage or age. Those revenues are fading as used car prices start to normalize. Hertz said on its earnings call in late October that “residuals on used cars declined precipitously as Q3 progressed.”The company was still able to post solid results and it beat our bottom-line estimate for the fourth quarter in a row. And Zacks estimates call for its 2022 revenue to surge 19% to $8.73 billion as the travel market’s resurgence remains in full force. Hertz’s sales are then projected to climb another 4% higher in 2023.But the firm provided rather downbeat earnings guidance. Hertz’s Zacks consensus earnings estimate for FY22 is down 14% in the last 60 days, with FY23’s outlook 17% lower. With this in mind, its adjusted earnings are projected to fall 15% YoY to $3.71 per share and then slide 35% lower in FY23 to $2.42 per share.Bottom LineHertz’s downward earnings revisions help it land a Zack Rank #5 (Strong Sell) right now. And its Transportation – Services industry lands in the bottom 33% of over 250 Zacks industries. Plus, Hertz stock is down 32% in 2022 and it’s been on a rather volatile ride since it began trading again.Therefore, investors might want to find other opportunities to invest in the travel or transportation industries.Additional content:EIA Oil Supply Headlines: Crude Stocks Down, Fuel UpU.S. oil prices moved down on Nov 16 after government data showed a weekly build in gasoline and distillate supplies. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude futures settled at $85.59 a barrel yesterday — the lowest since Oct 25.Before going into the overall macro environment for oil, let's dig deep into the Energy Information Administration’s (""EIA"") Weekly Petroleum Status Report for the week ending Nov 11.Analyzing the Latest EIA ReportCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell 5.4 million barrels compared to expectations of a 400,000-barrel decrease per the analysts surveyed by S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights. The combination of a surge in exports, lower imports and higher refinery demand accounted for the big stockpile draw with the world’s biggest oil consumer.Total domestic stocks now stand at 435.4 million barrels — 0.6% more than the year-ago figure but 4% lower than the five-year average.The latest report also showed that supplies at the Cushing terminal (the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange) fell 1.6 million barrels to 25.6 million barrels.Meanwhile, the crude supply cover decreased from 28 days in the previous week to 27.4 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 28.5 days.Let’s turn to the products now.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies increased for the first time in five weeks. The 2.2 million-barrel rise was primarily attributable to a pullback in demand. Analysts had forecast that gasoline inventories would fall 800,000 barrels. At 207.9 million barrels, the current stock of the most widely used petroleum product is 1.9% less than the year-earlier level and 5% below the five-year average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) increased after dropping last week. The 1.1 million-barrel gain reflected a fall in demand. Meanwhile, the market looked for a supply draw of some 500,000 barrels. Despite last week’s build, current inventories — at 107.4 million barrels — are 13.2% below the year-ago level and 15% lower than the five-year average.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization, at 92.9%, rose 0.8% from the prior week.Final WordEven as fears revolving around high inflation and slowing growth somewhat cloud the outlook for Oil/Energy, it has remained the best S&amp;P 500 sector this year. The space has generated a total return of more than 66% in 2022 against the S&amp;P 500’s loss of around 17%. Apart from a positive fundamental picture, the sector is enjoying support from geopolitical uncertainty amid Russia’s military operations in Ukraine. In March, crude prices surged to multi-year highs of $130 on concerns about supplies from Russia, which is one of the world's largest producers of the commodity.Oil has pulled back from those lofty levels, with the conflict showing no sign of a quick resolution, the risk of dwindling inventory and the influential oil exporters’ group OPEC agreeing on a production curtailment means that the commodity has got enough reasons to stay elevated in the near-to-medium term.Consequently, three of the top four gainers of the S&amp;P 500 this year are all energy-related names: Occidental Petroleum, Hess Corporation and Marathon Oil.Occidental Petroleum: OXY is the top-performing S&amp;P 500 stock in 2022, with a gain of 148%. Occidental Petroleum beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 12.7%, on average.OXY has a projected earnings growth rate of 289.4% for this year. Occidental Petroleum is valued at around $68 billion.Hess Corp.: Hess shares have appreciated 98% so far in 2022. HES has a projected earnings growth rate of 231.1% for this year.Hess, with a market capitalization of $46 billion, enjoys a Zacks Growth Style Score of A. HES beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters, the average being 8.1%.Marathon Oil: This stock is among the best performers on the S&amp;P 500 Index, with shares having appreciated 92% in 2022. MRO, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has a projected earnings growth rate of 190.5% for this year.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Marathon Oil beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters.

The oil and gas exploration and production industry has become one of the most important industries in the world as the Russian invasion of Ukraine spurs investment in fossil fuel production.

This segment involves the use of heavy duty rigs to extract fossil fuels from sub sea and ocean levels. The research firm estimates that the industry was worth $7.4 billion in 2021 and it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.4% between then and 2032. The market is divided into several segments, such as deepwater and ultra deepwater, and by subsystem types. Companies are increasingly relying on the use of automated systems for their drilling operations, and are using technologies such as computer controlled drilling and robots to aid them in their daily operations.Speaking of technology, the exploration and production software market was worth $4.5 billion in 2020 and from then to 2027 it will grow at a CAGR of 14.5% to sit at $11.5 billion by the end of 2027 according to Research and Markets.

Over the past few years, Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)-or the priorities a company shares publicly for how it operates its business and cares for the world around it-has increasingly become an area of focus for Boston Scientific.To that end, the company recently appointed Kathryn Unger to the newly created role of vice president of ESG.And while this is her first ESG-related job, it's one that she's personally passionate about and for which Unger is uniquely qualified: From her first job as a high school teacher to a more recent role leading a large, highly regulated business, she's a seasoned executive with deep, diverse experiences to draw from.We sat down with her to find out more about how she defines ESG, how Boston Scientific is leading its peers when it comes to its environmental goals and why this work is so crucial for the sake of the planet as well as the patients, customers and employees Boston Scientific serves.Q: You've held several leadership positions in your career, but this is your first position in ESG. How has your previous work experience prepared you for this role?A: I feel incredibly fortunate that I've worn a number of hats.Teaching was the best first challenge I could have ever had. If you can give five presentations a day to a highly hostile high school audience, you can do just about anything. You have to care about the next generation to do that job, and that's part of ESG.At Cummins Inc., where I led the Rail and Defense engine business, I learned what it means to be a global company, how to manage product development and life cycles and how to grow customers and sales.And at Cargill, I worked with supply chain and sales and production, and as a vice president in government relations. So I really have an awareness of all the pieces of ESG that I wouldn't have if it weren't for all those experiences.Story continuesQ: ESG has become a bit of a corporate buzzword. What does it mean to you, personally?A: My husband and I are very passionate about helping to take care of the environment and the planet on which we live for the sake of generations to come. In fact, we had an organic farm in North Carolina where we used very sustainable growing practices, just because we felt that was important.As a Black woman and someone who believes in building and nurturing the communities in which we work and live, I'm on the board of Urban Ventures, which is a not-for-profit that is working to stop the cycle of generational poverty. It's a very personal commitment to me.Q: What progress has Boston Scientific made when it comes to ESG?A: Boston Scientific has made strong progress against its ESG goals. For example, just before I joined the company, Boston Scientific committed to setting science-based environmental and sustainability targets and had them validated by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi). We're one of the first companies in the Healthcare Equipment and Supplies sector to have our net-zero, science-based targets approved under the SBTi Net-Zero Standard, which is really amazing.Basically, this means our near and long-term targets for reduction of greenhouse gas and carbon emissions are scientifically backed and aligned with the latest climate science, setting us on a path toward net-zero carbon emissions across our entire value chain by 2050.But there is so much more work to do together with our external partners and suppliers to continue to achieve these targets and advance our collective efforts to contribute to a healthier planet. Regulations are increasing and evolving. Customer expectations are evolving. Science is constantly evolving and changing the things that we can accomplish for our customers and our patients.As all of these things change, the goal posts also change. At Boston Scientific, we are just always trying to be ever better. I think we must always look at ESG through that lens.Learn more about how Boston Scientific is advancing science for life through our ESG strategy.View original content hereBoston Scientific, Friday, November 18, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Boston Scientific on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Boston ScientificWebsite: https://www.bostonscientific.com/en-US/Home.htmlEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Boston ScientificView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/726977/What-Does-ESG-Mean-at-Boston-Scientific-Ask-Its-Newest-VP-Kathryn-Unger]"

The company's shares saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Norfolk Southern’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Norfolk Southern Is Norfolk Southern Still Cheap?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 8.71% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Norfolk Southern today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $226.98, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Norfolk Southern’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of Norfolk Southern look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Norfolk Southern's earnings growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years, indicating a solid future ahead. This should lead to robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in NSC’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on NSC, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you want to dive deeper into Norfolk Southern, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

(NASDAQ: AAPL), which has sold 1.3 billion iPhones since 2007 and reported a $19.4 billion profit last quarter?Or Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), which went from selling just 937 cars in 2009 to over 300,000 last year?Some savvy income investors might consider Altria Group Inc. (NYSE: MO). The tobacco giant, formerly Phillip Morris International Inc., has grown its dividends by 631% since 2002. That streak of dividend hikes is possible when you sell an addictive product to hundreds of millions of people.But there’s one little-known company that left these household names in the dust.The Unknown Stock That Beat Every Wall Street DarlingMonster Beverage Corp. (NASDAQ: MNST) is a company no one ever described as changing the world. It’s not putting an iPhone into every third human’s hand or solving climate change.Yet this energy drink company returned 87,560% from 2000 to 2020 — enough to turn every $1 invested into $876.Why was Monster Beverage able to dramatically outperform these world-changing companies?Part of the reason comes from its size — Monster Beverage recorded $92 million in revenue in 2002 while Apple reported $5.7 billion. A smaller company can grow revenue — and ultimately its earnings and share price — much faster than a company that’s already a behemoth.But there’s bigger factor at play. Apple spent $446 million on research and development in 2002 to stay ahead of its competitors and maintain its existing operations. By 2022, its annual operating costs had reached $274 billion.To keep the lights on, Apple had to spend $274 billion or the company could no longer make and sell products. By contrast, Monster Beverage spent just $4.6 billion on operating costs in 2022.It turns out that an energy-drink business is a lot less capital-intensive than a tech business — and this difference, compounded over the years, means that Monster Beverage had hundreds of billions of dollars more to plow into growing its business by expanding operations and claiming greater market share.Story continuesA similar dynamic benefitted Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO). If you’ve ever wondered why the ticker symbol is KO rather than CO or CC, it’s because Wall Street settled on an acronym for “knock out.” The sentiment was that investing in Coca-Cola was a slam dunk because the invaluable brand name commanded loyalty from hundreds of millions around the world. How could investors go wrong?Sure enough, $100 invested in Coca-Cola at the time of its 1919 initial public offering (IPO) would have turned into $1.25 million a century later. A lot of factors are behind that performance, but it’s not a coincidence that Coca-Cola had to pay just $24 billion in operating costs in 2020, or less that 10% of what Apple paid.Benzinga has a lot to say on the battles between tech giants to capture hundreds of billions of dollars in market share of revolutionary trends like blockchain technology, 5G and clean energy. But as stocks like Monster Beverage show, slow and steady can sometimes win the race.Benzinga is tracking one company with striking parallels to Monster Beverage. It also has a product designed to improve energy levels and performance. It’s already profitable, but with just $17 million in sales since 2012, is even smaller than Monster Beverage was at the turn of the century.Don't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.48%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.59%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.15%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the maker of TurboTax, QuickBooks and other accounting software had lost 4.8% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 6.82% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.49% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Intuit as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be November 29, 2022. On that day, Intuit is projected to report earnings of $1.17 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 23.53%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $2.5 billion, up 24.42% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $13.70 per share and revenue of $14.51 billion. These totals would mark changes of +15.61% and +14%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Intuit. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.05% lower. Intuit is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Story continuesInvestors should also note Intuit's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 27.89. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 25.24, so we one might conclude that Intuit is trading at a premium comparatively.Also, we should mention that INTU has a PEG ratio of 1.77. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Computer - Software was holding an average PEG ratio of 2.1 at yesterday's closing price.The Computer - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 122, which puts it in the top 49% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

The company remains well positioned to capitalize on demand for the home improvement market, backed by investments in technology, merchandise category and strength in Pro business.Lowe’s posted sturdy quarterly results wherein the bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and grew year over year. Earnings performance benefited from strong operating margin, stemming from gains from the Total Home strategy and the execution of the Perpetual Productivity Improvement initiative. Focus on driving productivity boosted margins.The Total Home strategy is resonating well with Pro and DIY customers for a while. Management is committed to enhancing the Pro offerings, expanding the company’s market share and driving its operating margin.(You can read the full research report on Lowe’s here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Gilead Sciences have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the past year (+21.7% vs. -24.0%). The company’s results are driven by continued demand for its HIV portfolio with further share growth for flagship therapy Biktarvy and oncology revenues driven by cell therapy and Trodelvy. Though sales of COVID-19 treatment, Veklury (remdesivir) declined, but came in better than expected.The approval of new treatments like Sunlenca will strengthen the HIV franchise. The company is also looking to solidify its oncology franchise through internal pipeline development and strategic collaborations. The acquisition of Immunomedics added the breast cancer drug Trodelvy to its portfolio.However, the loss of Atripla and Truvada’s exclusivity is affecting sales. Although the CAR-T cell therapy franchise is gaining traction, it has a long way to go.(You can read the full research report on Gilead Sciences here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Intuitive Surgical's shares have declined -25.2% over the past year against the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry’s decline of -29.4%. The company is facing macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds might significantly hurt small businesses operations, thereby posing risks for Intuit’s top-line growth. Additionally, higher costs and expenses due to increased investments in marketing and engineering teams are likely to continue impacting bottom-line results in the near term.However, Intuit is benefiting from strong momentum in online ecosystem revenues and solid professional tax revenues. The TurboTax Live offering is also driving growth in the Consumer tax business. Solid momentum in the company’s lending product, QuickBooks Capital, remains a positive.Moreover, the company’s strategy of shifting its business to cloud-based subscription model will help generate stable revenues over the long run. We expect Intuit’s revenues to grow at a CAGR of 13.2% through fiscal 2023-2025.(You can read the full research report on Intuitive Surgical here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

This is shown in the chart below.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesVisaVisa is a payments technology company that provides transaction processing services (primarily authorization, clearing, and settlement) to financial institutions and merchant clients.Visa reported free cash flow of $5.6 billion in its latest quarter, penciling in an 11% sequential uptick and a solid 48% Y/Y change.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company’s annual dividend currently yields 0.8%, a few ticks below its Zacks Business Services sector average of roughly 1%.While the yield may be lower than its sector’s average, Visa’s 15% five-year annualized dividend growth rate helps to pick up the slack in a big way.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor the cherry on top, V has consistently impressed with its quarterly results, exceeding earnings and revenue expectations in 11 consecutive quarters.In its latest release, V exceeded earnings expectations by 3.8% and revenue estimates by 3.1%. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUnitedHealth UnitedHealth provides a wide range of healthcare products and services, including health maintenance organizations (HMOs), point of service plans (POS), preferred provider organizations (PPOs), and managed fee-for-service programs.Over the last several months, analysts have been bullish in their earnings outlook regarding UNH’s current and next fiscal year, helping land the stock into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn its latest print, UNH’s free cash flow was reported at a sizable $17.8 billion, reflecting a massive 180% sequential uptick and a 150% Y/Y increase.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUnitedHealth’s current annual dividend yield of 1.3% is below its Zacks Medical sector average.

(NYSE:EL) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 15th of December to $0.66. This takes the annual payment to 1.1% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry. See our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies Estée Lauder Companies' Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsSolid dividend yields are great, but they only really help us if the payment is sustainable. Before making this announcement, Estée Lauder Companies was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 44.3%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 31%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityAlthough the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. Since 2012, the dividend has gone from $0.525 total annually to $2.64. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 18% over that duration. Dividends have grown rapidly over this time, but with cuts in the past we are not certain that this stock will be a reliable source of income in the future.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share is growing, which could point to a growing dividend in the future. Estée Lauder Companies has impressed us by growing EPS at 10% per year over the past five years. Estée Lauder Companies definitely has the potential to grow its dividend in the future with earnings on an uptrend and a low payout ratio.Estée Lauder Companies Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

Shares have added about 10.9% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is P&amp;G due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Procter &amp; Gamble Beats Q1 Earnings &amp; Sales EstimatesProcter &amp; Gamble reported better-than-expected top and bottom lines in first-quarter fiscal 2023. Sales improved year over year, while earnings declined. Top-line growth was driven by robust pricing and a favorable mix, along with strength across segments. Improved productivity amid cost headwinds has also aided the results.Q1 in DetailProcter &amp; Gamble’s core earnings of $1.57 per share declined 2% from $1.61 in the year-ago quarter. This can be attributable to the lower operating margin, offset by higher sales and lower outstanding shares. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.55 and came in line with our estimate of $1.57. Currency-neutral net EPS rose 7% year over year.The company reported net sales of $20,612 million, increasing 1% year over year and surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20,455 million and our estimate of $20,451.5 million. Sales growth was attributed to strength across all segments, except for Grooming and Beauty, as well as robust pricing and a favorable mix. Currency impacted net sales by 6%.On an organic basis (excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange), revenues improved 7%, backed by a 9% rise in pricing and a 1% gain from the positive product mix, offset by a 3% decline in volume.Net sales for the Health Care segment increased 3%, while sales for the Fabric &amp; Home Care, and Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care segments increased 1% each. Meanwhile, sales for the Beauty segment declined 4% and the Grooming segment was flat year over year. All of the company’s business segments have reported growth in organic sales. Organic sales rose 4% for Beauty, 5% for Grooming, 8% each for Fabric &amp; Home Care, and Health Care segments, and 6% for the Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care segment.Story continuesMarginsIn the reported quarter, the gross margin contracted 160 basis points (bps) to 47.4%. Favorable currency rates aided the gross margin by 0.3%. The currency-neutral gross margin declined 130 bps to 47.7%. The decline in the gross margin was mainly due to a 510-bps commodity and input material cost inflation, a 40-bps increase in freight costs, a 130-bps negative product mix and other impacts, and 30 bps from product and packaging investments. This was partly negated by 470 bps of pricing gains and 100 bps of gross productivity savings.Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&amp;A), as a percentage of sales, declined 90 bps from the year-ago quarter to 23.4%. Currency aided the SG&amp;A expense rate by 0.5%. SG&amp;A expenses declined 140 bps to 22.9% on a currency-neutral basis, owing to 170 bps of leverage benefits due to higher sales, and 120 bps of productivity savings from overhead and marketing efficiencies, offset by 100 bps of overhead investments and 50 bps of other impacts.The operating margin declined 70 bps from the prior year to 24%. Currency rates aided the operating margin by 0.8%. On a currency-neutral basis, the operating margin expanded 10 bps to 24.8%. The operating margin included gross productivity savings of 230 bps.FinancialsProcter &amp; Gamble ended first-quarter fiscal 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $6,710 million, long-term debt of $21,286 million, and total shareholders’ equity of $44,334 million.The company generated an operating cash flow of $4,070 million in first-quarter fiscal 2023 and an adjusted free cash flow of $3,405 million. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 86% in the fiscal first quarter.It returned $6.3 billion of value to its shareholders in the fiscal first quarter. This included $2.3 billion of dividend payouts and $4 billion of share buybacks.Fiscal 2023 GuidanceManagement lowered its all-in sales view for fiscal 2023, while retaining its organic sales expectations. The company anticipates all-in sales between down 3% and down 1% year over year for fiscal 2023 compared with flat to up 2% sales growth stated earlier. Organic sales are likely to increase 3-5% in fiscal 2023. Currency movements are expected to negatively impact all-in sales growth by 6% versus the 3% impact mentioned earlier.The company also retained its view for fiscal 2023 EPS. It expects reported EPS to be flat to up 4% from $5.81 recorded in fiscal 2022. However, the company expects EPS at the low end of the prior mentioned range due to the increased currency impacts.The current earnings view considers after-tax impacts of $1.3 billion related to unfavorable currency movements, $2.4 billion of impacts of higher commodity and material costs, and $200 million from higher freight costs. This equates to a $3.9-billion after-tax impact on net income, implying a $1.57-per-share on EPS or a 23-percentage-point impact on EPS growth. The revised $3.9-billion headwinds marks a $600-million increase from the company’s prior view of $3.3 billion.Procter &amp; Gamble projects a core effective tax rate of 19.5% for fiscal 2023. It expects capital expenditure to be 5% of net sales in fiscal 2023.Adjusted free cash flow productivity is estimated to be 90% for fiscal 2023. The company intends to make dividend payments of more than $9 billion, along with share repurchases of $6-$8 billion in fiscal 2023.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month.VGM ScoresCurrently, P&amp;G has a nice Growth Score of B, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with an A. However, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise P&amp;G has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to read about some more dividend stocks, go directly to 5 Best Stocks to Increase Your Dividend Income. Investors have long discussed whether a healthy business that pays a reliable dividend payout will also generate the highest capital returns over the long term. Value investors generally concur with this point of view while growth investors argue in favor of the opposite. According to a study of dividend paying stocks published by Hartford Funds, companies that grew or initiated a dividend have experienced the highest returns relative to other stocks since 1973. They have also experienced significantly less volatility. Companies that pay dividends usually return the profit they have made to shareholders while those that do not pay dividends reinvest that profit for growth in the business. Stocks like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) usually lie in the latter category. Even though these firms have been popular on Wall Street in the past few years, the Hartford Study claims that 84% of the total return of the S&amp;P 500 Index since 1960 can be attributed to reinvested dividends. A Brief History of Dividend Versus Growth StocksThe study has outlined how dividend players performed over each decade going back to before the Great War. In the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, the dividend payouts of companies played a large role in their total returns. The average total return through these decades was around 10%. However, as the average total returns jumped from the 1960s onwards, the role of dividends started to diminish. During the 1990s, dividends were largely marginalized as companies preferred growth rather than focusing on returns to shareholders. However, at the turn of the millennium, the dotcom bubble burst, forcing investors away from growth firms towards reliable dividend players. The benchmark index posted negative returns in the first decades of the new millennium. Per the study, between 1960 and 2021, the median dividend yield for the market was around 2.90%. The yield peaked in the 1980s and bottomed in the 2000s. After the 2010s, growth stocks once again became popular as the social media and ecommerce age dawned. Story continuesAs inflation climbs and the Fed prepares a further rise in interest rates, investors at the stock market have once again shifted their focus towards dividend stocks to weather the upcoming storm. Our MethodologyThe companies that have a solid track record of dividend payouts were selected for the list. The business fundamentals and analyst ratings of these firms are also discussed to provide further context. Hedge fund sentiment was included as a classifier as well. Data from around 920 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey was used to quantify the hedge fund sentiment around each stock. 10 Best Stocks to Make $500 Per Month in Dividends10.

Through the alliance, the airlines coordinate flights and pool revenue to the detriment of travelers, said the department, arguing consumers face nearly $700 million in extra annual costs.U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin in Boston plans to hold another hearing before he issues a decision in the case.Justice Department lawyer Bill Jones argued the alliance gives the airlines incentives to raise prices and that they are no longer competing.""This is a bad deal for travelers,"" Jones said, saying it was important because of the impact on families that travel and who want affordable tickets and good service.Jones added the government wants to ensure as much competition as possible in the airline sector ""and this deal threatens to do exactly the opposite.""Lawyers for JetBlue and American argued the alliance, which was announced in 2020, has not raised air fares or resulted in flight cuts.

With this approval, the Monterey Peninsula is a critical step closer to finally solving the region’s decades-long water supply crisis.""With the Commission’s vote and approval, we have received the major regulatory milestone needed to finally solve the long-standing water supply needs of the Monterey Peninsula,"" said Kevin Tilden, president of California American Water. ""This is a significant victory for the Carmel River, and will support desperately needed new housing, economic development and vitality, as well as help ensure water security for those who live and work on the Monterey Peninsula.""The desalination plant is one of three major components that California American Water – the Peninsula’s water provider – has supported to diversify the area’s water supply and relieve the over-drafted Carmel River Aquifer. The other two components of the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project are aquifer storage and recovery and a groundwater replenishment and recycled water project that together with other smaller projects will bring drought-proof and environmentally sustainable water supplies to the Monterey Peninsula.California American Water held more than 24 community workshops and meetings around Monterey County in the last three months to answer questions and receive feedback from community members. Over 100 supporters sent letters and spoke at the Coastal Commission hearing to advocate for the need to develop new water supplies for new housing, jobs, and environmental protection. The company had offered solutions to many of the major concerns that were raised in these meetings, including future system demands, public access to coastal resources and habitat protection.Story continuesAdditional conditions required by the Commission include California American Water agreeing to expand and improve affordability programs for customers and ongoing outreach and reporting to the City of Marina. A $3 million community benefit for Marina residents to address concerns about the location of the intake wells in the city was also included as a condition.With the Commission's approval, California American Water expects to receive the remaining customary permits. Construction is expected to begin in 2024 and be in service by the end of 2027. California American Water expects to maximize State Revolving Fund financing and other available grants to help reduce the cost impact to customers.""This project was conceived a decade ago and has been through extensive review and comment by key stakeholders,"" Tilden said. ""This was a truly collaborative process that incorporated perspectives and interested parties on the Peninsula whether they be our government partners, community organizations, or individual citizens. We listened and, to the extent reasonably possible, addressed their concerns. Subjects of discussion included water supply needs, affordability, public access, community benefits, saltwater intrusion, equity, and a myriad of other important topics.""The plant has an initial 4.8 million-gallons-per-day capacity and will rely on greenhouse gas-free renewable energy sources. It is designed, however, to accommodate a phased increase in capacity to provide for future needs for the Peninsula and region, and possible direct public participation in the project. This added flexibility in design was in response to concern regarding future supply needs.About California American Water: California American Water, a subsidiary of American Water (NYSE: AWK), provides high-quality and reliable water and wastewater services to more than 725,000 people.

However, the P/E might be high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.Union Pacific certainly has been doing a good job lately as it's been growing earnings more than most other companies. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. View our latest analysis for Union Pacific peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Union Pacific.Is There Enough Growth For Union Pacific?There's an inherent assumption that a company should outperform the market for P/E ratios like Union Pacific's to be considered reasonable.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 20%. As a result, it also grew EPS by 29% in total over the last three years. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been respectable for the company.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 7.3% per annum during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. With the market predicted to deliver 9.0% growth per year, the company is positioned for a comparable earnings result.With this information, we find it interesting that Union Pacific is trading at a high P/E compared to the market. Apparently many investors in the company are more bullish than analysts indicate and aren't willing to let go of their stock right now. These shareholders may be setting themselves up for disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.The Bottom Line On Union Pacific's P/EWe'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.Story continuesWe've established that Union Pacific currently trades on a higher than expected P/E since its forecast growth is only in line with the wider market. Right now we are uncomfortable with the relatively high share price as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. Unless these conditions improve, it's challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.It's always necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

Store sales inched up 1% year over year.Brand-Wise Sales &amp; CompsOld Navy: Net sales at Old Navy Global rose 2% year over year to $2,137 million due to improved size and assortment balance, as well as product acceptance, which was more than offset by softness in the kids and baby category, and muted demand stemming from lower-income consumers. The metric missed our estimate of $2,305.7 million. Comps also declined 1% year over year.Gap Global: For third-quarter fiscal 2022, net sales remained flat year over year to $1,041 million, driven by improvement in the category mix and assortment balance, offset by softness in the kids and baby category. The metric lagged our estimate of $1,441.5 million. Comps increased 4% year over year, while North America comps remained flat.Banana Republic: Net sales advanced 8% to $517 million and comps were up 10%, driven by the current shift in consumer preferences and gains from the prior year’s relaunch of work-based categories.

The adjusted gross margin of 38.7% contracted 320 basis points (bps) year over year due to a 370-bps decline in adjusted merchandise margins stemming from huge discounts and elevated commodity prices, somewhat offset by the lapping of last year’s higher air freight costs.Adjusted operating income was $156 million compared with $170 million in the year-ago quarter. The adjusted operating margin contracted 40 bps year over year to 3.9%.Adjusted operating expenses declined 5.1% year over year to $1,406 million.Other FinancialsThis Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company ended the fiscal third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $679 million, down from $801 million in the year-ago period.

Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseThe Gap, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | The Gap, Inc. QuoteGuidancePer management, it has been making efforts to lower inventory and rebalance its assortments to meet changing consumer needs, as well as reevaluate investments. Given the uncertain consumer environment and higher promotions, Gap expects sales to decline year over year in the mid-single digits in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. The gross margin is likely to leverage 540 basis points year over year in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, driven by air freight normalization, which is likely to be offset by 200 basis points of continued inflationary cost.The company’s cost-cutting actions in the quarter under review resulted in $250 million in annualized savings. Part of this is envisioned to benefit the fourth quarter, offset by headwinds related to higher seasonal labor costs.Stocks to ConsiderHere are three better-ranked stocks to consider — Wingstop WING, Kroger KR and Chipotle Mexican Grill CMG.Wingstop currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

327,96ac9297-1f56-3420-bd21-2845a11eb058,GPS,2022-11-19,"Gap beats on earnings, inventory rises 12% annually",Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/gap-beats-earnings-inventory-rises-144515985.html,1668782715,VIDEO,['GPS'],"[Yahoo Finance Live anchors discuss the rise in stock for Gap following third-quarter earnings.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]BRAD SMITH: Shares of Gap, that ticker symbol GPS, it's moving higher by about 9% premarket after beating earnings expectations on the top and bottom line. Sales growth, that was up 2% across all of their brands. And inventory up 12%. That continues to be the headline for retailers. But for Gap, largely better than expectations here on many fronts. Yeah, no?BRIAN SOZZI: Sure. I mean, they beat on earnings by, what, $0.69. And that's probably why the stock is up. They also beat slightly on sales. Banana Republic, good quarter for that brand comeback. Banana Republic, believe it or not, has been probably the comeback retailer of this year.And it pains me. It kills me to even give Gap any credit. But at the end of the day, here's a company still battling very high levels of inventory, battling margin degradation. Oh, yeah, it still doesn't have a permanent CEO. And it sounds like, from that earnings call last night, they really don't have anybody in the mix, at least right now, for a permanent CEO, which is alarming as you start to plan out 2023 budgets and buy that inventory for the spring selling season.I have a story right now on the Yahoo Finance home page just breaking down some other concerns in here, chief among them this is a company that is prepared to get very, very aggressive on promotions and discounting this holiday season. So we could be sitting here about three, 3 and 1/2 months from now talking about a retailer with a very bad quarter.JULIE HYMAN: We could be, potentially. I mean, as I wrote about in this morning's Morning Brief, inventory management is where it's at. And Gap does seem to have done a little bit better with inventory management at the cost--BRIAN SOZZI: At the cost of margins.JULIE HYMAN: Right. Right. At the cost of margins. They were doing a lot of promotions, as you said, like a lot of these brands are, and it did see an improvement in the year-over-year inventory build, like we saw at many of those retailers that we just showed, with the exception of somebody like Kohl's, for example, which is still seeing a big inventory build year-over-year.Story continuesBut retailers, by and large, seem to have gotten the message they have to clear stuff out. Are they going to take that short-term hit? It depends on which retailer you're talking about and how they have managed things thus far. But Gap, at least, has managed to get the message here. And the whole idea that people are going out and going to work and buying Banana Republic things is so interesting to me.BRIAN SOZZI: They've improved the quality. They've really--JULIE HYMAN: Yes.BRAD SMITH: Yeah.BRIAN SOZZI: --they've done a better job. Mostly, for years, Banana Republic was essentially Gap clothes, just more expensive, same thread, same you name it. But they have improved the quality, a lot of new leaders there. So I have to tip my hat to them.BRAD SMITH: This is also a larger question of what's taking place with Old Navy right now? And is that starting to wane in favor, at least in the era of fast fashion? Now, Old Navy still brings in about $2.1 billion for Gap, at least in this most recent quarter. And you kind of compare that to the $4.04 billion.So they're still largely putting the team on their back for the lion's share of the revenue. But it's now, for Old Navy as a subsidiary-- subsidiary within Gap, how do they start to retain some of the fanfare that they had seen over many years and then also combat what an H&amp;M is doing, what a Zara is doing, what all of these other fast--JULIE HYMAN: Shein.BRAD SMITH: Shein.BRIAN SOZZI: Ross storesBRAD SMITH: Yes, the--BRIAN SOZZI: Ross stores.BRAD SMITH: --e-commerce plays, and Ross Stores, which we can talk about too.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, really good quarter for Ross stores as well. TJ Maxx, early in the week, somewhat a good quarter. But for-- I think for Gap's stock to work higher, you have to have that Old Navy division humming.BRAD SMITH: Yeah.BRIAN SOZZI: That business is 60% of Gap's overall sales. And now sales are starting to just decline there as addition-- in addition to margins. They're still dealing with major inventory problems there. And as long as that's playing out, I just don't see how this rally's sustained.]"

If you want to see more of billionaire Cliff Asness' dividend stocks, go directly to Billionaire Cliff Asness' Top 5 Dividend Stocks.Billionaire Cliff Asness is the founder of AQR Capital Management, one of the largest hedge funds in the world. In 1998, Asness, along with several of his Goldman Sachs colleagues, founded AQR Capital Management after they ran $7 billion for Goldman Sachs Asset Mangement's quantitative research group that realized substantial success.At AQR Capital Management, which stands for 'Applied Quantitative Research Capital Management', Asness and his colleagues did similar things where they took substantial market data, processed it, and applied it to the markets. Given AQR Capital Management's track record since its founding, the fund now has a 13F portfolio worth over $41 billion as of the end of September.Although the fund had a challenging 2018 to 2020, the fund had a strong 2021. In terms of 2022, some of AQR's most famous funds are up this year as of April 2022.2022 has been challenging given the high inflation and central bank tightening. Given the interest rate increases, U.S. Treasury yields have increased substantially and many dividend stocks are not as attractive to some investors as they were before as a result.Nevertheless, October's inflation data shows that inflation could be peaking. If inflation has peaked, interest rates might not rise that much further and high quality blue chip dividend stocks could potentially be attractive in the long term given the lower valuations.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.AQR CAPITAL MANAGEMENTCliff Asness of AQR Capital ManagementMethodologyFor our list of Billionaire Cliff Asness' Top 10 Dividend Stocks, we took 10 stocks from Cliff Asness' AQR Capital Management's top holdings in its 13F portfolio at the end of Q3 2022 that paid dividends and we ranked them based on AQR Capital Management's stake in the stocks.Story continuesBillionaire Cliff Asness' Top 10 Dividend Stocks10.

For FY22, the company sees adjusted EPS guidance range of $8.55-$8.65 and full year 2022 cash flow from operations guidance range to $13.5 billion to $14.5 billion.Vltava Fund commented on CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in a Q3 2022 investor letter,“CVS is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years. We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt. This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”Like CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc.
