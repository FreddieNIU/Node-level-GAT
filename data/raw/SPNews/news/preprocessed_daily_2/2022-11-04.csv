But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Right now, STMicroelectronics is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Texas Instruments has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that STM is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.STM currently has a forward P/E ratio of 7.62, while TXN has a forward P/E of 17.09. We also note that STM has a PEG ratio of 1.52. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. TXN currently has a PEG ratio of 1.83.Another notable valuation metric for STM is its P/B ratio of 2.50. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, TXN has a P/B of 9.92.Story continuesThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to STM's Value grade of A and TXN's Value grade of C.STM sticks out from TXN in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that STM is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

2,7ce6ed83-f289-329e-8e66-aec56c6b72d6,TXN,2022-11-04,3 Technology Stocks With 3%+ Yields to Buy Today,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-technology-stocks-3-yields-184330447.html,1667241810,STORY,"['CSCO', 'SWKS', 'TXN']","[Investors often think of the technology sector as a high-growth area. That’s for good reason, as some of the largest companies in the world reside in this area. The downside of such high growth is that investors often are willing to pay a premium multiple but often rush to the exits at the first sign of trouble. Aside from healthcare, no sector has endured a more challenging 2022 than technology stocks, which are down about 42% year to date (YTD).The plus side of the downturn is that there are quality technology stocks now trading at much more reasonable valuations. These stocks also provide meaningful levels of income to go along with strong total return potential, which should appeal to both value and dividend growth investors alike.This article will examine three technology stocks yielding more than 3% that could deliver double-digit annual returns.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCSCOCisco$45.51SWKSSkyworks Solutions$86.66TXNTexas Instruments$161.06Cisco (CSCO)cisco (CSCO) logo on an office buildingSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comFirst up is Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), one of the largest high-performance computer networking systems in the world. The company is valued at $171 billion and has annual revenue of approximately $54 billion.Cisco has long been the most dominant name in enterprise networking. This has been the case for so long that it is estimated that the vast majority of data transferred over the internet for the past three decades has been done so through the company’s products. As a result, Cisco’s switches and routers are very entrenched in the industry.That said, the company has made efforts to move beyond hardware. This includes offerings such as cloud storage and security products that are very intertwined. This makes it difficult for customers to switch providers without enduring high switching costs.Cisco has also transformed into more a software-as-a-service company, which allows for recurring revenue sources and helps to remove some cyclicality from its business. Deferred revenue has been growing at a strong rate for some time now. For example, Cisco’s deferred revenue grew 11% to $23.3 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022.Story continuesThe company also has one of the best balance sheets in the industry. Cisco ended the fiscal year with total assets of $94 billion, including almost $19 billion of cash and equivalents against total liabilities of $54 billion and long-term debt of just $8.4 billion.Given the strength of its business and the company’s ability to offer smoother revenue results, we believe that Cisco is capable of generating earnings growth of 6%, which is close to the long-term average.Cisco’s dividend growth streak stands at 12 years. Shares currently yield 3.6%, which is twice the average yield of 1.8% for the S&amp;P 500. With a projected payout ratio of 43%, it is likely that the company’s dividend will continue to grow.The final component of our projected return model is valuation. Historically, Cisco has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of slightly more than 13. We have a fair value target of 14 times earnings given the positives working in the company’s favor. With shares trading at 11.9 times earnings, this implies an annual tailwind of 3.3% from multiple expansion over the next five years.In total, we forecast that Cisco will offer annual returns of 12.4% over the next five years, stemming from a 6% earnings growth rate, a starting yield of 3.6% and a low single-digit contribution form multiple expansion.Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)the Skyworks website is loading on a smartphoneSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comThe next technology name to consider is Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS), a leading semiconductor company. The company is valued at more than $13 billion and has produced revenue of just over $5 billion over the last year.Skyworks Solutions designs and sells semiconductor products to a wide variety of customers around the world. The company’s amplifiers, antenna tuners, converters, modulators, receivers and switches are used in end markets such as automotive, connected home, defense, industrial, medical and smartphones.Of these markets, smartphones might be the most important at the moment. This is because of the ongoing 5G rollout. Most of the major carriers have turned on 5G service, but customer upgrades to devices that can access this network is ongoing. It will take time for the majority of customers to acquire a 5G device, which should provide Skyworks Solutions with tailwinds to its business.There will be immense competition in the 5G space, but the company’s expertise, size and scale should work to its advantage as more people switch to the service. Skyworks Solutions’ products are used by some of the largest technology names involved in 5G, such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which gives the company a partnership with some of the top makers of smartphones.Skyworks Solutions has increased EPS at a high rate over the last decade. However, we believe 5% earnings growth going forward is more likely given the high base that the company is starting from.The company has raised its dividend for 10 consecutive years, and the stock is currently yielding 3.1%, one of its highest yields in its history. The projected payout ratio of 21% is extremely low and leaves ample room for Skyworks Solutions to continue to raise its payments to shareholders.Shares of the company are trading at just 7.3 times expected EPS for the year. With a fair value price-to-earnings ratio of 12, we believe that Skyworks Solutions will see multiple expansion add 10.5% to annual returns over the next five years.In total, Skyworks Solutions is projected to return 18.1% per year for the next half-decade. This is due to 5% earnings growth, a starting yield of 3.1% and a low double-digit valuation tailwind.Texas Instruments (TXN)Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comOur final technology name is Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), one of the largest semiconductor companies in the world. The $145 billion company has generated revenue approaching $20 billion over the last 12 months.Texas Instruments has two business segments. The analog segment produces products that help in the management of power in electronic systems and that measure signals that allow information to be transferred or converted. The embedded processing segment makes semiconductor chips that can be used in a multitude of applications.The company’s products are used in several different areas, including automotive, where the sophistication of cars and trucks has greatly increased. This will require more advanced components in order to meet the needs of manufacturers. Other important end markets include industrial applications and communication services.Texas Instruments has also invested heavily to design more advanced chips, which has helped to solidify its place in its industry. This has led to strong margin performance over long periods of time. The company’s EPS have compounded at a double-digit rate over the last decade, but we forecast earnings growth of 7.5%, as we feel this builds in some measure of protection against what has typically been a cyclical business.Texas Instruments yields 3.2% today. The company’s lengthy dividend growth streak of 19 years is one of the longest in the technology sector and growth rates have been robust over the long term. The projected payout ratio for 2022 is 52%.The stock is trading with a price-to-earnings ratio of 16.9. We believe fair value is closer to 20 times earnings, which is near the historical valuation. Reverting to our target price-to-earnings ratio would add 4.3% to annual returns going forward.Therefore, Texas Instruments is predicted to provide annual returns of 14.7% through 2027, stemming from 7.5% earnings growth, 3.2% dividend yield and a low single-digit contribution from an expanding multiple.On the date of publication, Bob Ciura did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

However, the top line exceeded the management guidance and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,135 million.Non-GAAP gross margin was 49.2% compared with 52.4% in the year-ago quarter owing to higher inventory-related charges and planned reduction in factory utilization.

Capital expenditure remains concentrated in areas where the company sees continued demand for differentiated products.OutlookFor third-quarter fiscal 2023, Qorvo expects revenues to be in the range of $700–$750 million, driven by continued weakness across end markets and acute inventory correction at Android-based smartphone customers.

""People were plagued with the pandemic. We were all sent home in isolation from our community. We were watching George Floyd being murdered on TV. As a result, people were slowing down and turning their focus on what was happening in their lives and community.""It was that, along with a report that named Waterloo-Cedar Falls the worst metro area in the U.S. for Black Americans due to income, unemployment and home ownership disparities, that spurred the creation of 24/7 Blac and an ongoing partnership with U.S. Bank.""No one wants to hold onto that designation [as the worst place in the U.S. for Black people],"" said Joy Briscoe, the executive director of 24/7 Blac. ""That's not my Waterloo. Through 24/7 Blac, we are working to address that by specifically working with the Black community around a lack of economic empowerment and financial literacy.""Two years since 24/7 Blac was founded, there are now four core programs aimed at supporting the Black community: career readiness, a business accelerator program, homeownership preparedness and an investment group. In the months that followed its founding, U.S. Bank began partnering with 24/7 Blac.""We cannot do this work without partners,"" said Sallis. ""Partners that are willing to say how can I support you and create space for you.""In 2021, to advance generational wealth among Black business owners, 24/7 Blac received a $50,000 Market Impact Fund (MIF) grant from the U.S. Bank Foundation. Launched in 2019, MIF grants have addressed urgent needs in communities across the 26-state footprint of U.S. Bank.""We are trying to change and transform the outcomes for the Black community,"" said Ashlei Spivey, a business access advisor at U.S. Bank who spoke at a 24/7 Blac leadership event in June 2022. ""To partner with an organization like 24/7, who is leading in their community, we are able to share, learn and be thoughtful about our approach.""Story continuesThis includes programs like U.S. Bank Access Home, which focuses on supporting and growing Black homeownership, and sharing information and resources with the community. That's where Kelly Newton, the mortgage sales supervisor for U.S. Bank in the Waterloo-Cedar Falls area, comes in.When the second cohort of people go through 24/7 Blac's homebuying classes this fall, Newton will spend Saturdays discussing how to become mortgage-ready and what the mortgage application process looks like.""Homeownership is the biggest driver toward building generational wealth,"" said Newton. ""I work with those in the cohort because I want to share what I know and give good information to those who haven't had access to it and deserve more.""For Sallis and Briscoe, what's been accomplished in 24/7 Blac's first couple of years of existence is just the beginning: 40 business have gone through their accelerator program; three business owners have turned it into their full-time job, and three people in the first homebuyer cohort have closed on their new homes.""We thought we could do a little something when we started, but it turns out a lot of people needed what we were offering,"" said Briscoe.

12,b80d7aa9-32c6-37b9-9f53-d1f2ff4d7e4f,USB,2022-11-04,U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 68% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-bancorp-nyse-usb-largely-110021905.html,1667559621,STORY,"['USB', 'USB-PQ']","[To get a sense of who is truly in control of U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 68% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of U.S. Bancorp. Check out our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About U.S. Bancorp?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.U.S. Bancorp already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at U.S. Bancorp's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in U.S. Bancorp. Our data shows that Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.1% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.7% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 6.7% of the company stock.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of U.S. BancorpThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of U.S. Bancorp in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$85m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 24% stake in U.S. Bancorp. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Public Company OwnershipIt appears to us that public companies own 8.1% of U.S. Bancorp. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand U.S. Bancorp better, we need to consider many other factors.

LOUIS, Mo., November 03, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--U.S. Bank’s community development entity (CDE) – USBCDE, LLC – received $60 million of New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) allocation from the U.S. Department of Treasury. The allocation was among the largest awarded in this round and is part of the federal government’s $5 billion NMTC program, which helps economically distressed communities attract private investment capital.USBCDE was one of 107 CDEs to receive a share of the NMTC allocation authority package announced by the Treasury’s Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI Fund). It’s the bank’s 12th allocation under the NMTC program and the fifth year in a row it has received an award. Since its inception, USBCDE has invested more than $870 million in communities across the country, helping create more than 59,000 jobs and increasing the capacity served at community facilities like schools and health care centers by more than 1.8 million people annually.Some recent projects USBCDE has financed with its allocation include an expansion of the Dewberry, a multi-tenant healthcare facility in Birmingham, Alabama, serving low income uninsured and under-insured people living with HIV/AIDS; the purchase of equipment and inventory for Ogaakaaning Wild Rice in Bemidji, Minnesota, which is the first business owned by the Red Lake Nation of Chippewa to operate off the Red Lake Nation Reservation; an infrastructure project in the Crenshaw neighborhood of Los Angeles that will create a hub for Black art, culture and commerce, including pocket parks, landscaping, public art and support to local businesses; and a complete redevelopment of the historic Lexington Market, one of the country’s oldest markets and key anchor of Baltimore’s downtown west side.The NMTC program is an economic development tool that infuses capital in areas that need it most. CDEs allocate tax credits to projects, attracting private investment capital that helps grow businesses and create jobs in economically distressed communities. According to the Department of the Treasury, NMTC program awards generate more than $8 of private investment for every $1 invested by the federal government.Story continuesIn addition to the work done through its CDE, U.S. Bank is also the most active NMTC investor in the country, having invested more than $7.3 billion nationwide in a wide variety of economic development projects nationwide.Laura Vowell, managing director of Community Finance Solutions for U.S. Bancorp Community Development Corporation – the tax credit and community investment subsidiary of the bank –credits the CDE’s strategic shift several years ago to use its allocation to drive investment to communities of color, where racial barriers have perpetuated inequities.""We are intentional about how we invest our own allocation, focusing on purposeful equity. We prioritize projects that help reduce the racial wealth gap, create quality jobs, provide critical services and build wealth by making investments that support or are owned or led by people of color,"" said Vowell, who heads the bank’s NMTC business and USBCDE, LLC.Fee income collected through these projects is also reinvested; USBCDE distributes it as grants to organizations with a racial equity focus and has provided $6.9 million to organizations and communities since 2013.""We take our role as a large investor very seriously,"" Vowell said. ""We’re constantly looking for ways we can better leverage our power and influence to advance racial equity in the industry.""In addition to being a vocal advocate for greater equity in the NMTC industry, U.S. Bank has provided technical assistance, grant dollars and referrals for third-party support to several person of color-led CDEs to assist in completing the allocation application. USBCDE also deploys some of its own allocation to emerging and person of color-led CDEs through the intermediary CDE model – a partnership that helps the CDE build a NMTC track record, offers an opportunity to deploy this resource within their selected community, and is a potential factor for success in gaining future allocation.Overall, about 20% of this year’s allocatees and allocation went to CDEs led by persons of color.""We’re happy to see modest improvement in representation with this round of allocations,"" Vowell said. ""We’ll continue to look for ways we can personally partner with and support person of color-led CDEs in earning their own allocation.""USBCDE's intentional focus on racial equity supports U.S. Bank Access Commitment, the company’s long-term approach to help build wealth while redefining how the bank serves racially diverse communities and providing more opportunities for diverse employees.About U.S. BankU.S. Bancorp, with approximately 70,000 employees and $601 billion in assets as of September 30, 2022, is the parent company of U.S. Bank National Association.

18,7471ff98-8794-39de-95e2-4fd3985e2bea,EW,2022-11-04,7 Stocks to Buy at the ‘Midterm Elections’ Bottom,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-buy-midterm-elections-160153912.html,1667232113,STORY,"['TROW', 'META', 'NVDA', 'GOOGL', 'EW', 'ADBE', 'TTD']","[Although the concept of stocks to buy at the ‘midterm elections’ bottom seems farfetched considering the broader volatility this year, the calendar might provide a change of heart. According to The New York Times, the U.S. equities sector generally follows election-related patterns.“The months leading up to midterm elections have generally been the worst in what is known as the four-year presidential election cycle. But the stock market is about to enter a sweet spot. Stocks have usually rallied in the year after the midterms — no matter which side wins.” Fundamentally, that might be great news for stocks to buy.As well, the latter point may give investors relief. To no one’s surprise, the campaign cycle features incredible vitriol all over the map. And with major geopolitical events in the background, this year’s midterms may be more significant than others. However, if stocks to buy will rise irrespective of which party wins, that’s one factor to help people sleep better.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsStill, some ideas may be better than others. Therefore, the stocks to buy on this list feature a combination of undervalued profiles and fiscal resilience.GOOG GOOGLAlphabet$95.28NVDANvidia$135.26METAMeta Platforms$94.62ADBEAdobe$320.32EWEdwards Lifesciences$71.99TTDTrade Desk$53.42TROWT. Rowe Price$107.57Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comOne of the hardest-hit majors in the broader technology space, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) finds its equity value chopped by more than a third since the start of the year. Fundamentally, this volatility might be overdone. As stated before, the company’s Google ecosystem dominates the internet. For instance, it commands over 92% market share in the search engine sector.Financially, Gurufocus.com labels GOOG and GOOGL as significantly undervalued based on its proprietary calculations. To be fair, under standard assessments, GOOG/GOOGL is priced at 17 times forward earnings, which is middling for the industry.Story continuesHowever, Alphabet brings excellent income statement-related strengths to the mix. For instance, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 25%, better than about 75% of its peers. And its net margin pings at nearly 24%, rating higher than nearly 85% of the competition. Finally, Alphabet allows long-term stakeholders to sleep easier at night due to its balance sheet. Specifically, its Altman Z-Score hits nearly 10 points, reflecting very low bankruptcy risk.Nvidia (NVDA)Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green treesSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comSemiconductor specialist Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is hurting, and it’s no surprise why. In 2021, the company flourished with certain growth sectors like cryptocurrencies absolutely booming. Unfortunately, cryptos deflated badly this year, applying pressure on NVDA. In addition, the company suffered from the usual suspects like global supply chain problems and monetary policy fluctuations. Still, for the patient, NVDA represents one of the stocks to buy on discount.Per Gurufocus.com, Nvidia is significantly undervalued based on proprietary calculations. Based on traditional metrics, it runs a premium, such as its 30-times forward earnings price. However, investors also need to consider its income statement. For instance, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 31%. Its net margin pings at 26%. Both stats rank well above their respective industry median levels.Just as importantly, Nvidia enjoys a stable balance sheet. While it carries a middling cash-to-debt ratio, its Altman Z-Score rates at 12.8. This reflects extremely low bankruptcy risk, providing a discount you can believe in.Meta Platforms (META)Meta Written On The Googles - Man Wearing Virtual Reality Goggles Inside A Metaverse. FTC investigating META.Source: Aleem Zahid Khan / Shutterstock.comAlthough Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) made a big fuss about its transition to the metaverse, both investors and analysts remain unimpressed. For the former category, META dropped nearly 71% of equity value on a year-to-date basis. Clearly, investors aren’t enamored with the pivot. Regarding the latter category, analysts criticized the emphasis on the metaverse.With people asking really basic questions (such as what’s the point?) Meta faces a difficult road ahead. That is, a difficult road for the metaverse. Relating to its massive social media footprint, that’s where the money is. Sure, Meta warned earlier this year about the slowdown in the digital advertising market. However, companies will still need to advertise somewhere. Meta brings nearly a three-billion-strong active user base to the picture. As well, Elon Musk’s Twitter possibly about to nuke its attractiveness, the safe space that is its Facebook platform could be very enticing.META also represents a steal. With strong income-statement metrics, a stable balance sheet and a forward price-earnings ratio of just under 12 times (compared to the industry median 15.5 times), you don’t want to ignore META as one of the potential stocks to buy.Adobe (ADBE)ADBE stock adobe stockSource: ShutterstockOn the surface, the volatility toward Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) might appear rational. Though a compelling tech play, Adobe largely generated its reputation with creatives-related programs. The market for such services seemingly may be at risk considering economically deflationary risks. However, the burgeoning gig economy may help to bring in demand over the next several years.Further, the loss of over 42% of equity value since the beginning of the year may be too much. We’re not talking about some junk company that’s tethered to aspirational projections. Rather, the enterprise features compelling attributes sold at discount. For instance, Adobe’s earnings yield based on investor Joel Greenblatt’s model stands at 4%. In contrast, the median for the industry is 1.3%.Along with that, Adobe’s income statement-related metrics, including three-year revenue growth rate and net margin stand above industry norms, especially for profitability. Factor in the strong balance sheet (with an Altman Z-Score of over 10) and you have a great case for stocks to buy on discount.Edwards Lifesciences (EW)Modern Medical Research Laboratory with Computer, Microscope, Glassware with Biochemicals on the Desk. Scientific Lab Biotechnology Development Center Full of High-Tech Equipment. Biomedical technology stocksSource: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.comA medical technology firm, Edwards Lifesciences (NYSE:EW) specializes in artificial heart valves and hemodynamic monitoring. To be fair, EW represents one of the riskiest stocks to buy, in part because of its recent earnings report. Per Investor’s Business Daily, Edwards slashed its profit guidance due to U.S. hospital staffing challenges and a strong dollar. Since the beginning of this year, EW dropped almost 45% of equity value.Aside from the recent downgrade, the overall picture for EW remains attractive for speculators. For instance, Gurufocus.com rates Edwards as a significantly undervalued business. For example, the company’s earnings yield (Greenblatt model) is 4.15%. In contrast, the industry median is only 0.6%.On the income statement, Edwards features a three-year revenue growth rate of 12.6%, beating out over 64% of its peers. The company’s net margin stands at 27%, beating out over 90% of its rivals in the medical devices segment. Finally, the company features an Altman Z-Score of over 13, reflecting great stability in the balance sheet.Trade Desk (TTD)The logo for The Trade Desk is displayed on a smart phone.Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comAnother high-risk, high-reward idea among stocks to buy during the possible midterms bottom, Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) specializes in real-time programmatic marketing automation technologies, products, and services, designed to personalize digital content delivery to users, per its corporate profile. However, the fundamental headwind to TTD stems from the digital ad space market. Suffering deflationary forces, Trade Desk doesn’t bring a confident canvas to the table.However, it’s also important to point out that entertainment streaming services appear to be enjoying an uptick in demand. This dynamic isn’t just significant for the companies directly involved. Rather, the consumption of entertainment may be pivoting back to the living room. Part of this may center on economic pressures. People still want to be entertained, it’s just that they must seek cheaper alternatives.Well, that spells music to Trade Desk’s ears due to its programmatic marketing specialty. As well, the company brings a stable balance sheet to the picture, with an Altman Z-Score of 9.45.T. Rowe Price (TROW)Graphic of side view of virtual financial charts with tech aesthetic, symbolizing fintechSource: shutterstock.com/whiteMoccaIn 2020 and 2021, with worker bees operating remotely, people couldn’t get enough of the equities market. Fast forward to this year and the term stocks to buy might represent fighting words to some folks. Not surprisingly, T. Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW), an investment management firm, feels the pressure. Since the beginning of this year, TROW slipped over 44% of equity value.Admittedly, it’s not a great look for stocks to buy. With the Federal Reserve committed to a hawkish monetary policy, it rendered limitations for investment opportunities. I don’t want to get bogged down here but the basics is this: higher costs of borrowing generally reduces investor sentiment and confidence. However, if you can get past this little detail, TROW brings an attractive profile to the stage.Based on its price-earnings-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.67 (with the industry median being 1.43) you can make the argument that TROW is undervalued. The company also features a stable growth trek and profitability margins. Further, its return on equity is 28%, reflecting a high-quality business. As well, T. Rowe features an Altman Z-Score of nearly 10, signifying a resilient enterprise.Plus, investors will still invest, making T. Rowe one of the best among the troubled.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

And despite signs that the economy is slowing, Americans are expected to spend more this year between Thanksgiving and New Year’s than they did in 2021.According to accounting and professional services firm Deloitte, holiday retail sales are likely to boom. Expectations are that retail sales will total between $1.45 trillion and $1.47 trillion from late November to the start of January. That’s up about 5% from the same time last year. E-commerce sales during this year’s holiday sales period are expected to rise even more dramatically, with Deloitte forecasting year-over-year growth of 12.8% to 14.3%. Indeed, the firm says that e-commerce sales could exceed $260 billion, making for a very merry holiday sales season.Clearly, Americans aren’t letting inflation and rising interest rates hold them back from celebrating year-end festivities. Other holiday sales forecasts are equally bullish. So, which companies and stocks are likely to benefit from all that holiday spending? Here is a list of seven stocks that could pop with the holidays.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWMTWalmart$140.72UPSUnited Parcel Service$164.01AMZNAmazon$89.30CVSCVS Health$97.80LUVSouthwest Airlines$36.96BBYBest Buy$67.07TAPMolson Coors$49.48Walmart (WMT)Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the backgroundSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comMany people depend on Walmart (NYSE:WMT) at Christmas time. From toys and decorations to food and stocking stuffers, Walmart has it all. Additionally, this company usually offers the best prices in town. That could be an especially attractive draw for consumers this year, with inflation in the U.S. continuing to run at a 40-year high, and costs up sharply for everything from turkeys to eggnog.The world’s biggest retailer is following the lead of competitors this year and offering holiday sales earlier than ever before. The company started rolling out deals to consumers in October, rather than waiting until Thanksgiving at the end of November. Over the last month, Walmart has announced price cuts, expanded return options, and an enhanced omnichannel shopping experience. This is in a bid to kickstart its holiday shopping season into high gear.Story continuesIn the coming weeks, Walmart said it will offer thousands more price “rollbacks” to help harried shoppers complete their holiday lists. Currently, WMT stock is only down 1% on the year at $141 per share. That said, a strong holiday boost could help turn the company’s share price green by New Year’s.United Parcel Service (UPS)Close up of UPS logo printed on a delivery truck; partial view of the driver sitting at the wheel, waiting at a red traffic light in south San Francisco baySource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comHelping Santa get all those gifts and packages under the tree this year is the job of United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS). The largest courier company in the world with annual revenues of more than $85 billion, UPS thrives during the holidays. In September, the company announced plans to hire more than 100,000 additional workers to help with the holiday shipping rush. These hires span the spectrum, from drivers to package handlers.UPS said it anticipates package shipments to peak later in December this year and closer to Christmas, as consumers return to pre-Covid patterns and shop for items later and in-person. The company also expects to lose some business to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which is directly handling more of it its own shipments now. Still, the fourth and final quarter of the year is always the busiest for UPS.UPS stock is down approximately 20% this year at $164 per share, mirroring the decline in the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index.Amazon (AMZN)Amazon LOGO ON THE SIDE OF A BUILDING.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comSpeaking of Amazon, the e-commerce giant made headlines around the world in October when it held a second Prime sales event for the year. Traditionally, Amazon’s Prime sales event has been held at Thanksgiving and tied into the Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales extravaganzas. However, Amazon decided to move up this year’s sales to October to try and kickstart holiday shopping early, and give its revenues a big boost in the fourth quarter.While exact sales figures for the October event have yet to be made public by Amazon, preliminary indications are that the company sold more than 100 million items during the two-day event. Additionally, Amazon should continue to benefit from strong e-commerce sales throughout this year’s holidays, especially around Black Friday and during the lead-up to Christmas. Like the other companies on this list, the fourth quarter is typically the strongest for Amazon.AMZN stock is down roughly 45% this year and trading at $90 per share. At this price, the stock is a true gift to investors.CVS Health (CVS)the exterior of a CVS pharmacy storeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comPharmacy retailer CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) just reported its third consecutive earnings beat. The Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based company’s stock popped 3% after it reported Q3 earnings per share of $2.09 versus $1.99 that was expected on Wall Street. Revenue for the July through September period came in at $81.16 billion compared to $76.75 billion that was expected by analysts.A big reason for the company’s continued strong earnings is revenue from CVS Health’s retail sales, which rose 7% year-over-year in the third-quarter. Those retail sales are likely to get a boost during the holidays as people turn to the company’s nearly 10,000 retail outlets for chocolates, stocking stuffers, and other items.December is also cold and flu season, and that should help CVS Health’s pharmacy services, which saw revenue climb 10% higher from a year ago during the most recent quarter. CVS stock is down only 6% this year, outperforming all the major U.S. stock indices.Southwest Airlines (LUV)a southwest airline stocks (LUV) jet flying above the cloudsSource: Carlos E. Santa Maria / Shutterstock.comLet’s not forget holiday travel. After two years of sheltering-in-place at home, Americans are again planning to travel during the holidays this year. Approximately 70% of Americans saying they plan to travel to visit family and friends for Thanksgiving and/or Christmas. Thus, airlines are seeking to capitalize on the busy travel season, with most having already raised their fares by 50% or more from mid-November through early January.One of the airlines most likely to benefit from the holiday travel boom is Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV). The world’s largest low-cost carrier and one of the busiest airlines in the U.S., Southwest carries more domestic passengers than any other airline in America. The company is rushing to resolve its staffing problems in the lead-up to Thanksgiving, announcing plans to hire more than 3,000 pilots this year and next.LUV stock is down 16% this year and trading at $37 per share.Best Buy (BBY)Image of Best Buy logo on storefront during daytime. retail stocksSource: BobNoah / Shutterstock.comAs a purveyor of consumer electronics such as smartphones, video game consoles, and Ultra High Definition (UHD) television sets, Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) is typically ground zero for both Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday sales. Consumers line-up around the country to crash the retailer’s Black Friday sales events at midnight the day after Thanksgiving, while millions more try to score deals online during Cyber Monday.Like the other retailers on this list, Best Buy got a jump on the holidays this year, offering exclusive sales to customers in October. Not only has the company offered early Black Friday deals, it has also announced exclusive offers to its “My Best Buy” members, which, it says, will continue through January as part of what it is calling “Member Mondays.” This strategy could power Best Buy to a strong fourth quarter.So far this year, BBY stock has fallen 34% to $67 a share.Molson Coors (TAP)Molson Coors (TAP) logo on a web browser magnified by a magnifying glassSource: OleksandrShnuryk / Shutterstock.comWe’ll end with a cup of holiday cheer. For that, investors should look to Chicago-based beverage giant and master brewer Molson Coors (NYSE:TAP). According to a survey published on the website Beveragedaily.com, Americans double their intake of alcohol between Thanksgiving and New Year’s, consuming eight alcoholic drinks a week compared to four during the rest of the year.The most popular alcoholic beverages during the holidays are eggnog (40%), coffee with Bailey’s (34%), beer (28%) and cider (27%). Molson Coors, which is the second largest brewer in the U.S. and third largest maker of alcoholic beverages in the world, is sure to benefit from an uptick in sales during the holidays.Strong year-end sales could further help TAP stock, which has benefitted from the economic reopening following the pandemic. Year-to-date, Molson Coors stock is up 5% at just under $50 per share, making it among the rare securities that are on the positive side of the ledger in 2022.Disclosure: On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

The comments in the earnings call offset quarterly results that showed a wider than expected loss in Q3.Zillow (NASDAQ:ZG) reported a beat on both the top and bottom lines in Q3, though warned of lower revenue in the final quarter of the year as rising mortgage rates weighs on demand.Story continuesIn other news, Boeing (NYSE:BA), a major Dow component, jumped after the aircraft maker detailed plans to increase production and deliveries of new aircraft.On the economic front, weekly jobless claims unexpectedly declined pointing to a robust labor market and stoked expectations for an upside surprise in Friday's monthly jobs report, which will likely fuel further bets on a hawkish Fed.Economists expect that 200,000 new jobs were created last month, which would still be a ""historically strong number, this late in the in the cycle,"" Eric Diton, president and managing director at The Wealth Alliance, said in an interview on Thursday with Yasin Ebrahim's Investing.com.""Job openings increased last month, there's more companies looking for workers, so I don't see how that's going to be followed by a weak October jobs report as that would be inconsistent,"" Diton added.

I mean, can we sort of take away some positive here, especially when you're looking at the retailers that have reported so far?ALEXADNRA SEMENOVA: Absolutely, Akiko. It's another big morning for corporate earnings with a flurry of retailers headlining today's results. Among them is Crocs.Shares are up about 7% after the footwear company reported third quarter figures that beat Wall Street estimates. Quarterly sales and direct to consumer comparable sales rose sharply, as well as revenue for its Hey Dude brand up 87% during the period. The company raised its full year guidance with CEO Andrew Rees citing strong back-to-school performance and 20% constant currency revenue growth in its Crocs brand.Let's turn now to Under Armour also beating estimates for the quarter, but signaling a less optimistic view of what's ahead for the company. The sports brand said sales for the 2023 fiscal year are set to rise in the low single digits. That's down from the 5% to 7% it projected earlier.The company attributed lower expectations to, quote, ""a more challenging retail environment and additional negative impacts from changes in foreign currency"". BMO analyst Simeon Siegel, who is a friend of the show, telling us this morning that he believes shares are still priced too low. He reiterated his outperform rating on the stock this morning.AKIKO FUJITA: And speaking of some positive takeaways here, we've got Etsy. That stock just on a tear today up well over 10%. What's fueling the rally there?ALEXADNRA SEMENOVA: Well, Akiko, results signal today to investors that e-commerce is still holding up better than expected, especially ahead of the all important holiday shopping season. Etsy's revenue came in at $594.5 million. That's up 11.7% from a year ago. Gross merchandise sales down slightly, but still at the higher end of the projected range.The online marketplace also said it expects continued strength in its sales into the fourth quarter. That's helping lift shares today. Analysts from Evercore ISI this morning saying the company maintained its pandemic success and is showing healthy levels of profitability as well.AKIKO FUJITA: OK, some silver linings there to take away. Thanks so much for that, Alexandra Semenova.]"

Are they protecting this house? Yes, they are.All right, the only way is through. It's up by about 15, 16% right now. The athletic wear company posted slightly better than expected second quarter results, but cut back its guidance. Citing the stronger dollar and a, quote, ""more challenging retail environment."" It's challenging indeed.You're taking a look at the actuals versus the estimates on your screen. And turnaround had to start sometime, but it's not a full turnaround here.BRIAN SOZZI: I didn't see really any signs of a turnaround. This is maybe-- this was the Peloton turnaround with the green shoots. Maybe Barry McCarthy should write this company's letter too as well. But look, they came out, lowered their guidance.And one of the biggest concerns this holiday season in retail is all the inventory sitting at various stores. And one of the most promotional brands in the store right now remains Under Armour. And it's just not what this brand was founded on.I remember saving up a lot of money to buy my first moisture wicking Under Armour shirt. I had to pay full price. This was six or seven years ago, maybe even longer than that. But still you go now to TJ Maxx, you go to Marshall's, this stuff is on sale $10, $20 a pop.JULIE HYMAN: Well, and their inventory was up by 29%. So that-- but that's in line with what we've seen from others. They did cut the forecast, as you mentioned, but that forecast cut was largely expected. Analysts were saying they got to cut the forecast. So I guess their acknowledgment of reality was a good thing.Also really surprising here. Asia-Pacific sales up 7%. Like, who else had Asia-Pacific sales?BRIAN SOZZI: Big in basketball.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, yeah. They've been sending Steph Curry there every single summer to do a grassroots, just boots on the ground promotion.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: But still, given how shut down things have been there.BRAD SMITH: No, you're right.JULIE HYMAN: And given what we've been hearing from other companies, that's a bit surprising. Remember they still don't have a permanent CEO, by the way. Remember Patrick Frisk left?BRIAN SOZZI: This has always been Kevin Plank's house. You've covered Under Armour too as a well. Even when Patrick Frisk was in there, I mean, it's very much Kevin Plank's baby, his ship. He may not be running it day-to-day, but he sends an email, you're getting it done.BRAD SMITH: Right. He was steering it. And I think for what Under Armour has gone up against and continues to go up against, this is not going to get any easier for them. And so continuing to have the nostalgia factor that you were mentioning a moment ago.BRIAN SOZZI: I did.BRAD SMITH: Everybody remembers their first Under Armour experience.BRIAN SOZZI: I still have it.BRAD SMITH: You really do?BRIAN SOZZI: I use this shirt to play softball. It helped me recover a lot faster, or at least that's what I told myself. And then I hit better and I threw the ball further. It was amazing, Brad.BRAD SMITH: It was that aura that you take on but--BRIAN SOZZI: I'm still carrying on. I'm wearing it underneath this shirt.BRAD SMITH: And so it's-- really?BRIAN SOZZI: No. Just kidding.[LAUGHTER]JULIE HYMAN: Along with the chain.BRIAN SOZZI: Let's go to the Julie Hyman trade here.]"

34,1831de44-f360-309b-9be7-ed49208e8d84,EQR,2022-11-04,Covenant Logistics and Herbalife have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/covenant-logistics-herbalife-highlighted-zacks-111611855.html,1667560571,STORY,"['HLF', 'BRT', 'MAA-PI', 'EQR']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – November 4, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares Covenant Logistics Group CVLG as the Bull of the Day and Herbalife HLF as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on BRT Apartments Corp. BRT, Equity Residential's EQR and Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. MAA.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Covenant Logistics Group is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and it sports an A for Value and a B for Growth.  This company just posted a big beat and has seen a solid move higher.  Let's explore more about this company in this Bull of The Day article.DescriptionCovenant Logistics Group Inc. offers a portfolio of transportation and logistics services, through its subsidiaries. The company services include asset-based expedited, dedicated and irregular route truckload capacity, as well as asset-light warehousing, transportation management and freight brokerage capability. Covenant Logistics Group Inc, is based in Chattanooga, Tennessee.Earnings HistoryWhen I look at a stock, the first thing I do is look to see if the company is beating the number.  This tells me right away where the market's expectations have been for the company and how management has communicated to the market.  A stock that consistently beats has management communicating expectations to Wall Street that can be achieved.  That is what you want to see.For CVLG, I see four straight beats of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.  That is great to see, but by itself that is not enough to make the company a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The average positive earnings surprise over the course of the last year works out to be 22%.Earnings Estimates RevisionsThe Zacks Rank tells us which stocks are seeing earnings estimates move higher.Over the last 60 days, earning estimates have moved up for CVLG.This quarter has moved from $1.17 to $1.51.Story continuesNext quarter has increased from $0.79 to $0.94.The full fiscal year 2022 has increased from $5.43 to $5.77.Next fiscal year has seen the estimate move from $3.56 to $3.97.Positive movement in earnings stock is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).ValuationThe valuation for this name is quite low with a 6.5x forward earnings multiple.  The price to book is 1.5x which is well below the 3x level that value investors need to see. Price to sales comes in at 0.44x and has room to grow.  I see margins increasing in each of the last two quarters and with revenue growth slated to come in at 16%, this name looks very attractive.Bear of the Day:Herbalife is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) but it could be worthy of deeper after -16% and -10% moves on back-to-back days. This article will look at why this stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) as it is the Bear of the Day.DescriptionHerbalife is a global network marketing company offering a range of science-based weight management products, nutritional supplements and personal care products intended to support weight loss and a healthy lifestyle.Earnings HistoryWhen I look at a stock, the first thing I do is look to see if the company is beating the number. This tells me right away where the market's expectations have been for the company and how management has communicated to the market. A stock that consistently beats has management communicating expectations to Wall Street that can be achieved. That is what you want to see.In the case of HLF, I have three beats of the  Zacks Consensus Estimate and one miss. This alone does not make the stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and it doesn't make it a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) either.The Zacks Rank does care about the earnings history, but it is much more heavily influenced by the movement of earnings estimates.Earnings EstimatesThe Zacks Rank tells us which stocks are seeing earnings estimates move higher or in this case lower. For HLF I see annual estimates moving lower.The current fiscal year consensus number moved from $3.39  to $2.24 over the last 60 days.The next year has moved from $4.24 to $2.30.Negative movement in earnings estimates like that is why this stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).It should be noted that a majority of stocks in the Zacks universe are seeing negative earnings estimate revisions. That means that the stocks that are seeing small but negative earnings estimate revisions are falling to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Additional content:What to Expect from BRT Apartments (BRT) This Earnings SeasonBRT Apartments Corp. is slated to report third-quarter 2022 earnings on Nov 7 after market close. The company's quarterly results are likely to reflect growth in revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share.In the last reported quarter, this residential real estate investment trust's (REIT) adjusted FFO per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.13%.Over the last four quarters, BRT Apartments surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and missed the same on the other, the average beat being 9.29%.Let's see how things have shaped up before this announcement.Factors to ConsiderFor the U.S. apartment market, demand remained healthy initially in the third quarter, though normal seasonality returned in September.BRT Apartments is the owner and operator of Class B and better multi-family assets,mainly in well-situated Sun Belt locations. The company is expected to have benefited from healthy market fundamentals.Particularly, in the third quarter, BRT Apartments' properties in growth markets are likely to have benefited from population growth and job in-migration. Also, a shortage in quality housing is aiding the demand for rental units in its markets.Further, BRT Apartments is likely to have progressed in its efforts to grow and improve its portfolio through targeted dispositions and the acquisition of its partners' remaining interests in several joint ventures.During the said period, BRT announced that the unconsolidated joint venture in which it holds an 80% equity stake accomplished the sale of a 204-unit multifamily property — Waters' Edge — in Columbia, SC, for $32.4 million. The company estimated to recognize an $11.4 million gain on this.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.9 million for third-quarter revenues suggests a significant increase from $7.7 million reported in the year-ago period.Before the third-quarter earnings release, the company's activities were not adequate to gain analysts' confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly FFO per share has remained unchanged at 42 cents in the past month. However, the figure suggests year-over-year growth of 35.5%.Here Is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively predict a surprise in terms of FFO per share for BRT Apartments this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an FFO beat, which is not the case here.BRT Apartments currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Performance of Notable Residential REITsEquity Residential's third-quarter 2022 normalized FFO per share of 92 cents outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 91 cents. Rental income of $695.1 million also exceeded the consensus mark of $694.1 million. On a year-over-year basis, the FFO per share grew 19.5% from 77 cents, while the rental income increased 11.5%.Equity Residential's results reflected healthy demand during the primary leasing season. This residential REIT benefited from the favorable real estate tax and payroll expenses. However, EQR narrowed its full-year guidance for normalized FFO per share.Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc., commonly referred to as MAA, reported a third-quarter 2022 core FFO per share of $2.19, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.09. The reported number improved by 23% year over year.Mid-America Apartment Communities' quarterly results were driven by an increase in the average effective rent per unit for the same-store portfolio. MAA increased its outlook for core FFO growth for the year.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

The company’s quarterly results are likely to reflect growth in revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share.In the last reported quarter, this residential real estate investment trust’s (REIT) adjusted FFO per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.13%.Over the last four quarters, BRT Apartments surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and missed the same on the other, the average beat being 9.29%. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company:BRT Apartments Corp. Price and EPS SurpriseBRT Apartments Corp. Price and EPS SurpriseBRT Apartments Corp. price-eps-surprise | BRT Apartments Corp. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.Factors to ConsiderFor the U.S. apartment market, demand remained healthy initially in the third quarter, though normal seasonality returned in September.BRT Apartments is the owner and operator of Class B and better multi-family assets,mainly in well-situated Sun Belt locations. The company is expected to have benefited from healthy market fundamentals.Particularly, in the third quarter, BRT Apartments’ properties in growth markets are likely to have benefited from population growth and job in-migration. Also, a shortage in quality housing is aiding the demand for rental units in its markets.Further, BRT Apartments is likely to have progressed in its efforts to grow and improve its portfolio through targeted dispositions and the acquisition of its partners’ remaining interests in several joint ventures.During the said period, BRT announced that the unconsolidated joint venture in which it holds an 80% equity stake accomplished the sale of a 204-unit multifamily property — Waters’ Edge — in Columbia, SC, for $32.4 million. The company estimated to recognize an $11.4 million gain on this.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.9 million for third-quarter revenues suggests a significant increase from $7.7 million reported in the year-ago period.Before the third-quarter earnings release, the company’s activities were not adequate to gain analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly FFO per share has remained unchanged at 42 cents in the past month. However, the figure suggests year-over-year growth of 35.5%.Story continuesHere Is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively predict a surprise in terms of FFO per share for BRT Apartments this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an FFO beat, which is not the case here.BRT Apartments currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3.

Rental income of $695.1 million also exceeded the consensus mark of $694.1 million. On a year-over-year basis, the FFO per share grew 19.5% from 77 cents, while the rental income increased 11.5%.Equity Residential’s results reflected healthy demand during the primary leasing season. This residential REIT benefited from the favorable real estate tax and payroll expenses. However, EQR narrowed its full-year guidance for normalized FFO per share.Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. MAA, commonly referred to as MAA, reported a third-quarter 2022 core FFO per share of $2.19, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.09. The reported number improved by 23% year over year.Mid-America Apartment Communities’ quarterly results were driven by an increase in the average effective rent per unit for the same-store portfolio. MAA increased its outlook for core FFO growth for the year.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

For the second quarters of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, GAAP net income was adversely impacted by amortization of acquired intangible assets associated with our previous acquisitions and losses on settlement of debt.Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 was a record at $814.4 million, or $1.46 per diluted share, up from non-GAAP net income of $605.7 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, in the prior year's second fiscal quarter. For the second quarters of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, our non-GAAP results exclude the effect of share-based compensation, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, severance, and other restructuring costs, and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions including legal fees and expenses for litigation and investigations related to our Microsemi acquisition), professional services associated with certain legal matters, non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures and losses on the settlement of debt. For the second quarters of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, our non-GAAP income tax expense is presented based on projected cash taxes for the applicable fiscal year, excluding transition tax payments under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release.Microchip announced today that its Board of Directors declared a record quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 32.8 cents per share, up 9.0% from the cash dividend paid last quarter and up 41.4% from the year ago quarter. The quarterly dividend is payable on December 6, 2022 to stockholders of record on November 22, 2022.""Our fiscal second-quarter results exceeded expectations resulting in yet another quarter of strong growth and profitability,"" said Ganesh Moorthy, President and Chief Executive Officer. ""Record revenue of $2.07 billion grew 5.6% sequentially and 25.7% year over year, driven by broad-based strength in our business. Disciplined execution by our team in combination with our resilient end markets helped to drive record non-GAAP gross margins, operating margins, and earnings per share as we remain focused on executing our Microchip 3.0 strategy, which we believe positions us for long-term success.""Mr. Moorthy added, ""Amid changing economic conditions and ongoing global supply disruption, our business remains strong as we exited the September quarter with the highest unsupported backlog ever. While we see encouraging signs of the supply chain loosening, many of our technology corridors remain constrained despite the careful capacity ramps we continue to implement. As such, we expect capacity to remain tight for specialized, trailing-edge technologies throughout 2022 and into 2023. Our focus on Total Systems Solutions and semiconductor industry megatrends is creating ample growth opportunities as our design win and new products funnel remains healthy.""Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Executive Chair, said, “Microchip’s Board of Directors approved a sequential increase in our dividend of approximately 9% to a record 32.8 cents per share, up from the August dividend of 30.1 cents per share. The dividend announced today represents a 41.4% year-over-year increase, and the board remains committed to an increasing cash return strategy. Given our strong cash flow generation during the September quarter, we are targeting to return $409.7 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the December quarter, and for calendar year 2022 our cash return to shareholders is expected to be approximately $1.57 billion.""Eric Bjornholt, Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, said, ""Our strong cash generation capabilities have helped us to pay down approximately $5.48 billion in debt over the past 17 quarters as we reduced our total debt by another $264.9 million during the September quarter. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leaving the September 2022 quarter was 1.84 times and we are making excellent progress towards our net debt to adjusted EBITDA target of 1.5 times.""Mr. Moorthy concluded, ""Our backlog for the December quarter remains strong, and we have more capacity improvements coming into effect. Demand continues to outpace supply, and we have considerable backlog requested by customers in the December quarter that we currently cannot fulfill until later quarters, despite growing capacity from last quarter. Considering these factors and the economic backdrop, we expect net sales in the December quarter to be up between 3% and 5% sequentially, and we expect to grow sequentially again in the March quarter. At the mid-point of our guidance for the December quarter, net sales would be 22.7% higher than the year-ago quarter.""Microchip's Highlights for the Quarter Ended September 30, 2022:Unveiled the industry’s first terabit-scale secure Ethernet PHY family with port aggregation for enterprise and cloud interconnect.

These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. Microchip Consolidated GuidanceNet Sales$2.135 to $2.177 billion   GAAPNon-GAAP AdjustmentsNon-GAAP(1)Gross Margin67.5% to 67.7%$6.3 to $7.3 million67.8% to 68.0%Operating Expenses(2)30.7% to 30.9%$214.3 to $218.3 million20.7% to 20.9%Operating Income36.6% to 36.9%$220.6 to $225.6 million46.9% to 47.3%Other Expense, net$52.9 to $55.3 million($0.1) to $0.3 million$53.0 to $55.0 millionIncome Tax Provision$134.7 to $176.0 million(3)$41.7 to $69.8 million$93.0 to $106.2 million(4)Net Income$593.3 to $572.8 million$262.3 to $295.6 million$855.6 to $868.4 millionDiluted Common Shares OutstandingApproximately 556.4 to 556.9 million shares Approximately 556.4 to 556.9 million sharesEarnings per Diluted Share$1.03 to $1.07$0.49 to $0.51$1.54 to $1.56(1) See the ""Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section of this release for information regarding our non-GAAP guidance.(2) We are not able to estimate the amount of certain Special Charges and Other, net that may be incurred during the quarter ending December 31, 2022. Therefore, our estimate of GAAP operating expenses excludes certain amounts that may be recognized as Special Charges and Other, net in the quarter ending December 31, 2022.(3) The forecast for GAAP tax expense excludes any unexpected tax events that may occur during the quarter, as these amounts cannot be forecasted.(4) Represents the expected cash tax rate for fiscal 2023, excluding any transition tax payments associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.Microchip's inventory days in the December 2022 quarter are expected to be in the range of 143 to 147 days, compared to 139 days on September 30, 2022. Our actual inventory level will depend on the inventory that our distributors decide to hold to support their customers, overall demand for our products, and our production levels.Capital expenditures for the quarter ending December 31, 2022 are expected to be between $105 million and $125 million. Capital expenditures for all of fiscal 2023 are expected to be between $500 million and $550 million. We continue to add capital equipment to maintain, grow and operate our internal manufacturing capabilities to support the expected growth of our business.Under the GAAP revenue recognition standard, which we adopted on April 1, 2018, we are required to recognize revenue when control of the product changes from us to a customer or distributor. We focus our sales and marketing efforts on creating demand for our products in the end markets we serve and not on moving inventory into our distribution network. We also manage our manufacturing and supply chain operations, including our distributor relationships, towards the goal of having our products available at the time and location the end customer desires.Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures: Our non-GAAP adjustments, where applicable, include the effect of share-based compensation, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, severance, and other restructuring costs, and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions including legal fees and expenses for litigation and investigations related to our Microsemi acquisition), professional services associated with certain legal matters, non-cash interest expense on our convertible debentures and losses on the settlement of debt. For the second quarters of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, our non-GAAP income tax expense is presented based on projected cash taxes for the fiscal year, excluding transition tax payments under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.We are required to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units, and our employee stock purchase plan, and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement. Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant. The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management. Our other non-GAAP adjustments are either non-cash expenses, unusual or infrequent items, or other expenses related to transactions. Management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models.We are using non-GAAP operating expenses in dollars, including non-GAAP research and development expenses and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP other expense, net, and non-GAAP income tax rate, which exclude the items noted above, as applicable, to permit additional analysis of our performance.Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods. Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our underlying operating results. Management uses non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of our business and for compensation purposes. We also use our non-GAAP results when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending. Our determination of these non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations associated with using these non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance. Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results.Generally, gross margin fluctuates over time, driven primarily by the mix of products sold and licensing revenue; variances in manufacturing yields; fixed cost absorption; wafer fab loading levels; costs of wafers from foundries; inventory reserves; pricing pressures in our non-proprietary product lines; and competitive and economic conditions. Operating expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to net sales and profit levels.Diluted Common Shares Outstanding can vary for, among other things, the trading price of our common stock, the exercise of options or vesting of restricted stock units, the potential for incremental dilutive shares from our convertible debentures (additional information regarding our share count is available in the investor relations section of our website under the heading ""Supplemental Financial Information""), and repurchases or issuances of shares of our common stock. The diluted common shares outstanding presented in the guidance table above assumes an average Microchip stock price in the December 2022 quarter between $65 and $70 per share (however, we make no prediction as to what our actual share price will be for such period or any other period and we cannot estimate what our stock option exercise activity will be during the quarter). MICROCHIP

MET reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted operating earnings of $1.21 per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.18. However, the bottom line declined 49% year over year.Adjusted operating revenues of MetLife amounted to $23,690 million, which increased from $17,087 million in the year-ago quarter. The top line surpassed the consensus mark by 19.1%.The better-than-expected third-quarter results were driven by volume growth across segments, solid contributions from the Latin America segment and increased interest rates aiding core spreads. However, the upside was partly offset by reduced private equity returns and increased expenses.MetLife, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMetLife, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMetLife, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | MetLife, Inc. QuoteBehind the HeadlinesAdjusted premiums, fees and other revenues, excluding pension risk transfer (PRT), were $11,061 million, down 3% year over year. Adjusted net investment income fell 27% year over year to $4,163 million in the quarter under review, primarily due to reduced variable investment income stemming from decreased private equity returns.Total expenses of $21,851 million increased from $14,863 million a year ago, due to higher policyholder benefits and claims. The adjusted expense ratio, excluding total notable items related to adjusted other expenses and PRT, increased 140 basis points (bps) year over year to 20.1%.Net income plunged 78% year over year to $331 million due to derivative and investment losses. Adjusted return on equity, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, deteriorated 810 bps year over year to 8.9%.Segmental PerformancesU.S.: The segment reported adjusted earnings of $744 million, which declined 17% year over year in the third quarter due to reduced variable investment income.

Adjusted premiums, fees &amp; other revenues declined 14% year over year to $1,789 million in the third quarter.Latin America: Adjusted earnings of $171 million increased significantly from $29 million a year ago and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $150.5 million, due to lower claims regarding COVID-19, volume growth and increased interest margins stemming from the inflation in Chile. Adjusted premiums, fees &amp; other revenues advanced 14% or 21% on a cc basis year over year to $1,123 million in the segment, due to growing sales.EMEA: The segment’s adjusted earnings were $60 million, which plunged 36% year over year in the third quarter, but beat the consensus mark of $59 million. At cc, adjusted earnings fell 20% year over year due to less favorable underwriting. Adjusted premiums, fees &amp; other revenues of $545 million declined 19% year over year.

Its refineries are upping their crude oil production after Beijing increased its fuel export quotas to 15 million tonnes for 2022 in a bid to boost trade.US oil exports are also benefiting from recent OPEC+ production cuts, according to one analyst.

Enbridge Chief Executive Officer Al Monaco said that supply growth coupled with future demand from planned liquefied natural gas (LNG) export projects was underpinning the expansions.""Given the outlook for Western Canada supply, we are seeing strong customer interest for more egress for LNG exports and downstream access,"" Monaco said in an earnings call.Enbridge said the expansion of the southern part of its system, known as T-South, will add 300 million cubic feet per day (cfpd) of capacity. It will serve customers in the Pacific Northwest and southern B.C., as well as the Woodfibre LNG project that Enbridge bought a C$1.5 billion stake in earlier this year.The company expects to file a regulatory application for the T-South expansion in 2024 and is targeting 2028 to start operations.Enbridge is also looking at adding about 500 million cfpd of capacity to the northern section of the system, T-North, which connects the gas-producing region around Fort Nelson in northeastern B.C. to the southern part of the pipeline network.The open season for T-North is expected to end on Jan. 10, 2023.Enbridge shares were trading 1.6% higher at C$54.51 on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Friday after the company reported a higher third-quarter adjusted profit.

Details of G7 price cap aimed at alleviating constraints on Russian flows outside the EU are still under discussion.RECESSION FEARSOn the bearish side, fears of a recession in the United States, the world's biggest oil consumer, grew on Thursday after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said it was ""very premature"" to be thinking about pausing interest rate hikes.""The spectre of further rate hikes dimmed hopes of a pick-up in demand,"" ANZ Research analysts said in a note.The Bank of England warned on Thursday that it thinks Britain has entered a recession and the economy might not grow for another two years.Underscoring demand concerns, Saudi Arabia lowered December official selling prices (OSPs) for its flagship Arab Light crude to Asia by 40 cents to a premium of $5.45 a barrel versus the Oman/Dubai average.The cut was in line with trade sources' forecasts, which were based on a weaker outlook for Chinese demand.Looking into next week, investors are awaiting the U.S. Energy Information Administration's short-term energy outlook and the November U.S. Consumer Price Index for insight on the pace of inflation.(Additional reporting by Julia Payne in London and Sonali Paul in Melbourne and Jeslyn Lerh in SingaporeEditing by Chris Reese and Nick Zieminski)]"

Holding on to stock would have meant their investment would be worth less now than it was at the time of sale. Thus selling at an average price of US$102, which is higher than the current price, may have been the best decision.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Morgan Stanley The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Morgan StanleyIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, Eric Grossman, sold US$3.4m worth of shares at a price of US$102 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$83.62). So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.In total, Morgan Stanley insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Morgan Stanley insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$353m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Do The Morgan Stanley Insider Transactions Indicate?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Morgan Stanley insiders selling.

Specifically, we decided to study Salesforce's  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Salesforce How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Salesforce is:0.9% = US$536m ÷ US$60b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.01 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Salesforce's Earnings Growth And 0.9% ROEIt is quite clear that Salesforce's ROE is rather low. Even when compared to the industry average of 13%, the ROE figure is pretty disappointing. Despite this, surprisingly, Salesforce saw an exceptional 29% net income growth over the past five years. We reckon that there could be other factors at play here. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.Story continuesWe then performed a comparison between Salesforce's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 26% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for CRM? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Salesforce Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Given that Salesforce doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.ConclusionOn the whole, we do feel that Salesforce has some positive attributes. Even in spite of the low rate of return, the company has posted impressive earnings growth as a result of reinvesting heavily into its business. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

It’s fine to learn about this development, but Salesforce’s forward financial guidance should be top-of-mind. All things considered, it’s difficult to offer anything higher than a “D” rating for Salesforce.This certainly isn’t to suggest that the fields of customer relationship management (or CRM) and cloud computing won’t demonstrate substantial growth over the coming years. However, financial traders must always time their investments carefully.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPlus, it’s important to have a rock-solid reason to invest in a particular business at a specific time. Right now, the timing doesn’t seem right to take a long position in Salesforce shares, even if a big-money investor already owns a stake.CRMSalesforce$159.82Starboard Stake Gives CRM Stock a BumpMake no mistake about it: CRM stock has been a terrible performer over the past year. The shares were worth $300 apiece in early November of 2021. More recently, they traded at around $160.The main reason Salesforce shares were near $160 instead of $140 in late October was because of a headline-grabbing news item. Reportedly, Starboard Value took a large-sized position in Salesforce.Starboard is known as an activist investor, and the firm manages around $6.2 billion in assets. Because activist investors tend to take risks sometimes, we can see why Starboard’s stake caught people’s attention.However, the size of the activist investor’s position in CRM stock isn’t currently known. Besides, Starboard Value founder Jeff Smith opined that the valuation discount in Salesforce shares is largely due to a “subpar mix of growth and profitability.”Story continuesFurthermore, Smith reportedly observed that, in recent years, Salesforce “is not generating meaningful operating leverage relative to peers.” That’s not exactly what most people would call a ringing endorsement of the company.Salesforce Reduced Its Revenue OutlookAdditionally, let’s not forget that this is just one investor’s stake and assessment. None of this should be taken as more important than Salesforce’s own forward guidance.Plus, that guidance isn’t necessarily as optimistic as some investors might have expected it to be. Sure, CRM stock got a boost on the Starboard news, but let’s not forget that Salesforce lowered its own revenue forecast not long ago.As you may recall, Salesforce did increase its revenue on a year-over-year basis during the company’s second fiscal quarter of 2023. However, Salesforce’s operating expenses also increased across all three major listed categories (research and development, marketing and sales, and general and administrative).In addition, Salesforce reduced its fiscal 2023 revenue and profit guidance. Specifically, the company lowered its FY2023 earnings forecast from $4.74 to $4.76 per share to $4.71 to $4.73. Also, Salesforce cut its full-year revenue outlook from $31.7 billion to 31.8 billion, to a range of $30.9 billion to $31 billion.Be Careful with CRM StockSalesforce’s shareholders may have booked gains in the short term. However, they’re not doing well in 2022 year-to-date. It’s certainly not going to inspire confidence, moreover, that Salesforce reduced its FY2023 financial outlook.Again, this doesn’t mean that Salesforce is dead on arrival. It might be worthwhile to reevaluate the company’s prospects later on. As they say in the world of financial trading, though, timing is everything.And right now, just because an activist investor took a stake in CRM stock, doesn’t necessarily mean you have to. Hence, it’s best to be careful and consider other opportunities now.On the date of publication, neither Louis Navellier nor the InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article held (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.Louis Navellier, who has been called “one of the most important money managers of our time,” has broken the silence in this shocking “tell all” video… exposing one of the most shocking events in our country’s history… and the one move every American needs to make today.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayEarly Bitcoin Millionaire Reveals His Next Big Crypto Trade “On Air”It doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

Governor Newsom signed Assembly Bill (AB) 847 which allows mylar or metallic balloons to be sold in California only if those balloons do not cause electrical faults when making contact with overhead distribution lines.Metallic balloons conduct electricity and can pose a significant threat to public safety if released into the air. If they float into powerlines, they can disrupt electric service to an entire neighborhood, cause significant property damage and potentially result in serious injuries.Here’s an example of what can happen when metallic balloons become loose and hit utility power lines.Specifically, the new law requires balloons sold in the state after 2027 to meet Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineer standards. The standard requires that balloons must not be conductive at distribution voltages up to 38 kilovolts (kV). Of the 47 fires caused by metallic balloons in 2020-2021, 44 (90%) occurred on powerlines with voltage below 35 kV. Those fires could have been prevented under the new law.""Balloon-caused outages have been on the rise in recent years and have the potential to cause ignitions when interacting with electrical assets. This legislation will help minimize that risk and is part of our unwavering focus on keeping our customers and our hometowns safe,"" said Sumeet Singh, PG&amp;E Executive Vice President and Chief Risk and Safety Officer.Metallic balloon-related outages can pose a wildfire risk. In 2015, a metallic balloon coming into contact with overhead lines sparked the Webb Fire in Butte County which burned 75 acres. Since 2018, the number of balloon-related ignitions has increased in frequency.Balloon-related outages also impact electric reliability. In 2021, metallic balloons that drifted into PG&amp;E power lines caused more than 600 outages, a 27 percent increase from the previous year and the highest number of balloon-related outages that PG&amp;E has seen in a decade.Story continuesThanks to the new legislation, sales of non-compliant celebratory balloons would be banned after January 1, 2027. In the meantime, PG&amp;E reminds customers to follow these important safety tips for metallic balloons:""Look Up and Live!"" Use caution and avoid celebrating with metallic balloons near overhead electric lines.Make sure helium-filled metallic balloons are securely tied to a weight that is heavy enough to prevent them from floating away. Never remove the weight.When possible, keep metallic balloons indoors. Never permit metallic balloons to be released outside, for everyone's safety.Do not bundle metallic balloons together.Never attempt to retrieve any type of balloon, kite, drone or toy that becomes caught in a power line. Leave it alone, and immediately call PG&amp;E at 1-800-743-5000 to report the problem.Never go near a power line that has fallen to the ground or is dangling in the air. Always assume downed electric lines are energized and extremely dangerous. Stay far away, keep others away and immediately call 911 to alert the police and fire departments.

She’s now News Corp.’s vice president of federal government affairs, the company said on Wednesday night.Bissex previously worked for Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, and Colorado Republication Representative Ken Buck -- two of the Republican party’s most fervent critics of the big tech companies.The move comes as News Corp. and a handful of smaller tech companies gear up for a potential Republican takeover of the House or Senate. News Corp. and Fox Corp., which are both owned by media mogul Rupert Murdoch, have stepped up their lobbying push to regulate the tech giants. They’ve targeted Republicans with the message that the companies have accumulated too much power and control over the digital ecosystem.News Corp., which owns Dow Jones &amp; Co. and other major media organizations, claims that the tech companies don’t adequately compensate publishers for links to articles and news segments. Murdoch has specifically called out the internet giants for allegedly censoring conservatives online, a common GOP talking point.The Bissex hire is part of a broader shakeup of News Corp.’s lobbying operation after longtime global head of government affairs, Toni Bush, retired earlier this year. Bush was replaced by her colleague Todd Thorpe, who now heads the office.Story continuesMeanwhile, the major tech companies have hired up a slew of Capitol Hill aides. Amazon in August hired Judd Smith, formerly a senior aide to Republican Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley, to bolster its efforts to stymie a highly-anticipated antitrust bill aimed at US internet giants.

78,0bf6cf7b-9928-3c25-b26b-fd3d9404c926,MRO,2022-11-04,7 Cheap Large-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Surge Higher,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-cheap-large-cap-stocks-124333953.html,1667302233,STORY,"['AMX', 'MOS', 'CNQ', 'PBR-A', 'MRO', 'SU']","[Cheap large-cap stocks are in for a boost sooner than you may have thought.With recent economic data raising hopes of a “soft landing,” stocks have been trending higher in recent weeks. Yet while the current market perception may be that “the worst is over,” some analysts are arguing that it’s premature to say that a recovery has kicked off, or is imminent.There are plenty of large-cap names that have performed well during the recent rally and are likely to perform well. The reasons for this are twofold. First, being “cheap,” or undervalued, stocks, these particular plays are less at risk of multiple compression, in the event of further sharp interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSecond, many cheap large-cap stocks are either resistant to a continued downturn and/or are benefiting from secular growth trends. Consider adding them to your portfolio.FFord$13.42FCXFreeport-McMoRan$31.87KMIKinder Morgan$18.01KRKroger$47.25METMetLife$73.51MROMarathon Oil$30.68OXYOccidental Petroleum$73.82Ford (F)Ford logo badge on grill of carSource: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.comFrom early 2021 to early 2022, Ford (NYSE:F) shares were on a tear. During this timeframe, this “old school” automotive stock more than doubled in price, as the market became confident in its efforts to transform into primarily a maker of electric vehicles (or EVs).Flash forward to now, and F stock has delivered a mixed performance. Shares have fallen around 39% so far this year, due to recession fears, as well as the cooling down in enthusiasm for EV plays.However, even as Ford is contending with multiple headwinds at present, as its electrification efforts continue, the automaker’s long-term prospects remain very promising.Shares are cheap at current levels, trading at 6.7 times earnings. With its EV catalyst still intact, this stock could continue to slowly (but steadily) continue its comeback. This makes F stock (which earns a B rating in Portfolio Grader) a great long-term buy.Story continuesFreeport-McMoRan (FCX)Freeport-McMoRan sign on a Freeport-McMoRan office building in Phoenix, Arizona.Source: MICHAEL A JACKSON FILMS / Shutterstock.comFreeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) is another of the cheap large-cap stocks beginning to recover. The copper miner’s shares have whipsawed throughout the year, in line with copper prices.Boosted higher by the commodities rally sparked by Russia’s Ukraine invasion, FCX stock has until recently been knocked lower by concerns about falling demand, due to China’s economic slowdown.However, following the company’s recent strong earnings report, the near-term forecast may not be as bleak as the market currently believes. As CEO Richard Adkerson argued on the post-earnings conference call, Freeport-McMoRan has “no problem selling copper.”Demand for the metal keeps rising. The EV megatrend could continue to help counter the impact of a possible global recession. This may enable FCX stock (earning a B in Portfolio Grader), reasonably priced at 14 times earnings, to continue making a partial recovery in the near-term, and possibly hit new highs over a longer timeframe.Kinder Morgan (KMI)Kinder Morgan logo on a sign outside the company headquarters in Houston.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comShares in Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI), one of the largest oil and gas pipeline companies, continue to bounce back, after nearly re-testing lows during the September stock market sell-off.While overall a mixed earnings report, Kinder Morgan did report double-digit earnings and distributable cash flow growth.This points to continued dividend growth for high-yielding KMI stock (forward yield of 6.25%). Over the past five years, KMI’s dividend has grown by an average of 17.1% annually. These payouts provide investors with steady returns, and the growth of such payouts opens the door for continued price appreciation.Trading at a reasonable earnings multiple of 15.3, KMI could continue to climb, in tandem with earnings/dividend growth. That makes this midstream energy play (which earns a B rating in Portfolio Grader) a great opportunity. Shares could continue to recover in the near-term and generate strong returns over a long timeframe.Kroger (KR)Kroger (KR) Supermarket. The Kroger Co. is One of the World's Largest Grocery Retailers.Source: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.comGrocery store operator Kroger (NYSE:KR) has successfully stayed one step ahead of inflation thus far. This, plus its reputation as a recession-resistant “safe stock,” has helped keep its shares in the green throughout 2022.More recently, a new uncertainty about KR stock (B-rated in Portfolio Grader) has emerged. That would be news of the company’s plans to merge with competitor Albertsons Companies (NYSE:ACI).Yet while possible antitrust-related objections result in the deal failing to secure regulatory approval, this combination could be one that pays off handsomely for investors.As InvestorPlace’s Dana Blankenhorn discussed Oct. 14, this mega-merger may create a grocery store colossus that can better compete with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and other large retailers.Albertsons also sports a lower earnings multiple (6.9 times earnings) than Kroger (11.5 times earnings). This deal could be very accretive to earnings, even before cost savings are taken into account.MetLife (MET)the MetLife logo displayed on the outside of a buildingSource: Osugi / Shutterstock.comIn 2022, “boring stocks” have been beautiful, and MetLife (NYSE:MET) is no exception. Shares in the mammoth life insurance and financial services firm are up around 15.7% year to date.Even with this moderate price appreciation, MET stock (which earns a B in Portfolio Grader) remains cheap. MET’s current price-to-earnings ratio is only 10.1. This may not be out of the ordinary for insurers, yet this valuation may be too low, given the prospect of much higher earnings in 2023.As seen in recent financial results, MetLife is experiencing premium and fee growth, but has been temporarily affected by the sharp rise in interest rates.Yet as the impact of rising rates turns from a negative (one-time investment and derivative losses) to a positive (higher yield from its investment portfolio), the insurer’s earnings are expected to grow by around 15.75% next year.Marathon Oil (MRO)Marathon Oil gas station carport on sunny day with blue sky backgroundSource: Jonathan Weiss/shutterstock.comLike most oil and gas exploration and production (or E&amp;P) stocks, Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) has knocked it out of the park performance-wise over the past year.In the last twelve months, Marathon shares have surged to the tune of 83.3%.Yet while another similarly-sized jump may not be in the cards over the next twelve months, Undervalued MRO stock (trading at a low P/E ratio of 6.5) could nonetheless continue to deliver above-average returns to investors. With crude oil prices expected to remain high, this E&amp;P company’s earnings will stay high as well.Management plans to return most of these earnings back to shareholders. Mainly, through the repurchase of shares. The company has also raised its quarterly dividend by one cent per share, or 12.5%. These return-of-capital efforts could keep MRO stock (A-rated in Portfolio Grader) moving in the right direction.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is another E&amp;P stock that’s both cheap (trading for 7 times earnings) and top-rated (A rating) in Portfolio Grader, but unlike Marathon Oil, this oil company has other catalysts.As I discussed recently, the accumulation of additional shares in the company by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A,NYSE:BRK.B) has been another driver for OXY stock this year. With regulatory approval to raise Berkshire’s stake to up to 50%, subsequent purchases could help shares inch higher.Alongside this catalyst, Oxy has a longer-term clean energy catalyst as well, with its big bet on carbon capture. With this emerging technology getting a major boost from the Inflation Reduction Act, the company is well-positioned to turn carbon capture into a profitable sideline business.All of this points to further gains ahead for A-rated OXY stock.On the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in F, KMI, KR, MRO and OXY.

This compares to earnings of $2.35 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4.17%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this communications equipment maker would post earnings of $1.87 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.07, delivering a surprise of 10.70%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Motorola , which belongs to the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry, posted revenues of $2.37 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.60%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.11 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Motorola shares have lost about 11.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -21.1%.What's Next for Motorola?While Motorola has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Motorola: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $3.43 on $2.51 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $10.07 on $8.86 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Wireless Equipment is currently in the top 14% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the same industry, ViaSat (VSAT), is yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on November 8.This provider of satellite and wireless networking technology is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.22 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +450%.

Details regarding these non-GAAP adjustments and the use of non-GAAP measures are included later in this news release.OTHER SELECTED FINANCIAL RESULTSRevenue - Sales were $2.4 billion, up 13% from the year-ago quarter driven by growth in North America and International. Revenue from acquisitions was $32 million and currency headwinds were $66 million in the quarter. The Products and Systems Integration segment grew 15%, driven by growth in land mobile radio (LMR) and video security and access control (video). The Software and Services segment grew 8%, driven by growth in video, LMR services and command center software.Operating margin - GAAP operating margin was 15.7% of sales, down from 21.4% in the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by a fixed asset impairment charge in the amount of $147 million related to the now expected exit from the Emergency Services Network (ESN) contract in the U.K. Non-GAAP operating margin was 28.5% of sales, up 220 basis points from 26.3% in the year-ago quarter, driven by higher sales, higher gross margin and improved operating leverage, primarily in the Products and Systems Integration segment.Taxes - The GAAP effective tax rate was 15.9%, down from 24.0% in the year-ago quarter. The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 19.7%, down from 22.4% in the year-ago quarter. Both the GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates declined primarily due to higher benefits from stock-based compensation recognized in the current year.Cash flow - Operating cash flow was $388 million, compared to $376 million in the year-ago quarter. Free cash flow was $318 million, compared to $315 million in the year-ago quarter. Both the operating cash flow and free cash flow for the quarter increased primarily due to higher earnings (adjusted for non-cash charges), partially offset by an increase in working capital, driven primarily by higher inventory.Capital allocation - During the quarter, the company paid $132 million in cash dividends, repurchased $94 million of shares and incurred $70 million of capital expenditures. Additionally, the company closed the acquisition of Barrett Communications for $18 million, net of cash acquired.Backlog - The company ended the quarter with record Q3 backlog of $13.5 billion, up 19% or $2.1 billion from the year-ago quarter, inclusive of $826 million of unfavorable currency. Products and SI segment backlog was up 35%, or $1.2 billion. The growth was primarily driven by strong LMR and video demand. Software and Services segment backlog was up 11% or $876 million, driven by the extension of the Airwave contract in the fourth quarter of 2021 and an increase in multi-year software and services contracts in North America, partially offset by $722 million of unfavorable currency and a $99 million reduction for the now expected exit from the ESN contract.Story continuesNOTABLE WINS AND ACHIEVEMENTSSoftware and Services$43M services renewal for the state of Maryland$17M PTT over broadband order for a customer in the Middle East$15M services renewal for the city of Phoenix, AZ$7M command center software renewal for Will County, IL$4M body-worn camera order for the Texas Department of Public Safety$4M command center software suite order for Ellis County, TXProducts and Systems Integration$400M+ 25 year Systems Integration agreement in Israel$165M P25 System and APX NEXT devices award for Miami-Dade County, FL$67M P25 order for Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority$45M P25 order for a customer in Africa$29M P25 subscriber order for a U.S. Federal customer$18M TETRA order for a customer in Europe$5M fixed video order for a major transportation company in the North AfricaBUSINESS OUTLOOKFourth quarter 2022 - The company expects revenue growth of approximately 9%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. The company expects non-GAAP EPS in the range of $3.40 to $3.45 per share. This assumes approximately $90 million in foreign exchange headwinds, approximately 172 million fully diluted shares, and an effective tax rate of approximately 23%.Full-year 2022 - The company now expects revenue growth of between 9.25% and 9.5%, up from its prior guidance of approximately 8%, and non-GAAP EPS of between $10.17 and $10.22 per share, up from its prior guidance of between $10.03 and $10.13 per share. This outlook assumes approximately $220 million in foreign exchange headwinds, approximately 172 million fully diluted shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 20.5%.The company has not quantitatively reconciled its guidance for forward-looking non-GAAP metrics to their most comparable GAAP measures because the company does not provide specific guidance for the various reconciling items as certain items that impact these measures have not occurred, are out of the company’s control, or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP financial metric is not available without unreasonable effort. Please note that the unavailable reconciling items could significantly impact the company’s results.RECENT EVENTSCMA UPDATEIn October 2021, the United Kingdom’s Competition and Markets Authority (the CMA) announced that it had opened a market investigation into the Mobile Radio Network for the Police and Emergency Services. This investigation affects Airwave, the company’s private mobile radio communications network that it acquired in 2016. Airwave provides mission-critical voice and data communications to public emergency service agencies in Great Britain. In October 2022, the CMA published a provisional decision with its findings regarding competition and proposed remedies. The company disagrees with the CMA’s provisional decision and will continue to work with the CMA to demonstrate the value of the Airwave network and pursue its legal avenues to protect Airwave’s contractual position.ESN MATTERSDuring the third quarter of 2022, the company made a business decision to begin negotiations regarding an early exit from its ESN contract with the Home Office of the United Kingdom. As a result, the company now believes the future service potential of the assets is limited, and accordingly has recognized a fixed asset impairment loss of $147 million related to assets constructed and used in the deployment of the ESN contract.MACROECONOMIC EVENTSDuring the third quarter of 2022, the company continued to operate under challenging market conditions, influenced by events such as those discussed below.Russia-Ukraine ConflictDuring the first quarter of 2022, in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the company suspended all sales, provision of services and shipments of its products to Russia and Belarus. Russia, Ukraine and Belarus do not constitute a material portion of the company's business. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the company's net sales in Russia and Belarus were less than $25 million. While the company does not anticipate that the current posture of the Russia-Ukraine conflict will materially and adversely affect its results of operations, the conflict is still ongoing and future impacts, including those relating to an escalation of the conflict's current scope or expansion of the conflict's economic disruption, could materially and adversely affect the company's results of operations. During the first nine months of 2022, the company indirectly experienced impacts from the Russia-Ukraine conflict (as further described below). The conflict has and may continue to have a significant impact on the global macroeconomic and geopolitical environments, including increased volatility in capital and commodity markets, rapid changes to regulatory conditions (including the use of sanctions), supply chain and operational challenges for multinational corporations, inflationary pressures and an increased risk of cybersecurity incidents. For a more complete discussion of the risks the company encounters in its business, please refer to Part I, Item 1A, ""Risk Factors"" in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 and Part II, Item 1A, ""Risk Factors"" in the company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended July 2, 2022.COVID-19, Supply Chain Disruptions &amp; Inflationary Cost EnvironmentThe company's supply chain has been impacted by global issues related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the inflationary cost environment throughout the first nine months of 2022, particularly with respect to materials in the semiconductor market, including part shortages, increased freight costs, diminished transportation capacity and labor constraints. This has resulted in disruptions in the company's supply chain, as well as difficulties and delays in procuring certain semiconductor components. Since the latter part of the fourth quarter of 2021, cost increases have been driven by elevated lead times and increased material costs, in particular the need to purchase semiconductor components from alternative sources, including brokers. The company anticipates increased costs to procure materials within the semiconductor market to continue throughout 2022. Further, the company anticipates the broader impact of inflationary pressures and increased material and supply chain costs and disruptions to continue throughout 2022. The company is closely monitoring its supply chain, including impacts from manufacturing lockdowns related to the spread of COVID-19 in China which continue to disrupt the semiconductor supply market. Accordingly, in the first nine months of 2022 the company focused on improving its supplier network, engineering alternative designs and working to reduce supply shortages. The company is actively managing its inventory in an effort to minimize supply chain disruptions and enable continuity of supply and services to its customers, and it expects to maintain elevated levels of inventory until supply constraints have been remediated.In order to combat rising inflation in the U.S., the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates multiple times since the beginning of 2022. The increase in U.S. dollar interest rates and overall market conditions have led to significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other global currencies in 2022. The strong U.S. dollar reduced the impact of cash generated from the company's foreign operations during the first nine months of 2022, driven by revenues and costs that are denominated in foreign currencies, which has negatively impacted, and which the company expects to continue to impact, its operating cash flows and net earnings throughout 2022.Although the macroeconomic environment continued to introduce challenges in the first nine months of 2022, the company is encouraged by customer demand for its products and services. Specifically, in the Software and Services segment, with the largely recurring nature of the business and the strong backlog position, the company continues to expect that the impact to operating margin will be limited throughout 2022. While the company is encouraged by strong backlog and growth in its Products and Systems Integration segment in the first nine months of 2022, which the company expects to continue to grow for the remainder of 2022, supply constraints continue to impact the business and the company expects demand for its products will continue to out-pace its ability to obtain semiconductor component supply throughout 2022. Where appropriate, the company has taken pricing actions around its product and service offerings to mitigate its exposure to inflationary pressures on its businesses and benefited from these adjustments during the third quarter of 2022. The company expects to further benefit from such adjustments during the fourth quarter of 2022. Further, demand continues to be supported with ongoing sources of government funding. In March 2021, the President of the United States signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (""ARPA""), which is intended to provide economic stimulus, specifically additional funding to state and local governments, education and healthcare, as well as other funding relief provisions, in order to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company experienced the positive impact of the ARPA funding on its business and results of operations during the first nine months of 2022 and anticipates that the ARPA will continue to have a positive impact throughout the remainder of 2022.CONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCAST Motorola Solutions will host its quarterly conference call beginning at 4 p.m. U.S. Central Time (5 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time) on Thursday, November 3.

An archive of the webcast will be available for a limited period of time thereafter.CONSOLIDATED GAAP RESULTS (presented in millions, except per share data)A comparison of results from operations is as follows:Q3 2022Q3 2021Net sales$2,373$2,107Gross margin$1,031$1,045Operating earnings$373$451Amounts attributable to Motorola Solutions, Inc. common stockholdersNet earnings$279$307Diluted EPS$1.63$1.76Weighted average diluted common shares outstanding171.5174.1USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATIONIn addition to the results presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (""GAAP"") included in this news release, Motorola Solutions also has included non-GAAP measurements of results, including free cash flow, non-GAAP operating earnings, non-GAAP EPS, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP tax rate and organic revenue. The company has provided these non-GAAP measurements to help investors better understand its core operating performance, enhance comparisons of core operating performance from period-to-period and allow better comparisons of its operating performance to that of its competitors. Among other things, management uses these operating results, excluding the identified items, to evaluate the performance of its businesses and to evaluate results relative to certain incentive compensation targets. Management uses operating results excluding these items because it believes these measurements enable it to make better period-to-period evaluations of the financial performance of its core business operations. The non-GAAP measurements are intended only as a supplement to the comparable GAAP measurements and the company compensates for the limitations inherent in the use of non-GAAP measurements by using GAAP measures in conjunction with the non-GAAP measurements. As a result, investors should consider these non-GAAP measurements in addition to, and not in substitution for or as superior to, GAAP measurements.Reconciliations: Details and reconciliations of such non-GAAP measurements to the corresponding GAAP measurements can be found at the end of this news release.Free cash flow: Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. The company believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as the basis for comparing its performance and coverage ratios with other companies in the company's industries, although the company's measure of free cash flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. This measure is also used as a component of incentive compensation.Organic revenue: Organic revenue reflects net sales calculated under GAAP excluding net sales from acquired business owned for less than four full quarters. The company believes organic revenue provides useful information for evaluating the periodic growth of the business on a consistent basis and provides for a meaningful period-to-period comparison and analysis of trends in the business.Non-GAAP operating earnings, non-GAAP EPS and non-GAAP operating margin each excludes highlighted items, including share-based compensation expenses and intangible assets amortization expense, as follows:Highlighted items: The company has excluded the effects of highlighted items including, but not limited to, acquisition-related transaction fees, tangible and intangible asset impairments, reorganization of business charges, certain non-cash pension adjustments, legal settlements and other contingencies, gains and losses on investments and businesses, Hytera-related legal expenses, gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt and the income tax effects of significant tax matters, from its non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measurements because the company believes that these historical items do not reflect expected future operating earnings or expenses and do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the company's current operating performance or comparisons to the company's past operating performance. For the purposes of management's internal analysis over operating performance, the company uses financial statements that exclude highlighted items, as these charges do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the company's current operating performance or comparisons to the company's past operating performance.Hytera-Related Legal Expenses: On March 14, 2017, the company filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (the ""Court"") against Hytera Communications Corporation Limited of Shenzhen, China; Hytera America, Inc.; and Hytera Communications America (West), Inc. (collectively, ""Hytera""), alleging trade secret theft and copyright infringement and seeking, among other things, injunctive relief, compensatory damages, and punitive damages. On February 14, 2020, the company announced that a jury decided in the company's favor in its trade secret theft and copyright infringement case. In connection with this verdict, the jury awarded the company $345.8 million in compensatory damages and $418.8 million in punitive damages, for a total of $764.6 million. On December 17, 2020, the Court denied the company’s motion for a permanent injunction, finding instead that Hytera must pay the company a forward-looking reasonable royalty on products that use the company’s stolen trade secrets. As the parties were unable to agree on a reasonable royalty rate, the Court entered an order favorable to the company on December 15, 2021, and, consistent with the company's requests, set royalty rates for Hytera's sale of relevant products from July 1, 2019 forward. On July 5, 2022, the Court ordered that Hytera pay into a third-party escrow on July 31, 2022, the royalties owed to the company based on the sale of relevant products from July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2022. Hytera failed to make the required royalty payment on July 31, 2022. On August 1, 2022, Hytera filed a motion to modify or stay the Court’s previous July 5, 2022 royalty order. On August 3, 2022, the company filed a motion seeking to hold Hytera in civil contempt for violating the royalty order by not making the required royalty payment.In response to the Court's decision to award the company $764.6 million in compensatory and punitive damages, Hytera motioned for certain equitable relief, which the Court granted on January 8, 2021, reducing the $764.6 million judgment award to $543.7 million. That same day, the Court also granted the company’s motion for pre-judgment interest. On August 10, 2021, the Court ruled that Hytera must pay the company $51.1 million in pre-judgment interest and $2.6 million in costs. On March 25, 2021, the Court entered rulings favorable to the company with respect to several of the company's post-trial motions, including the company's motion for attorneys' fees and its motion to require Hytera to turn over certain assets in satisfaction of the company’s judgment award. On October 15, 2021, the Court granted the company’s request for $34.2 million in attorneys’ fees against Hytera. On September 29, 2021, the company filed two additional motions with the Court, requesting the Court to reconsider its order denying the company’s request for an injunction, and requesting that the Court enforce its ruling requiring Hytera to turn over certain assets in satisfaction of the company's judgment award, or, in the alternative, hold Hytera in contempt. On July 5, 2022, the Court denied both motions.On September 7, 2021, Hytera filed a notice of appeal of the Court’s judgment with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit (the ""Court of Appeals""). The Court of Appeals dismissed the notice of appeal on February 16, 2022 after determining that such appeal was premature. On August 2, 2022, after the Court denied the motions described on July 5, 2022, Hytera filed a renewed notice of appeal in the Court of Appeals. The company filed its cross-appeal on August 5, 2022.Separate from the company's litigation with Hytera, on May 27, 2020, Hytera America, Inc. and Hytera Communications America (West), Inc. each filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California (the ""Bankruptcy Court""). The company filed motions in the Bankruptcy Court to dismiss the bankruptcy proceedings in July 2020. On January 22, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court entered an agreed order, allowing a partial sale of Hytera's U.S. assets in the bankruptcy proceedings. The proposed sale does not include Hytera inventory accused of including the company’s intellectual property. On February 11, 2022, the Court entered an order to confirm the liquidation plan for the two Hytera entities and the distributions were made on February 25, 2022 to the creditors, including $13 million to the company. The gain was recorded to Other charges (income).Management typically considers legal expenses associated with defending the company's intellectual property as ""normal and recurring"" and accordingly, Hytera-related legal expenses were included in both the company's GAAP and non-GAAP operating income for fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019. The company anticipates further expenses associated with Hytera-related litigation; however, as of 2020, the company believes that these expenses are no longer a part of the ""normal and recurring"" legal expenses incurred to operate its business. In addition, as any contingent or actual gains associated with the Hytera litigation are recognized, they will be similarly excluded from the company's non-GAAP operating income, consistent with the company's treatment of the $13 million of proceeds realized in Q1 2022. The company believes after the jury award, the presentation of excluding both Hytera-related legal expenses and gains related to awards better aligns with how management evaluates the company's ongoing underlying business performance.Share-based compensation expenses: The company has excluded share-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measurements. Although share-based compensation is a key incentive offered to the company’s employees and the company believes such compensation contributed to the revenue earned during the periods presented and also believes it will contribute to the generation of future period revenues, the company continues to evaluate its performance excluding share-based compensation expenses primarily because it represents a significant non-cash expense. Share-based compensation expenses will recur in future periods.Intangible assets amortization expense: The company has excluded intangible assets amortization expense from its non-GAAP operating expenses and net earnings measurements primarily because it represents a non-cash expense and because the company evaluates its performance excluding intangible assets amortization expense. Amortization of intangible assets is consistent in amount and frequency but is significantly affected by the timing and size of the company’s acquisitions. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to the company’s revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to the company’s future period revenues as well. Intangible assets amortization expense will recur in future periods.FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTSThis news release contains ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of applicable federal securities law.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) look very promising so lets take a look.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Microsoft, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.31 = US$85b ÷ (US$360b - US$87b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, Microsoft has an ROCE of 31%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 10% earned by companies in a similar industry. See our latest analysis for Microsoft roceIn the above chart we have measured Microsoft's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Microsoft.What Can We Tell From Microsoft's ROCE Trend?We like the trends that we're seeing from Microsoft. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 31%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 38% more capital is being employed now too. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.What We Can Learn From Microsoft's ROCEA company that is growing its returns on capital and can consistently reinvest in itself is a highly sought after trait, and that's what Microsoft has. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.Story continuesIf you'd like to know about the risks facing Microsoft, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should be aware of.High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

Microsoft CEO expects technology spending as a percent of gross domestic product (GDP) to jump from about 5% now to 10% in 10 years and that Microsoft will continue to capture market share within the technology sector.Microsoft’s shares underperformed during the period because the company slightly missed analysts' estimates. The miss was due to foreign currency headwinds, weakening small business and consumer demand, and decreasing advertising activity. However, Microsoft showed that despite consumer, advertising, and small and medium business weakness; the company's main business, the digitization of corporate America, continues to grow.

Indeed, worries of a recession at this moment have been quashed by this impressive report, leading to strength in most Dow stocks relative to other sector such as tech, for example, of late.That said, investors benefit from questioning the peculiarly strong report. Knowing which sectors did the heavy lifting with these GDP numbers is important. In this regard, investors may want to take caution with some Dow stocks, which have not been the stalwarts they used to.U.S. GDP rose because the government increased its spending. Exports increased, driven by strong demand for U.S. energy. However, winter is coming. This will limit the country’s ability to send more energy products abroad. Conversely, a decrease in housing costs and lower imports over time signals ongoing weakness for consumer goods. Some of the strongest U.S. brands survived the starting phase of this economic decline. However, that luck may run out.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsInflation is raising the cost of nearly everything. This has not deterred customers from spending more on services, such as travel (yet). However, consumers increasingly will eventually need to offset the negative impact of lower disposable income. As a result, it’s widely expected that consumers will cut non-essential spending.As consumers dip into their savings, these seven Dow stocks may best be avoided right now.BABoeing$149.44GSGoldman Sachs$348.82HDHome Depot$295.45MMM3M$124.78MSFTMicrosoft$224.75NKENike$92.67WBAWalgreens Boots Alliance$36.36Boeing (BA)Boeing (BA) passenger airplane with open exit door, passenger windows, cargo door, close up view of Boeing logoSource: vaalaa / Shutterstock.comStarting off our list of Dow stocks to sell is the embattled aerospace company, Boeing (NYSE:BA). Indeed, Boeing is no longer the great company that it once was. After the company took years to resolve Boeing 787 safety issues, it resumed deliveries in the last quarter.Story continuesIn the third quarter, Boeing delivered only nine 787 airplanes. The company lost $6.18 per share, largely due to fixed-price defense development programs. That said, Q3 is not the only quarter where Boeing booked a write-down. This is a company that’s been losing money for some time on specific parts of its business which should provide stability.On Boeing’s recent conference call, the company tried to spin a positive outlook for this contract loss. Dave Calhoun, the company’s President and Chief Executive Officer said that Boeing will ultimately deliver products to the Air Force or the armed forces.Like other company’s in the Dow, Boeing faced supply chain constraints in the quarter, with parts shortages persisting longer than expected. Labor instability in the sector has also had an impact on program deliveries.The development of products like the MQ-25, an unmanned aircraft carrier, has had technical challenges. Expect BA stock to underperform the Dow Jones index as uncertainties continue.Goldman Sachs (GS)In this photo illustration the Goldman Sachs Group (GS) logo displayed on a smartphone screen and a stock market graph in the backgroundSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) reported revenue which declined by 12% year-over-year to $11.98 billion in the company’s third quarter. The financials giant faced challenging macroeconomic conditions, as did most in its sector. In fact, CEO David Solomon said that macro themes dominated his conversations with top executives.In the company’s fourth quarter, Solomon sensed an ongoing, unsettled outlook. Markets dislike such uncertainties. Accordingly, while GS stock rallied from below $300 to trade above $340 for the week ended Oct. 28, many aren’t so sure this broad rebound in financial stocks can be maintained. For Goldman, specific difficulties related to the company’s private lending businesses have been the focal point of some bears. Additionally, in order for Goldman to keep grabbing market share from competition in the retail investor space, more capital spending may be required. Right now is not the right time for this, according to many investors.Thus, I think buying a more diversified financials ETF such as the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLF) could be the way to go. It appears it will take a few quarters before Goldman realizes any gains from its investments, making this stock a pass for me.Home Depot (HD)a Home Depot store is seen from the outsideSource: Cassiohabib / Shutterstock.comHome Depot (NYSE:HD) has added $40 billion worth of business to its books over the last two years alone. As it turns out, catering to the construction professionals and a do-it-yourself customer base has been very profitable, especially following a pandemic which saw nesting patterns emerge among many homeowners.Strong engagement among its customer base has led to strong business growth. That said, HD stock faces pressure ahead as past tailwinds fade. Homeowners are less-inclined to invest in expensive home improvement projects as interest rates rise. Mortgage rates topped 7% recently, which will hurt demand for homes overall. And as home prices decline, the ROI on various projects dips, as well as the equity which many homeowners have used to pay for such home improvement projects.Now, homes still need small repairs as they age. Indeed, small home upgrade projects like painting are ongoing revenue sources for Home Depot. However, the revenue potential from selling maintenance items is smaller than major renovation budgets. In addition, the pandemic between 2020-2021 encouraged customers to upgrade their outdoor space. Now that the U.S. is not adopting lockdowns or draconian measures, Home Depot customers will not spend as much as they once did.3M (MMM)3M logo on top of a corporate building. MMM stockSource: JPstock / Shutterstock.comAnother company I’m focusing on as one of the top Dow stocks to sell is 3M (NYSE:MMM). That’s not because of the company’s consumer staples portfolio of products. Rather, it’s the company’s potentially massive liability related to its earplugs, which were sold to the U.S. military.In August, the court ruled that 3M must face over 230,000 lawsuits. The company cannot use the bankruptcy of its subsidiary, Aearo Technologies LLC, to shield it from the case.In the third quarter, revenue fell by 3.8% compared to last year’s total of $48.6 billion. It saw declines in its personal safety unit, much of which was tied to Covid-related products such as vaccines and therapeutics. Still, this unit benefited from strong demand in the Asia Pacific region. Business in China recovered after lockdowns eased in the second quarter. However, the recent lockdown in Wuhan suggests that 3M will report weaker results next quarter.Although 3M posted stronger revenue from the Americas, its outlook is negative. It expects total sales will fall by up to 3.5% in 2022.3M stopped disclosing pricing, as one analyst commented on the call. After giving fewer details to investors, the risks are high that this company cannot pass inflation pressures on to consumers.Microsoft (MSFT)Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) recently fell after posting strong results. The company earned a solid $2.35 a share on $50.1 billion in revenue. However, the market’s negative reaction pressured MSFT stock on Oct. 26. This suggests that investors don’t expect the software giant to exceed guidance the next quarter.Trading at around 25-times price-to-earnings, Microsoft needs Azure, its cloud solution, to grow despite the weak macroeconomic environment. Investors are concerned that business customers will slow their digitization transformation. Small and mid-sized customers will likely slow their spending as well, as business growth lags.Microsoft has a growing total addressable market for its infrastructure, data, and artificial intelligence offerings. In the long-term, the company’s revenue will expand. But in the current quarter, Microsoft should expect customers will delay their technology spending.Microsoft 365 is a flagship productivity solution that is still appealing. Last quarter, the company relied less on discounts to drive growth. It also benefited from upselling its customers to E5, an enterprise solution. As corporations cut spending, this upsell rate could slow.Nike (NKE)Nike (NKE) store in a shopping mall in Penang, Malaysia. robinhood stocksSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.comNike (NYSE:NKE) risks tied to elevated inventory levels have re-shaped the narrative on this stock, as consumers spend less on sporting goods. In the last quarter, Nike’s inventory grew by 44% year-over-year. That said, inventory growth outpaced top-line growth, surging by 65% in North America.Nike has attractive products in its pipeline. For example, customers are likely to splurge on the Air Zoom Mercurial, Air Max Scorpion, and Nike Forward this holiday season. Despite falling this year, the stock’s high price-earnings ratio may have priced in those prospects.Nike blamed disruptions that started over a year ago for the inventory glut. For example, factories in Vietnam closed for nearly 15 weeks. Transit times increased and are volatile. And while transit times have improved, inventories are rising as the company loaded up on too much product ahead of the holiday season.So, does this mean more markdowns (and lower margins) are coming? I think that’s likely, and investors are taking a risk by holding NKE stock. Consumers may spend less during this holiday period than they have historically. Accordingly, with inflation hurting disposable income, pressure on consumers to avoid expensive items will pick up. Thus, Nike is a pass for me at this time.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, FloridaSource: saaton / Shutterstock.comRounding out our list of Dow stocks to sell is Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), a drugstore company that’s increasingly scaling its U.S. healthcare business. This move is expected to strengthen its long-term sales prospects through its fiscal 2024 year.To meet its business plan, the drugstore must simplify its business structure. This optimization is aimed at achieving organic growth. That said, investors may view this goal differently. The company’s core business is slowing, so Walgreens may need to increase capital spending, which could result in cash flow declines for this company.On Oct. 11, the company acquired CareCentrix, acquiring the remaining 45% stake in this company for around $392 million. Although CareCentrix is a leader in the $75 billion post-acute and home care industry, the purchase increases investor risk. Walgreens will only achieve margins in the high single-digit percentage range, at best, given its previous struggles with VillageMD. This acquisition was a much larger one, worth $5.2 billion, in 2021.Investors are justifiably wary that Walgreens management will achieve EBITDA growth from those two acquisitions. Thus, WBA stock fell to $30.39 in October, and I think this stock has more room to fall from here.On the date of publication, Chris Lau did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

At the same time, the call did little to clear up a key question coming out of the recent investor day: how revenue, profit and returns accretive will the U.S. initiatives be once fully installed (espescially the Siren remodel program)?

You can skip our detailed analysis of the food industry and its outlook, and go directly to read 5 Best Food Dividend Stocks to Buy Now. The food industry encompasses all businesses that are involved in the production, transportation, storage, and selling of food and related items. Like many other sectors, the food industry also evolved during the pandemic in 2020 when major companies brought digital operations into play. The execution worked splendidly for the overall industry as analysts expect it to generate $899 billion in sales this year, according to Forbes.The current market environment has investors turning towards safe stocks that are not impacted by the economic downturn. Food stocks, that fall under the consumer staples sector, are a decent inflation hedge as their sales demand continues even if the prices are increased. The sector can also maintain its profitability as the rising prices are likely to be passed on to consumers. Some of the popular food stocks include PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), and Kellogg Company (NYSE:K).This year, food prices have recorded their largest annual increase since 1979, growing by 11.4% year-over-year as of August. The price hike has altered consumers’ shopping patterns and overall eating habits as they look for alternative and cheap ingredients. However, despite these high prices, the sector’s performance is relatively stable this year as demand for food products remained intact. According to a report by the US Census Bureau, retail and food services sales in the country were up by 9.2% in Q3 2022 from the same period last year. Moreover, the S&amp;P Food and Beverage Select Industry Index fell by 1.51% year-to-date, compared with a 21.6% drop in the broader market, as of the close of November 2.According to analysts, investors should focus on food businesses that can reduce their production costs and operating costs to stay afloat during inflationary periods. Moreover, companies with stable cash flows are also recommended by analysts as they often pay dividends to shareholders, which is rewarding in times of financial volatility. Given this, we will discuss some of the best food dividend stocks.Story continues12 Best Food Dividend Stocks to Buy NowPhoto by Heidi Kaden on UnsplashOur Methodology:The stocks mentioned below belong to different segments within the food industry, such as food manufacturers, food processors, beverage companies, and restaurants.

This compares to earnings of $0.63 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3.45%.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.41 billion.

Net sales on a foreign currency adjusted basis increased 20.2 percent for the 2022 third quarter.During the third quarter of 2022, the Company continued to mitigate increased product and distribution costs through pricing actions, including price increases and reductions in promotional allowances. The Company implemented a price increase effective September 1, 2022 in the United States and continued to implement price increases in certain international markets where feasible in the third quarter of 2022, all of which positively impacted gross profit.In the 2022 third quarter, the Company experienced a significant increase in cost of sales, resulting in a decrease in both gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales, relative to the comparative 2021 third quarter. The increase in cost of sales was primarily due to (i) increased ingredient and other input costs, including secondary packaging materials and increased co-packing fees, (ii) increased logistical costs, (iii) increased aluminum can costs and (iv) geographical and product sales mix. Furthermore, the Company experienced significant increases in distribution expenses primarily as the result of increased warehousing expenses, as well as other logistical expenses, which adversely impacted operating expenses.Story continuesAs of September 30, 2022, the Company had $1.30 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $1.35 billion in short-term investments and $72.4 million in long-term investments.Third Quarter ResultsNet sales for the 2022 third quarter increased 15.2 percent to $1.62 billion from $1.41 billion in the same period last year.   Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales for the 2022 third quarter of $71.3 million.

The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2022 third quarter was primarily the result of increased ingredient and other input costs, including secondary packaging materials and increased co-packing fees, increased logistical costs, increased aluminum can costs and geographical and product sales mix. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2022 third quarter was partially offset by pricing actions.Operating expenses for the 2022 third quarter were $415.8 million, compared with $344.7 million in the 2021 third quarter. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increased warehousing and other logistical expenses, increased payroll expenses, increased selling and marketing expenses, as well as increased general and administrative expenses. Certain of these increases were the result of the Company’s return to activities, consistent with pre COVID-19 levels.Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the 2022 third quarter were 25.6 percent, compared with 24.4 percent in the 2021 third quarter, and 24.5 percent for the 2019 third quarter (pre COVID-19).Distribution costs for the 2022 third quarter increased to $83.0 million, an increase of 27.1 percent, or 5.1 percent of net sales, compared with $65.3 million, or 4.6 percent of net sales, in the 2021 third quarter, and 3.3 percent of net sales in the 2019 third quarter (pre COVID-19).Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales for both the 2022 and 2021 third quarters were 9.7 percent and 11.1 percent in the 2019 third quarter (pre COVID-19).General and administrative expenses for the 2022 third quarter were $175.5 million, or 10.8 percent of net sales, compared with $142.6 million, or 10.1 percent of net sales, for the 2021 third quarter, and 10.1 percent for the 2019 third quarter (pre COVID-19).

Operating income for the 2022 third quarter decreased primarily as a result of the decrease in the gross profit as a percentage of net sales, as well as the increase in operating expenses.The effective tax rate for the 2022 third quarter was 23.3 percent, compared with 23.7 percent in the 2021 third quarter.Net income for the 2022 third quarter decreased 4.4 percent to $322.4 million, from $337.2 million in the 2021 third quarter. Net income per diluted share for the 2022 third quarter decreased 3.9 percent to $0.60, from $0.63 in the third quarter of 2021. Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer Hilton H. Schlosberg said: “We are pleased to report another quarter of continued strong volume and revenue growth, driven by consumer demand. The strength of the United States dollar in the quarter adversely impacted the solid results of our overseas operations. We are also pleased to report increased gross margins on a sequential quarterly basis, as a result of our pricing actions and our supply challenges moderating. While aluminum pricing is easing, cost inflation, including increases in ingredient and other input costs, freight and fuel costs and co-packing fees, remain challenging.“We are continuing to deplete our inventory of higher cost imported cans in EMEA and in the United States, although the cans utilized for a major promotion in the 2022 third quarter were all sourced locally.   “We continue to believe that some of the increased costs that we are experiencing are likely to be transitory.“In the United States, in addition to pricing actions to reduce promotional allowances, we implemented a market-wide increase in pricing, effective September 1, 2022. In certain international markets, price increases were also implemented in the second half of 2022, some in addition to price increases or pricing actions already taken earlier in 2022,” Schlosberg added.Rodney C. Sacks, Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer, said: “The global energy drink category continues to expand, and the Company is well positioned to capitalize on this growth with our Monster Energy® family of brands, as well as our Strategic and Affordable energy brands.“We continued to expand distribution of our brands in many international markets in the third quarter of 2022. As previously reported, we are planning to launch Monster Energy® Zero Sugar at retail in the United States in January 2023. “We are also planning to launch our first flavored malt beverage alcohol product leveraging Monster’s brand equity in the 2023 first quarter. ‘The Beast Unleashed™ contains six percent alcohol by volume and will initially be available in four flavors.  The Beast Unleashed™ will launch through certain beer distributors in the United States, utilizing a phased state launch approach, with the goal of being national by the end of 2023. “In the first half of 2023, we are planning to introduce Monster Tour Water™, a pure unflavored water line, in still and sparkling variants in 19.2 oz aluminum cans as well as four flavors of Reign Storm™ in 12 oz slim aluminum cans, in response to certain competitive new entrants in the energy drink category.“Our innovation pipeline of both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages continues to be robust and exciting,” Sacks added.2022 Nine-Months ResultsNet sales for the nine-months ended September 30, 2022 increased 16.6 percent to $4.80 billion, from $4.12 billion in the comparable period last year.  Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales for the nine-months ended September 30, 2022 of $157.6 million.

And despite signs that the economy is slowing, Americans are expected to spend more this year between Thanksgiving and New Year’s than they did in 2021.According to accounting and professional services firm Deloitte, holiday retail sales are likely to boom. Expectations are that retail sales will total between $1.45 trillion and $1.47 trillion from late November to the start of January. That’s up about 5% from the same time last year. E-commerce sales during this year’s holiday sales period are expected to rise even more dramatically, with Deloitte forecasting year-over-year growth of 12.8% to 14.3%. Indeed, the firm says that e-commerce sales could exceed $260 billion, making for a very merry holiday sales season.Clearly, Americans aren’t letting inflation and rising interest rates hold them back from celebrating year-end festivities. Other holiday sales forecasts are equally bullish. So, which companies and stocks are likely to benefit from all that holiday spending? Here is a list of seven stocks that could pop with the holidays.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWMTWalmart$140.72UPSUnited Parcel Service$164.01AMZNAmazon$89.30CVSCVS Health$97.80LUVSouthwest Airlines$36.96BBYBest Buy$67.07TAPMolson Coors$49.48Walmart (WMT)Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the backgroundSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comMany people depend on Walmart (NYSE:WMT) at Christmas time. From toys and decorations to food and stocking stuffers, Walmart has it all. Additionally, this company usually offers the best prices in town. That could be an especially attractive draw for consumers this year, with inflation in the U.S. continuing to run at a 40-year high, and costs up sharply for everything from turkeys to eggnog.The world’s biggest retailer is following the lead of competitors this year and offering holiday sales earlier than ever before. The company started rolling out deals to consumers in October, rather than waiting until Thanksgiving at the end of November. Over the last month, Walmart has announced price cuts, expanded return options, and an enhanced omnichannel shopping experience. This is in a bid to kickstart its holiday shopping season into high gear.Story continuesIn the coming weeks, Walmart said it will offer thousands more price “rollbacks” to help harried shoppers complete their holiday lists. Currently, WMT stock is only down 1% on the year at $141 per share. That said, a strong holiday boost could help turn the company’s share price green by New Year’s.United Parcel Service (UPS)Close up of UPS logo printed on a delivery truck; partial view of the driver sitting at the wheel, waiting at a red traffic light in south San Francisco baySource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comHelping Santa get all those gifts and packages under the tree this year is the job of United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS). The largest courier company in the world with annual revenues of more than $85 billion, UPS thrives during the holidays. In September, the company announced plans to hire more than 100,000 additional workers to help with the holiday shipping rush. These hires span the spectrum, from drivers to package handlers.UPS said it anticipates package shipments to peak later in December this year and closer to Christmas, as consumers return to pre-Covid patterns and shop for items later and in-person. The company also expects to lose some business to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which is directly handling more of it its own shipments now. Still, the fourth and final quarter of the year is always the busiest for UPS.UPS stock is down approximately 20% this year at $164 per share, mirroring the decline in the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index.Amazon (AMZN)Amazon LOGO ON THE SIDE OF A BUILDING.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comSpeaking of Amazon, the e-commerce giant made headlines around the world in October when it held a second Prime sales event for the year. Traditionally, Amazon’s Prime sales event has been held at Thanksgiving and tied into the Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales extravaganzas. However, Amazon decided to move up this year’s sales to October to try and kickstart holiday shopping early, and give its revenues a big boost in the fourth quarter.While exact sales figures for the October event have yet to be made public by Amazon, preliminary indications are that the company sold more than 100 million items during the two-day event. Additionally, Amazon should continue to benefit from strong e-commerce sales throughout this year’s holidays, especially around Black Friday and during the lead-up to Christmas. Like the other companies on this list, the fourth quarter is typically the strongest for Amazon.AMZN stock is down roughly 45% this year and trading at $90 per share. At this price, the stock is a true gift to investors.CVS Health (CVS)the exterior of a CVS pharmacy storeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comPharmacy retailer CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) just reported its third consecutive earnings beat. The Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based company’s stock popped 3% after it reported Q3 earnings per share of $2.09 versus $1.99 that was expected on Wall Street. Revenue for the July through September period came in at $81.16 billion compared to $76.75 billion that was expected by analysts.A big reason for the company’s continued strong earnings is revenue from CVS Health’s retail sales, which rose 7% year-over-year in the third-quarter. Those retail sales are likely to get a boost during the holidays as people turn to the company’s nearly 10,000 retail outlets for chocolates, stocking stuffers, and other items.December is also cold and flu season, and that should help CVS Health’s pharmacy services, which saw revenue climb 10% higher from a year ago during the most recent quarter. CVS stock is down only 6% this year, outperforming all the major U.S. stock indices.Southwest Airlines (LUV)a southwest airline stocks (LUV) jet flying above the cloudsSource: Carlos E. Santa Maria / Shutterstock.comLet’s not forget holiday travel. After two years of sheltering-in-place at home, Americans are again planning to travel during the holidays this year. Approximately 70% of Americans saying they plan to travel to visit family and friends for Thanksgiving and/or Christmas. Thus, airlines are seeking to capitalize on the busy travel season, with most having already raised their fares by 50% or more from mid-November through early January.One of the airlines most likely to benefit from the holiday travel boom is Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV). The world’s largest low-cost carrier and one of the busiest airlines in the U.S., Southwest carries more domestic passengers than any other airline in America. The company is rushing to resolve its staffing problems in the lead-up to Thanksgiving, announcing plans to hire more than 3,000 pilots this year and next.LUV stock is down 16% this year and trading at $37 per share.Best Buy (BBY)Image of Best Buy logo on storefront during daytime. retail stocksSource: BobNoah / Shutterstock.comAs a purveyor of consumer electronics such as smartphones, video game consoles, and Ultra High Definition (UHD) television sets, Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) is typically ground zero for both Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday sales. Consumers line-up around the country to crash the retailer’s Black Friday sales events at midnight the day after Thanksgiving, while millions more try to score deals online during Cyber Monday.Like the other retailers on this list, Best Buy got a jump on the holidays this year, offering exclusive sales to customers in October. Not only has the company offered early Black Friday deals, it has also announced exclusive offers to its “My Best Buy” members, which, it says, will continue through January as part of what it is calling “Member Mondays.” This strategy could power Best Buy to a strong fourth quarter.So far this year, BBY stock has fallen 34% to $67 a share.Molson Coors (TAP)Molson Coors (TAP) logo on a web browser magnified by a magnifying glassSource: OleksandrShnuryk / Shutterstock.comWe’ll end with a cup of holiday cheer. For that, investors should look to Chicago-based beverage giant and master brewer Molson Coors (NYSE:TAP). According to a survey published on the website Beveragedaily.com, Americans double their intake of alcohol between Thanksgiving and New Year’s, consuming eight alcoholic drinks a week compared to four during the rest of the year.The most popular alcoholic beverages during the holidays are eggnog (40%), coffee with Bailey’s (34%), beer (28%) and cider (27%). Molson Coors, which is the second largest brewer in the U.S. and third largest maker of alcoholic beverages in the world, is sure to benefit from an uptick in sales during the holidays.Strong year-end sales could further help TAP stock, which has benefitted from the economic reopening following the pandemic. Year-to-date, Molson Coors stock is up 5% at just under $50 per share, making it among the rare securities that are on the positive side of the ledger in 2022.Disclosure: On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

However, investors might be overlooking a clear opportunity or potential setback if there is no rational basis for the P/E.While the market has experienced earnings growth lately, Philip Morris International's earnings have gone into reverse gear, which is not great. One possibility is that the P/E is moderate because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn around. If not, then existing shareholders may be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. See our latest analysis for Philip Morris International peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Philip Morris International.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The P/E?There's an inherent assumption that a company should be matching the market for P/E ratios like Philip Morris International's to be considered reasonable.If we review the last year of earnings, dishearteningly the company's profits fell to the tune of 2.4%. This has soured the latest three-year period, which nevertheless managed to deliver a decent 17% overall rise in EPS. Although it's been a bumpy ride, it's still fair to say the earnings growth recently has been mostly respectable for the company.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 2.7% per annum as estimated by the analysts watching the company. That's shaping up to be materially lower than the 9.5% each year growth forecast for the broader market.With this information, we find it interesting that Philip Morris International is trading at a fairly similar P/E to the market. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly limited growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. Maintaining these prices will be difficult to achieve as this level of earnings growth is likely to weigh down the shares eventually.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Philip Morris International's P/EWhile the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.Our examination of Philip Morris International's analyst forecasts revealed that its inferior earnings outlook isn't impacting its P/E as much as we would have predicted. Right now we are uncomfortable with the P/E as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support a more positive sentiment for long. Unless these conditions improve, it's challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.There are also other vital risk factors to consider before investing and we've discovered 1 warning sign for Philip Morris International that you should be aware of.If you're unsure about the strength of Philip Morris International's business, why not explore our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals for some other companies you may have missed.Have feedback on this article?

To skip our detailed analysis of these companies and the glass industry, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest Glass Companies In The World.The glass industry is among the most overlooked industries in the market, as many customers who habitually and repeatedly purchase glass products do not realize the extent of their reliance on them. Despite this, the glass industry has steadily been on the rise across the globe over the last two decades in terms of the usage of high-performance glasses. As a result, key players in the glass industry such as Saint Gobain Company (EPA:SGO), PPG Industries, Inc. (NYSE:PPG), and Corning Incorporated (NYSE:GLW), among others, have been profiting. Geographically, the Asia-Pacific continues to be the largest market for glass and glass products. In 2021, this region alone accounted for 20.3% of the global market revenue share in the glass sector.According to a report published by the National Glass Association this January, while US economic recovery continues, glass manufacturers have begun pushing for improved efficiency and better performance to meet rising demand. The report mentions that there is a fair likelihood of demand for glass products remaining high throughout 2022. Stephen Weidner, the head of Architectural Glass North America, was cited as commenting that the glass market is continuing to grow at a rate of 3% per year. The glass market has also started making headway into solar products with the rise of ""green"" glass products used in the production of solar panels for the increased use of green energy and electricity.Apart from just being used in conventional sectors such as electronics, green energy, and more, glass products also have much to contribute to the automotive sector. Companies such as Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), and Ferrari N.V. (NYSE:RACE) in this sector all rely on glass companies for the provision of automotive glass and coatings used in the manufacture of vehicles. Glass demand in this sector is also expected to stabilize throughout 2022, ensuring a vital customer base remains from which the glass industry can continue to benefit for years to come.Story continuesPhoto by Quino Al on UnsplashOur Methodology:For our list below, we have selected glass manufacturers that are among the largest in the world, based on their market cap.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $96.68 million.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Goldman Sachs BDC: mixed.

(NYSE:GS) insiders",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/selling-us-21m-worth-stock-140052957.html,1667484052,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD']","[The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.'s (NYSE:GS) stock rose 4.2% last week, but insiders who sold US$21m worth of stock over the last year are probably in a more advantageous position. Selling at an average price of US$375, which is higher than the current price, may have been the wisest decision for these insiders as their investment would have been worth less now than when they sold.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Goldman Sachs GroupThe Non-Executive Director, David Viniar, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$7.0m worth of shares at a price of US$411 each. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$350. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.In the last year Goldman Sachs Group insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At Goldman Sachs Group Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Goldman Sachs Group. In total, insiders dumped US$5.3m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Insider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Goldman Sachs Group insiders own about US$576m worth of shares (which is 0.5% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Goldman Sachs Group Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Goldman Sachs Group.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Packaging Corporation of America (NYSE:PKG). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. Check out our latest analysis for Packaging Corporation of America How Fast Is Packaging Corporation of America Growing?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. We can see that in the last three years Packaging Corporation of America grew its EPS by 11% per year. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. The music to the ears of Packaging Corporation of America shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 15% to 18% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time.

But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$181m. Holders should find this level of insider commitment quite encouraging, since it would ensure that the leaders of the company would also experience their success, or failure, with the stock.Is Packaging Corporation of America Worth Keeping An Eye On?One important encouraging feature of Packaging Corporation of America is that it is growing profits. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists. Don't forget that there may still be risks. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Packaging Corporation of America (1 shouldn't be ignored)  you should be aware of.Although Packaging Corporation of America certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

It will continue the practice in 2023 as well.""Efforts around passing on higher costs appear to be making progress as margins tracked ahead of expectations,"" Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch said.Meanwhile, Aptiv flagged the potential impact from energy shortages in Europe. ""I think Europe remains a challenging environment for the foreseeable future,"" Massaro added.Europe's energy crisis could cut the region's car production by close to 40%, or more than 1 million vehicles, per quarter through the end of 2023, auto forecaster S&amp;P Global Mobility warned last monthStill, Aptiv expects net sales for the full year to be between $17 billion and $17.3 billion.The company reported net sales of $4.6 billion for the reported quarter, above average analysts' expectation of $4.3 billion, according to Refinitiv data.Excluding items, profit came in at $1.28 per share, compared with expectations of 99 cents per share.

This compares to FFO of $0.73 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.A quarter ago, it was expected that this seniors housing real estate investment trust would post FFO of $0.72 per share when it actually produced FFO of $0.72, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates two times.Ventas , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry, posted revenues of $1.04 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.49%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $976.08 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Ventas shares have lost about 26.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -21.1%.What's Next for Ventas?While Ventas has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Ventas: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continuesIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus FFO estimate is $0.73 on $1.05 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.99 on $4.12 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, REIT and Equity Trust - Other is currently in the bottom 40% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.W.P.

Year-over-year revenue growth is expected to be partially mitigated by continued broad inflationary expense pressure.Office: Same-store cash NOI growth year-over-year is expected to be driven by occupancy growth, contractual escalators and favorable expense controls.Triple-Net: Same-store cash NOI growth is expected to be driven by contractual escalators.Interest Rates and Foreign Exchange: Rising interest rates on floating rate debt and a strengthening U.S. dollar are expected to reduce Normalized FFO by ($0.02) per share in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter 2022.VIM: The Company is expected to earn its first promote revenue from its third-party institutional capital management business (VIM), approximating $0.01 per share in the fourth quarter.General and Administrative Expenses: The Normalized FFO impact of fourth quarter general and administrative expenses is expected to range from approximately $36 million to $38 million.Transactions: The guidance does not assume any new or unannounced material acquisitions or capital markets activities.HHS Grants: The Company does not expect to receive any HHS grants in the fourth quarter. Ventas has received the benefit of $54 million or $0.13 per share of HHS grants year-to-date through the third quarter of 2022 on behalf of the assisted living communities in its SHOP segment to partially mitigate losses attributable to COVID-19.The guidance assumes no material changes in the impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s business. The trajectory and future impact of COVID-19 on various aspects of the business remain highly uncertain and may change rapidly.Please see below for further discussion and our definitions of non-GAAP measures along with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

However, since real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors deem presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. For that reason, the Company considers Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance of an equity REIT. The Company believes that the presentation of FFO, combined with the presentation of required GAAP financial measures, has improved the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and has helped make comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers Nareit FFO to be a useful measure for understanding and comparing our operating results because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment losses on depreciable real estate and real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can differ across owners of similar assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), Nareit FFO can help investors compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate across reporting periods and to the operating performance of other companies. The Company believes that Normalized FFO is useful because it allows investors, analysts and Company management to compare the Company’s operating performance to the operating performance of other real estate companies across periods on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by non-recurring items and other non-operational events such as transactions and litigation. In some cases, the Company provides information about identified non-cash components of Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO because it allows investors, analysts and Company management to assess the impact of those items on the Company’s financial results.Nareit Funds from Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders (""Nareit FFO"")The Company uses the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (""Nareit"") definition of FFO. Nareit defines FFO as net income attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property, including gain (or loss) on re-measurement of equity method investments and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests. Adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.Normalized FFOThe Company defines Normalized FFO as Nareit FFO excluding the following income and expense items, without duplication: (a) transaction expenses and deal costs, including transaction, integration and severance-related costs and expenses, and amortization of intangibles, in each case net of noncontrolling interests’ share of these items and including Ventas’ share of these items from unconsolidated entities; (b) the impact of expenses related to asset impairment and valuation allowances, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees or additional costs, expenses, discounts, make-whole payments, penalties or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of the Company’s debt; (c) the non-cash effect of income tax benefits or expenses, the non-cash impact of changes to the Company’s executive equity compensation plan, derivative transactions that have non-cash mark-to-market impacts on the Company’s income statement and non-cash charges related to leases; (d) the financial impact of contingent consideration; (e) gains and losses for non-operational foreign currency hedge agreements and changes in the fair value of financial instruments; (f) gains and losses on non-real estate dispositions and other items related to unconsolidated entities; (g) net expenses or recoveries related to materially disruptive events; and (h) other items set forth in the Normalized FFO reconciliation included herein.Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO presented herein may not be comparable to those presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO should not be considered as alternatives to net income attributable to common stockholders (determined in accordance with GAAP) as indicators of the Company’s financial performance or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as measures of the Company’s liquidity, nor are they necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company’s needs. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, Nareit FFO and Normalized FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to common stockholders as presented elsewhere herein.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES RECONCILIATIONFourth Quarter 2022 Guidance1Net Income and FFO Attributable to Common Stockholders(In millions, except per share amounts; dollars in USD; totals may not sum due to rounding; unaudited)Q4 2022Q4 2022 - Per ShareLowHighLowHighNet income attributable to common stockholders$22$48$0.06$0.12]"

This compares to loss of $0.07 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.A quarter ago, it was expected that this biomedical products company would post a loss of $0.06 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.05, delivering a surprise of 16.67%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Cerus , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Products industry, posted revenues of $39.57 million for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.46%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $36.13 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Cerus shares have lost about 48.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -21.1%.What's Next for Cerus?While Cerus has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Cerus: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continuesIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is -$0.04 on $41.4 million in revenues for the coming quarter and -$0.21 on $158.9 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Medical - Products is currently in the bottom 42% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the same industry, Perrigo (PRGO), is yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022.

Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's, Ali, Canal, who's been looking into this. And Ali, guess the question is, what's the bar here for Netflix at a time when ads have been slowing down across the board.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Well, I think for a company like Netflix, the bar has already been set high, right? The platform confirmed that it sold out of nearly all of its ad inventory globally for the launch. And that optimism has been echoed from both analysts and ad experts alike.I spoke to Kevin Krim, he's the CEO of advertising measurement platform EDO. And he described this as a quote, ""pivotal moment for the media industry."" He also cited Amazon's Thursday Night Football as another watershed moment, when we had streaming subscription and ad-supported Go To The Masses. And now with Netflix rolling out ads, Disney right behind them, this is the new future for consumers and the new future for tech companies.For Netflix, it's reached peak penetration in the North American markets. And this is a way for them to really capture more subscribers. There have been some concerns that consumers will trade down.But analysts have said that it's actually a spin up opportunity, a chance for Netflix to secure more revenue, increase profits. That's the name of the game on Wall Street right now, and Netflix needs to capitalize on that in order to remain at the top of the streaming wars. And advertisers seem on board with that as well.- Yeah, Ali, when you look across the streaming landscape, those like Hulu have been early on, with the ad-supported tier, Netflix entering into new territory with Disney Plus right behind it. What's the big risk for Netflix?Story continuesALEXANDRA CANAL: It's 100% a super big risk. If we think about the programming on Netflix, it's a lot of mass content, right? It's global. A lot of it is considered, quote-unquote niche. And that's where we could see some potential tension.Advertisers, they like to play it safe. They want content that captures large audiences, and that might challenge Netflix's current content strategy. Another potential risk could be when it comes to acquiring new licensing agreements to run ads. And Netflix warned that about 5% to 10% of content will not be available on the ad tier due to those ongoing conversations with studios like Disney and NBCUniversal.We had a new Wall Street Journal out report earlier this week, that noted that shows that are really popular on Netflix, like Gray's Anatomy, The Crown, You. They could potentially be impacted by this. So that's something that they'll have to figure out.And then finally, another issue is just ad integration, right? How will this interrupt the binge model that made Netflix so successful in the first place? And how can the company really tackle those measurement tactics to lure advertisers amid all of this competition? So these will just be some of the growing pains.But Netflix signal that it's ready for the ride, they're ready to innovate. And that potential is what's driving up the stock price higher, up more than about 35% over the past six months. So analysts ready for it, investors ready for it. We'll see if consumers are ready for it too.- Yeah, the counterargument being that this actually might not be a bad time when consumers are trying to pull back on spending. So we'll see where those numbers come in. Ali, thanks so much for that.]"

However, consumer spending grew by 0.6% in September despite inflationary pressures, according to the Commerce Department’s data. Luke Tilley, Chief Economist at Wilmington Trust, talked about ongoing consumer trends in his interview with Wall Street Journal this October. He said that consumer spending increased due to fiscal stimulus given during the pandemic. He also said that although the consumer backdrop seems to be slowing but is overall strong.Following the current trends, analysts are expecting that consumer spending in the US will start rebounding in 2023. Goldman Sachs analyst Jason English spoke to CNBC about this. He asserted that increased consumer spending will be able to counter the negative growth in household discretionary cash flow. He further mentioned that this improvement in cash flow will be because of wages. This growth in consumer spending and the sector’s cash flow will also provide a positive direction to consumer cyclical stocks.

But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. For example, the The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) share price has soared 107% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. In more good news, the share price has risen 12% in thirty days.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for TJX Companies While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, TJX Companies managed to grow its earnings per share at 10% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 16% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. This free interactive report on TJX Companies' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for TJX Companies the TSR over the last 5 years was 121%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that TJX Companies shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 4.5% over the last year. That's including the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 17% a year, is even better. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   3 warning signs for TJX Companies (1 is potentially serious)  that you should be aware of.There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

We expect continued volume growth given Otezla's unique, broad indication to treat patients suffering from mild, moderate or severe psoriasis.Enbrel® (etanercept) sales decreased 14% year-over-year for the third quarter, driven by lower net selling price, a 5% decline from unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions, and a 3% decline in volume. The 5% unfavorable impact of changes to estimated sales deductions results from a $114 million favorable adjustment in the third quarter of 2021, more than offsetting a $47 million favorable adjustment in this quarter. Going forward, we expect net selling price to continue to decline year-over-year, driven by increased competition.AMGEVITA™ (adalimumab) sales increased 5% year-over-year for the third quarter, driven by 27% volume growth, partially offset by foreign exchange impact and lower net selling price resulting from increased competition. AMGEVITA continued to be the most prescribed adalimumab biosimilar in Europe.Hematology-OncologyLUMAKRAS®/LUMYKRAS™ (sotorasib) generated $75 million of sales for the third quarter, driven by volume growth. Quarter-over-quarter sales declined 3% driven by lower net selling price due to an unfavorable price adjustment resulting from a reimbursement approval in Germany, partially offset by 15% volume growth. In the U.S., LUMAKRAS has been prescribed to over 3,700 patients by over 2,200 physicians in both academic and community settings. Outside the U.S., LUMYKRAS has now been approved in over 45 countries around the world.

In the third quarter, volume growth benefited from the timing of shipments to Takeda, our partner in Japan.Nplate® (romiplostim) sales increased 5% year-over-year for the third quarter, primarily driven by 12% volume growth, partially offset by unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions. In the third quarter, volume growth benefited from increased shipments to KKC, our partner in Japan.BLINCYTO® (blinatumomab) sales increased 14% year-over-year for the third quarter, driven by volume growth.MVASI® sales decreased 24% year-over-year for the third quarter, primarily driven by lower net selling price. The most recently published Average Selling Price (ASP) for MVASI in the U.S. declined 37% year-over-year and 12% quarter-over-quarter. Looking forward, we expect continued net selling price erosion and declining volume driven by increased competition and continued ASP erosion.KANJINTI® (trastuzumab-anns) sales decreased 38% year-over-year for the third quarter, primarily driven by lower net selling price and decline in volume, partially offset by favorable changes to estimated sales deductions. The most recently published ASP for KANJINTI in the U.S. declined 38% year-over-year and 11% quarter-over-quarter. Going forward, we expect continued net selling price deterioration and volume declines driven by increased competition and continued ASP erosion.Established ProductsTotal sales of our established products, which include Neulasta® (pegfilgrastim), NEUPOGEN® (filgrastim), EPOGEN® (epoetin alfa), Aranesp® (darbepotein alfa), Parsabiv® (etelcalcetide), and Sensipar®/Mimpara™ (cinacalcet), decreased 17% year-over-year for the third quarter, primarily driven by lower net selling price and lower inventory levels. In the third quarter, the published ASP for Neulasta in the U.S. declined 24% year-over-year and 7% quarter-over-quarter. In the aggregate, we expect the year-over-year net selling price and volume erosion for this portfolio of products to continue.Product Sales Detail by Product and Geographic Region$Millions, except percentagesQ3 '22Q3 '21YOY ΔUSROWTOTALTOTALTOTALProlia®$ 590$ 272$ 862$ 8037 %EVENITY®1366520114935 %Repatha®14216730927214 %Aimovig®10341077935 %TEZSPIRE®55—55—NMOtezla®529986276093 %Enbrel® 1,086201,1061,289(14 %)AMGEVITA™—1171171115 %LUMAKRAS®/LUMYKRAS™61147536*KYPROLIS®2171013182939 %XGEVA®363132495517(4 %)Vectibix®10614124720024 %Nplate®1621262882735 %BLINCYTO®845814212514 %MVASI®13970209274(24 %)KANJINTI®581472116(38 %)Neulasta®20542247415(40 %)NEUPOGEN®21143552(33 %)EPOGEN®136—136138(1 %)Aranesp®128230358396(10 %)Parsabiv®61391006164 %Sensipar®/Mimpara™4131719(11 %)Other products**80341149323 %Total product sales$ 4,466$ 1,771$ 6,237$ 6,320(1 %)* Change in excess of 100%** Other products include Corlanor®,AVSOLA®,IMLYGIC® andRIABNI®, as well as sales byGENSENTA andBergamo subsidiariesNM = not meaningfulOperating Expense, Operating Margin and Tax Rate AnalysisOn a GAAP basis:Total Operating Expenses decreased 8%.

ZTS reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of $1.21 per share (excluding one-time items), which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.24 per share. In the year-ago quarter, the company reported earnings of $1.25 per share.Total revenues grew 1% year over year to $2.0 billion, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.07 billion.Shares of Zoetis were down 10.76% in the pre-market trading session on Nov 3. The stock has plunged 39.2% this year compared with the industry’s 30.5% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQuarterly HighlightsZoetis derives most of its revenues from a diversified product portfolio of medicines and vaccines used to treat and protect livestock and companion animals. The company reports business results under two geographical operating segments — United States and International.Revenues from the U.S. segment increased 2% year over year to $1.09 billion in the third quarter. Sales of companion animal products in this region increase 6% from the prior-year quarter’s levels, primarily owing to higher sales of Simparica Trio, the triple-combination parasiticide for dogs. The Apoquel and Cytopoint brands in the dermatology portfolio also led to this increase. However, sales of livestock products declined 7% year over year for the quarter due to a decline in cattle product sales due to generic competition for Draxxin.In the reported quarter, sales of swine products in the U.S segment declined due to increased competition for vaccines. Sales of poultry products also declined in the quarter due to the expanded use of lower-cost alternatives and generic competition for Zoamix.Revenues in the International segment increased 2% year over year on a reported and 8% on an operational basis to $889 million. Sales of companion animal products rose 6% year over year on a reported and 17% on an operational basis. The growth can be attributed to the recent launch of Librela and Solensia, the company’s monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies for dogs and cats and due to the increased sales of its Apoquel and Cytopoint brands in the dermatology portfolio.Story continuesIn the international segment, livestock product sales declined 8% year over year on a reported basis and were flat operationally. Sales of poultry products improved owing to market growth and demand generation efforts across the Latin American markets. Sales of sheep products also witnessed growth due to favorable market conditions and new product launches in Australia. The company also witnessed improvement in its fish portfolio, owing to increased vaccine sales across key salmon markets, including Chile and Norway.However, growth in the sheep, poultry and fish business segments was offset by reduced sales across the company’s swine and cattle portfolios. Zoetis’ cattle products sales in the international market decreased as a result of supply constraints and also due to an unfavorable macro environment for producers in Brazil. In the third quarter, swine product sales declined due to supply constraints across international markets. Lower sales across Europe due to reduced exports to China. Consequently, higher input costs for producers also affected the sales of swine products for Zoetis.2022 GuidanceOwing to the negative impact of foreign exchange rates, veterinary workforce challengesand constant supply chain constraints Zoetis has lowered its full-year 2022 guidance.The company now expects adjusted earnings in the range of $4.83-$4.90 per share compared with the previous expectation of $4.97-$5.05 per share.Revenues are now projected between $8.000 to $8.075 billion compared with the previous range of $8.225 to $8.325 billion.Our TakeZoetis missed earnings and sales estimates in the third quarter, as a result of supply constraints, especially in the international markets.

(NEE) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nextera-energy-inc-nee-attracting-130001233.html,1667480401,STORY,"['NEE', 'NEE-PR']","[NextEra Energy (NEE) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this parent company of Florida Power &amp; Light Co. Have returned -5.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, which NextEra falls in, has gained 1.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.NextEra is expected to post earnings of $0.56 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +36.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -4%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.90 points to a change of +13.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.13 indicates a change of +8% from what NextEra is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, NextEra is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NEE _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of NextEra, the consensus sales estimate of $5.78 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +14.6%. The $20.21 billion and $26.33 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +18.4% and +30.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNextEra reported revenues of $6.72 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +53.8%. EPS of $0.85 for the same period compares with $0.75 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.35 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.77%. The EPS surprise was +7.59%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.NextEra is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about NextEra. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The newly published 2023 Electric, Natural Gas and Water Utilities Outlook is part of S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence's Big Picture 2023 Outlook Report series.Battery metals demand to outpace supply starting in 2024With the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act set to increase U.S. renewable energy generation capacity by around 150GW in the coming years and electric vehicle demand set to increase almost 30% annually on a global basis through 2026, metals including copper, lithium, cobalt, and nickel will remain in high demand. The 2023 outlook spans both the U.S. utility and renewable energy sectors, as well as global metals markets.""The Inflation Reduction Act is providing a rosy outlook for renewable energy development in the U.S., while the energy transition taking place across much of the globe will see demand for the key raw materials such as lithium, nickel and copper start to exceed supply in the years ahead,"" said Richard Sansom, Research Director at S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights.Key findings of the report include:The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is expected to drive the addition of 150GW of additional renewable energy capacity in the U.S. in coming years, providing for support for wind, solar and storage projects.The IRA has come at a time when regulators are facing a challenging confluence of events, with utilities in the midst of a prolonged period of aggressive capital spending on infrastructure, the lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, more frequent and severe weather events, the war in Ukraine, and rising interest rates and inflation combining to drive historical levels of rate case activity.Federal legislation designed to support decarbonization initiatives is expected to attract substantial interest from utility investors in the coming years, but regulatory support, in the form of adequate returns on equity and ample cost recovery opportunities, is necessary to ensure that capital continues to flow to the sector.With global economic conditions taking center stage, 2023 industrial commodities prices covered by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence's Commodities Briefing Service are set to average lower than in 2022, with a year-over-year drop ranging from 7% for copper to 33% for lithium.Growing energy transition and electric vehicle demand for key battery and materials means consumption will outstrip the mining industry's ability to ramp up supply, resulting in commodity deficits as early as 2024. Addressing ESG concerns while allowing development of new mines crucial to those efforts, will require accommodations among all stakeholders.High metals prices entering 2022 contributed to global exploration budgets rising 16% for the year, but investors have since shied away from mining companies as metals prices retreated; should this trend continue, S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence expect a 10%-20% decrease in the global exploration budget for 2023.Story continuesTo request a copy of the 2023 Electric, Natural Gas and Water Utilities Industry Outlook, please contact pressinquiries.mi@spglobal.com.S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence's opinions, quotes, and credit-related and other analyses are statements of opinion as of the date they are expressed and not statements of fact or recommendation to purchase, hold, or sell any securities or to make any investment decisions, and do not address the suitability of any security.About S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence At S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, we understand the importance of accurate, deep and insightful information.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the food industry and its outlook, and go directly to read 5 Best Food Dividend Stocks to Buy Now. The food industry encompasses all businesses that are involved in the production, transportation, storage, and selling of food and related items. Like many other sectors, the food industry also evolved during the pandemic in 2020 when major companies brought digital operations into play. The execution worked splendidly for the overall industry as analysts expect it to generate $899 billion in sales this year, according to Forbes.The current market environment has investors turning towards safe stocks that are not impacted by the economic downturn. Food stocks, that fall under the consumer staples sector, are a decent inflation hedge as their sales demand continues even if the prices are increased. The sector can also maintain its profitability as the rising prices are likely to be passed on to consumers. Some of the popular food stocks include PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), and Kellogg Company (NYSE:K).This year, food prices have recorded their largest annual increase since 1979, growing by 11.4% year-over-year as of August. The price hike has altered consumers’ shopping patterns and overall eating habits as they look for alternative and cheap ingredients. However, despite these high prices, the sector’s performance is relatively stable this year as demand for food products remained intact. According to a report by the US Census Bureau, retail and food services sales in the country were up by 9.2% in Q3 2022 from the same period last year. Moreover, the S&amp;P Food and Beverage Select Industry Index fell by 1.51% year-to-date, compared with a 21.6% drop in the broader market, as of the close of November 2.According to analysts, investors should focus on food businesses that can reduce their production costs and operating costs to stay afloat during inflationary periods. Moreover, companies with stable cash flows are also recommended by analysts as they often pay dividends to shareholders, which is rewarding in times of financial volatility. Given this, we will discuss some of the best food dividend stocks.Story continues12 Best Food Dividend Stocks to Buy NowPhoto by Heidi Kaden on UnsplashOur Methodology:The stocks mentioned below belong to different segments within the food industry, such as food manufacturers, food processors, beverage companies, and restaurants.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this processor of debit and credit card payments have returned +5.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.9% change. The Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, to which MasterCard belongs, has gained 10.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, MasterCard is expected to post earnings of $2.60 per share, indicating a change of +10.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.8% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.60 points to a change of +26.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.2%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.17 indicates a change of +14.8% from what MasterCard is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.6%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, MasterCard is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MA _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For MasterCard, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $5.81 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +11.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $22.19 billion and $25.15 billion estimates indicate +17.5% and +13.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMasterCard reported revenues of $5.76 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.5%. EPS of $2.68 for the same period compares with $2.37 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.66 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.77%. The EPS surprise was +4.28%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.MasterCard is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about MasterCard. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Revenue and earnings per share (EPS) forecasts were both revised downwards, with the analysts seeing grey clouds on the horizon.After the downgrade, the consensus from QUALCOMM's 24 analysts is for revenues of US$40b in 2023, which would reflect a definite 8.9% decline in sales compared to the last year of performance. Statutory earnings per share are anticipated to tumble 24% to US$8.83 in the same period. Before this latest update, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$47b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$11.59 in 2023. Indeed, we can see that the analysts are a lot more bearish about QUALCOMM's prospects, administering a substantial drop in revenue estimates and slashing their EPS estimates to boot. See our latest analysis for QUALCOMM earnings-and-revenue-growthThe consensus price target fell 7.6% to US$163, with the weaker earnings outlook clearly leading analyst valuation estimates. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. The most optimistic QUALCOMM analyst has a price target of US$250 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$120. Note the wide gap in analyst price targets? This implies to us that there is a fairly broad range of possible scenarios for the underlying business.One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. We would highlight that sales are expected to reverse, with a forecast 8.9% annualised revenue decline to the end of 2023. That is a notable change from historical growth of 15% over the last five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the same industry are forecast to see their revenue grow 7.4% annually for the foreseeable future. It's pretty clear that QUALCOMM's revenues are expected to perform substantially worse than the wider industry.Story continuesThe Bottom LineThe most important thing to take away is that analysts cut their earnings per share estimates, expecting a clear decline in business conditions. Unfortunately analysts also downgraded their revenue estimates, and industry data suggests that QUALCOMM's revenues are expected to grow slower than the wider market. After such a stark change in sentiment from analysts, we'd understand if readers now felt a bit wary of QUALCOMM.There might be good reason for analyst bearishness towards QUALCOMM, like a weak balance sheet.

The court in October declined any relief and the case will next be heard on Nov. 7.Documents contained in Xiaomi's Oct. 3 court filing shed new light on the investigation's findings, and show federal agents found suspected irregularities in the way its India unit made transfers as royalties to Qualcomm for licensed technologies such as patents.According to the court documents, which contained the enforcement agency's findings, a Deutsche Bank India executive confirmed to the federal agents in April that Indian law required the drawing up of a legal agreement between Xiaomi India and Qualcomm to make royalty payments, and the smartphone company disclosed to the bank such an agreement existed.Xiaomi India did not share the agreement with the bank due to confidentiality reasons, Deutsche told investigators, according to the documents.However, during the investigation, Xiaomi's India CFO, Sameer B. S. Rao, and its managing director at the time, Manu Kumar Jain, admitted there was no agreement between Qualcomm and Xiaomi India, and the royalties were remitted based on directions received from the group's executives in China, the Indian agency stated, the documents showed.Story continuesXiaomi ""provided misleading information to the bank. They did not share the agreement with the bank which they referred (to) as the basis of payment,"" the agency noted in its assessment.""This shows ... their intention of remitting the money outside India as per the whims and fancies of the Chinese parent,"" it added.A spokesperson for Deutsche Bank declined to comment. One of Xiaomi's four frozen bank accounts in India is at Deutsche, according to the court documents.Qualcomm, in a statement, said under ""the license with Qualcomm, Xiaomi India pays royalties on all devices sold in India"". Both didn't answer questions related to royalty agreements.Rao, Jain and the Enforcement Directorate did not respond.Xiaomi, India's biggest smartphone player with a 21% market share, said it continues to stand by its ""position on the legality of the royalty payments,"" referring Reuters to an Oct. 2 statement.In that statement, it said Xiaomi India was an affiliate and one of the Xiaomi Group companies, which entered into a legal agreement with Qualcomm. It was ""legitimate"" for the India unit to pay the U.S. firm, the statement added.Indian authorities do not agree with that and say Xiaomi India only acts as a reseller of smartphones that are made by contract manufacturers. Given the Indian unit has no role in designing phones, it had ""nothing to do"" with royalty payments to Qualcomm, the agency assessed, according to the court documents.Many Chinese companies have struggled to do business in India due to political tensions following a border clash in 2020. India has cited security concerns in banning more than 300 Chinese apps and tightened investment norms for Chinese firms.In the Xiaomi probe, the company alleged Rao and Jain faced threats of ""physical violence"" during questioning by the Indian agency, Reuters reported in May. The agency called the allegations ""untrue and baseless"".(Reporting by Aditya Kalra and Munsif Vengattil in New Delhi; Additional reporting by Nimitt Dixit; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)]"

Eventually that means there’s less need to spend marketing dollars to win them back.App downloads were strong, but app usage was at an all-time high with quarterly active app users increasing nearly 40 percent versus 2019, Kern said. Almost two-thirds of its gross bookings resulted from direct traffic in the quarter.Kern’s comments came as Expedia reported net income for the third quarter of $482 million, on revenue of $3.62 billion. That turns things around significantly after the last quarter’s losses. The quarter also produced record earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, of more than a billion dollars.Pipeline of the FutureThe CEO also gave a glimpse into what lies further ahead. Kern discussed microservices during Skift Global Forum in September, and he now wants to “externalize” those capabilities.That will include social commerce, and Kern said Expedia was in a unique position to roll out those services at scale. “So we’re extremely bullish there. We’ve expanded and improved our partnerships with many of our biggest supply partners through these kind of technological relationships, and we’re feeling quite good about it,” he said.Story continues“It’s a real opportunity for us to take our technological advances and bring them to the industry and help create greater efficiency in our partners running their businesses and then ultimately expand the universe of partners who can sell travel,” he added.On Thursday Expedia confirmed that it had already signed up a customer to its fraud prevention technology.The company will also invest more in new features like price tracking, trip boards and smart shopping. These are designed to reassure customers that they are finding the right product at the right time at the right price.“Flight tracking has been a great engagement tool,” Kern said.New chief financial officer Julie Whalen added during the call that she was attracted to Expedia because she felt it was at a “pivotal point” in its history.“Some of the things they were doing are just game changers. And some of this have happened actually at my previous company,” she said. “And once we have finished, some of that really enables the business to take off in a big way. So I knew they were at the pivotal point as the company to launch these changes.”Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

This compares to earnings of $3.53 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4.11%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this online travel company would post earnings of $1.57 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.96, delivering a surprise of 24.84%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Expedia , which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, posted revenues of $3.62 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.84%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.96 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Expedia shares have lost about 50% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -21.1%.What's Next for Expedia?While Expedia has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Expedia: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.78 on $2.73 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.15 on $11.72 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Internet - Commerce is currently in the top 25% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the same industry, Shift Tech (SFT), is yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on November 8.This company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.53 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -10.4%.

Total GAAP and adjusted indirect selling and marketing expenses, decreased 10% and 4%, respectively compared to the third quarter of 2021. The decrease in indirect marketing expense was driven by lower personnel costs related to the sale of Egencia in November 2021. The year-over-year decrease in GAAP indirect costs was driven by lower stock-based compensation.Technology and ContentFor the third quarter of 2022, total GAAP and adjusted technology and content expense increased 12% and 15%, respectively, compared to the third quarter of 2021, due to an increase in personnel costs from increased headcount.General and AdministrativeFor the third quarter of 2022, total GAAP and adjusted general and administrative expense increased 2% and 4%, respectively, compared to the third quarter of 2021, due to an increase in personnel costs from increased headcount.Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Expedia Group and Adjusted EBITDA*Adjusted EBITDA by Segment ($ millions)Third Quarter20222021Δ%Retail$943$8797%B2B22174198%Unallocated overhead costs(119)(116)3%Expedia Group (excluding trivago)$1,045$83725%trivago(1)341885%Total Adjusted EBITDA$1,079$85526%Net income attributable to Expedia Group common stockholders(2)$482$36233%(1) trivago is a separately listed company on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and, therefore, is subject to its own reporting and filing requirements which could result in possible differences that are not expected to be material to Expedia Group.(2) Expedia Group does not calculate or report net income (loss) by segment.* Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure.

Consolidated interest expense decreased $23 million in the third quarter of 2022, as a result of lower interest expense related to the early redemption of senior notes in the first nine months of 2022.Consolidated other, net was a loss of $87 million in the third quarter of 2022, primarily driven by mark-to-market losses on minority equity investments in American Express Global Business Travel (""GBT"") and Despegar compared to a gain of $25 million in the third quarter of 2021, in which we recognized a gain related to the sale of the Alice business.Income TaxesThe GAAP effective tax rate was a 31% expense on a pre-tax income in the third quarter of 2022, compared to a 19% expense on pre-tax income in the third quarter of 2021. The change in the effective tax rate was primarily due primarily due to nondeductible mark-to-market adjustments to our minority equity investments as well as other discrete itemsThe effective tax rate on pretax adjusted net income was 24% in the third quarter of 2022, compared to 2% in the third quarter of 2021. The change in effective tax rate was primarily due to the increase in pretax adjusted net income and discrete items.Balance Sheet, Cash Flows and CapitalizationFor the three months ended September 30, 2022, consolidated net cash used in operating activities was approximately $1.0 billion.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go to Growth Stock Portfolio: 5 Stock Picks By Hedge Funds. Growth fund managers, Wall Street experts, and even small firms have been fairly optimistic in the face of macro challenges which are piling up one after another, ranging from persistent inflation and rising rates to virus restrictions and geopolitical unrest disrupting supply chains and energy provision globally. Investors acknowledge these headwinds, but with the November Fed meeting and Q3 2022 corporate earnings now on the table, there is some relief that the largest surprises are out of the way, which leaves stocks attractively valued. Eric Schoenstein, chief investment officer at Jensen Investment Management, who owns positions in premier tech firms like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), told Bloomberg on November 3: “We’re comfortable looking through the current headwinds and volatility, and we’re comfortable with our conclusion that these are very strong businesses that are going through a bit of a reset in expectations.” Big tech remains largely favored by Wall Street analysts, retail traders, and institutional investors alike. Firms like Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon received Buy ratings from at least 70% of Wall Street experts. As per Vanda Research, retail investors are boosting their equity investments as well. Bloomberg cited Vanda senior vice president Marco Iachini on November 3, who said: “The selloff in mega caps was seen as a buy-the-dip opportunity rather than a capitulation moment.”Our Methodology We selected the following growth stocks based on their popularity among elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022. We have also mentioned the latest analyst coverage, underlying business fundamentals, and the P/E ratios as of November 3. Stocks with a P/E ratio of more than 30 were selected for this list. Story continuesGrowth Stock Portfolio: 12 Stock Picks By Hedge FundsPhoto by Ruben Sukatendel on UnsplashGrowth Stock Portfolio: Stock Picks By Hedge Funds12. Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 80P/E Ratio as of November 3: 36.35Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) is a Washington-based online travel company that operates through Brand Expedia, Vrbo, Classic Vacations, Expedia Cruise, Expedia Partner Solutions, Trivago, and Expedia Group Media brands. Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) is one of the premier picks of elite hedge funds for a growth stock portfolio. On October 28, Truist analyst Naved Khan maintained a Buy rating on Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $175 from $185 part of a broader research note on Online Travel names. The group's Q3 results should be ""healthy"" amid resilient demand and positive traffic patterns. Commentary from Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) on strength in Travel ad spend also supports this view, the analyst wrote in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 80 hedge funds were long Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) at the end of June 2022, compared to 88 funds in the last quarter. Like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), elite hedge funds are largely bullish on Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE). Here is what Artisan Partners specifically said about Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) shares declined 1% during the quarter. Part of this was just the shares finding a bottom after a significant decline in the prior quarter. The business continues to perform well. The core business has largely recovered from the pandemic, with lodging revenues now 9% higher than 2019 levels. The overall travel environment has remained strong, but the big question is whether inflationary pressure on consumer discretionary spending will render the recovery short lived. Time will tell. In the meantime, the business is performing well, and the structural improvements in Expedia’s cost structure made during the pandemic are becoming visible. We estimate the shares are trading at ~10X normalized earnings, which remains attractive.”11. Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 81P/E Ratio as of November 3: 4,323.69Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) provides a cloud-based monitoring and analytics platform for web developers and business users in North America and internationally. On November 3, the company posted market-beating Q3 results, and said that it expects revenue for full-year 2022 between $1.650 billion and $1.654 billion, versus a consensus of $1.63 billion. The company also initiated upbeat Q4 guidance. It is one of the best candidates for a growth stock portfolio. On November 2, Macquarie analyst Frederick Havemeyer initiated coverage of Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) with a Neutral rating and an $85 price target. The rating represents a cautious stance on short-term macro headwinds, the analyst told investors in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 81 hedge funds were bullish on Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) at the end of June 2022, compared to 82 funds in the prior quarter. Henry Ellenbogen’s Durable Capital Partners is the leading position holder in the company, with 3.14 million shares worth $299.5 million. Here is what Baron Global Advantage Fund has to say about Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Another example is Datadog, the leading infrastructure monitoring, application performance monitoring and log management software platform. Datadog’s stock declined 15% during the quarter, despite reporting sparkling operational results, with revenues accelerating to a growth rate of 84% year-over-year with 33% free cash flow margins, while guiding for 2022 significantly above expectations. Datadog added 4,600 new customers in the quarter, while existing customers continued to increase their spending on Datadog products at a rapid pace with the number of customers using four or more products increasing to 33% from 22% last year. While Datadog’s stock was down, its intrinsic value has undoubtedly increased. This is enabled by rapid innovation (Datadog released 13 new products in 2021) into a market that is benefiting from the secular growth in cloud, digital transformation, and the explosion in complexity as the number of vendors, diversity of technologies and related infrastructure continued to expand.”10. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84P/E Ratio as of November 3: 42.98NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), an American multinational semiconductor firm, is one of the top picks of the smart money for a growth stock portfolio. On October 18, Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) announced that they were expanding their current partnership in an effort to advance artificial intelligence adoption in the Oracle enterprise. According to the NVIDIA CEO, the deal would ""put NVIDIA AI within easy reach for thousands of companies.""On October 25, Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill reiterated a Buy rating on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) but trimmed the firm's price target on the shares to $155 from $170 as part of a broader research note on Semiconductors and Semiconductor Equipment. Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management held a significant position in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) at the end of June 2022, comprising 7.6 million shares worth $1.15 billion. Here is what Baron Funds specifically said about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a fabless semiconductor company and a leader in gaming and accelerated computing. NVIDIA is powering the growth of AI from the data center to the edge. Shares detracted due to inventory right sizing in NVIDIA’s gaming segment coupled with the broader market sell-off in growth stocks. Given NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, we believe the company can sustain its growth trajectory. See further discussion of NVIDIA in the top net purchases section below.During the third quarter, we took advantage of its stock sell-off to add to NVIDIA Corporation, a fabless semiconductor mega cap that is a global leader in gaming cards and accelerated computing hardware and software. The sell-off was driven by a near-term inventory correction in gaming as a result of a COVID-related pull forward in demand as well as the shift in the Ethereum cryptocurrency from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Additionally, investors are concerned over the potential slowdown in data center revenues as a result of a weaker macroeconomic environment as well as the recently announced limitations on semiconductor shipments to China. Despite the near-term uncertainty, we believe that NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, would enable the company to benefit from durable growth for years to come and therefore view the stock price where we added shares as a compelling value for long-term investors. With demand for computing power doubling every one to two years, and Moore’s Law slowing down, there is more need for computing than ever. At the same time, “near free” supply growth (that was possible thanks to Moore’s Law) has slowed dramatically. NVIDIA’s accelerated architecture, with parallel computing at scale, answers that need.”9. Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 93P/E Ratio as of November 3: 50.63Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), an American travel technology firm, is one of the firms backed by elite investors for a growth stock portfolio. In Q2 2022, the company reported earnings for the third quarter of 2022. Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) posted a Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $53.03 and a revenue of $6.05 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $3.18 and $130 million, respectively. Gross travel bookings, net of cancellations, were $32.1 billion. This represents an increase of 36% year-over-year. Deutsche Bank analyst Lee Horowitz on November 3 raised the price target on Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) to $2,370 from $2.280 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. The company's Q3 results significantly topped Street expectations, showcasing the resilience of travel recovery across all global regions as well as Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG)’s ability to gain higher share, the analyst told investors in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 93 hedge funds were bullish on Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 99 funds in the prior quarter. Harris Associates is a significant position holder in the company, with 616,383 shares worth more than $1 billion. Here is what RiverPark Large Growth Fund has to say about Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We also bought back a small position in Booking Holdings during the quarter. Booking is the world’s leader in online travel, operating in 200 countries with brands including Booking.com, priceline.com, agoda.com, Kayak, Rentalcars.com and OpenTable. The company has been a dominant on-line travel agency for more than a decade with a high margin business model (40% EBITDA margin for 2019 and 28% for 2021) that requires limited capital expenditures, typically less than 3% of revenue, producing $4.5 billion free cash flow for 2019 and $2.5 billion for 2021 (due to the vast COVID disruption). The company has used its free cash flow for episodic acquisitions as well as to return cash to shareholders. BKNG is well positioned in travel as the largest player in online lodging bookings and the second largest player in alternative accommodations. Like all travel companies, Booking was hit hard by the pandemic, but with its high international exposure, we expect the company’s recovery to be equally strong as travel returns.”8. T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 96P/E Ratio as of November 3: 121.17T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) is an American company providing mobile communications services such as voice, messaging, and data to customers in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands. Although T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) missed revenue estimates in Q3, the company reassured investors about subscriber strength and posted a positive outlook for full-year 2022. T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) is one of the top contenders for a growth stock portfolio. On October 28, Cowen analyst Paul Gallant lifted the price target on T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) to $201 from $187 and reiterated an Outperform rating on the shares following the robust Q3 results. According to the second quarter database of Insider Monkey, 96 hedge funds held stakes worth $6.85 billion in T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS), compared to 91 funds in the last quarter worth $7.2 billion. In its Q4 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments shared its stance on T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS):“As mentioned, the communication services sector has come under some pressure, and irrational pricing competition has negatively impacted wireless industry growth and profitability of late, weighing on T-Mobile. Faced with these headwinds, and with pressure from other wireless carriers and cable companies that could cause the company to cede share in subscriber growth in 2022, we exited our position in the fourth quarter.”7. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 97P/E Ratio as of November 3: 46.54PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), an American multinational payments technology firm, is one of the leading picks of elite investors for a growth stock portfolio. On October 25, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock climbed as e-commerce giant Amazon authorized some of its customers to use PayPal's Venmo at checkout during the holiday shopping season. Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette on October 26 maintained an Overweight rating and a $134 price target on PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) shares. Although the analyst acknowledged that the Amazon-Venmo deal will have an immaterial impact on PayPal’s financials, he views the roll-out as a significant catalyst as it can introduce Venmo to other merchants and boost the overall acceptance network, in addition to improving habituation for Venmo users.According to Insider Monkey’s data, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) was part of 97 hedge fund portfolios at the end of the second quarter of 2022, compared to 100 in the last quarter. Terry Smith’s Fundsmith LLP is a significant position holder in the company, with 9.65 million shares worth $674 million. Here is what RiverPark Large Growth Fund has to say about PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“PayPal, announced better-than-expected 2Q results, positive guidance (including more than $1.3 billion of 2023 cost savings leading to operating margin expansion), a $15 billion stock repurchase program, and the appointment of Blake Jorgensen as CFO, who was previously the well-regarded CFO at Electronic Arts. The company reported 9% revenue growth, in-line with guidance, and $0.93 EPS, exceeding guidance due to robust operating leverage. Management narrowed its 2022 revenue guidance from 11%-13% growth to about 11% growth due to the macro environment but raised its EPS guidance due to greater operating margin leverage and share buybacks. The stock also reacted to the news that activist investor Elliott Management had taken a stake in the company. PYPL operates at significantly lower margins than its payment competitors Visa and Mastercard, and sources suggest that Elliott intends, among other things, to push for the company to improve its margins and drive higher cash flow growth in the near term.PayPal provides direct exposure to the secular growth in ecommerce-driven digital payments as it is the most accepted digital wallet on-line. More than 3/4 of the 1,500 largest online retailers across North America and Europe accept PayPal, which is almost triple the acceptance of Apple Pay, the number two digital wallet. PayPal is also a key beneficiary of the current dramatic shift in consumer buying habits brought on by the pandemic, as well as the relatively newer consumer-to-consumer payment trends through its Venmo peer-to-peer (P2P) payment service. With a 2Q non-GAAP operating margin of 19%, PYPL also has significant margin expansion potential given that competitors Adyen, Visa and Mastercard have 50%-65% operating margins. We believe the combination of the secular growth of eCommerce and P2P payments, along with expanding operating leverage and the strategic use of the company’s significant and growing cash balance should fuel a mid-20% earnings growth rate over the next five years. This, to us, presents an excellent risk/reward profile given that PYPL trades at a modest premium to the market multiple and a 6% 2023 FCF yield.”6. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99P/E Ratio as of November 3: 394.19ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a California-based provider of cloud computing solutions for enterprises worldwide.

(NYSE:NOW) reiterated the earlier FY22 operating margin guidance of 25%, while also absorbing an incremental 1% impact from forex headwinds. The revenue grew 21.2% year-over-year to $1.83 billion but fell short of Wall Street consensus. ServiceNow, Inc.

The analyst expects the company to continue to ""deliver a best-in-class platform for making work better.""According to Insider Monkey’s data, 99 hedge funds were long ServiceNow, Inc.

(NYSE:NOW) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“ServiceNow: Despite a strong beat and raise quarter and a positive analyst day where management increased its long-term subscription revenue and operating margin targets, NOW was a top detractor for the quarter as management noted the macro environment created some near-term deal slippage and longer sales cycles. For its 2Q22, the company reported 25% subscription revenue growth (including a 500-basis point currency headwind) and lowered full year subscription revenue guidance to 24% from 26%, on a 400-basis point currency headwind. Still the company reiterated its ambitious long-term targets from its May analyst day, at which the company raised its F24 subscription revenue target by $1 billion to $11 billion (up almost 60% from the $7 billion in revenue expected for 2022), all through organic growth, and increased its operating margin target to 27% (up from its 25% target for 2022).ServiceNow is a best-of-breed provider of both IT Service Management (ITSM) and IT Operations Management (ITOM) solutions to enterprise customers. The company’s products serve mainly its clients’ internal employee base with a current focus on automating the process of IT deployment, configuration and service and management of IT assets across an organization. Both its ITSM and ITOM solutions are delivered as a software-as-a-service (SaaS) and are leading solutions in growing markets, driven by the secular trend of enterprises transitioning all aspects of their business and operations to the cloud. As the company maintains and adds customers, upsells them, and expands into adjacent markets, we believe NOW should sustain a strong long-term revenue and FCF growth trajectory.” Click to continue reading and see Growth Stock Portfolio: 5 Stock Picks By Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:Harvard University's Stock Portfolio11 Best Future Food Stocks To Buy11 Best Midcap Dividend Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None.

This will take the annual payment to 2.5% of the stock price, which is above what most companies in the industry pay. Check out our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. Prior to this announcement, Lockheed Martin's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings.

Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 43% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendLockheed Martin Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2012, the dividend has gone from $4.00 total annually to $12.00. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 12% a year over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. We are encouraged to see that Lockheed Martin has grown earnings per share at 12% per year over the past five years. Shareholders are getting plenty of the earnings returned to them, which combined with strong growth makes this quite appealing.We Really Like Lockheed Martin's DividendOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For instance, we've picked out 2 warning signs for Lockheed Martin that investors should take into consideration. Is Lockheed Martin not quite the opportunity you were looking for?

It has amassed assets over $47.27 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap ValueLarge cap companies usually have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.Value stocks have lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios. They also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. Looking at their long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in almost all markets. They are however likely to underperform growth stocks in strong bull markets.CostsWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.06%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 3.06%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Financials sector--about 20.50% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Consumer Staples round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) accounts for about 3.28% of total assets, followed by Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Jpmorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM).Story continuesThe top 10 holdings account for about 23.11% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskVYM seeks to match the performance of the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index before fees and expenses. The FTSE High Dividend Yield Index which is consists of common stocks of companies that pay dividends that generally are higher than average.The ETF has lost about -4.74% so far this year and is down about -1.59% in the last one year (as of 11/04/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $94.88 and $115.01.The ETF has a beta of 0.86 and standard deviation of 23.27% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 445 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesVanguard High Dividend Yield ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, VYM is an excellent option for investors seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Value segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.The iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $51.72 billion in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $99.37 billion. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.18% and VTV charges 0.04%.Bottom-LineWhile an excellent vehicle for long term investors, passively managed ETFs are a popular choice among institutional and retail investors due to their low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While this might not raise any eyebrows, if the P/E ratio is not justified investors could be missing out on a potential opportunity or ignoring looming disappointment.Recent times have been advantageous for Merck as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. One possibility is that the P/E is moderate because investors think this strong earnings performance might be about to tail off. If not, then existing shareholders have reason to be feeling optimistic about the future direction of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for Merck peKeen to find out how analysts think Merck's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Does Growth Match The P/E?Merck's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver moderate growth, and importantly, perform in line with the market.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 159%. The latest three year period has also seen an excellent 68% overall rise in EPS, aided by its short-term performance. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been superb for the company.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 11% each year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. With the market predicted to deliver 9.5% growth per year, the company is positioned for a comparable earnings result.With this information, we can see why Merck is trading at a fairly similar P/E to the market. It seems most investors are expecting to see average future growth and are only willing to pay a moderate amount for the stock.What We Can Learn From Merck's P/E?Generally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.Story continuesWe've established that Merck maintains its moderate P/E off the back of its forecast growth being in line with the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement or deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a high or low P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price moving strongly in either direction in the near future under these circumstances.It is also worth noting that we have found 3 warning signs for Merck that you need to take into consideration.It's important to make sure you look for a great company, not just the first idea you come across. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with strong recent earnings growth (and a P/E ratio below 20x).Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?

MRNA reported earnings of $2.53 per share for the third quarter of 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.04. Earnings declined 67% in the quarter. The year-over-year decline in the bottom line was due to lower revenues and higher operating expenses incurred during the third quarter.Revenues in the quarter were $3.36 billion, which also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.33 billion. Total revenues were down 32.3% year over year due to declining COVID-19 vaccine sales during the quarter.Quarter in DetailProduct sales, entirely from the sale of COVID-19 vaccines, were down 35.1% year over year to $3.12 billion, driven by lower sales volume of COVID due to the timing of market authorizations for bivalent booster vaccines. Sequentially, the sales figures declined 31.1%.Grant revenues were $144 million compared with $140 million in the year-ago quarter. Collaboration revenues were $100 million compared with $19 million in the year-ago quarter. The company earns collaboration revenues from agreements with several big pharma/biotech companies, including AstraZeneca, Merck MRK and Vertex Pharmaceuticals.Selling, general and administrative expenses were $278 million, up 65% year over year. The upside can be attributed to an increase in personnel-related expenses and increased spending in commercialization activities.Research &amp; development expenses were $820 million, up 57% from the year-ago period’s levels. The significant increase was primarily attributable to higher clinical costs and personnel-related expenses.The company ended the quarter with $17.0 billion in cash and cash equivalents compared with $18.1 billion as of Jun 30, 2022.Trims 2022 GuidanceFollowing the delay of certain deliveries of its bivalent COVID-19 vaccine doses due to short-term supply-related issues, Moderna cut its annual sales forecast for its COVID-19 vaccine. Management now expects revenue from advanced purchase agreements in the range of $18-$19 billion, down from the previous guidance of nearly $21 billion. The company deferred deliveries worth $2-$3 billion out to next year.Story continuesFollowing the opening bell on Nov 3, Moderna’s shares dived down 12% due to the cut in sales guidance for its COVID vaccine. In the year so far, shares of the company have declined 41.6% compared with the industry’s 22.3% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company maintained combined R&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses to be approximately $4 billion in 2022. It expects capital expenditure to be around $500 million, down from the previous range of $600-$800 million.Coronavirus Vaccine UpdateThis August, the FDA authorized mRNA-1273.222, a BA.4/BA.5 Omicron-targeting bivalent COVID vaccine for use as a single booster dose in individuals aged six years and older. This booster vaccine has been developed specifically to cater to the U.S. market. A deal worth $1.7 billion has been inked with the U.S. government for this new vaccine. A regulatory filing is also pending in the European Union seeking authorization for mRNA-1273.222 in individuals aged 12 years and older.During the third quarter, Moderna also gained authorizations in Europe, Australia and Japan for using mRNA-1273.214, a bivalent COVID vaccine designed to target the BA.1 Omicron subvariant.Other Key Pipeline UpdatesModerna has several other mRNA-based pipeline candidates targeting different indications in its pipeline. The leading candidates among them are mRNA-1010 (seasonal flu vaccine), mRNA-1345 (respiratory syncytial virus vaccine) and mRNA-1647 (cytomegalovirus vaccine), which are in pivotal late-stage studies. Data from the influenza vaccine is expected in first-quarter 2023.Last month, Moderna announced that partner Merck exercised an option under an existing collaboration agreement. Per the agreement, the companies will jointly develop and commercialize Moderna’s PCV candidate, mRNA-4157/V940. In consideration for exercising the option, Merck will pay $250 million to Moderna. This payment by Merck was received in fourth-quarter 2022.mRNA-4157 is currently being evaluated in a mid-stage study by Moderna in combination with Merck’s blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda as an adjuvant treatment for patients with high-risk melanoma.

Yet while the current market perception may be that “the worst is over,” some analysts are arguing that it’s premature to say that a recovery has kicked off, or is imminent.There are plenty of large-cap names that have performed well during the recent rally and are likely to perform well. The reasons for this are twofold. First, being “cheap,” or undervalued, stocks, these particular plays are less at risk of multiple compression, in the event of further sharp interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSecond, many cheap large-cap stocks are either resistant to a continued downturn and/or are benefiting from secular growth trends.

During this timeframe, this “old school” automotive stock more than doubled in price, as the market became confident in its efforts to transform into primarily a maker of electric vehicles (or EVs).Flash forward to now, and F stock has delivered a mixed performance. Shares have fallen around 39% so far this year, due to recession fears, as well as the cooling down in enthusiasm for EV plays.However, even as Ford is contending with multiple headwinds at present, as its electrification efforts continue, the automaker’s long-term prospects remain very promising.Shares are cheap at current levels, trading at 6.7 times earnings. With its EV catalyst still intact, this stock could continue to slowly (but steadily) continue its comeback. This makes F stock (which earns a B rating in Portfolio Grader) a great long-term buy.Story continuesFreeport-McMoRan (FCX)Freeport-McMoRan sign on a Freeport-McMoRan office building in Phoenix, Arizona.Source: MICHAEL A JACKSON FILMS / Shutterstock.comFreeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) is another of the cheap large-cap stocks beginning to recover. The copper miner’s shares have whipsawed throughout the year, in line with copper prices.Boosted higher by the commodities rally sparked by Russia’s Ukraine invasion, FCX stock has until recently been knocked lower by concerns about falling demand, due to China’s economic slowdown.However, following the company’s recent strong earnings report, the near-term forecast may not be as bleak as the market currently believes. As CEO Richard Adkerson argued on the post-earnings conference call, Freeport-McMoRan has “no problem selling copper.”Demand for the metal keeps rising. The EV megatrend could continue to help counter the impact of a possible global recession. This may enable FCX stock (earning a B in Portfolio Grader), reasonably priced at 14 times earnings, to continue making a partial recovery in the near-term, and possibly hit new highs over a longer timeframe.Kinder Morgan (KMI)Kinder Morgan logo on a sign outside the company headquarters in Houston.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comShares in Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI), one of the largest oil and gas pipeline companies, continue to bounce back, after nearly re-testing lows during the September stock market sell-off.While overall a mixed earnings report, Kinder Morgan did report double-digit earnings and distributable cash flow growth.This points to continued dividend growth for high-yielding KMI stock (forward yield of 6.25%). Over the past five years, KMI’s dividend has grown by an average of 17.1% annually. These payouts provide investors with steady returns, and the growth of such payouts opens the door for continued price appreciation.Trading at a reasonable earnings multiple of 15.3, KMI could continue to climb, in tandem with earnings/dividend growth. That makes this midstream energy play (which earns a B rating in Portfolio Grader) a great opportunity. Shares could continue to recover in the near-term and generate strong returns over a long timeframe.Kroger (KR)Kroger (KR) Supermarket. The Kroger Co. is One of the World's Largest Grocery Retailers.Source: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.comGrocery store operator Kroger (NYSE:KR) has successfully stayed one step ahead of inflation thus far. This, plus its reputation as a recession-resistant “safe stock,” has helped keep its shares in the green throughout 2022.More recently, a new uncertainty about KR stock (B-rated in Portfolio Grader) has emerged. That would be news of the company’s plans to merge with competitor Albertsons Companies (NYSE:ACI).Yet while possible antitrust-related objections result in the deal failing to secure regulatory approval, this combination could be one that pays off handsomely for investors.As InvestorPlace’s Dana Blankenhorn discussed Oct. 14, this mega-merger may create a grocery store colossus that can better compete with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and other large retailers.Albertsons also sports a lower earnings multiple (6.9 times earnings) than Kroger (11.5 times earnings). This deal could be very accretive to earnings, even before cost savings are taken into account.MetLife (MET)the MetLife logo displayed on the outside of a buildingSource: Osugi / Shutterstock.comIn 2022, “boring stocks” have been beautiful, and MetLife (NYSE:MET) is no exception. Shares in the mammoth life insurance and financial services firm are up around 15.7% year to date.Even with this moderate price appreciation, MET stock (which earns a B in Portfolio Grader) remains cheap. MET’s current price-to-earnings ratio is only 10.1. This may not be out of the ordinary for insurers, yet this valuation may be too low, given the prospect of much higher earnings in 2023.As seen in recent financial results, MetLife is experiencing premium and fee growth, but has been temporarily affected by the sharp rise in interest rates.Yet as the impact of rising rates turns from a negative (one-time investment and derivative losses) to a positive (higher yield from its investment portfolio), the insurer’s earnings are expected to grow by around 15.75% next year.Marathon Oil (MRO)Marathon Oil gas station carport on sunny day with blue sky backgroundSource: Jonathan Weiss/shutterstock.comLike most oil and gas exploration and production (or E&amp;P) stocks, Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) has knocked it out of the park performance-wise over the past year.In the last twelve months, Marathon shares have surged to the tune of 83.3%.Yet while another similarly-sized jump may not be in the cards over the next twelve months, Undervalued MRO stock (trading at a low P/E ratio of 6.5) could nonetheless continue to deliver above-average returns to investors. With crude oil prices expected to remain high, this E&amp;P company’s earnings will stay high as well.Management plans to return most of these earnings back to shareholders. Mainly, through the repurchase of shares. The company has also raised its quarterly dividend by one cent per share, or 12.5%. These return-of-capital efforts could keep MRO stock (A-rated in Portfolio Grader) moving in the right direction.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is another E&amp;P stock that’s both cheap (trading for 7 times earnings) and top-rated (A rating) in Portfolio Grader, but unlike Marathon Oil, this oil company has other catalysts.As I discussed recently, the accumulation of additional shares in the company by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A,NYSE:BRK.B) has been another driver for OXY stock this year. With regulatory approval to raise Berkshire’s stake to up to 50%, subsequent purchases could help shares inch higher.Alongside this catalyst, Oxy has a longer-term clean energy catalyst as well, with its big bet on carbon capture. With this emerging technology getting a major boost from the Inflation Reduction Act, the company is well-positioned to turn carbon capture into a profitable sideline business.All of this points to further gains ahead for A-rated OXY stock.On the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in F, KMI, KR, MRO and OXY.

I want to build a product that's going to differentiate in a way that absolutely substitutes the airplanes that came before it,"" Calhoun told analysts at an investor day.Such a plane would be 20-30% more efficient and start to lay the groundwork for future autonomous or machine-driven flight.""There'll be a moment in time where we'll pull the rabbit out of the hat and introduce a new airplane sometime in the middle of the next decade,"" he said.Analysts said that was meant to reassure investors Boeing would not embark on a $15-billion spree before reducing its $45 billion of net debt, while reassuring restless airlines any 737 successor would be worth the wait.Story continuesThat marks what some industry sources described as a quiet but decisive U-turn behind the scenes after months in which the planemaker had been informally touting the possibility of a pair of late 2020s jets known as 5X and 6X to block the A321neo.It now calculates the MAX family of aircraft will carry it through the decade, as originally planned, in the face of still-evolving technology and limited resources.Investors mostly agreed, pushing up Boeing's shares some 10%.MARKET SHAREBut industry insiders said there were a number of risks in Calhoun's strategy of waiting out the 2020s.First, Boeing is now more than ever dependent on getting its MAX 10 - needed to counter the A321neo - certified.That depends on a Congressional waiver which although far from automatic is ultimately likely to happen, congressional aides say. If it fails, the 5X/6X may yet see the light of day.Second, it leaves Airbus with an entrenched market lead through the decade, rather than the 50/50 split seen over time.That offers Airbus a cost advantage as well as a useful negotiating currency with which to convert existing customers to its own next jet likely to appear in the 2030s.Calhoun stressed market share was not the issue.But industry experts said it appeared no accident that Boeing's mid-decade delivery forecasts - 50 single-aisles a month compared with Airbus' goal of 75 - gave Boeing an implied share of 40%, widely seen as the lowest needed for a duopoly to remain stable.""They are settling for 40% but no less,"" a senior industry source said.Neither planemaker was immediately available for comment.Sitting out the decade also leaves the MAX family exposed to competition from a potential new variant of Airbus' smaller but lighter A220. Airbus has said the A220-500 is ""when not if"".Amid the threat to its MAX cash cow from below, Boeing highlighted plans to put pressure on Airbus from above and generate more cash by pledging higher 787 wide-body output.Harder to measure are the intangible risks of waiting.Ron Epstein of Bank of America said lack of investment historically turns market dominance to ""market subordination"".Calhoun insists patience will pay off next decade. Until then, the numbers of a lop-sided duopoly favour Airbus barring a setback in its own output plans, which many see as ambitious.""If we bring any of the capabilities that I am suggesting will be available to us at that moment...leadership will be well within our grasp,"" Calhoun said.(Writing by Tim Hepher.

A quarter ago, it was expected that this genetic testing tools company would post earnings of $0.63 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.57, delivering a surprise of -9.52%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Illumina , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, posted revenues of $1.12 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.33%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.11 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Illumina shares have lost about 44.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -21.1%.What's Next for Illumina?While Illumina has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Illumina: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

226,1054d7d0-a1bc-33f9-a300-6361c8bc67b4,ILMN,2022-11-04,Illumina Introduces New Research Test to Address One of the Most Common Infections in the United States,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/illumina-introduces-research-test-address-171000116.html,1667495400,STORY,['ILMN'],"[Panel leverages precision metagenomics to transform testing for urinary tract infectionsNewest kit follows recent launch of panel testing for 66 viral pathogens that pose persistent threats to global public healthSAN DIEGO, CA / ACCESSWIRE / November 3, 2022 / Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN), a global leader in DNA sequencing and array-based technologies, announced a new research test for genitourinary pathogen and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) identification. The Illumina Urinary Pathogen Infectious Disease/Antimicrobial Resistance (ID/AMR) Panel (UPIP) applies precision metagenomics to detect and quantify pathogens, including those that are drug resistant that cause complicated and recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs).Genitourinary tract infections are among the most common community and healthcare-associated infections, and rising drug resistance causes increasing morbidity and mortality. This announcement comes after the October launch of two research tests enabling high-risk virus surveillance, as part of Illumina's steadfast commitment to supporting global preparedness for epidemic and pandemic outbreaks.In less than 48 hours, UPIP, a next-generation sequencing (NGS) based panel, detects and quantifies over 170 organisms that can cause genitourinary infections and more than 3700 AMR markers associated with 18 different drug classes. Combined with the use of Explify®, a fully automated data analysis platform, this workflow provides a comprehensive infection profile across bacterial, fungal, viral, and parasitic microbes.""The growing threat of infections by common and uncommon microbes with growing antimicrobial drug resistance is alarming; public health and private laboratories require new tools to fight emerging threats. Our UPIP test represents a unique opportunity for microbiologists and clinical researchers to rapidly identify pathogens and potential drug resistance for complicated or recurrent urinary infections,"" said Dr. Phil Febbo, chief medical officer of Illumina.Story continuesIn the United States, UTIs are one of the most common infections in the community and in hospitalized patients; they account for an average of 10 million office visits and 1 million hospitalizations per year. The prevalence of drug resistance in disease-causing microorganisms (uropathogens) is increasing, and antibiotic treatment for acute infection or prophylaxis often does not prevent recurrent infections.UPIP also identifies more than 20 sexually transmitted pathogens and their respective antimicrobial profile.Current testing methods require culture of the urinary sample as the first line of detection for UTIs and STIs, but many organisms do not grow in culture and remain undetected. UPIP detects and quantifies common and underrecognized but crucial uropathogens with no need for culture. UPIP can also identify slow-growing and anaerobic bacteria linked to UTIs that are typically missed in traditional detection methods.Precision MetagenomicsPrecision metagenomics can reduce the time to learn critical information about microbes from weeks to hours. UPIP is the second precision metagenomics panel on the Illumina Explify® platform. It follows the NGS-based Respiratory Pathogen ID/AMR Panel (RPIP) launched in June 2020 in partnership with IDbyDNA. RPIP targets over 280 respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, bacteria, fungi, and more than 2000 AMR markers. Both pathogen panels offer culture-free, flexible and scalable workflow in less than 48 hours, comprising a rapid, cost-effective solution for detecting respiratory and urinary tract infections in clinical research settings.Beyond the clinical research utilization, both RPIP and UPIP can also bring valuable insights to public health and surveillance, being used to monitor respiratory, genitourinary pathogens, and AMR markers in wastewater and environmental samples.Illumina's Role in Global High-Risk Virus SurveillancePublic health professionals are more often using genomics for surveillance of epidemics and pandemics. NGS has proven to be a more flexible, rapid, and comprehensive approach compared to traditional methods of assessing pathogenic agents. It provides a universal, culture-free method for infectious disease characterization and surveillance.Illumina is committed to supporting preparedness for and response to future large-scale outbreaks and preventing pandemics. In October, it launched the Viral Surveillance Panel (VSP), offering whole-genome sequencing and characterization of 66 viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, influenza, RSV, monkeypox, and poliovirus, which represent a high risk to public health. VSP's design allows researchers and public health scientists to monitor multiple high-risk viruses (both DNA and RNA) proactively, using a variety of sample types, including wastewater, environmental, and post-clinical.""We believe that a long-term, consistent, proactive genomic surveillance solution focused on high-risk viruses and deployed globally is necessary to help ensure better protection against future outbreaks,"" said Febbo.In parallel with VSP, Illumina launched the Pan-Coronavirus Panel (Pan-CoV), which allows for the detection and whole-genome sequencing of 203 known coronaviruses and over 370 strains of animal and closely related novel coronaviruses. With this panel, public health and zoonotic researchers can detect and characterize viruses that have the potential to move from wildlife and domestic animals to human populations.About IlluminaIllumina is improving human health by unlocking the power of the genome.

This compares to earnings of $1.48 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.A quarter ago, it was expected that this specialty contractor for utility and energy companies would post earnings of $1.51 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.54, delivering a surprise of 1.99%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Quanta Services , which belongs to the Zacks Engineering - R and D Services industry, posted revenues of $4.46 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.80%.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Quanta Services: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

230,1831de44-f360-309b-9be7-ed49208e8d84,MAA,2022-11-04,Covenant Logistics and Herbalife have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/covenant-logistics-herbalife-highlighted-zacks-111611855.html,1667560571,STORY,"['HLF', 'BRT', 'MAA-PI', 'EQR']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – November 4, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares Covenant Logistics Group CVLG as the Bull of the Day and Herbalife HLF as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on BRT Apartments Corp. BRT, Equity Residential's EQR and Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. MAA.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Covenant Logistics Group is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and it sports an A for Value and a B for Growth.  This company just posted a big beat and has seen a solid move higher.  Let's explore more about this company in this Bull of The Day article.DescriptionCovenant Logistics Group Inc. offers a portfolio of transportation and logistics services, through its subsidiaries. The company services include asset-based expedited, dedicated and irregular route truckload capacity, as well as asset-light warehousing, transportation management and freight brokerage capability. Covenant Logistics Group Inc, is based in Chattanooga, Tennessee.Earnings HistoryWhen I look at a stock, the first thing I do is look to see if the company is beating the number.  This tells me right away where the market's expectations have been for the company and how management has communicated to the market.  A stock that consistently beats has management communicating expectations to Wall Street that can be achieved.  That is what you want to see.For CVLG, I see four straight beats of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.  That is great to see, but by itself that is not enough to make the company a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The average positive earnings surprise over the course of the last year works out to be 22%.Earnings Estimates RevisionsThe Zacks Rank tells us which stocks are seeing earnings estimates move higher.Over the last 60 days, earning estimates have moved up for CVLG.This quarter has moved from $1.17 to $1.51.Story continuesNext quarter has increased from $0.79 to $0.94.The full fiscal year 2022 has increased from $5.43 to $5.77.Next fiscal year has seen the estimate move from $3.56 to $3.97.Positive movement in earnings stock is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).ValuationThe valuation for this name is quite low with a 6.5x forward earnings multiple.  The price to book is 1.5x which is well below the 3x level that value investors need to see. Price to sales comes in at 0.44x and has room to grow.  I see margins increasing in each of the last two quarters and with revenue growth slated to come in at 16%, this name looks very attractive.Bear of the Day:Herbalife is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) but it could be worthy of deeper after -16% and -10% moves on back-to-back days. This article will look at why this stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) as it is the Bear of the Day.DescriptionHerbalife is a global network marketing company offering a range of science-based weight management products, nutritional supplements and personal care products intended to support weight loss and a healthy lifestyle.Earnings HistoryWhen I look at a stock, the first thing I do is look to see if the company is beating the number. This tells me right away where the market's expectations have been for the company and how management has communicated to the market. A stock that consistently beats has management communicating expectations to Wall Street that can be achieved. That is what you want to see.In the case of HLF, I have three beats of the  Zacks Consensus Estimate and one miss. This alone does not make the stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and it doesn't make it a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) either.The Zacks Rank does care about the earnings history, but it is much more heavily influenced by the movement of earnings estimates.Earnings EstimatesThe Zacks Rank tells us which stocks are seeing earnings estimates move higher or in this case lower. For HLF I see annual estimates moving lower.The current fiscal year consensus number moved from $3.39  to $2.24 over the last 60 days.The next year has moved from $4.24 to $2.30.Negative movement in earnings estimates like that is why this stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).It should be noted that a majority of stocks in the Zacks universe are seeing negative earnings estimate revisions. That means that the stocks that are seeing small but negative earnings estimate revisions are falling to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Additional content:What to Expect from BRT Apartments (BRT) This Earnings SeasonBRT Apartments Corp. is slated to report third-quarter 2022 earnings on Nov 7 after market close.

The company estimated to recognize an $11.4 million gain on this.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.9 million for third-quarter revenues suggests a significant increase from $7.7 million reported in the year-ago period.Before the third-quarter earnings release, the company's activities were not adequate to gain analysts' confidence.

232,3f270d5a-e09b-3eb6-8522-9e01032d073b,CI,2022-11-04,Are Strong Financial Prospects The Force That Is Driving The Momentum In Cigna Corporation's NYSE:CI) Stock?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/strong-financial-prospects-force-driving-110015991.html,1667559615,STORY,['CI'],"[Cigna (NYSE:CI) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 15% over the last three months. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Specifically, we decided to study Cigna's  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Cigna How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Cigna is:12% = US$5.5b ÷ US$46b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.12 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Cigna's Earnings Growth And 12% ROETo start with, Cigna's ROE looks acceptable. Even when compared to the industry average of 15% the company's ROE looks quite decent. This certainly adds some context to Cigna's exceptional 24% net income growth seen over the past five years. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Cigna's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 18% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for CI? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Cigna Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Cigna's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 2.3%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 98% of its profits. So it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business and this reflects in its earnings growth number.Besides, Cigna has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 19% over the next three years. Regardless, the future ROE for Cigna is speculated to rise to 17% despite the anticipated increase in the payout ratio. There could probably be other factors that could be driving the future growth in the ROE.SummaryIn total, we are pretty happy with Cigna's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

233,119b1ca2-57cf-3851-8b97-5a5e9b6167d2,CI,2022-11-04,Is IQ Chaikin U.S. Large Cap ETF (CLRG) a Strong ETF Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/iq-chaikin-u-large-cap-102010729.html,1667557210,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'CI']","[The IQ Chaikin U.S. Large Cap ETF (CLRG) was launched on 12/13/2017, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund designed to offer broad exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend category of the market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?For a long time now, the ETF industry has been flooded with products based on market capitalization weighted indexes, which are designed to represent the broader market or a particular market segment.Market cap weighted indexes work great for investors who believe in market efficiency. They provide a low-cost, convenient and transparent way of replicating market returns.However, some investors believe in the possibility of beating the market through exceptional stock selection, and choose a different type of fund that tracks non-cap weighted strategies: smart beta.These indexes attempt to select stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance, based on certain fundamental characteristics or a combination of such characteristics.Methodologies like equal-weighting, one of the simplest options out there, fundamental weighting, and volatility/momentum based weighting are all choices offered to investors in this space, but not all of them can deliver superior returns.Fund Sponsor &amp; IndexBecause the fund has amassed over $270.03 million, this makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the Style Box - Large Cap Blend. CLRG is managed by New York Life Investments. CLRG seeks to match the performance of the NASDAQ CHAIKIN POWER US LARGE CAP INDEX before fees and expenses.The NASDAQ Chaikin Power US Large Cap Index applies a quantitative multi-factor model that seeks to identify securities that are expected to outperform peers by selecting securities from the Nasdaq US 300 Index.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor. And, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Story continuesOperating expenses on an annual basis are 0.25% for CLRG, making it on par with most peer products in the space.The fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.44%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsMost ETFs are very transparent products, and disclose their holdings on a daily basis. ETFs also offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, though it's still important for investors to research a fund's holdings.Representing 22.10% of the portfolio, the fund has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector; Healthcare and Financials round out the top three.When you look at individual holdings, Cigna Corp (CI) accounts for about 1.32% of the fund's total assets, followed by Mckesson Corp (MCK) and Centene Corp (CNC).Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 12.37% of CLRG's total assets under management.Performance and RiskYear-to-date, the IQ Chaikin U.S. Large Cap ETF has lost about -15.80% so far, and is down about -13.04% over the last 12 months (as of 11/04/2022). CLRG has traded between $28.38 and $36.15 in this past 52-week period.CLRG has a beta of 1.04 and standard deviation of 25.34% for the trailing three-year period. With about 102 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesIQ Chaikin U.S. Large Cap ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - Large Cap Blend segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.IShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF (IVV) tracks S&amp;P 500 Index and the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) tracks S&amp;P 500 Index. IShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF has $283.12 billion in assets, SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF has $352.98 billion. IVV has an expense ratio of 0.03% and SPY charges 0.09%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - Large Cap Blend.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Analysts on average expect a profit of $23 per share, according to Refinitiv data.Net income attributable to shareholders surged 70.1% to $2.76 billion due to a $1.4 billion after-tax gain from the sale of its Asia Pacific and Turkey accident and health business to Chubb Ltd.Excluding one-off items, Cigna's profit was $6.04 per share, beating consensus estimate of $5.71 per share.

This compares to earnings of $2.62 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3.78%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this chipmaker would post earnings of $2.36 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.44, delivering a surprise of 3.39%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Skyworks , which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductors - Radio Frequency industry, posted revenues of $1.41 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.25%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.31 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Skyworks shares have lost about 46.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -21.1%.What's Next for Skyworks?While Skyworks has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Skyworks: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $3.16 on $1.51 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $11.34 on $5.58 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Semiconductors - Radio Frequency is currently in the top 35% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the same industry, Akoustis (AKTS), is yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022.This company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.20 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +4.8%.

(Nasdaq: SWKS), an innovator of high-performance analog and mixed signal semiconductors connecting people, places and things, today reported fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year-end results for the period ended Sept. 30, 2022.Revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2022 was $1.407 billion, up 7% year over year, exceeding consensus estimates. On a GAAP basis, operating income for the fourth fiscal quarter was $388.0 million with diluted earnings per share of $1.88. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income was $528.6 million with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.02.For fiscal year 2022, revenue was $5.486 billion, up 7% compared to the prior year, and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $7.81. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for fiscal year 2022 were $11.24.""Skyworks set new records for revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year, delivering year-over-year growth driven by our increasingly diversified product portfolio and disciplined execution,"" said Liam K.

As set forth in the ""Unaudited Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" table found above, we derive such non-GAAP financial measures by excluding certain expenses and other items from the respective GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our operating performance and compare it against past periods, make operating decisions, forecast for future periods, compare our operating performance against peer companies, and determine payments under certain compensation programs. These non-GAAP financial measures provide management with additional means to understand and evaluate the operating results and trends in our ongoing business by eliminating certain non-recurring expenses and other items that management believes might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods and competitors more difficult, obscure trends in ongoing operations, or reduce management’s ability to make forecasts.We provide investors with non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin, non-GAAP operating income and operating margin, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share because we believe it is important for investors to be able to closely monitor and understand changes in our ability to generate income from ongoing business operations. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures give investors an additional method to evaluate historical operating performance and identify trends, an additional means of evaluating period-over-period operating performance and a method to facilitate certain comparisons of our operating results to those of our peer companies. We also believe that providing non-GAAP operating income and operating margin allows investors to assess the extent to which our ongoing operations impact our overall financial performance. We further believe that providing non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share allows investors to assess the overall financial performance of our ongoing operations by eliminating the impact of share-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, settlements, gains, losses, and impairments, restructuring-related charges, and certain tax items which may not occur in each period presented and which may represent non-cash items unrelated to our ongoing operations. We believe that disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures contributes to enhanced financial reporting transparency and provides investors with added clarity about complex financial performance measures.We calculate non-GAAP gross profit by excluding from GAAP gross profit, share-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. We calculate non-GAAP operating income by excluding from GAAP operating income, share-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, settlements, gains, losses, and impairments, and restructuring-related charges. We calculate non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share by excluding from GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share, share-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, settlements, gains, losses, and impairments, restructuring-related charges, and certain tax items. We exclude the items identified above from the respective non-GAAP financial measure referenced above for the reasons set forth with respect to each such excluded item below:Share-Based Compensation Expense - because (1) the total amount of expense is partially outside of our control because it is based on factors such as stock price volatility and interest rates, which may be unrelated to our performance during the period in which the expense is incurred, (2) it is an expense based upon a valuation methodology premised on assumptions that vary over time, and (3) the amount of the expense can vary significantly between companies due to factors that can be outside of the control of such companies.Acquisition-Related Expenses and Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles - including such items as, when applicable, fair value adjustments to contingent consideration, fair value charges incurred upon the sale of acquired inventory, acquisition-related expenses, and amortization of acquired intangible assets because they are not considered by management in making operating decisions and we believe that such expenses do not have a direct correlation to our future business operations and thereby including such charges does not necessarily reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges or reversals are incurred.Settlements, Gains, Losses, and Impairments - because such settlements, gains, losses, and impairments (1) are not considered by management in making operating decisions, (2) are infrequent in nature, (3) are generally not directly controlled by management, (4) do not necessarily reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are recognized, and/or (5) can vary significantly in amount between companies and make comparisons less reliable.Restructuring and Other Charges - because these charges have no direct correlation to our future business operations and including such charges or reversals does not necessarily reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges or reversals are incurred.Certain Income Tax Items - including certain deferred tax charges and benefits that do not result in a current tax payment or tax refund and other adjustments, including but not limited to, items unrelated to the current fiscal year or that are not indicative of our ongoing business operations.The non-GAAP financial measures presented in the table above should not be considered in isolation and are not an alternative for the respective GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to each such non-GAAP financial measure. Investors are cautioned against placing undue reliance on these non-GAAP financial measures and are urged to review and consider carefully the adjustments made by management to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to arrive at these non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures may have limited value as analytical tools because they may exclude certain expenses that some investors consider important in evaluating our operating performance or ongoing business performance. Further, non-GAAP financial measures are likely to have limited value for purposes of drawing comparisons between companies as a result of different companies potentially calculating similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures in different ways because non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.Our earnings release contains forward-looking estimates of non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of our 2023 fiscal year (""Q1 2023""). We provide this non-GAAP measure to investors on a prospective basis for the same reasons (set forth above) that we provide it to investors on a historical basis. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of our forward-looking estimate of Q1 2023 GAAP diluted earnings per share to a forward-looking estimate of Q1 2023 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share because certain information needed to make a reasonable forward-looking estimate of GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q1 2023 (other than estimated share-based compensation expense of $0.25 to $0.35 per diluted share, estimated amortization of intangibles of $0.40 to $0.50 per diluted share and certain tax items of -$0.10 to $0.10 per diluted share) is difficult to predict and estimate and is often dependent on future events that may be uncertain or outside of our control. Such events may include unanticipated changes in our GAAP effective tax rate, unanticipated one-time charges related to asset impairments (fixed assets, inventory, intangibles, or goodwill), unanticipated acquisition-related expenses, unanticipated settlements, gains, losses, and impairments, and other unanticipated non-recurring items not reflective of ongoing operations. The probable significance of these unknown items, in the aggregate, is estimated to be in the range of $0.00 to $0.15 in quarterly earnings per diluted share on a GAAP basis. Our forward-looking estimates of both GAAP and non-GAAP measures of our financial performance may differ materially from our actual results and should not be relied upon as statements of fact.[a]The following table summarizes the expense recognized in accordance with ASC 718 - Compensation, Stock Compensation (in millions):Three Months EndedTwelve Months EndedSeptember 30,2022October 1,2021September 30,2022October 1,2021Cost of goods sold$4.1$5.0$26.9$28.9Research and development19.423.493.885.7Selling, general, and administrative13.519.274.577.3Total share-based compensation$37.0$47.6$195.2$191.9SKYWORKS SOLUTIONS, INC.UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(in millions)September 30,2022October 1,2021AssetsCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities$586.8$1,027.2Accounts receivable, net1,094.0756.2Inventory1,212.1885.0Property, plant, and equipment, net1,604.81,501.6Goodwill and intangible assets, net3,621.43,875.3Other assets792.7545.4Total assets$8,911.8$8,590.7Liabilities and EquityAccounts payable$274.2$236.0Accrued and other liabilities979.5822.0Debt2,189.12,235.6Stockholders’ equity5,469.05,297.1Total liabilities and equity$8,911.8$8,590.7SKYWORKS SOLUTIONS, INC.UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWSThree Months EndedTwelve Months Ended(in millions)September 30,2022October 1,2021September 30,2022October 1,2021Cash flow from operating activitiesNet income$302.2$326.3$1,275.2$1,498.3Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities:Share-based compensation37.047.6195.2191.9Depreciation104.889.3394.4332.2Amortization of intangible assets, including inventory step-up76.680.6295.7104.5Deferred income taxes38.2(56.9)68.4(59.5)Asset impairment charges20.77.120.77.1Amortization of debt discount and issuance costs1.00.94.01.1Other, net3.60.2(1.5)0.2Changes in assets and liabilities:Receivables, net(308.4)(238.9)(337.8)(397.7)Inventory(109.5)(35.4)(337.3)(41.2)Accounts payable(1.2)37.931.359.6Other current and long-term assets and liabilities71.3139.6(183.7)75.5Net cash provided by operating activities236.3398.31,424.61,772.0Cash flow from investing activitiesCapital expenditures(141.8)(263.0)(489.4)(637.8)Purchased intangibles(4.0)(6.8)(20.3)(14.3)Purchases of marketable securities(5.8)(92.4)(97.2)(500.8)Sales and maturities of marketable securities4.181.1220.3770.7Payments for acquisitions—(2,751.0)—(2,751.0)Receipts from the sales of property, plant, and equipment0.1—7.7—Net cash used in investing activities(147.4)(3,032.1)(378.9)(3,133.2)Cash flow from financing activitiesRepurchase of common stock — payroll tax withholdings on equity awards(3.3)(1.7)(88.5)(55.2)Repurchase of common stock — stock repurchase program(80.3)—(886.8)(195.6)Dividends paid(99.4)(92.5)(373.2)(340.6)Net proceeds from exercise of stock options3.33.86.511.6Proceeds from employee stock purchase plan13.812.129.424.8Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt, net—998.4—2,488.2Debt financing costs—1.6—(5.8)Payments of debt—(250.0)(50.0)(250.0)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities(165.9)671.7(1,362.6)1,677.4Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents(77.0)(1,962.1)(316.9)316.2Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period643.02,845.0882.9566.7Cash and cash equivalents at end of period$566.0$882.9$566.0$882.9View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221103005469/en/ContactsMedia Relations: Constance Griffiths(949) 231-4207Investor Relations: Mitch Haws(949) 231-3223]"

That’s for good reason, as some of the largest companies in the world reside in this area. The downside of such high growth is that investors often are willing to pay a premium multiple but often rush to the exits at the first sign of trouble. Aside from healthcare, no sector has endured a more challenging 2022 than technology stocks, which are down about 42% year to date (YTD).The plus side of the downturn is that there are quality technology stocks now trading at much more reasonable valuations. These stocks also provide meaningful levels of income to go along with strong total return potential, which should appeal to both value and dividend growth investors alike.This article will examine three technology stocks yielding more than 3% that could deliver double-digit annual returns.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCSCOCisco$45.51SWKSSkyworks Solutions$86.66TXNTexas Instruments$161.06Cisco (CSCO)cisco (CSCO) logo on an office buildingSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comFirst up is Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), one of the largest high-performance computer networking systems in the world. The company is valued at $171 billion and has annual revenue of approximately $54 billion.Cisco has long been the most dominant name in enterprise networking. This has been the case for so long that it is estimated that the vast majority of data transferred over the internet for the past three decades has been done so through the company’s products. As a result, Cisco’s switches and routers are very entrenched in the industry.That said, the company has made efforts to move beyond hardware. This includes offerings such as cloud storage and security products that are very intertwined. This makes it difficult for customers to switch providers without enduring high switching costs.Cisco has also transformed into more a software-as-a-service company, which allows for recurring revenue sources and helps to remove some cyclicality from its business. Deferred revenue has been growing at a strong rate for some time now. For example, Cisco’s deferred revenue grew 11% to $23.3 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022.Story continuesThe company also has one of the best balance sheets in the industry. Cisco ended the fiscal year with total assets of $94 billion, including almost $19 billion of cash and equivalents against total liabilities of $54 billion and long-term debt of just $8.4 billion.Given the strength of its business and the company’s ability to offer smoother revenue results, we believe that Cisco is capable of generating earnings growth of 6%, which is close to the long-term average.Cisco’s dividend growth streak stands at 12 years. Shares currently yield 3.6%, which is twice the average yield of 1.8% for the S&amp;P 500. With a projected payout ratio of 43%, it is likely that the company’s dividend will continue to grow.The final component of our projected return model is valuation. Historically, Cisco has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of slightly more than 13. We have a fair value target of 14 times earnings given the positives working in the company’s favor. With shares trading at 11.9 times earnings, this implies an annual tailwind of 3.3% from multiple expansion over the next five years.In total, we forecast that Cisco will offer annual returns of 12.4% over the next five years, stemming from a 6% earnings growth rate, a starting yield of 3.6% and a low single-digit contribution form multiple expansion.Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)the Skyworks website is loading on a smartphoneSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comThe next technology name to consider is Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS), a leading semiconductor company. The company is valued at more than $13 billion and has produced revenue of just over $5 billion over the last year.Skyworks Solutions designs and sells semiconductor products to a wide variety of customers around the world. The company’s amplifiers, antenna tuners, converters, modulators, receivers and switches are used in end markets such as automotive, connected home, defense, industrial, medical and smartphones.Of these markets, smartphones might be the most important at the moment. This is because of the ongoing 5G rollout. Most of the major carriers have turned on 5G service, but customer upgrades to devices that can access this network is ongoing. It will take time for the majority of customers to acquire a 5G device, which should provide Skyworks Solutions with tailwinds to its business.There will be immense competition in the 5G space, but the company’s expertise, size and scale should work to its advantage as more people switch to the service. Skyworks Solutions’ products are used by some of the largest technology names involved in 5G, such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which gives the company a partnership with some of the top makers of smartphones.Skyworks Solutions has increased EPS at a high rate over the last decade. However, we believe 5% earnings growth going forward is more likely given the high base that the company is starting from.The company has raised its dividend for 10 consecutive years, and the stock is currently yielding 3.1%, one of its highest yields in its history. The projected payout ratio of 21% is extremely low and leaves ample room for Skyworks Solutions to continue to raise its payments to shareholders.Shares of the company are trading at just 7.3 times expected EPS for the year. With a fair value price-to-earnings ratio of 12, we believe that Skyworks Solutions will see multiple expansion add 10.5% to annual returns over the next five years.In total, Skyworks Solutions is projected to return 18.1% per year for the next half-decade. This is due to 5% earnings growth, a starting yield of 3.1% and a low double-digit valuation tailwind.Texas Instruments (TXN)Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comOur final technology name is Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), one of the largest semiconductor companies in the world. The $145 billion company has generated revenue approaching $20 billion over the last 12 months.Texas Instruments has two business segments. The analog segment produces products that help in the management of power in electronic systems and that measure signals that allow information to be transferred or converted. The embedded processing segment makes semiconductor chips that can be used in a multitude of applications.The company’s products are used in several different areas, including automotive, where the sophistication of cars and trucks has greatly increased. This will require more advanced components in order to meet the needs of manufacturers. Other important end markets include industrial applications and communication services.Texas Instruments has also invested heavily to design more advanced chips, which has helped to solidify its place in its industry. This has led to strong margin performance over long periods of time. The company’s EPS have compounded at a double-digit rate over the last decade, but we forecast earnings growth of 7.5%, as we feel this builds in some measure of protection against what has typically been a cyclical business.Texas Instruments yields 3.2% today. The company’s lengthy dividend growth streak of 19 years is one of the longest in the technology sector and growth rates have been robust over the long term. The projected payout ratio for 2022 is 52%.The stock is trading with a price-to-earnings ratio of 16.9. We believe fair value is closer to 20 times earnings, which is near the historical valuation. Reverting to our target price-to-earnings ratio would add 4.3% to annual returns going forward.Therefore, Texas Instruments is predicted to provide annual returns of 14.7% through 2027, stemming from 7.5% earnings growth, 3.2% dividend yield and a low single-digit contribution from an expanding multiple.On the date of publication, Bob Ciura did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like TE Connectivity (NYSE:TEL). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. Check out our latest analysis for TE Connectivity How Fast Is TE Connectivity Growing?If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. We can see that in the last three years TE Connectivity grew its EPS by 10% per year. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. EBIT margins for TE Connectivity remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 9.0% to US$16b. That's a real positive.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for TE Connectivity?Are TE Connectivity Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since TE Connectivity has a market capitalisation of US$36b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. With a whopping US$72m worth of shares as a group, insiders have plenty riding on the company's success. This should keep them focused on creating long term value for shareholders.Story continuesShould You Add TE Connectivity To Your Watchlist?One important encouraging feature of TE Connectivity is that it is growing profits. To add an extra spark to the fire, significant insider ownership in the company is another highlight. The combination definitely favoured by investors so consider keeping the company on a watchlist. Once you've identified a business you like, the next step is to consider what you think it's worth. And right now is your chance to view our exclusive discounted cashflow valuation of TE Connectivity. You might benefit from giving it a glance today.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

The S&amp;P 500 Consumer Discretionary Index is also down 30.19% year-to-date. However, consumer spending grew by 0.6% in September despite inflationary pressures, according to the Commerce Department’s data. Luke Tilley, Chief Economist at Wilmington Trust, talked about ongoing consumer trends in his interview with Wall Street Journal this October. He said that consumer spending increased due to fiscal stimulus given during the pandemic. He also said that although the consumer backdrop seems to be slowing but is overall strong.Following the current trends, analysts are expecting that consumer spending in the US will start rebounding in 2023. Goldman Sachs analyst Jason English spoke to CNBC about this. He asserted that increased consumer spending will be able to counter the negative growth in household discretionary cash flow. He further mentioned that this improvement in cash flow will be because of wages. This growth in consumer spending and the sector’s cash flow will also provide a positive direction to consumer cyclical stocks.

Indeed, worries of a recession at this moment have been quashed by this impressive report, leading to strength in most Dow stocks relative to other sector such as tech, for example, of late.That said, investors benefit from questioning the peculiarly strong report. Knowing which sectors did the heavy lifting with these GDP numbers is important. In this regard, investors may want to take caution with some Dow stocks, which have not been the stalwarts they used to.U.S. GDP rose because the government increased its spending. Exports increased, driven by strong demand for U.S. energy. However, winter is coming. This will limit the country’s ability to send more energy products abroad. Conversely, a decrease in housing costs and lower imports over time signals ongoing weakness for consumer goods. Some of the strongest U.S. brands survived the starting phase of this economic decline. However, that luck may run out.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsInflation is raising the cost of nearly everything. This has not deterred customers from spending more on services, such as travel (yet). However, consumers increasingly will eventually need to offset the negative impact of lower disposable income. As a result, it’s widely expected that consumers will cut non-essential spending.As consumers dip into their savings, these seven Dow stocks may best be avoided right now.BABoeing$149.44GSGoldman Sachs$348.82HDHome Depot$295.45MMM3M$124.78MSFTMicrosoft$224.75NKENike$92.67WBAWalgreens Boots Alliance$36.36Boeing (BA)Boeing (BA) passenger airplane with open exit door, passenger windows, cargo door, close up view of Boeing logoSource: vaalaa / Shutterstock.comStarting off our list of Dow stocks to sell is the embattled aerospace company, Boeing (NYSE:BA). Indeed, Boeing is no longer the great company that it once was. After the company took years to resolve Boeing 787 safety issues, it resumed deliveries in the last quarter.Story continuesIn the third quarter, Boeing delivered only nine 787 airplanes. The company lost $6.18 per share, largely due to fixed-price defense development programs. That said, Q3 is not the only quarter where Boeing booked a write-down. This is a company that’s been losing money for some time on specific parts of its business which should provide stability.On Boeing’s recent conference call, the company tried to spin a positive outlook for this contract loss. Dave Calhoun, the company’s President and Chief Executive Officer said that Boeing will ultimately deliver products to the Air Force or the armed forces.Like other company’s in the Dow, Boeing faced supply chain constraints in the quarter, with parts shortages persisting longer than expected. Labor instability in the sector has also had an impact on program deliveries.The development of products like the MQ-25, an unmanned aircraft carrier, has had technical challenges. Expect BA stock to underperform the Dow Jones index as uncertainties continue.Goldman Sachs (GS)In this photo illustration the Goldman Sachs Group (GS) logo displayed on a smartphone screen and a stock market graph in the backgroundSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) reported revenue which declined by 12% year-over-year to $11.98 billion in the company’s third quarter. The financials giant faced challenging macroeconomic conditions, as did most in its sector. In fact, CEO David Solomon said that macro themes dominated his conversations with top executives.In the company’s fourth quarter, Solomon sensed an ongoing, unsettled outlook. Markets dislike such uncertainties. Accordingly, while GS stock rallied from below $300 to trade above $340 for the week ended Oct. 28, many aren’t so sure this broad rebound in financial stocks can be maintained. For Goldman, specific difficulties related to the company’s private lending businesses have been the focal point of some bears. Additionally, in order for Goldman to keep grabbing market share from competition in the retail investor space, more capital spending may be required. Right now is not the right time for this, according to many investors.Thus, I think buying a more diversified financials ETF such as the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLF) could be the way to go. It appears it will take a few quarters before Goldman realizes any gains from its investments, making this stock a pass for me.Home Depot (HD)a Home Depot store is seen from the outsideSource: Cassiohabib / Shutterstock.comHome Depot (NYSE:HD) has added $40 billion worth of business to its books over the last two years alone. As it turns out, catering to the construction professionals and a do-it-yourself customer base has been very profitable, especially following a pandemic which saw nesting patterns emerge among many homeowners.Strong engagement among its customer base has led to strong business growth. That said, HD stock faces pressure ahead as past tailwinds fade. Homeowners are less-inclined to invest in expensive home improvement projects as interest rates rise. Mortgage rates topped 7% recently, which will hurt demand for homes overall. And as home prices decline, the ROI on various projects dips, as well as the equity which many homeowners have used to pay for such home improvement projects.Now, homes still need small repairs as they age. Indeed, small home upgrade projects like painting are ongoing revenue sources for Home Depot. However, the revenue potential from selling maintenance items is smaller than major renovation budgets. In addition, the pandemic between 2020-2021 encouraged customers to upgrade their outdoor space. Now that the U.S. is not adopting lockdowns or draconian measures, Home Depot customers will not spend as much as they once did.3M (MMM)3M logo on top of a corporate building. MMM stockSource: JPstock / Shutterstock.comAnother company I’m focusing on as one of the top Dow stocks to sell is 3M (NYSE:MMM). That’s not because of the company’s consumer staples portfolio of products. Rather, it’s the company’s potentially massive liability related to its earplugs, which were sold to the U.S. military.In August, the court ruled that 3M must face over 230,000 lawsuits. The company cannot use the bankruptcy of its subsidiary, Aearo Technologies LLC, to shield it from the case.In the third quarter, revenue fell by 3.8% compared to last year’s total of $48.6 billion. It saw declines in its personal safety unit, much of which was tied to Covid-related products such as vaccines and therapeutics. Still, this unit benefited from strong demand in the Asia Pacific region. Business in China recovered after lockdowns eased in the second quarter. However, the recent lockdown in Wuhan suggests that 3M will report weaker results next quarter.Although 3M posted stronger revenue from the Americas, its outlook is negative. It expects total sales will fall by up to 3.5% in 2022.3M stopped disclosing pricing, as one analyst commented on the call. After giving fewer details to investors, the risks are high that this company cannot pass inflation pressures on to consumers.Microsoft (MSFT)Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) recently fell after posting strong results. The company earned a solid $2.35 a share on $50.1 billion in revenue. However, the market’s negative reaction pressured MSFT stock on Oct. 26. This suggests that investors don’t expect the software giant to exceed guidance the next quarter.Trading at around 25-times price-to-earnings, Microsoft needs Azure, its cloud solution, to grow despite the weak macroeconomic environment. Investors are concerned that business customers will slow their digitization transformation. Small and mid-sized customers will likely slow their spending as well, as business growth lags.Microsoft has a growing total addressable market for its infrastructure, data, and artificial intelligence offerings. In the long-term, the company’s revenue will expand. But in the current quarter, Microsoft should expect customers will delay their technology spending.Microsoft 365 is a flagship productivity solution that is still appealing. Last quarter, the company relied less on discounts to drive growth. It also benefited from upselling its customers to E5, an enterprise solution. As corporations cut spending, this upsell rate could slow.Nike (NKE)Nike (NKE) store in a shopping mall in Penang, Malaysia. robinhood stocksSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.comNike (NYSE:NKE) risks tied to elevated inventory levels have re-shaped the narrative on this stock, as consumers spend less on sporting goods. In the last quarter, Nike’s inventory grew by 44% year-over-year. That said, inventory growth outpaced top-line growth, surging by 65% in North America.Nike has attractive products in its pipeline. For example, customers are likely to splurge on the Air Zoom Mercurial, Air Max Scorpion, and Nike Forward this holiday season. Despite falling this year, the stock’s high price-earnings ratio may have priced in those prospects.Nike blamed disruptions that started over a year ago for the inventory glut. For example, factories in Vietnam closed for nearly 15 weeks. Transit times increased and are volatile. And while transit times have improved, inventories are rising as the company loaded up on too much product ahead of the holiday season.So, does this mean more markdowns (and lower margins) are coming? I think that’s likely, and investors are taking a risk by holding NKE stock. Consumers may spend less during this holiday period than they have historically. Accordingly, with inflation hurting disposable income, pressure on consumers to avoid expensive items will pick up. Thus, Nike is a pass for me at this time.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, FloridaSource: saaton / Shutterstock.comRounding out our list of Dow stocks to sell is Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA), a drugstore company that’s increasingly scaling its U.S. healthcare business. This move is expected to strengthen its long-term sales prospects through its fiscal 2024 year.To meet its business plan, the drugstore must simplify its business structure. This optimization is aimed at achieving organic growth. That said, investors may view this goal differently. The company’s core business is slowing, so Walgreens may need to increase capital spending, which could result in cash flow declines for this company.On Oct. 11, the company acquired CareCentrix, acquiring the remaining 45% stake in this company for around $392 million. Although CareCentrix is a leader in the $75 billion post-acute and home care industry, the purchase increases investor risk. Walgreens will only achieve margins in the high single-digit percentage range, at best, given its previous struggles with VillageMD. This acquisition was a much larger one, worth $5.2 billion, in 2021.Investors are justifiably wary that Walgreens management will achieve EBITDA growth from those two acquisitions. Thus, WBA stock fell to $30.39 in October, and I think this stock has more room to fall from here.On the date of publication, Chris Lau did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

256,3e57ac03-d48e-317d-bac3-2027b1710ce6,VFC,2022-11-04,3 High-Yield Dividend Stocks to Buy and Hold for Years,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-high-yield-dividend-stocks-193150612.html,1667331110,STORY,"['VZ', 'BNS', 'VFC']","[As dividend stock investors, we’re focused on finding great stocks to buy for long-term wealth accumulation. There are many ways to accumulate wealth in the stock market, but we believe the most proven method is to find great stocks with durable competitive advantages and long dividend histories. When we combine those criteria with an additional screen of high-yielding dividend stocks, we can end up with some truly great picks.In this article, we’ll take a look at three dividend stocks we believe are good buys for investors with long-term time horizons, given their strength in dividend longevity, durability and very high dividend yields of more than 6%.VZVerizon$37.44BNSBank of Nova Scotia$48.36VFCV.F. Corporation$28.73InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsVerizon (VZ)Verizon Wireless sign and trademark logo.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comOur first stock is Verizon (NYSE:VZ), which is a communications and technology company that operates globally, but principally in the U.S. The company provides postpaid and prepaid wireless phone service plans, internet access for consumers and businesses, associated hardware, data security and more. Verizon has about 150 million different connections to customers through its full suite of services and products. The vast majority of those are attributed to its ubiquitous wireless service.Verizon was founded in 1983 and generates about $137 billion in annual revenue. It trades with a market cap of $153 billion.Verizon’s competitive advantage stems from its enormous 5G wireless network that spans the entire U.S. Together with AT&amp;T (NYSE:T), the two companies operate what amounts to a duopoly in wireless service. Verizon is the larger of the two. The network Verizon has built out would require tens of billions of dollars of spending from a new entrant, so its market position is extremely secure. This helps protect the company’s earnings stream for the future, which, in turn, makes it a better dividend stock.Story continuesSpeaking of the dividend, Verizon’s dividend has risen for the past 18 years consecutively. The company’s average increase during that time was less than 3% annually. However, given Verizon’s utility-like nature, relatively modest dividend increases should be expected.That’s still been good enough for Verizon to sport a 7.2% yield today, which is an all-time high for the stock. Shares have been punished this year while Verizon continues to raise the dividend, so the current yield is outstanding.In addition, we see Verizon’s dividend as highly secure given it has very predictable earnings and a payout ratio of only 50% for this year. That means Verizon could suffer sizable earnings declines, although we don’t believe that will occur under any reasonable scenario, and still pay out its dividend for years to come. This combination of factors — including the payout ratio and Verizon’s competitive advantage — means the stock is a great by for those with long time horizons.Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Our next stock is Bank of Nova Scotia (NYSE:BNS), or Scotiabank, as it is otherwise known. Scotiabank operates across a wide area of the Western Hemisphere, conducting business in Canada, the U.S., Mexico, Peru, Chile, Colombia, the Caribbean and parts of Central America. The bank offers a full suite of banking services, including traditional checking and deposit accounts, investments, credit cards, mortgages and other loan products, insurance, business banking, wealth management, and more. The bank operates about 1,000 branches in Canada and a further 1,300 outside of Canada.Scotiabank was founded in 1832 and produces about $23 billion in annual revenue. It trades with a market value of $57 billion.Scotiabank’s competitive advantage comes from its combination of its huge footprint in the Canadian banking market, its international growth story and its reputation that has been built over nearly 200 years. Scotiabank has a core Canadian business that doesn’t grow very quickly but generates steady earnings. Its international business is more volatile, but growth rates and potential for those markets over time is much higher. This combination of factors means we believe Scotiabank will be competitive for many years to come. That’s good news for dividend investors.Scotiabank just hit 10 years of consecutive dividend increases, coming out of the financial crisis that saw just about every bank cut their dividends. Scotiabank has raised its payout at a rate of about 4% annually in the past decade as it has tried to maintain a payout ratio of under 50%. This year, the payout ratio is expected to be 48%. That is right in line with historical tendencies. It also means the dividend should be safe in all but the harshest of recessions going forward.Finally, Scotiabank’s current yield is 6.3%, which is among the highest yields the bank has ever produced. The stock has traded down significantly in 2022, creating a great opportunity for long-term dividend investors to pick up a yield that is about four times that of the S&amp;P 500.V.F. Corporation (VFC)Image of a giant boot in the street surrounded by people.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comOur final pick for dividend stocks to buy and hold is V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC), which is a company that designs, markets and distributes branded lifestyle apparel, footwear and accessories globally. V.F. operates in three segments: outdoor, active and work. Through these segments, the company offers a variety of premium products for men, women and children. Its brands include well-known favorites such as Vans, Supreme, Timberland, North Face and Dickies, among others.V.F. was founded in 1899 and generates about $12 billion in annual revenue. It has a current market cap of $11 billion.We like V.F. for its outstanding portfolio of premium brands that have decades of success backing them. The company has collected brands over the years with strong reputations among consumers. On the whole, this collection of products makes a consolidated company with diversified exposure across a wide variety of use cases for its products, price points and demand profiles.V.F. has boosted its dividend for 49 consecutive years. That means it is just one more annual increase away from being a Dividend King. That alone puts V.F. in rare company, but among apparel distributors, it is in a class of its own. The dividend has also grown at about 10% annually in the past decade, a tremendous growth profile for a company with nearly half a century of increases under its belt.VFC stock has a current yield of over 7%. That is about triple the level it generally has been over the years. That’s due to its cheap valuation and the fact that the stock has been punished in 2022.The current payout is $2 per share annually. Earnings guidance is about $2.45 for this year, so the payout ratio is elevated. However, the company has defended the dividend during brief periods of the payout exceeding earnings before, and we believe it would again. Current earnings will cover the payout, so this is not an issue at the moment. And we don’t believe the dividend is in danger of being cut.On the date of publication, Bob Ciura did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

That is, insiders sold more stock than they bought.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Wells Fargo The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Wells FargoOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Kleber Santos, for US$1.0m worth of shares, at about US$44.44 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$45.54). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was 51% of Kleber Santos's holding. Kleber Santos was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insider Ownership Of Wells FargoFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Wells Fargo insiders own 0.07% of the company, worth about US$134m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Wells Fargo Insiders?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Wells Fargo insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with Wells Fargo and understanding this should be part of your investment process.Story continuesBut note: Wells Fargo may not be the best stock to buy.

258,46703b68-7ffe-36b9-9d62-c94cca7c190b,WFC,2022-11-04,16 Biggest Banks in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/16-biggest-banks-world-140941624.html,1667484581,STORY,"['BAC', 'CRARY', 'C', 'HSBC', 'MFG', 'WFC-PD', 'MUFG', 'PSTVY', 'SMFG']","[In this article, we will take a look at 16 of the biggest banks in the world. If you want to see more of the biggest banks in the world, go directly to 5 Biggest Banks in the World.The biggest banks in the world, otherwise known as megabanks, are giant companies that have substantial assets on their balance sheets. Many offer a variety of different financial services including commercial banking, corporate banking, capital markets, asset management, and more.Given their scale, many megabanks enjoy substantial advantages versus smaller banks, especially in technology. Bloomberg's Paul J. Davies writes, ""The biggest banks, with the greatest profits, are already investing vastly more in faster, cheaper, easier-to-use digital apps than smaller banks can afford. Technology is helping big banks gain market share and is more likely to drive consolidation in the years ahead than regional bank mergers.""In 2022 alone, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)'s budget for technology in its consumer and small business banking businesses was $2.8 billion, which is more than the revenue of many banks. With having greater technology in addition to other advantages, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) has increased its market share in U.S. consumer deposits from 8.9% in 2017 to 10.3% in 2021 and CEO Jamie Dimon believes there could be even more growth in the future.Davies adds, ""Banking is increasingly a scale game where the biggest players are most able to absorb high fixed costs and generate the best returns. Advantage begets advantage as profits can be plowed back into making services cheaper and continuing to build smarter technology that customers want to use.""The Leading MegabanksMany of the world's biggest banks are based in the United States or China.Many megabanks are based in the United States because the United States has the world's largest economy. In 2021, the U.S. had a GDP of $23 trillion, outpacing second place China's $17.73 trillion and third place Japan's $4.94 trillion.Story continuesIn addition to having the world's largest economy, the United States has the most popular global reserve currency with the U.S. dollar. According to the IMF, the U.S. dollar accounted for 59% of global foreign exchange reserves in 2021, versus 21% for the Euro, 6% for the Yen and 5% for the Great Britain Pound. Given the dominance, the U.S. enjoys lower interest rates than if the U.S. dollar wasn't the dominant global reserve currency.Several Chinese banks are among the biggest banks in the world. Given that China's government plays a big role in the economy, it has played a part in the formation and growth of several megabanks there that help develop the country. With the big four banks in China each state owned, China's government can sometimes use the Chinese megabanks for economic policies. It can sometimes be more efficient to ask big banks in China to make more loans than it is to simply lower the interest rate, for example.Several Japanese banks also rank among the 16 Biggest Banks in the World given the size of Japan's economy.In terms of the future, there could eventually be several Indian companies that make it to the list given how quickly India's economy is growing.2022Given high inflation, the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates multiple times this year.With the substantially higher rates, there is a potential for an economic slowdown or a recession by the end of 2023 if not sooner. As a result, many megabanks, along with many other companies, could face headwinds.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Pixabay/Public DomainMethodologyFor our list, we took the top 16 out from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence's World's 100 Largest Banks whose list is as of December 31, 2021 for the majority of banks on the list.16 Biggest Banks in the World16. Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC)Total Assets: $1.95 trillionAlthough rising interest rates could increase credit losses during an economic downturn, Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) is currently benefiting from the rising rates with higher net interest income. Due to the interest rate increases, Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) reported its best net interest income since 2019 and the bank estimates its net interest income will rise 24% year over year for 2022. If it is more profitable and the bank makes quality loans, Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) could potentially realize a higher return on its assets.15. Mizuho Financial GroupTotal Assets: $1.96 trillionMizuho Financial Group is a Japan based bank holding company with $1.96 trillion in assets. The bank has a long history given it was founded in 1864 and Mizuho Financial Group is economically important given its commercial and retail banking operations. Mizuho Financial Group has over 20 million customers, representing approximately one fifth of the adult population in Japan.14. Postal Savings Bank of ChinaTotal Assets: $1.98 trillionPostal Savings Bank of China is one of the largest banks in China with total assets of $1.98 trillion. Postal Savings Bank of China also has around 40,000 outlets, and offers services to more than 600 million personal customers. Given the slowing Chinese economy, Postal Savings Bank of China faces headwinds in the near term but the bank nevertheless has potential to increase its assets if it maintains its market share.13. Japan Post BankTotal Assets: $2 trillionJapan Post Bank is a leading Japanese bank with $2 trillion in assets. Although the Japanese government owned around 57% of Japan Post Bank in 2020, it has a goal of divesting more of its stake in the future. If Japan Post Bank is a privately owned bank, it could potentially be more efficient.12. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Grp, Inc. (NYSE:SMFG)Total Assets: $2.18 trillionSumitomo Mitsui Financial Grp, Inc. (NYSE:SMFG) is one of Japan's largest banks with $2.18 trillion in total assets. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Grp, Inc. (NYSE:SMFG) provides commercial banking, leasing securities, consumer finance and other services in Japan and internationally. Due to macroeconomic headwinds, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Grp, Inc. (NYSE:SMFG) shares are down 16.8% year to date.11. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)Total Assets: $2.29 trillionGiven Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) doesn't have as big of a retail banking business as some of its other big four bank peers, the company hasn't benefited that much from the higher rates. Like the other big banks in the United States, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) faces headwinds if a recession occurs in 2023. In the long term, however, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) still has substantial quality earnings potential and the bank ranks as one of the largest in the world by assets.10. Crédit Agricole GroupTotal Assets: $2.67 trillionCrédit Agricole Group is France's second largest bank with total assets of $2.67 trillion. Given its scale, Crédit Agricole Group has around 147,000 employees, 53 million customers, and operations in 47 countries. Like other international banks, Crédit Agricole Group faces near term headwinds given the economic slowdown globally.9. BNP ParibasTotal Assets: $2.91 trillionBNP Paribas is one of the largest banks in the world with $2.91 trillion in total assets. The France-based bank also has around 190,000 employees and operations in 65 countries. Although BNP Paribas sold Bank of the West to Bank of Montreal for $16.3 billion, the bank is reportedly not interested in buying another bank with the proceeds according to CFO Lars Machenil in a Q2 earnings call. Instead BNP Paribas is planning to invest the proceeds in potentially accelerating organic growth.8. HSBC Holdings plc (NYSE:HSBC)Total Assets: $2.95 trillionHSBC Holdings plc (NYSE:HSBC) reported stronger than expected results for its third quarter with pre-tax profit of $6.5 billion versus the expected $6 billion and the same quarter last year's $5.5 billion. Although profits are higher, HSBC Holdings plc (NYSE:HSBC) has committed to its guidance of a 50% dividend payout ratio for 2023 and 2024. Like many other banks, rising interest rates have helped HSBC Holdings plc (NYSE:HSBC) realize higher returns in 2022 although the bank also faces potential headwinds if the global economy slows.7. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Total Assets: $3.17 trillionBank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is the United States' second largest bank with $3.17 trillion in total assets. Although an economic slowdown or recession in the near term will be a headwind, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)'s results are currently strong at least when it comes to consumer spending growth. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan commented on the bank's third quarter results, “An analyst might wonder whether the talk of inflation, recession, and other factors could rectify slower spending growth. We just don’t see it here at Bank of America.” For Q3, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) 's spending across debt and credit cards rose 9% year over year and consumer loans also rose by $14 billion.6. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (NYSE:MUFG)Total Assets: $3.18 trillionMitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (NYSE:MUFG) is Japan's largest bank with total assets of $3.18 trillion. In terms of its operations, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (NYSE:MUFG) offers many services including retail and corporate banking as well as asset management. Due to headwinds, shares of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (NYSE:MUFG) are down around 14% year to date.Click to continue reading and see 5 Biggest Banks in the World.Suggested articles:22 Biggest Economies in the World in 202215 Largest IPOs of All Time Worldwide15 Biggest Global Tech Companies by Market CapDisclosure: None. 16 Biggest Banks in the World is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Pfizer (NYSE:PFE). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. View our latest analysis for Pfizer Pfizer's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingGenerally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Shareholders will be happy to know that Pfizer's EPS has grown 23% each year, compound, over three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. The music to the ears of Pfizer shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 32% to 39% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Pfizer's future EPS 100% free.Story continuesAre Pfizer Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Pfizer, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. With a whopping US$96m worth of shares as a group, insiders have plenty riding on the company's success. This should keep them focused on creating long term value for shareholders.Does Pfizer Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?For growth investors, Pfizer's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. This EPS growth rate is something the company should be proud of, and so it's no surprise that insiders are holding on to a considerable chunk of shares. On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research. It is worth noting though that we have found 1 warning sign for Pfizer that you need to take into consideration.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

(NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) today announced updated data from a Phase 2/3 clinical trial demonstrating a robust neutralizing immune response one-month after a 30-µg booster dose of the companies’ Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent (Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5)). Immune responses against BA.4/BA.5 sublineages were substantially higher for those who received the bivalent vaccine compared to the companies’ original COVID-19 vaccine, with a similar safety and tolerability profile between both vaccines. These results reinforce the previously reported early clinical data measured 7 days after a booster dose of the bivalent vaccine, as well as the pre-clinical data, and suggest that a 30-µg booster dose of the Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccine may induce a higher level of protection against the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 sublineages than the original vaccine.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221103006400/en/""As we head into the holiday season, we hope these updated data will encourage people to seek out a COVID-19 bivalent booster as soon as they are eligible in order to maintain high levels of protection against the widely circulating Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 sublineages,"" said Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer. ""These updated data also provide confidence in the adaptability of our mRNA platform and our ability to rapidly update the vaccine to match the most prevalent strains each season.""Story continues""These data demonstrate that our BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccine works as conceptually planned in providing stronger protection against the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 sublineages,"" said Prof. Ugur Sahin, M.D., CEO and Co-founder of BioNTech. ""In the next step and as part of our science-based approach we will continue to evaluate the cross-neutralization of the adapted vaccine against new variants and sublineages. Our goal is to provide broader immunity against COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, including Omicron and other circulating strains.""For the analyses, sera were drawn before (baseline) and one month after administration of a 30-µg booster dose (fourth dose) of the companies’ Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccine. A subset of individuals, evenly stratified between those who had evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and those who did not, was selected for ages 18 to 55 years (n=38) and older than 55 years and older (n=36). A comparator group of participants older than 55 years of age (n=40) who received a 30-µg booster dose (fourth dose) of the companies’ original COVID-19 vaccine as part of a prior study was randomly selected, while ensuring the same equal stratification. Participants receiving the bivalent vaccine had their prior booster dose approximately 10-11 months earlier, whereas those who received the original vaccine had their prior booster dose approximately 7 months earlier. Despite this difference, pre-booster antibody titers were similar for both.Among the overall study population who received the Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccine, there was a substantially higher increase in Omicron BA.4/BA.5-neutralizing antibody titers compared to pre-booster levels. For individuals 18 to 55 years of age, the geometric mean titer (GMT) against Omicron BA.4/BA.5 was 606, representing a 9.5-fold rise (95% CI: 6.7, 13.6) from pre-booster levels. For individuals older than 55 years, the GMT was 896, representing a 13.2-fold rise (95% CI: 8.0, 21.6) from pre-booster levels. By contrast, participants over 55 years of age who received a 30-µg booster dose of the companies’ original COVID-19 vaccine had a lower neutralizing antibody response against Omicron BA.4/BA.5 measured one month post booster. For these participants, the GMT was 236, representing a 2.9-fold rise (95% CI: 2.1, 3.9). Therefore, the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 neutralizing antibody titers were approximately 4-fold higher for the bivalent vaccine compared to the companies’ original Covid-19 vaccine in individuals over 55 years of age.Further, when examining those with or without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection who received a booster dose of the bivalent vaccine, there was a significant increase in neutralizing antibodies against Omicron BA.4/BA.5 in both groups, which was greater in those without prior infection. These data highlight the potential benefit of the bivalent vaccine for all populations regardless of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. The safety profile remains favorable for the bivalent vaccine and consistent with the original vaccine.Pfizer and BioNTech have shared these data with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and plan to share with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other global health authorities as soon as possible. A booster dose of the BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccine has been authorized for emergency use by the FDA for ages 5 years and older and has also been granted marketing authorization in the EU by the European Commission following a positive opinion from the EMA for ages 12 years and older. An application for marketing authorization of the BA.4/BA.5 booster has been submitted to the EMA for children ages 5 through 11.Separately, Pfizer and BioNTech are continuing to monitor immunogenicity of the BA.4/BA.5 bivalent booster against emerging Omicron subvariants. The companies also initiated a Phase 1/2/3 trial in September 2022, in September 2022, to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of different doses and dosing regimens of the companies’ Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccine among children 6 months through 11 years of age.The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccines (COMIRNATY®), which are based on BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA technology, were developed by both BioNTech and Pfizer. BioNTech is the Marketing Authorization Holder for BNT162b2 Wild Type and BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) in the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada and other countries, and the holder of emergency use authorizations or equivalents in the United States (jointly with Pfizer) and other countries. Submissions to pursue regulatory approvals in those countries where emergency use authorizations or equivalent were initially granted are planned.About the Phase 2/3 StudyThis arm of the multicenter, randomized, controlled Phase 2/3 trial (NCT05472038) has enrolled about 900 healthy volunteers 12 years of age and older in the U.S. who have received at least three doses of an authorized COVID-19 vaccine. During the trial, participants aged 18 years and older received either a 30-µg or 60-µg booster dose (fourth booster) of Pfizer and BioNTech’s Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted COVID-19 vaccine and participants aged 12 through 17 years received a 30-µg booster (fourth booster) of the same vaccine. Comparisons to support potential full licensure and registrations globally will be made with a control group who previously received a fourth dose with the original vaccine.U.S. INDICATION &amp; AUTHORIZED USEPfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine, Bivalent (Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5)AUTHORIZED USEPfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent (Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5) is FDA-authorized under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for use in individuals 5 years of age and older as a single booster dose administered at least 2 months after either:completion of primary vaccination with any authorized or approved monovalent* COVID-19 vaccine; orreceipt of the most recent booster dose with any authorized or approved monovalent COVID-19 vaccine.*Monovalent refers to any authorized and approved COVID-19 vaccine that contains or encodes the spike protein of only the Original SARS-CoV-2 virusCOMIRNATY® (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA)INDICATIONCOMIRNATY® (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) is a vaccine approved for active immunization to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in individuals 12 years of age and older.AUTHORIZED USECOMIRNATY® (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) is FDA-authorized under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to provide:Primary Seriesa third primary series dose to individuals 12 years of age and older who have certain kinds of immunocompromisePfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 VaccineAUTHORIZED USESPfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is FDA authorized under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for use in individuals 6 months and older to provide:Primary Seriesa 3-dose primary series to individuals 6 months through 4 years of agea 2-dose primary series to individuals 5 years of age and oldera third primary series dose to individuals 5 years of age and older with certain kinds of immunocompromiseEMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATIONEmergency uses of the vaccines have not been approved or licensed by FDA but have been authorized by FDA under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to prevent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in individuals aged 6 months and older for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and 5 years and older for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent.

Risks and uncertainties include, among other things, the uncertainties inherent in research and development, including the ability to meet anticipated clinical endpoints, commencement and/or completion dates for clinical trials, regulatory submission dates, regulatory approval dates and/or launch dates, as well as risks associated with preclinical and clinical data (including Phase 1/2/3 or Phase 4 data), including the data discussed in this release for BNT162b2, any monovalent, bivalent or variant-adapted vaccine candidates or any other vaccine candidate in the BNT162 program in any of our studies in pediatrics, adolescents, or adults or real world evidence, including the possibility of unfavorable new preclinical, clinical or safety data and further analyses of existing preclinical, clinical or safety data, including the risk that additional data from the Phase 2/3 trial could differ from the data discussed in this release; the ability to produce comparable clinical or other results, including the rate of vaccine effectiveness and safety and tolerability profile observed to date, in additional analyses of the Phase 3 trial and additional studies, in real world data studies or in larger, more diverse populations following commercialization; the ability of BNT162b2, any monovalent, bivalent or variant-adapted vaccine candidates or any future vaccine to prevent COVID-19 caused by emerging virus variants; the risk that more widespread use of the vaccine will lead to new information about efficacy, safety, or other developments, including the risk of additional adverse reactions, some of which may be serious; the risk that preclinical and clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments, including during the peer review/publication process, in the scientific community generally, and by regulatory authorities; whether and when additional data from the BNT162 mRNA vaccine program will be published in scientific journal publications and, if so, when and with what modifications and interpretations; whether regulatory authorities will be satisfied with the design of and results from these and any future preclinical and clinical studies; whether and when submissions to request emergency use or conditional marketing authorizations for BNT162b2 in additional populations, for a potential booster dose for BNT162b2, any monovalent or bivalent vaccine candidates or any potential future vaccines (including potential future annual boosters or re-vaccinations), and/or other biologics license and/or emergency use authorization applications or amendments to any such applications may be filed in particular jurisdictions for BNT162b2, any monovalent or bivalent vaccine candidates or any other potential vaccines that may arise from the BNT162 program, including a potential variant-based, higher dose, or bivalent vaccine, and if obtained, whether or when such emergency use authorizations or licenses will expire or terminate; whether and when any applications that may be pending or filed for BNT162b2 (including any requested amendments to the emergency use or conditional marketing authorizations), any monovalent or bivalent vaccine candidates (including the submission pending with the EMA for the BA.4/BA.5 booster for children ages 5 through 11 and any other potential submissions for the Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine), or other vaccines that may result from the BNT162 program may be approved by particular regulatory authorities, which will depend on myriad factors, including making a determination as to whether the vaccine’s benefits outweigh its known risks and determination of the vaccine’s efficacy and, if approved, whether it will be commercially successful; decisions by regulatory authorities impacting labeling or marketing, manufacturing processes, safety and/or other matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential of a vaccine, including development of products or therapies by other companies; disruptions in the relationships between us and our collaboration partners, clinical trial sites or third-party suppliers; the risk that demand for any products may be reduced or no longer exist which may lead to reduced revenues or excess inventory; risks related to the availability of raw materials to manufacture a vaccine; challenges related to our vaccine’s formulation, dosing schedule and attendant storage, distribution and administration requirements, including risks related to storage and handling after delivery by Pfizer; the risk that we may not be able to successfully develop other vaccine formulations, booster doses or potential future annual boosters or re-vaccinations or new variant-based or next generation vaccines; the risk that we may not be able to maintain or scale up manufacturing capacity on a timely basis or maintain access to logistics or supply channels commensurate with global demand for our vaccines, which would negatively impact our ability to supply the estimated numbers of doses of our vaccines within the projected time periods; whether and when additional supply agreements will be reached; uncertainties regarding the ability to obtain recommendations from vaccine advisory or technical committees and other public health authorities and uncertainties regarding the commercial impact of any such recommendations; challenges related to public vaccine confidence or awareness; uncertainties regarding the impact of COVID-19 on Pfizer’s business, operations and financial results; and competitive developments.A further description of risks and uncertainties can be found in Pfizer’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 and in its subsequent reports on Form 10-Q, including in the sections thereof captioned ""Risk Factors"" and ""Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affect Future Results"", as well as in its subsequent reports on Form 8-K, all of which are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and available at www.sec.gov and www.pfizer.com.About BioNTechBiopharmaceutical New Technologies is a next generation immunotherapy company pioneering novel therapies for cancer and other serious diseases.

We've got details of two fintech shares. PayPal and Block going in opposite directions after both companies beat on the top and bottom lines in the third quarter. But PayPal's guidance worried shareholders, and Block didn't provide forward guidance but did post strong Cash App growth in particular. That's what I was seeing in analyst after analyst, who note it was all about Cash App for Block. That was something that saw a lot of traction for the company. Cash App sales, I believe, were up by 51-- or excuse me, revenue up by 12%. Maybe it was profit that was up by 51% there. So seeing some strength.- Yeah, it was Cash App that was at 51%. Square gross profit as well, was up 29% in the quarter here. And I think this continues to show as well, even going into this holiday quarter too, where they're going to be-- there's going to be a lot of focus on BNPL, Buy Now, Pay Later as well. That platform also contributed about $210 million of revenue, $150 million of gross profits. So highly profitable segment there, in buy now, pay later. And that was really triggered by the acquisition of Afterpay.So with the focus of Square Cash App and Afterpay, going into this holiday season, it's largely a question of the merchants that use all these platforms and the consumers that are deciding in one mechanism or another to say, hey, yeah, I'll pay my friend for something that they might be fronting me some money for. Or I'll use Afterpay to pay for things in installments. Or for the small businesses out there hoping that they get a boost on Small Business Saturday.I think that all still funnels back to some of the strategic acquisitions that Square has made over the years. Excuse me. Block.- Block.- Block, Square. Square, Block, whatever--Story continues- It's all the same thing. I'm locking in on PayPal here. You know, when I was reading the earnings report, when I see Apple mentioned-- a new partnership with Apple mentioned at the top of the earnings release, my first thought was this earnings report, it's not going to end well. There's going to be some type of red flag on this report. And there were. The guidance for the current quarter, not good. That's why you're seeing PayPal shares hit about 3% in the premarket, one of the top-trading tickers on our site.And they talked about PayPal on the earnings call. They have seen a pullback in consumer-- by consumers in discretionary spending, by lower in middle income consumers, noting that the holiday season has not started early. So a big red flag, not just for PayPal, I would argue for a lot of retailers more broadly.- On the flip side, PayPal is cutting expenses pretty aggressively. And expenses in the quarter actually were better than estimated, a little bit lower than estimated. Its goal is to cut by $900 million this year and $1.3 billion next year. So, you know, to your point, earlier when we were talking about Twitter, you can't cut your way to growth, but PayPal is still growing. It's just going to be growing at a slower pace while it is suffering from all these macroeconomic headwinds.And speaking of cutting to try to turn things around, Coinbase that's what it's doing. That's another fintech that we are watching here this morning. And analysts seem to be positive about the company's expense cutting even after its revenue was down by 55% last quarter and came in below estimates.]"

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. See our latest analysis for Marathon Petroleum How Fast Is Marathon Petroleum Growing Its Earnings Per Share?Investors and investment funds chase profits, and that means share prices tend rise with positive earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So for many budding investors, improving EPS is considered a good sign. It is awe-striking that Marathon Petroleum's EPS went from US$0.74 to US$25.53 in just one year. When you see earnings grow that quickly, it often means good things ahead for the company. Could this be a sign that the business has reached an inflection point?It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. The good news is that Marathon Petroleum is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 7.2 percentage points to 9.6%, over the last year. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Marathon Petroleum's future EPS 100% free.Story continuesAre Marathon Petroleum Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?It's said that there's no smoke without fire. For investors, insider buying is often the smoke that indicates which stocks could set the market alight. That's because insider buying often indicates that those closest to the company have confidence that the share price will perform well. Of course, we can never be sure what insiders are thinking, we can only judge their actions.Belief in the company remains high for insiders as there hasn't been a single share sold by the management or company board members. But the bigger deal is that the Independent Director, Charles Bunch, paid US$64k to buy shares at an average price of US$64.30. Strong buying like that could be a sign of opportunity.On top of the insider buying, it's good to see that Marathon Petroleum insiders have a valuable investment in the business. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$198m. This comes in at 0.4% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Is Marathon Petroleum Worth Keeping An Eye On?Marathon Petroleum's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. To sweeten the deal, insiders have significant skin in the game with one even acquiring more. This quick rundown suggests that the business may be of good quality, and also at an inflection point, so maybe Marathon Petroleum deserves timely attention. Don't forget that there may still be risks. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Marathon Petroleum (1 doesn't sit too well with us)  you should be aware of.There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

Consider Marathon Petroleum (MPC),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-fast-paced-momentum-stock-125012677.html,1667479812,STORY,['MPC'],"[Momentum investors typically don't time the market or ""buy low and sell high."" In other words, they avoid betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. Instead, they believe that ""buying high and selling higher"" is the way to make far more money in lesser time.Who doesn't like betting on fast-moving trending stocks? But determining the right entry point isn't easy. Often, these stocks lose momentum once their valuation moves ahead of their future growth potential. In such a situation, investors find themselves loaded up on expensive shares with limited to no upside or even a downside. So, going all-in on momentum could be risky at times.It could be safer to invest in bargain stocks that have been witnessing price momentum recently. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, is pretty useful in identifying great momentum stocks, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.There are several stocks that currently pass through the screen and Marathon Petroleum (MPC) is one of them. Here are the key reasons why this stock is a great candidate.Investors' growing interest in a stock is reflected in its recent price increase. A price change of 6.7% over the past four weeks positions the stock of this refiner well in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. MPC meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 20.5% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for MPC is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.61. This indicates that the stock moves 61% higher than the market in either direction.Given this price performance, it is no surprise that MPC has a Momentum Score of B, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.Story continuesIn addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped MPC earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, MPC is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. MPC is currently trading at 0.31 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 31 cents for each dollar of sales.So, MPC appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.In addition to MPC, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.

And despite signs that the economy is slowing, Americans are expected to spend more this year between Thanksgiving and New Year’s than they did in 2021.According to accounting and professional services firm Deloitte, holiday retail sales are likely to boom. Expectations are that retail sales will total between $1.45 trillion and $1.47 trillion from late November to the start of January. That’s up about 5% from the same time last year. E-commerce sales during this year’s holiday sales period are expected to rise even more dramatically, with Deloitte forecasting year-over-year growth of 12.8% to 14.3%. Indeed, the firm says that e-commerce sales could exceed $260 billion, making for a very merry holiday sales season.Clearly, Americans aren’t letting inflation and rising interest rates hold them back from celebrating year-end festivities. Other holiday sales forecasts are equally bullish. So, which companies and stocks are likely to benefit from all that holiday spending? Here is a list of seven stocks that could pop with the holidays.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWMTWalmart$140.72UPSUnited Parcel Service$164.01AMZNAmazon$89.30CVSCVS Health$97.80LUVSouthwest Airlines$36.96BBYBest Buy$67.07TAPMolson Coors$49.48Walmart (WMT)Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the backgroundSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comMany people depend on Walmart (NYSE:WMT) at Christmas time. From toys and decorations to food and stocking stuffers, Walmart has it all. Additionally, this company usually offers the best prices in town. That could be an especially attractive draw for consumers this year, with inflation in the U.S. continuing to run at a 40-year high, and costs up sharply for everything from turkeys to eggnog.The world’s biggest retailer is following the lead of competitors this year and offering holiday sales earlier than ever before. The company started rolling out deals to consumers in October, rather than waiting until Thanksgiving at the end of November. Over the last month, Walmart has announced price cuts, expanded return options, and an enhanced omnichannel shopping experience. This is in a bid to kickstart its holiday shopping season into high gear.Story continuesIn the coming weeks, Walmart said it will offer thousands more price “rollbacks” to help harried shoppers complete their holiday lists. Currently, WMT stock is only down 1% on the year at $141 per share. That said, a strong holiday boost could help turn the company’s share price green by New Year’s.United Parcel Service (UPS)Close up of UPS logo printed on a delivery truck; partial view of the driver sitting at the wheel, waiting at a red traffic light in south San Francisco baySource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comHelping Santa get all those gifts and packages under the tree this year is the job of United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS). The largest courier company in the world with annual revenues of more than $85 billion, UPS thrives during the holidays. In September, the company announced plans to hire more than 100,000 additional workers to help with the holiday shipping rush. These hires span the spectrum, from drivers to package handlers.UPS said it anticipates package shipments to peak later in December this year and closer to Christmas, as consumers return to pre-Covid patterns and shop for items later and in-person. The company also expects to lose some business to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which is directly handling more of it its own shipments now. Still, the fourth and final quarter of the year is always the busiest for UPS.UPS stock is down approximately 20% this year at $164 per share, mirroring the decline in the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index.Amazon (AMZN)Amazon LOGO ON THE SIDE OF A BUILDING.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comSpeaking of Amazon, the e-commerce giant made headlines around the world in October when it held a second Prime sales event for the year. Traditionally, Amazon’s Prime sales event has been held at Thanksgiving and tied into the Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales extravaganzas. However, Amazon decided to move up this year’s sales to October to try and kickstart holiday shopping early, and give its revenues a big boost in the fourth quarter.While exact sales figures for the October event have yet to be made public by Amazon, preliminary indications are that the company sold more than 100 million items during the two-day event. Additionally, Amazon should continue to benefit from strong e-commerce sales throughout this year’s holidays, especially around Black Friday and during the lead-up to Christmas. Like the other companies on this list, the fourth quarter is typically the strongest for Amazon.AMZN stock is down roughly 45% this year and trading at $90 per share. At this price, the stock is a true gift to investors.CVS Health (CVS)the exterior of a CVS pharmacy storeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comPharmacy retailer CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) just reported its third consecutive earnings beat. The Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based company’s stock popped 3% after it reported Q3 earnings per share of $2.09 versus $1.99 that was expected on Wall Street. Revenue for the July through September period came in at $81.16 billion compared to $76.75 billion that was expected by analysts.A big reason for the company’s continued strong earnings is revenue from CVS Health’s retail sales, which rose 7% year-over-year in the third-quarter. Those retail sales are likely to get a boost during the holidays as people turn to the company’s nearly 10,000 retail outlets for chocolates, stocking stuffers, and other items.December is also cold and flu season, and that should help CVS Health’s pharmacy services, which saw revenue climb 10% higher from a year ago during the most recent quarter. CVS stock is down only 6% this year, outperforming all the major U.S. stock indices.Southwest Airlines (LUV)a southwest airline stocks (LUV) jet flying above the cloudsSource: Carlos E. Santa Maria / Shutterstock.comLet’s not forget holiday travel. After two years of sheltering-in-place at home, Americans are again planning to travel during the holidays this year. Approximately 70% of Americans saying they plan to travel to visit family and friends for Thanksgiving and/or Christmas. Thus, airlines are seeking to capitalize on the busy travel season, with most having already raised their fares by 50% or more from mid-November through early January.One of the airlines most likely to benefit from the holiday travel boom is Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV). The world’s largest low-cost carrier and one of the busiest airlines in the U.S., Southwest carries more domestic passengers than any other airline in America. The company is rushing to resolve its staffing problems in the lead-up to Thanksgiving, announcing plans to hire more than 3,000 pilots this year and next.LUV stock is down 16% this year and trading at $37 per share.Best Buy (BBY)Image of Best Buy logo on storefront during daytime. retail stocksSource: BobNoah / Shutterstock.comAs a purveyor of consumer electronics such as smartphones, video game consoles, and Ultra High Definition (UHD) television sets, Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) is typically ground zero for both Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday sales. Consumers line-up around the country to crash the retailer’s Black Friday sales events at midnight the day after Thanksgiving, while millions more try to score deals online during Cyber Monday.Like the other retailers on this list, Best Buy got a jump on the holidays this year, offering exclusive sales to customers in October. Not only has the company offered early Black Friday deals, it has also announced exclusive offers to its “My Best Buy” members, which, it says, will continue through January as part of what it is calling “Member Mondays.” This strategy could power Best Buy to a strong fourth quarter.So far this year, BBY stock has fallen 34% to $67 a share.Molson Coors (TAP)Molson Coors (TAP) logo on a web browser magnified by a magnifying glassSource: OleksandrShnuryk / Shutterstock.comWe’ll end with a cup of holiday cheer. For that, investors should look to Chicago-based beverage giant and master brewer Molson Coors (NYSE:TAP). According to a survey published on the website Beveragedaily.com, Americans double their intake of alcohol between Thanksgiving and New Year’s, consuming eight alcoholic drinks a week compared to four during the rest of the year.The most popular alcoholic beverages during the holidays are eggnog (40%), coffee with Bailey’s (34%), beer (28%) and cider (27%). Molson Coors, which is the second largest brewer in the U.S. and third largest maker of alcoholic beverages in the world, is sure to benefit from an uptick in sales during the holidays.Strong year-end sales could further help TAP stock, which has benefitted from the economic reopening following the pandemic. Year-to-date, Molson Coors stock is up 5% at just under $50 per share, making it among the rare securities that are on the positive side of the ledger in 2022.Disclosure: On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

287,b25e2e50-8f81-3cff-9482-3437a50a849d,AES,2022-11-04,AES (AES) Tops Q3 Earnings and Revenue Estimates,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aes-aes-tops-q3-earnings-111511522.html,1667560511,STORY,"['AESC', 'AQNU']","[AES (AES) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.63 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.54 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.50 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 16.67%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this power company would post earnings of $0.31 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.34, delivering a surprise of 9.68%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.AES , which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, posted revenues of $3.63 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16.37%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.04 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.AES shares have added about 7.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -22%.What's Next for AES?While AES has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for AES: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead.

(PRNewsfoto/The AES Corporation)""With our strong year-to-date performance, we now expect our full year Adjusted EPS1 to come in at or near the high end of our guidance range of $1.55 to $1.65.  Our renewables business continues to grow, and we completed 500 MW of projects and signed 1.6 GW of new long-term contracts,"" said Andrés Gluski, AES President and Chief Executive Officer.  ""Our backlog of projects under long-term PPAs now stands at 11.2 GW, with the vast majority expected to come online through 2025, representing a key source of our future growth.  With our global pipeline of 64 GW and the recent enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in the United States, we are well-positioned to continue delivering attractive returns to our shareholders.""Story continues""Our proven business model of signing long-term contracts with investment grade commercial and industrial customers continues to deliver strong and resilient financial results even while volatile macroeconomic conditions persist globally.  During the third quarter we signed additional agreements to redirect excess LNG from Panama to international customers, highlighting the strategic flexibility and strength of our portfolio,"" said Stephen Coughlin, AES Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  ""Our results so far this year, along with our expectations for the remainder of 2022, give us confidence that we will deliver Adjusted EPS1 at or near the high end of our guidance range and keeps us well on track to achieve our annualized growth target of 7% to 9% through 2025.""Q3 2022 Financial ResultsThird quarter 2022 Diluted Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations (Diluted EPS) was $0.59, an increase of $0.11 compared to third quarter 2021, primarily driven by higher margins from the Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean (MCAC) Strategic Business Unit (SBU) due to redirecting excess LNG to international customers.  This favorability was partially offset by lower margins from the US and Utilities SBU primarily due to unrealized derivative losses, and the one-time settlement and recognition of previously deferred fuel and energy purchases.Third quarter 2022 Adjusted Earnings Per Share1 (Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP financial measure) was $0.63, an increase of $0.13, or 26%, compared to third quarter 2021, primarily reflecting the same drivers as Diluted EPS.Strategic AccomplishmentsIn year-to-date 2022, the Company signed 3,178 MW of renewables and energy storage under long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPA), including 1,625 MW of solar, energy storage and wind in the US.In year-to-date 2022, the Company completed the construction or acquisition of 861 MW of energy storage, wind and solar projects in the United States, Chile, and the Dominican Republic.The Company's backlog, which includes projects with signed contracts, but which are not yet operational, is now 11,230 MW, including 5,188 MW under construction.The Company signed agreements that will redirect excess LNG from the Company's business in Panama to international customers.AES Ohio filed a new Electric Security Plan (ESP 4) to provide a regulatory foundation to upgrade and modernize its network and settle any outstanding regulatory proceedings.Guidance and Expectations1The Company now expects full year 2022 Adjusted EPS1 to be at or near the high end of its guidance range of $1.55 to $1.65.  The Company is reaffirming its 7% to 9% annualized growth rate target through 2025, from a base year of 2020.1    Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure.  See attached ""Non-GAAP Measures"" for definition of Adjusted EPS and a description of the adjustments to reconcile Adjusted EPS to Diluted EPS for the quarter ended September 30, 2022.  The Company is not able to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent or reconciliation for its Adjusted EPS guidance without unreasonable effort.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresSee Non-GAAP Measures for definitions of Adjusted Earnings Per Share and Adjusted Pre-Tax Contribution, as well as reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.AttachmentsCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, Segment Information, Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Parent Financial Information.Conference Call InformationAES will host a conference call on Friday, November 4, 2022 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time (ET).  Interested parties may listen to the teleconference by dialing 1-844-200-6205 at least ten minutes before the start of the call.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the food industry and its outlook, and go directly to read 5 Best Food Dividend Stocks to Buy Now. The food industry encompasses all businesses that are involved in the production, transportation, storage, and selling of food and related items. Like many other sectors, the food industry also evolved during the pandemic in 2020 when major companies brought digital operations into play. The execution worked splendidly for the overall industry as analysts expect it to generate $899 billion in sales this year, according to Forbes.The current market environment has investors turning towards safe stocks that are not impacted by the economic downturn. Food stocks, that fall under the consumer staples sector, are a decent inflation hedge as their sales demand continues even if the prices are increased. The sector can also maintain its profitability as the rising prices are likely to be passed on to consumers. Some of the popular food stocks include PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), and Kellogg Company (NYSE:K).This year, food prices have recorded their largest annual increase since 1979, growing by 11.4% year-over-year as of August. The price hike has altered consumers’ shopping patterns and overall eating habits as they look for alternative and cheap ingredients. However, despite these high prices, the sector’s performance is relatively stable this year as demand for food products remained intact. According to a report by the US Census Bureau, retail and food services sales in the country were up by 9.2% in Q3 2022 from the same period last year. Moreover, the S&amp;P Food and Beverage Select Industry Index fell by 1.51% year-to-date, compared with a 21.6% drop in the broader market, as of the close of November 2.According to analysts, investors should focus on food businesses that can reduce their production costs and operating costs to stay afloat during inflationary periods. Moreover, companies with stable cash flows are also recommended by analysts as they often pay dividends to shareholders, which is rewarding in times of financial volatility.

(NYSE:PNC) boasts of strong institutional backing",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/85-ownership-pnc-financial-services-140020957.html,1667484020,STORY,['PNC'],"[If you want to know who really controls The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:PNC), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 85% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of PNC Financial Services Group. See our latest analysis for PNC Financial Services Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About PNC Financial Services Group?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in PNC Financial Services Group. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see PNC Financial Services Group's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. PNC Financial Services Group is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.2% of shares outstanding. With 8.8% and 7.6% of the shares outstanding respectively, Capital Research and Management Company and BlackRock, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 15 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of PNC Financial Services GroupThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$223m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 15% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over PNC Financial Services Group. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks for example - PNC Financial Services Group has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

The broad-based decline in equities through most of the year means that some of the best run and most dominant companies in the U.S. have undervalued stocks to buy. These names are trading at a huge discount relative to their current and future earnings.The share prices of many highly profitable, market-leading companies have sunk by 50% or more over the last nine months, in many cases erasing the gains that they achieved during the pandemic of the last two years.This presents a huge buying opportunity for investors looking to put capital to work in a weak market. And while we may not have achieved a firm bottom just yet, there are plenty of undervalued stocks to buy at fire-sale prices. These stocks should pay off handsomely once the market does bottom for good and share prices permanently reverse higher.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHere are seven of the most undervalued, attractive stocks to buy now.GOOG,GOOGLAlphabet$96HDHome Depot$298AMDAMD$60TGTTarget$163BABoeing$143PFEPfizer$47.50JPMJPMorgan$126.60Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)GOOG stock: letters spelling out googleSource: rvlsoft / Shutterstock.comThe shares of technology giant Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) are not likely to be this affordable again for a very long time. Following the Google parent company’s most recent earnings report, GOOGL stock dropped 6%, pulling its share price down to $96, its most affordable level since the company went public in 2004.To be sure, Alphabet’s latest earnings print was ugly. Owing largely to a drop of online advertising on YouTube, Alphabet’s Q3 results missed analysts’ average expectations on both the top and bottom lines. The company announced earnings per share of $1.06 versus analysts’ average estimate of $1.25, according to Refinitiv data. Its Q3 revenue amounted to $69.09 billion, compared to the mean estimate of $70.60 billion.Story continuesYouTube’s ad revenue fell 2%  year-over-year in the quarter while analysts, on average, were expecting an increase of 3%.In response to the poor Q3 showing, Alphabet announced several cost-cutting measures, including canceling the next generation of its Pixelbook laptop computer and plans to close its digital gaming service called Stadia. The company also said it would reduce its workforce in the coming months.The added pressure on GOOGL stock following the Q3 earnings has dragged the shares’ value down a total of 33% on the year. (A 20-for-1 stock split in July also lowered the share price). While discouraging, the decline makes Alphabet stock look very attractive at its current levels. The company’s price-earnings (P/E) ratio has dropped along with the share price to an attractive level of 19 times, which is below the large-cap technology stocks’ average of 25 times.This year’s pullback is one of the steepest in the company’s history. Investors should take advantage of this rare opportunity.Home Depot (HD)a Home Depot store is seen from the outsideSource: Cassiohabib / Shutterstock.comDown nearly 30% this year, retailer The Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is now trading at $298 a share and was recently at its lowest level since before the Covid-19 pandemic struck in March 2020.The decline of the share price hardly seems justified, considering that the Atlanta-based company just reported solid second-quarter earnings and reaffirmed its 2022 guidance. The company’s Q1 sales were the strongest in its 44-year history. For Q2, Home Depot reported earnings per share of $5.05, which beat analysts’ average forecast of $4.94 per share. Its Q2 revenue came in at $43.79 billion, beating the average outlook of $43.36 billion.For all of 2022, the company expects its sales to increase 3% and EPS growth of around 5%.Home Depot continues to manage inflationary pressures. The company has been focused on serving professional home builders and contractors rather than putting a great deal of its efforts towards serving do-it-yourself renovators and weekend warriors.The company noted on its Q2 earnings call that its sales to professionals continue to exceed its revenue from do-it-yourself projects. Illustrating that trend, its revenue from building-material supplies has been growing by double-digit-percentages YOY.The earnings and positive guidance show that Home Depot has been unfairly dragged lower by the market rout. Add in a P/E ratio on the stock of 18 and a quarterly dividend that yields 2.54%, and it’s easy to make the case that investors should buy HD stock on the dip.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comReally, you could put any semiconductor stock on this list. They’ve all been knocked lower this year as investors flee high-growth technology equities in favor of stocks that are more immune to rising interest rates.But among the semis, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has been especially battered, down 59% on the year. In mid-October, investors could purchase the shares of AMD for $55 each, the same level at which the stock was trading two years ago. The California-based company’s P/E ratio is now at 26, lower than archrival Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) P/E ratio of 45 and below the industry average.While AMD doesn’t pay a dividend, the company’s earnings have continued to be stellar this year, and its outlook is strong despite its ongoing challenges caused by supply-chain issues and inflationary pressures. In August, the company reported its second-quarter results which showed that its sales had come in at $6.55 billion versus analysts’ average estimate of $6.53 billion.Each of AMD’s individual businesses grew during the quarter, with its overall revenue rising 70% year-over-year. Looking ahead, the company guided for sales of $6.7 billion for the just-completed Q3, plus or minus $200 million. By almost every measure, AMD is a best-in-class stock that investors should buy while it is on sale.Target (TGT)Image of the Target logo on a storefront.Source: jejim / Shutterstock.comAnother retailer whose stock is looking cheap is Minneapolis-based Target (NYSE:TGT). In 2022, TGT stock has dropped 29% to trade at $163 a share.The shares of the big-box department store chain, which has nearly 2,000 locations, more than 400,000 employees, and annual revenues in excess of $100 billion, had been holding up fairly well until April. That’s when the company reported its Q1 earnings which showed that inflation had affected its bottom line and that it had an excessive amount of inventory in its warehouses.Inventory, in particular, has been a problem for TGT, with the retailer warning in June that its Q2 operating margin would likely fall to 2% from 5.3% in Q1 as it marked down unwanted items, canceled orders, and took steps to get rid of extra items. The retailer blamed its poor financial results on pricey freight costs, higher markdowns, and lower sales of everything from television sets to bikes.The earnings and inventory issues aside, Target still pays a decent, $1.08 per-share dividend that yields 2.58%. And its P/E ratio of 19 shows that the stock is currently undervalued relative to its peers.Boeing (BA)Boeing (BA) passenger airplane with open exit door, passenger windows, cargo door, close up view of Boeing logoSource: vaalaa / Shutterstock.comThe Boeing Company’s (NYSE:BA) stock was down for the count before this year’s bear market. Several high-profile crashes of its aircraft in the last few years had created a crisis of confidence in the Virginia-based manufacturer of passenger airplanes. However, all indications are that Boeing has turned the page and is moving forward with more stringent safety guidelines.However, this fact hasn’t helped BA stock, which has fallen 31% this year and is trading at $143 a share. The stock is trading near the same level that it was at in 2015.Investors willing to be patient with BA stock should consider the fact that Boeing is part of a duopoly when it comes to aircraft manufacturing. That’s because France’s Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) is the only other reputable company in the world that manufactures a high number of commercial passenger airplanes.This gives Boeing an enormous advantage and puts the company in a strong competitive position. While investors continue to fret about the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) looking over the shoulders of Boeing’s executives and engineers, they miss the fact that the company continues to win lucrative contracts around the world as airlines move to replace their aircraft fleets.Pfizer (PFE)Pfizer logo on Pfizer building. Pfizer is an American pharmaceutical corporation.Source: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.comPfizer (NYSE:PFE) is one of the world’s premier pharmaceutical companies, with annual revenues of more than $80 billion and nearly 80,000 employees worldwide. The company makes several blockbuster drugs ranging from Celebrex that treats arthritis; Eliquis for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis; and Prevnar for multiple types of pneumococcal bacteria.In late 2020, the company’s Covid-19 vaccine hit the market. Pfizer sold $36.7 billion worth of Covid-19 vaccines globally last year, representing 45% of its total revenue. This year, the company forecasts Covid-19 vaccine sales of $54.5 billion, including booster shots.Despite the successful addition of its Covid-19 vaccine and the multi-billion dollars of revenue that it has brought in, PFE stock has declined 15% this year to $47.50 a share. The company’s price–earnings ratio is a modest 9.3, suggesting the stock is relatively cheap at its current levels.Investors who snap up the shares ahead of this year’s cold-and-flu season will also benefit from a quarterly dividend that yields 3.37%. In the lead-up to this winter, Pfizer is continuing to develop its Covid-19 treatment, called “Paxlovid.”So far, the pill has received Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA, and trials of the drug continue. Some analysts say the pill could be Pfizer’s next blockbuster medication if it gets full approval from the FDA.JPMorgan Chase (JPM)A sign for JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM).Source: Bjorn Bakstad / Shutterstock.comAn investor could do worse than to buy shares of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), which is the biggest lender in America with nearly $4 trillion of assets under management, and the largest bank in the world with a market capitalization of $370 billion.JPMorgan Chase was one of the first banks out of the gate with Q3 earnings, and the results did not disappoint. For the July through September period, the bank reported earnings per share of $3.12, handily beating Wall Street estimates for $2.88. Revenue in the quarter totaled $33.49 billion, beating the $32.1 billion that was expected by analysts on average and up 10% from the same period a year earlier.JPM’s earnings, which serve as a bellwether for the banking industry, bolstered sentiment among investors, especially as the lender stressed that consumer and businesses appear to be holding up despite indications of a slowing economy. And while JPMorgan’s investment banking and equity trading units experienced a slowdown in Q3, the bank offset those declines with greater interest income generated from higher interest rates charged on its loans, and also through a bump in bond trading.JPM stock is currently down about 20% on the year at $126.60 per share. However, the bank’s share price has gained 19% in the past month due to a post-earnings bump. The shares also currently have a low price–earnings ratio of ten and pay a quarterly dividend that yields 3.17%.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in GOOGL and NVDA.

Fundamentally, the underlying industry represents the cutting edge of scientific innovation. Should clinical trials lead to commercialization, individual biotechnology firms can deliver outstanding returns.Of course, when looking for undervalued biotech stocks to buy, investors must consider the reason for their market discount. Irrespective of outside fundamentals, the biotech space inherently brings much volatility to the mix. No one knows for certain whether a groundbreaking therapeutic will pass clinical muster, meaning the sector represents a high-risk, high-reward endeavor.To remedy some of these dangers, the below ideas for undervalued biotech stocks to buy feature some financial substance to justify exposure. That is, this list avoids purely speculative or aspirational names. Without further ado, here are some of the best undervalued biotech stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsGMABGenmab$38.51TECHBio-Techne$296.26ABCMAbcam$15.56LGNDLigand Pharmaceuticals$87.65INVAInnoviva$13.65JAZZJazz Pharmaceuticals$143.79EXELExelixis$16.58Undervalued Biotech Stocks: Genmab (GMAB)Biotechnology stocks, biomedical stocksSource: aslysun / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Copenhagen, Denmark, Genmab (NASDAQ:GMAB) specializes in antibodies covering cancer indications and autoimmune diseases. Currently, Genmab carries a market capitalization of $25.4 billion. Shares have slipped only 2.7% on a year-to-date basis, far better than the performance of the broader U.S. indices.According to GuruFocus, GMAB is a modestly undervalued business based on its propriety calculations. On a broader level, investors will likely appreciate Genmab for its all-around excellent financial profile. For instance, the company features a cash-to-debt ratio of 34.1, rating well above the industry median of 10.2. Its Altman Z-Score hits over 40 points, signifying extremely low bankruptcy risk.Story continuesOn the top line, Genmab’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 38.1%, better than nearly 80% of the competition. On the bottom line, the company’s net margin is nearly 39%, surpassing 94% of the industry. To top it off, its return on equity is almost 18%, ranked within the 90th percentile of the underlying sector.GMAB stock presents an intriguing case for undervalued biotech stocks to buy.Bio-Techne (TECH)Phot of test tubes and droplet with purple and reddish-orange sunset visual effectSource: shutterstock.com/Romix ImageHeadquartered in Minneapolis, Bio-Techne (NASDAQ:TECH) develops, manufactures and sells life science reagents, instruments and services for the research, diagnostic and bioprocessing markets. Presently, Bio-Techne commands a market cap of $11.6 billion. Since the beginning of the year, TECH stock has lost 43% of its value. However, shares have stabilized over the past month, gaining 4.3%.According to GuruFocus and its proprietary calculations, TECH rates as modestly undervalued. One factor to consider is that using American academic and investor Joel Greenblatt’s assessment of earnings yield, TECH comes in at 2.3%. This ranks better than 71% of the industry.Just as importantly, Bio-Techne features overall solid financials. For example, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 13.6%, better than 61% of the industry. Net margin stands at 24.6%, ranked better than 89% of the competition.Finally, Bio-Techne features an Altman Z-Score of 13.6 points, again reflecting extremely low bankruptcy risk. Thus, TECH represents one of the undervalued biotech stocks investors should consider buying.Undervalued Biotech Stocks: Abcam (ABCM)A close-up concept image of a tiny glass vial with a strand of DNA in it.Source: ShutterstockBased in the U.K., Abcam (NASDAQ:ABCM) is a producer, distributor and seller of protein research tools. At time of writing, Abcam features a market cap of $3.6 billion. Since the start of this year, ABCM stock dropped 34% in value. However, shares have stabilized recently, rising nearly 4% over the past month.Per GuruFocus, ABCM rates as a significantly undervalued investment based on its proprietary calculations. One metric to consider is again the earnings yield using the Greenblatt model. Here, ABCM comes in at 0.31%, ranking better than almost 67% of the industry.However, Abcam’s claim to fame as one of the undervalued biotech stocks to buy undoubtedly focuses on its profitability angle. For example, its operating and net margins stand at 9.7% and 3.1%, respectively. Both stats rank better than three-quarters of the competition.Just as well, Abcam enjoys decent strength in the balance sheet. Its Altman Z-Score is over 32 points, reflecting extremely low bankruptcy risk.Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND)Image of two scientists in lab coats studying results in a labSource: ShutterstockBased in San Diego, Ligand Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:LGND) focuses on the acquisition of existing drugs and forming partnerships to develop them further. At the moment, Ligand carries a market cap of $1.5 billion, representing one of the smaller names among undervalued biotech stocks to buy. Since the start of the year, LGND has lost 43% of its value. However, in the past month, shares gained 1.8%.According to GuruFocus, LGND rates as significantly undervalued. Primarily, LGND’s Shiller price-earnings ratio sits at 15 times. In sharp contrast, the industry median level is a whopping 41 times. Therefore, Ligand offers a compelling discount for those that want to speculate on undervalued biotech stocks.Another factor to consider is the company’s growth trend. For instance, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 15.4%. During the same period, its book growth rate hit 21.9%. Both metrics rank above industry norms.Finally, Ligand enjoys decent strength in the balance sheet. Specifically, its Altman Z-Score of 4.2 reflects low bankruptcy risk.Undervalued Biotech Stocks: Innoviva (INVA)an image of a microscopeSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in San Francisco, Innoviva (NASDAQ:INVA) features a portfolio of royalties and innovative healthcare investments and assets in areas of significant unmet medical need, per its website. At the time of writing, Innoviva features a market cap of $945 million, ranking among the smaller candidates for today’s undervalued biotech stocks to buy. Shares have lost over 21% YTD, though they did gain almost 17% in the past month.According to GuruFocus, INVA is significantly undervalued based on traditional valuation indicators. For instance, its P/E ratio is 10.9, below the industry median of 28.8. Also, Innoviva’s Shiller P/E ratio is 16.3 times, lower than 80% of biotech competitors.Notably, though, the company brings the heat to the income statement. For instance, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 21.8%, beating out 68.5% of its peers. During the same period, its book growth rate pinged at almost 58%, ranking well above the industry median of 3.8%.Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ)Brown glass pill bottle on its side showing white pills inside, with other pill bottles behind itSource: shutterstock.com/ChampheiBased in Ireland, Jazz Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:JAZZ) focuses on developing life-changing medicines for people with serious diseases — often with limited or no options — so they can live their lives more fully, per its website. It features expertise in two key areas: neuroscience and oncology.Presently, Jazz Pharmaceuticals carries a market cap of slightly over $9 billion. Since the beginning of this year, JAZZ stock has gained almost 13%. Much of this enthusiasm stemmed from recent gains, with shares up nearly 8% in October. Still, if the financials have anything to say about it, JAZZ could go higher.Prominently, data from GuruFocus shows that Jazz Pharmaceuticals is modestly undervalued. Its forward P/E ratio sits at 8.4. For comparison, the industry median is 20.3. Also, the company’s price-to-sales ratio is 2.6 times, lower than the industry median of 10.1 times.To top it off, the company also does well on the income statement. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate is 19%, better than 65% of the competition.Undervalued Biotech Stocks: Exelixis (EXEL)The logo for Exelixis is displayed on a phone.Source: Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Alameda, California, Exelixis (NASDAQ:EXEL) is a genomics-based drug discovery company. It’s best known for producing Cometriq, a therapeutic for medullary thyroid cancer, which the Food and Drug Administration approved. Currently, Exelixis features a market cap of $5.3 billion. Shares dropped 18% YTD, although, in the past month, they’ve gained nearly 6%.According to GuruFocus, EXEL is significantly undervalued. Perhaps most notably, its forward P/E ratio is 11.2, ranking favorably below 73% of the competition. Also, its price-to-projected free cash flow is 0.88 times, coming in below the industry median of 2.9 times.Aside from asset growth rising faster than revenue growth, EXEL enjoys solid financials across the board. Its balance sheet is stable, evidenced by the Altman Z-Score of 8.1 points. Its three-year revenue growth rate of nearly 18% is higher than the sector median. Plus, it features a high-quality business, with a return on equity of 12.3%. Thus, EXEL makes an intriguing case for undervalued biotech stocks to buy.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Severely overleveraged is not a good look in a rising-interest-rate environment like the one we are in right now.Finding such stocks isn’t difficult. To start, I’ll narrow down the S&amp;P 500 to only those stocks with yields of 5% or higher. That reduces the field to 27, according to Finviz.com. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThen I’ll select my three pitiful dividend stocks from the companies whose long-term debt exceeds their equity. The list of 13 companies includes many stocks whose shares have been beaten down over the past year.But putting together lists of stocks to sell is difficult because beauty is in the eye of the beholder. What I think is pitiful, you might believe is misunderstood. So do your due diligence on all three of these pitiful dividend stocks.  Boston Properties (BXP)An image of two people with a housing contract, hands holding a pen, hands holding a calculator with a house in the backgroundSource: 89stocker / ShutterstockBoston Properties (NYSE:BXP) has been a public company since June 1997, when it sold 31.4 million shares to the investing public for $25 apiece. At the time, it owned 63 office properties, two hotels, nine industrial properties, and one garage. Its properties totaled more than 11 million square feet.The REIT (real estate investment trust) now has 193 Class A office properties with 53.7 million square feet of premier workspace in Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. The properties generate $3 billion of annualized revenue and $1.8 billion of EBITDAre (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for real estate). Clearly, BXP has become a much bigger business. If you bought shares during the IPO, you have generated a compound annual growth rate of 8.4%, including dividends. That’s 1.1 percentage points better than the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust over the same period.Before the Great Recession,  BXP had only traded this low on one other occasion:  March 2020. Story continuesFitch Ratings, however, wrote earlier this month that the U.S. office utilization rate, while improving, will not return to levels seen before the pandemic. As a result, weaker properties face obsolescence under the “new normal.”Since the beginning of 2010, BXP stock has moved sideways. Its 5.4% yield shouldn’t be enough to get you to bite on this stock.Oneok Inc. (OKE)Illustration of oil pump jacks on sunset sky background to represent oil and gas stocksSource: ShutterstockIn 2022, Oneok Inc. (NYSE:OKE) is up 2.5%. That’s much better than the S&amp;P 500 has done, but it’s nowhere near the performance of the S&amp;P 500 energy sector, which was up 62% in 2022 as of Oct. 28.Analysts are relatively lukewarm about OKE stock. The average rating of the 22 who cover it is “hold,” and their mean price target is $67.Morningstar.com sector strategist Stephen Ellis likes the Oklahoma-based midstream service provider.     “Oneok brings together high-quality assets, some of the strongest near- to medium-term growth prospects in our coverage as Rockies volumes continue their ongoing rebound, a C-Corporation structure, and a well-respected management team in a compelling package,” Ellis wrote in August. While the company’s financial results in 2022 have been good, it’s difficult to determine why the stock has barely moved at a time when most energy stocks are up 20% or more in 2022.One possibility is its net debt. At the end of June, its total debt was $13.88 billion while it had just $135.77 million of cash for net debt of $13.74 billion, nearly four times its annualized EBITDA. Its shareholders can’t absorb another decline of oil and gas prices. Whirlpool (WHR)the Whirlpool (WHR) logo on a corporate buildingSource: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.comEarlier in 2022, I included Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) on a list of ten stocks that I thought had enough pricing power with consumers to pass on rising input costs to the end buyers of their household appliances. At the time, I argued that regression to the mean would eventually move its stock higher. I suggested that buying WHR stock under $200 would make investors money over the next two to three years. Since the end of February, it has tumbled more than 30%.On Oct. 20, Whirlpool reported that its Q3 results were affected by inflation and slowing demand for its products. However, it also said that 2022 would be the second-best year in its 111-year history. There is, however, no way around the fact that, through the nine months that ended on Sept. 30, its sales in 2022 were down by a double digit-percentage year-over-year.  Meanwhile, its free cash flow has fallen by more than $1 billion, dropping to -$24 million from $988 million a year ago. The company says it has a plan to overcome its current difficulties. I’m not so sure if it will work and neither are analysts. Their average rating on WHR stock is “hold“ with a median target price of $140, just barely higher than its current share price.If you don’t want to sell WHR, at the very least, I would wait for some confirmation that it’s on the right path to recovery before buying any more of its shares.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

310,525f4549-d001-3e49-9652-3531aa1b0943,WRK,2022-11-04,WestRock (WRK) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/westrock-wrk-earnings-expected-grow-140002589.html,1667484002,STORY,['WRK'],"[WestRock (WRK) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 10, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis paper and packaging company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.40 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +13.8%.Revenues are expected to be $5.48 billion, up 7.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.45% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for WestRock?For WestRock, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.24%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that WestRock will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that WestRock would post earnings of $1.50 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.54, delivering a surprise of +2.67%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.WestRock doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Fernando Jorge / UnsplashRoyal Caribbean Group received a strong boost in its booking volume thanks to relaxed Covid protocols, the cruise company’s executives said on an earnings call Thursday.Booking volumes in the third quarter was higher than in the same quarter last year. Booking volumes for 2023 in the third quarter have doubled compared to the second quarter.  Executives did not specify an exact number.A big contributor to the growth in bookings was the recent relaxation of Covid protocols on its ships and in other countries. “I think our calculation in the American market, the addressable market expanded by 35 million almost overnight and we saw that coming through our bookings,” Royal Caribbean International President and CEO Michael Bayley said.Thanks to the relaxation of Covid protocols, Royal Caribbean executives said booking behavior has returned to 2019. “Psychologically and experience wise, it’s almost like we just stepped into the next quarter from 2019 and it’s business as usual,” Royal Caribbean Group President and CEO Jason Liberty said.Passengers are splurging before they set foot on cruise ships. About 60 percent of all customers purchased onboard experiences their ships set sail, which has contributed to average passenger spending exceeding 2019 levels, according to Liberty.Royal Caribbean sailed in the third quarter with a 96 percent occupancy level.  Caribbean market ships even sailed with nearly 105 percent occupancy. The cruise company expects the occupancy level to be roughly the same in the third quarter and potentially reach 100 percent by the end of the year.Total revenue for the third quarter amounted to $3 billion, compared to $460 million for the same period last year. Net income was $33 million, compared to a net loss of $1.4 billion in the same period last year.Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) was $742.3 million, compared to a net loss of $704 million in the third quarter last year.Story continuesThe executives also touted the results of the rollout of their Icon of the Seas class ship, which is reportedly the world’s largest cruise ship. “On the first day of booking, the past booking record for the brand and company overall,” Liberty said. “It wasn’t even close.” Icon will launch by the end of 2023 and it will be a “game changer,” according to Liberty.In the fourth quarter, Royal Caribbean will also launch a flagship terminal in Galveston, Texas to better serve the Southeastern U.S. market. The terminal will be powered by solar panels and be the first “zero energy” terminal in the world, Liberty said.Looking ahead to 2023, Royal Caribbean executives are optimistic about most markets except China, which they don’t expect business in for that year. They, however, expect to have business in China before 2025.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

This compares to earnings of $0.61 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.32%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this chipmaker would post earnings of $0.70 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.73, delivering a surprise of 4.29%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.M/A-Com , which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry, posted revenues of $178.14 million for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.58%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $155.21 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.M/A-Com shares have lost about 26.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -21.1%.What's Next for M/A-Com?While M/A-Com has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for M/A-Com: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.73 on $176.93 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.94 on $724.12 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

Now in its third year, the Visa Accelerator Program selects a small group of startups to collaborate on some of the most pressing challenges in the payments industry. The 2023 program will focus on developing solutions in the following areas: Web 3.0, global money movement, embedded finance, merchant and small business enablers, and open banking solutions.The Visa Accelerator Program was launched in 2019 and has since enabled the growth of some of Asia Pacific's most prominent startups. The five startups from the 2022 cohort presented their proof-of-concepts at the Visa Accelerator Spotlight event, after working with Visa product and business development teams to bring their concepts to life and expand their businesses into new markets across the region.Startups from the 2021 and 2022 cohorts secured nine commercial deals with Visa's clients and partners in Asia Pacific.

Set to open in 2025 with 145 guest rooms. Source: Marriott International.Marriott International forecast that its fourth quarter would surpass 2019 in revenue per available room, a a closely watched number, underscoring the resilience of travel spending despite economic worries.“We expect continued demand growth around the world in the fourth quarter and anticipate that global RevPAR [revenue per available room] could increase two percent to four percent compared to 2019,” said CEO Anthony Capuano on Thursday’s earnings call. Executives also highlighted why they will be stronger than in the past should a downturn hit the global economy.The Bethesda, Maryland-based company — operator of more than 30 brands ranging from Ritz Carlton to Fairfield Inn — raised its annual profit forecast on Thursday, thanks to higher rates it has been able to charge during the global travel boom. The company predicted that its worldwide revenue per available room could come in closer to pre-pandemic levels than it had expected at between 2 and 4 percent above 2019 levels.Forward leisure bookings for holidays, such as Thanksgiving and Christmas, look strong through year’s year — though the company’s clearest visibility is only a few weeks out.Group bookings also look strong. Fourth-quarter full-service group revenue is currently pacing to be more than 4 percent of the comparable quarter in 2019. Relatively last-minute bookings have allowed for strong pricing so far.Optimism About 2023Marriott believed that several factors would allow it to perform better during a possible economic downturn next year than it had done in past downturns.“We definitely see that we could perform relatively better than we have in prior recessions,” said Leeny Oberg, chief financial officer.Oberg noted that the company is entering a possible downturn at a time when U.S. unemployment rates are relatively low. Also, the company’s portfolio is weighted toward premium brands, and consumers with higher levels of discretionary income remain heavily motivated to travel post-pandemic and still have extra savings, on average.Story continues“We currently think 2023 global RevPAR [revenue per available room] could increase nicely year-over-year, driven by gains in both the U.S. and Canada and internationally,” Oberg said. “Each quarter could see growth compared to this year and particularly strong growth in the first quarter due to the easier comparison, given the impact of the omicron variant in early 2022.”Group bookings for 2023 also are pacing strongly.“When I look deeper into what’s on the books for 2023 [for group reservations], room nights are down [from 2019 levels] in the high teens, but ADR [average daily rate is actually up close to about 10% [above 2019 levels],” Capuano said.Strong QuarterIn the third quarter, Marriott generated $630 million in net income — a measure of profit — from $5.3 billion in revenue.In the U.S. and Canada — its largest market — the group reported that its third-quarter revenue per available room was $129, up 3 percent over 2019 levels. The region had an average occupancy of 72 percent — just 2 percentage points below the pre-pandemic level.Expanding Beyond Premium BrandsMarriott International has mainly kept its portfolio to serve the upper half of the hotel market. In North America, 43 percent of its inventory is “upscale,” 35 percent is “upper upscale,” and 5 percent is “luxury,” according to room count categorizations by market research firm STR on Wednesday. The rest, 17 percent, is “upper midscale.”The company hasn’t had economy or affordable mid-scale brands in the Americas, but that looks set to change. Earlier this month, Marriott said it would buy the City Express hotel portfolio in Latin America for $100 million. The deal gives it five brands in a new category — the affordable midscale segment.“We are quite bullish on the moderately priced mid-scale space, which has meaningful growth potential,” Capuano said.The company plans to scale up the brand, first in Latin America.“We are not in the mid-scale segment in the U.S.,” Capuano said. “Certainly, this acquisition gives us the opportunity to evaluate whether it makes sense to enter mid-scale in any other market, inclusive of the U.S.”Pipeline Steady Despite Financing FrictionAs of the end of September, Marriott had about nearly 8,200 properties globally. Its worldwide development pipeline totaled more than 3,000 properties and more than 468,000 rooms subject to signed contracts.Several investment analysts on Thursday’s call quizzed Marriott executives about whether the company’s hotel signings and development had stalled at all as interest rates have rapidly risen worldwide. The broad answer was no, except in China, where a mix of pandemic restrictions, complex projects, and other factors had caused a lot of friction on the development of its mostly upscale properties there.As of September 30, the company said it had about 204,800 rooms under construction. The company hasn’t yet reached 2019 levels of construction, but the construction level remained at the average for the past 20 quarters.“On the signing side, we continue to see strong development volume,” Capuano said. “We continue to see strong franchise application volume in most markets around the world. The construction we’re seeing in the developed markets for new construction, particularly here in the U.S., is lengthening the cycle even a bit longer in terms of getting shoes in the ground.”“We see signs that the strength of our brands continue to capture a disproportionate share of what’s out there,” Capuano added.Credit Card RecordMarriott arguably has the most-used hotel co-branded credit card in the world, and that has become an important tool for it in driving direct bookings and repeat business.In the U.S., Marriott had record new cardholder acquisitions and record spending on its credit cards during the first nine months of the year. Fees were up 20 percent year-over-year. In September, it added two “mid-tier” cards to further drive growth.The company similarly saw record growth internationally this year in new card members and total card spending, especially in China.The company’s loyalty program reached 173 million members, the largest of any of the hotel rewards programs.Watching Brand StandardsDuring the pandemic, some hotels procrastinated on doing renovations and other upkeep to maintain brand standards, and Marriott International looked the other way. But now some properties are looking shabby. That upsets owners who have kept their commitments when they see neighbor properties tarnish a brand’s reputation.Marriott is responding carefully. It has resumed quality assurance audits of its brand standards. During the crisis, they gave owners and franchisees a measure of relief on requirements for the timing of renovations.“We’re bringing those requirements back but with some pragmatic perspective on hotels that are doing a terrific job on service as evidenced by those quality metrics and giving them the ability to selectively extend some of those renovation cycles,” Capuano said.Holding Online Travel Agencies at BayDuring the pandemic, Marriott International joined many other hotel groups in leaning into online travel agencies as a source for demand during desperate times. But during the post-pandemic boom, the company has returned to encouraging consumers to book directly.In the third quarter, 38 percent of its bookings came directly. The contribution of online travel agencies to demand was only 12 percent of the mix — which was just 1 percent higher as a proportional share of the mix than in 2019.“Our direct digital bookings … do help the hotel margins by coming through that channel rather than coming through the OTAs [online travel agencies],” Oberg said. “We’ve obviously worked very hard to make sure that we can make the most out of every revenue dollar that comes through the hotels.”Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Marriott: favorable.

They’ve targeted Republicans with the message that the companies have accumulated too much power and control over the digital ecosystem.News Corp., which owns Dow Jones &amp; Co. and other major media organizations, claims that the tech companies don’t adequately compensate publishers for links to articles and news segments. Murdoch has specifically called out the internet giants for allegedly censoring conservatives online, a common GOP talking point.The Bissex hire is part of a broader shakeup of News Corp.’s lobbying operation after longtime global head of government affairs, Toni Bush, retired earlier this year. Bush was replaced by her colleague Todd Thorpe, who now heads the office.Story continuesMeanwhile, the major tech companies have hired up a slew of Capitol Hill aides. Amazon in August hired Judd Smith, formerly a senior aide to Republican Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley, to bolster its efforts to stymie a highly-anticipated antitrust bill aimed at US internet giants. Apple earlier hired a key aide to Minnesota Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar, who has led her party’s push against the tech platforms.(Updates with company confirmation, in second paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekSmall Businesses Find a Loophole in the New Tax Law: ZelleSeizing a Russian Superyacht Is Much More Complicated Than You ThinkInflation-Focused Voters Defy Biden’s Bid to Change the SubjectWill the No. 2 Movie Theater Chain Find a Happy Ending?©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

There are many ways to accumulate wealth in the stock market, but we believe the most proven method is to find great stocks with durable competitive advantages and long dividend histories. When we combine those criteria with an additional screen of high-yielding dividend stocks, we can end up with some truly great picks.In this article, we’ll take a look at three dividend stocks we believe are good buys for investors with long-term time horizons, given their strength in dividend longevity, durability and very high dividend yields of more than 6%.VZVerizon$37.44BNSBank of Nova Scotia$48.36VFCV.F. Corporation$28.73InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsVerizon (VZ)Verizon Wireless sign and trademark logo.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comOur first stock is Verizon (NYSE:VZ), which is a communications and technology company that operates globally, but principally in the U.S. The company provides postpaid and prepaid wireless phone service plans, internet access for consumers and businesses, associated hardware, data security and more. Verizon has about 150 million different connections to customers through its full suite of services and products. The vast majority of those are attributed to its ubiquitous wireless service.Verizon was founded in 1983 and generates about $137 billion in annual revenue. It trades with a market cap of $153 billion.Verizon’s competitive advantage stems from its enormous 5G wireless network that spans the entire U.S. Together with AT&amp;T (NYSE:T), the two companies operate what amounts to a duopoly in wireless service. Verizon is the larger of the two. The network Verizon has built out would require tens of billions of dollars of spending from a new entrant, so its market position is extremely secure. This helps protect the company’s earnings stream for the future, which, in turn, makes it a better dividend stock.Story continuesSpeaking of the dividend, Verizon’s dividend has risen for the past 18 years consecutively. The company’s average increase during that time was less than 3% annually. However, given Verizon’s utility-like nature, relatively modest dividend increases should be expected.That’s still been good enough for Verizon to sport a 7.2% yield today, which is an all-time high for the stock. Shares have been punished this year while Verizon continues to raise the dividend, so the current yield is outstanding.In addition, we see Verizon’s dividend as highly secure given it has very predictable earnings and a payout ratio of only 50% for this year. That means Verizon could suffer sizable earnings declines, although we don’t believe that will occur under any reasonable scenario, and still pay out its dividend for years to come. This combination of factors — including the payout ratio and Verizon’s competitive advantage — means the stock is a great by for those with long time horizons.Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Our next stock is Bank of Nova Scotia (NYSE:BNS), or Scotiabank, as it is otherwise known. Scotiabank operates across a wide area of the Western Hemisphere, conducting business in Canada, the U.S., Mexico, Peru, Chile, Colombia, the Caribbean and parts of Central America. The bank offers a full suite of banking services, including traditional checking and deposit accounts, investments, credit cards, mortgages and other loan products, insurance, business banking, wealth management, and more. The bank operates about 1,000 branches in Canada and a further 1,300 outside of Canada.Scotiabank was founded in 1832 and produces about $23 billion in annual revenue. It trades with a market value of $57 billion.Scotiabank’s competitive advantage comes from its combination of its huge footprint in the Canadian banking market, its international growth story and its reputation that has been built over nearly 200 years. Scotiabank has a core Canadian business that doesn’t grow very quickly but generates steady earnings. Its international business is more volatile, but growth rates and potential for those markets over time is much higher. This combination of factors means we believe Scotiabank will be competitive for many years to come. That’s good news for dividend investors.Scotiabank just hit 10 years of consecutive dividend increases, coming out of the financial crisis that saw just about every bank cut their dividends. Scotiabank has raised its payout at a rate of about 4% annually in the past decade as it has tried to maintain a payout ratio of under 50%. This year, the payout ratio is expected to be 48%. That is right in line with historical tendencies. It also means the dividend should be safe in all but the harshest of recessions going forward.Finally, Scotiabank’s current yield is 6.3%, which is among the highest yields the bank has ever produced. The stock has traded down significantly in 2022, creating a great opportunity for long-term dividend investors to pick up a yield that is about four times that of the S&amp;P 500.V.F. Corporation (VFC)Image of a giant boot in the street surrounded by people.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comOur final pick for dividend stocks to buy and hold is V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC), which is a company that designs, markets and distributes branded lifestyle apparel, footwear and accessories globally. V.F. operates in three segments: outdoor, active and work. Through these segments, the company offers a variety of premium products for men, women and children. Its brands include well-known favorites such as Vans, Supreme, Timberland, North Face and Dickies, among others.V.F. was founded in 1899 and generates about $12 billion in annual revenue. It has a current market cap of $11 billion.We like V.F. for its outstanding portfolio of premium brands that have decades of success backing them. The company has collected brands over the years with strong reputations among consumers. On the whole, this collection of products makes a consolidated company with diversified exposure across a wide variety of use cases for its products, price points and demand profiles.V.F. has boosted its dividend for 49 consecutive years. That means it is just one more annual increase away from being a Dividend King. That alone puts V.F. in rare company, but among apparel distributors, it is in a class of its own. The dividend has also grown at about 10% annually in the past decade, a tremendous growth profile for a company with nearly half a century of increases under its belt.VFC stock has a current yield of over 7%. That is about triple the level it generally has been over the years. That’s due to its cheap valuation and the fact that the stock has been punished in 2022.The current payout is $2 per share annually. Earnings guidance is about $2.45 for this year, so the payout ratio is elevated. However, the company has defended the dividend during brief periods of the payout exceeding earnings before, and we believe it would again. Current earnings will cover the payout, so this is not an issue at the moment. And we don’t believe the dividend is in danger of being cut.On the date of publication, Bob Ciura did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(""AIR"") (NYSE: AIRC) announced today third quarter results for 2022.Chief Executive Officer Terry Considine comments: ""Business is good! In 3Q:Keith and his Ops team are on track to deliver peer leading margins and record NOI growth in our Same Store portfolio. NOI in our 2021 Acquisition portfolio is growing even faster.John and his investment team continue to make accretive acquisitions that improve the quality and profitability of our real estate portfolio. During the quarter, we committed to purchase Southgate Towers in Miami Beach for $298 million, and we bought back (through November 2, 2022) 4.3 million shares of AIR common stock.AIR's business is well prepared for the key macro risks of the day: soaring interest rates, high inflation, and possible recession.With Paul’s good work, Pro forma Net Leverage: EBITDAre is 5.9:1, and AIR has only minor refunding and re-pricing exposure until 2025.Inflation provided a boost to AIR’s top-line, but was no match for Keith’s continuing productivity gains: controllable operating expenses are down.A future recession will find AIR with stable cash flows due to its disciplined customer selection. For example, new customers during 3Q had average household income of $250,000 and median household income of $170,000…together with FICO scores averaging 90 points higher than the national average for renters.""""AIR's prospects for 2023 are excellent. A 5% earn-in from 2022 leases provides a baseline for growth in Same Store Revenue. Current loss-to-lease is 5%. Rents continue to increase. NOI from our 2021 acquisitions is increasing at more than twice the Same Store NOI growth rate. 2022 acquisitions are performing in line with expectations.""""AIR enjoys peer leading margins and peer leading conversion of rent to free cash flow. These advantages are considerable, and durable.""Story continuesCommenting further, Chief Financial Officer Paul Beldin added: ""We are pleased with our third quarter results, and continue to see strong momentum through year-end 2022, and into 2023. The transformation of AIR’s balance sheet was completed in the quarter. With the Aimco note fully repaid, and approximately $500 million of property sales expected later this month, third quarter Pro forma leverage to EBITDAre is 5.9:1, consistent with our targeted 5.0x to 6.0x leverage ratio range. EBITDAre at projected 2022 levels is sufficient to repay annual average debt service plus fund maturities through 2031, with a 30% cushion.""""Third quarter Pro forma FFO was $0.58 per share, $0.02 above the midpoint of guidance, due primarily to the timing of favorable litigation outcomes and real estate tax appeals, all of which were previously anticipated to occur in the fourth quarter. During the third quarter, Same Store revenue increased by 9.6%. During a period of inflationary pressure, property level expenses were almost flat and controllable operating expenses were down 400 bps, resulting in a 13.3% increase in year-over-year NOI.""""Looking forward, we are maintaining our Same Store revenue growth expectations of 10.25% at the midpoint and reducing expense growth expectations by 125 basis points to 1%, at the midpoint. The result is a 40 basis point increase in expected NOI growth.""""Full year, Pro forma FFO is expected to be between $2.39 and $2.43 per share, unchanged the midpoint of $2.41, as incremental Same Store NOI is offset by higher general and administrative expenses. Similarly, our expectations for Pro forma Run Rate FFO are unchanged at $2.19 per share at the midpoint.""Financial Results: Third Quarter Pro Forma FFO Per ShareTHIRD QUARTERYEAR-TO-DATE(all items per common share – diluted)20222021Variance20222021VarianceNet income$0.01$0.06(83.3%)$3.68$0.48nmNAREIT Funds From Operations (FFO)$0.53$0.4712.8%$1.59$1.2230.3%Pro forma adjustments *0.050.09(44.4%)0.220.36(38.9%)Pro forma Funds From Operations (Pro forma FFO)$0.58$0.563.6%$1.81$1.5814.6%* Third quarter and year-to-date 2022 includes adjustments related to casualty losses due to Hurricane Ian-related wind damage, primarily at one of our communities in South Florida, currently estimated to be $2.3 million, and flooding at one of our communities in Boston, currently estimated at $1.7 million.Operating Results: Third Quarter Same Store NOI Up 13.3% Year-Over-Year, 4.6% Sequentially, and 14.1% Year-to-DateThe table below includes the operating results of the 58 AIR properties that meet our definition of Same Store.

Amounts may differ from those previously reported.Same Store Markets – Consumer demand remained strong through the quarter, with signed new lease rates up 17.0% from the prior leases and renewals up 11.8%, resulting in a weighted-average increase of 14.5%. We saw a sequential decline in ADO of 90 basis points to 95.9%, reflecting the frictional vacancy consistent with the higher move out volume that is typical during the summer leasing season. Year-to-date ADO of 96.9% was 120 bps higher than in the prior year. We anticipate continued occupancy gains throughout the fourth quarter.Acquisition Portfolio – The acquisition portfolio is currently comprised of five properties acquired in 2021, four acquired in 2022, and represents 14% of AIR GAV. At those properties acquired in 2021, leasing continues to exceed expectations. Signed new lease rates were up 25.1% in the third quarter, with renewals up 23.2%, resulting in a weighted-average increase of 24.1%. Fourth quarter revenue growth for the 2021 acquisitions, the first reporting period with a year-over-year comparison, is anticipated to be 50% above the Same Store portfolio. At properties we acquired in 2022, performance is consistent with our expectations, and rental rate achievement is ahead of our initial projections. We will provide year-over-year comparable data as it becomes available.Rent Collection UpdateWe measure residential rent collection as the dollar value of payments received as a percentage of all residential amounts owed. In the third quarter, residents paid, on a current basis, 98.1% of all residential revenue billed during the quarter. The remaining 1.9% of revenue was treated as bad debt. Offsetting this bad debt was $1.1 million of government assistance payments, reducing our bad debt percentage by 80 basis points. The result was net bad debt expense of 1.1% of third quarter residential revenues.Outside of California, 99.1% of our residents are current, leaving approximately 100 residents where eviction notices have been filed, but the eviction process is not complete due to a slowed cycle time. Previously, in these locales, an eviction took between 45 and 90 days to complete. Today, the eviction timeline is extended and less predictable, resulting in greater amounts of unpaid rent and increased bad debt. We estimate that the prolonged timeline increased our third quarter bad debt by approximately 100 basis points.In California, our ability to pursue remedies for unpaid rent now has fewer restrictions, though protections and moratoriums continue to prevent normal pursuit of delinquent balances. This has allowed approximately 300 California residents, about 3.5% of the total, to become delinquent by two or more months. Of the 300 California residents with multiple months of past due balances, approximately 175 are currently in the eviction process. The remaining 125 residents have continuing protections, that for now are scheduled to expire in February 2023.As of September 30, 2022, our proportionate share of gross residential accounts receivable was $8.6 million. After consideration of tenant security deposits and reserves for uncollectible amounts, our net exposure is $0.2 million, an amount expected to be collected during the fourth quarter of 2022.Portfolio ManagementOur portfolio of apartment communities is diversified across primarily ""A"" and ""B"" price points, averaging ""B/B+"" in quality, and also across eight core markets in the United States. In the past two years, AIR has recycled approximately $5.4 billion, or 40%, of its gross asset value as part of and since the Separation, property sales, and joint ventures, all during a period of attractive pricing for multi-family properties, using the proceeds to simplify its business, reduce leverage, and improve the quality and expected profitability of its real estate portfolio.We have improved AIR's portfolio through reducing our allocation to New York City and Chicago markets with regulatory risk, and reallocating capital into higher growth submarkets, such as Miami-Dade and Broward counties, now 19% of AIR GAV, in markets with limited REIT competition.AimcoAIRQ4 2019 or 2019AQ3 2022ChangeResidentsAverage Household Income$165,000$251,00052%Median Household Income$116,000$170,00047%CSAT Score (out of 5)4.304.33 (2021)0.03Kingsley Index*4.094.05(0.04)PortfolioProperties12480(35%)Apartment Homes32,59823,499(28%)Average Revenue per Apartment Home2,272$2,71119%Redevelopment and Development ($M)$230$–($230)Mezzanine Investments ($M)$280$–($280)Low G&amp;ANet G&amp;A as % of GAV36 bps (per GSA)&lt;15 bps (at AIR Target)-21 bpsBalance SheetNet Leverage / EBITDAre7.6x5.9x(1.7x)Refunding: Next 3-Years (% Total Debt)23%10%(13%)Repricing: Next 3-Years (% Total Debt)23%10%(13%)Unencumbered Properties ($B)$2.4$8.3$5.9* AIR named Kingsley Elite Five in 2022, #2 among all operators and #1 for public REITs.AIR uses ""paired trades"" to fund acquisitions, basing our cost of capital on the anticipated unlevered internal rates of return (""IRR"") of the communities or joint venture interests sold. We require a ""spread"" or accretion of an unlevered IRR at least 200 basis points higher on the communities purchased. This excess return is driven in part by what we call the AIR Edge, the cumulative result of our focus on resident selection, satisfaction, and retention, as well as relentless innovation in delivering best-in-class property management.In the past two years, we have acquired $1.4 billion, or 14% of GAV, of properties new to the AIR operating platform. New purchases will increase to 17% of GAV with the anticipated acquisition in early next year of Southgate Towers in Miami Beach. (Please see below for further information regarding this acquisition.)We estimate real estate values declined by approximately 10% during 2022, the result of approximately 85 basis points of NOI cap rate expansion, about half offset by strong NOI growth. As a paired trade investor, AIR is agnostic as to market changes insofar as it buys and sells properties in the same market conditions, and is focused on gaining an accretive ""spread"". As market conditions change, AIR adjusts its target returns and spreads to reflect its new cost of capital. Our ""paired trade"" approach is intended to ensure that new acquisitions are accretive to earnings in the near-term, and will generate attractive spreads to IRRs in the long-term.TransactionsAcquisitionsAs previously announced, we acquired The District at Flagler Village in Fort Lauderdale, FL for $173 million in the third quarter. The property has 350 apartment homes and was newly constructed in 2021. It sits in the affluent and growing Flagler Village neighborhood with access to the Brightline train station. Year-to-date, we have acquired $640 million of properties new to the AIR platform.Additionally, and as previously announced, we canceled existing master leases at four properties owned by AIR and previously leased to Aimco for purpose of their development. As part of the cancellation, AIR paid $200 million to Aimco for the added improvements. The four properties include 865 apartment homes with average revenue per apartment home of $3,669 and are located in the South Beach neighborhood of Miami Beach, FL, Kendall Square in Cambridge, MA, the Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, CO, and Redwood City, CA.In aggregate, we expect a NOI yield in 2023 of mid 4%s and a long-term unlevered IRR of approximately 9%.During the quarter, we also went under contract with a non-refundable deposit to acquire Southgate Towers, located in the South Beach neighborhood of Miami Beach with 495 apartment homes for $298 million. The acquisition is expected to close in early January 2023. We expect unlevered IRRs greater than 10% and at a spread of more than 200 basis points to the properties sold to fund its acquisition.DispositionsWe had no dispositions in the third quarter. We anticipate selling six properties located in the New England area in November for a gross sales price of approximately $500 million, representing a trailing twelve-month NOI cap rate of 4.4%. These have been classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2022.Capital Allocation – Share RepurchasesDuring the third quarter, AIR repurchased 1.2 million shares for $47 million, at an average price of $39.07 per share. Subsequent to quarter end and through November 2, 2022 we have purchased an additional 3.1 million shares for $115 million. In aggregate, we have repurchased 7.2 million shares during 2022 at an average price of $39.96. We are authorized by the AIR Board of Directors to repurchase an additional $213 million of shares. We consider share buybacks as part of a balanced investment program.Balance SheetWe seek to increase financial returns by using leverage with appropriate caution. We limit risk through our balance sheet structure, employing low leverage and primarily long-dated debt. We target a Net Leverage to EBITDAre ratio between 5.0x and 6.0x and anticipate the actual ratio will vary based on the timing of transactions. We maintain financial flexibility through ample unused and available credit, holding properties with substantial value unencumbered by property debt, maintaining an investment grade rating, and using partners’ capital when it enhances financial returns or reduces investment risk. We seek to minimize refunding and repricing risk.Components of LeverageOur leverage includes our share of long-term, non-recourse property debt encumbering our apartment communities, together with outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility, our term loans, unsecured notes payable, and preferred equity.SEPTEMBER 30, 2022($ in millions)*AmountWeighted-Avg.Maturity (Yrs.)Weighted-Avg.Term Before Repricing (Yrs.)Fixed rate loans payable$1,4998.79.2Floating rate loans payable**1383.34.0AIR share of long-term, non-recourse property debt1,6378.28.6Term loans8003.34.7Unsecured notes payable4007.77.7Outstanding borrowings on revolving credit facility4793.53.5Preferred equity***819.89.8Total Leverage$3,3976.46.9Cash and restricted cash(100)Net Leverage$3,298Leverage reduction funded by anticipated November 2022 property sales(460)Net Leverage, Pro forma for anticipated November 2022 sales$2,838Floating rate leverage not subject to interest rate caps and excluding borrowings on the revolving credit facility3%Net Leverage to Adjusted EBITDAre, Pro forma foranticipated November sales5.9x* Amounts are presented on a rounded basis and the sum of the individual amounts may not foot; please refer to Supplemental Schedule 5.** Includes one loan with an interest rate cap at 5.35% and a second floating rate loan that is expected to be refinanced during the fourth quarter.*** AIR’s Preferred equity is perpetual in nature; however, for illustrative purposes, we have computed the weighted-average maturity of our preferred OP Units assuming a 10-year maturity, and of our preferred stock assuming it is called at the expiration of its no-call period.As of September 30, 2022, about $170 million of AIR’s debt matures before 2025 and it is expected to be refunded before year end with $55 million at 4.9%, $14 million repaid and the remainder at a fixed rate to be determined. Once completed, AIR will have no debt maturing before the second quarter of 2025.AIR anticipates using the net proceeds from the November property sales discussed above to reduce borrowings on its revolving credit facility.Pro forma the completion of these refinancing activities, and exclusive of any remaining borrowings under its revolving credit facility, AIR’s floating rate debt exposure is anticipated to be $79 million. This debt has is subject to an interest rate cap at an effective rate of 5.35%.LiquidityWe use our revolving credit facility for working capital, other short-term purposes, and to secure letters of credit. At September 30, 2022, our share of cash and restricted cash, excluding amounts related to tenant security deposits, was $100 million and we had the capacity to borrow up to $510 million on our revolving credit facility, bringing total liquidity to $610 million. Liquidity is expected to increase by approximately $460 million with the closing of the November property sales.We manage our financial flexibility by maintaining an investment grade rating from S&amp;P and holding communities that are unencumbered by property debt. As of September 30, 2022, we held unencumbered apartment communities with an estimated fair market value of approximately $8.3 billion, almost triple the amount as of December 31, 2020.As previously announced, AIR is seeking an investment-grade Issuer Credit Rating from Moody’s and we anticipate receiving our rating during the fourth quarter.Dividend and Equity Capital MarketsOn November 1, 2022, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.45 per share of Common Stock. This amount is payable on November 30, 2022, to stockholders of record on November 18, 2022. On an annualized basis, the dividend represents $1.80 per share, reflecting a dividend yield of approximately 4.7% based on AIR's closing share price on Tuesday, November 1, 2022. In setting AIR's 2022 dividend, our Board of Directors targeted a dividend level of approximately 75% of full year FFO per share.The after-tax dividend will benefit from AIR's refreshed tax basis. Two-thirds of the 2021 dividend was a tax-free return of capital while the remaining one-third was taxable at capital gain rates. In the same year, approximately 60% of peer dividends were taxed at ordinary income rates, with the remaining 40% taxed at capital gain rates.In 2022, we currently project a majority of our dividend will be taxable at capital gain rates, with the remainder taxable at ordinary income rates. We believe the tax characteristics of our dividend makes our stock more attractive to taxable investors, such as foreign investors, taxable individuals, and corporations by comparison to peer shares whose dividends are taxed at higher rates. For example, if AIR's 2022 dividend is characterized as 50% capital gains and 50% as ordinary income and peer 2022 dividends are characterized consistently with 2021, AIR's estimated after tax dividend would be approximately 35% higher than peer average.Corporate Governance and Responsibility UpdateDuring the quarter, AIR engaged with holders of approximately 70% of outstanding common shares, which included the participation of multiple Board members alongside senior management, in a series of lunches, dinners, video meetings, and calls. Numerous topics were discussed such as governance, investment strategy, operations, and corporate responsibility, including CEO succession planning and matters related to Environmental, Social, and Governance (""ESG""). Board members have also participated in several industry conferences and private meetings throughout the year. AIR's Board is highly proactive and welcomes investor feedback to ensure stockholder perspectives are well heard in Board deliberations.AIR launched new corporate responsibility webpages during the quarter to highlight our commitments to ESG, and published corporate responsibility goals consistent with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. AIR also launched an inaugural materiality assessment and surveyed investors, its Board of Directors, teammates, vendors, and community partners to identify which topics they consider most material to the Company. Subsequent to quarter end, AIR published its 2021-2022 Corporate Responsibility Report, which demonstrates AIR's commitment to being an outstanding corporate citizen, and reinforces its dedication to ESG goal setting and reporting on progress through transparent, data-driven disclosures consistent with the Sustainability Accounting and Standards Board (""SASB"").AIR has made progress on its goals to reduce the Company's environmental impact by 2025, which include a 15% energy use reduction, 10% water usage reduction, and 15% greenhouse gas reduction, all by 2025. This is in addition to more than a decade of investment in clean energy, energy efficiency and water conservation, including $7.9 million invested in energy conservation between 2019 and 2021.AIR recently received its first public GRESB score of 78, which included an ""A"" grade for both ESG public disclosure and alignment with the Task Force for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (""TCFD""). AIR received a ""Green Star"" from GRESB for overall Management and Performance in 2021, a perfect social responsibility score, and a near-perfect corporate governance score.2022 OutlookAIR's midpoint of FFO per share of $2.41 remains unchanged. Similarly, our expectations for run-rate FFO are unchanged at $2.19 per share. AIR expects full-year Pro forma FFO between $2.39 and $2.43 per share.The following tables compare our 2021 FFO results to our full-year 2022 FFO expectations, at the midpoint:2021 FFO per share$2.14Growth in Same Store NOI0.32Contribution from lower leverage and acquisitions, net of related sales dilution(0.02)Change in interest rates(0.03)Change in contribution from Aimco note prepayment0.05Reacquisition of properties previously leased to Aimco(0.02)Other(0.03)2022 FFO per share at the midpoint$2.41Expectation of Pro forma Run Rate2021 FFO per share$2.14Less: Interest income on Aimco note, net of borrowing costs(0.12)2021 FFO per share before Aimco note contribution$2.02Growth in Same Store NOI0.32Net change in leverage, acquisitions and contribution from Aimco note prepayment...]"

Total revenues of $547.7 million came marginally ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $547.1 million and improved 7.6% year over year.Subscription revenues rose during the quarter due to continued progress in bundle offerings. While digital advertising revenues increased, print advertising revenues showcased a decline from the year-ago period. The New York Times Company is gradually heading toward its goal of 15 million subscribers by the end of 2027.A Rise in Subscription RevenuesSubscription revenues of $382.7 million grew 11.7% year over year. The upside was primarily due to an increase in the number of subscribers to the company’s digital-only products, the benefits of subscriptions graduating to higher prices from introductory promotional pricing and the inclusion of subscription revenues from The Athletic.Subscription revenues from digital-only products jumped 22.8% to $243.9 million. However, print subscription revenues fell 3.6% to $138.8 million due to lower domestic home delivery revenues that declined 3.3%.The company ended the quarter with roughly 9.33 million paid subscribers, with about 10.75 million paid subscriptions across its print and digital products. Of the 9.33 million subscribers, approximately 8.59 million were paid digital-only subscribers, with roughly 10.02 million paid digital-only subscriptions. There was a net increase of 180,000 digital-only subscribers and 210,000 digital-only subscriptions compared with the preceding quarter.Management envisions total fourth-quarter subscription revenues to increase about 17-20%, with digital-only subscription revenues anticipated to surge approximately 30-33%.The New York Times Company Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseThe New York Times Company Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseThe New York Times Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | The New York Times Company QuoteStory continuesA Look at Advertising RevenuesTotal advertising revenues of $110.5 million witnessed a marginal decline of 0.4% from the prior-year period.Print advertising revenues declined 8.5% to $40.2 million in the quarter under review. The metric decreased mainly in the advocacy and media categories and was hurt by macroeconomic factors.Meanwhile, digital advertising revenues advanced 4.9% to $70.3 million. This year-over-year increase was due to higher direct-sold advertising at The New York Times Group and the addition of advertising revenues from The Athletic, which helped mitigate lower revenues from fewer programmatic advertising impressions and pressure from the macroeconomic environment.For the fourth quarter, The New York Times Company expects both digital advertising revenues and total advertising revenues to decline in the mid-single digits.Other HighlightsWe note that other revenues fell 1.9% year over year to $54.5 million during the quarter under review as a result of lower licensing revenues, partly offset by higher Wirecutter affiliate and live event revenues. For the final quarter, The New York Times Company anticipates a low-single-digit increase in other revenues.Adjusted operating costs rose 7.8% to $478.7 million during the quarter. Management anticipates adjusted operating costs to increase approximately 7-9% in the fourth quarter.The total adjusted operating profit increased 6% to $69 million during the quarter under review as higher digital subscription revenues at The New York Times Group segment more than offset operating losses at The Athletic.Meredith Kopit Levien, the president and CEO, said, “With three quarters of the year behind us, we are improving our outlook for full-year 2022 results and expect adjusted operating profit between $320 and $330 million, even with the dilution from our acquisition of The Athletic, which is on the high-end of the full year guidance range we provided in February.”Segment DetailsThe New York Times Group revenues increased 2.8% year over year to $523.6 million. Subscription revenues rose 5.4% to $361 million due to growth in subscription revenues from digital-only products. Advertising revenues fell 2.5% to $108.1 million, stemming from soft print advertising revenues.The adjusted operating profit jumped 20.7% to $78.6 million. This can be attributed to higher digital-only subscription revenues.Revenues totaled $24.1 million in The Athletic segment, primarily from subscription revenues. The adjusted operating loss amounted to $9.6 million.Management expects fourth-quarter total subscription revenues to increase 10-13% at The New York Times Group and foresees a 6-8 percentage point contribution from The Athletic to consolidated results. It expects digital-only subscription revenues to increase about 20% at The New York Times Group and envisions a 10-13 percentage point contribution from The Athletic to consolidated results.The New York Times Company expects both digital advertising revenues and total advertising revenues to decline 10% at The New York Times Group.Financial AspectsThe New York Times Company ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of about $468.6 million, reflecting a decrease of $605.8 million from $1.07 billion as of Dec 26, 2021.

WWE posted third-quarter 2022 results, wherein the top and bottom lines not only beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but also increased year over year. The upbeat performance can be attributed to growth in the Media segment and a shift in the timing of revenues related to certain licensing agreements.Premium live events, such as Money in the Bank, SummerSlam and Extreme Rules, witnessed remarkable viewership. Clash at the Castle also witnessed stellar viewership. These events, coupled with solid ratings for flagship programs, Raw and SmackDown, continued to expand the brand reach and enhance the content value.WWE also announced a multi-year deal with its long-standing partner, the Foxtel Group, to expand content distribution in Australia. It also announced the creation of NXT Europe, which is slated to be launched next year, to expand the NXT brand internationally.Q3 Performance InsightThis Stamford, CT-based company reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of 65 cents a share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 50 cents. The quarterly earnings increased significantly from the 52 cents a share reported in the prior-year quarter.WWE’s revenues of $304.6 million came ahead of the consensus estimate of $285.7 million and surged 19% year over year, driven primarily by a jump in core content rights fees for flagship programs and the monetization of third-party original programming. Higher consumer product licensing revenues and international ticket sales also contributed to the top line.World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.

Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseWorld Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. QuoteA Look at MarginsWWE’s operating income of $58.9 million declined 8% year over year due to higher operating expenses on account of costs associated with the creation of content and expenses related to the Special Committee investigation.

However, the adjusted operating income came in at $76.6 million, up from $64 million in the prior-year quarter.Adjusted OIBDA came in at $91.2 million, up 17% year over year. The adjusted OIBDA margin remained flat at 30%.    Management foresees fourth-quarter adjusted OIBDA between $83 million and $90 million compared with $94.2 million reported in the year-ago period. The guidance indicates revenue growth, driven by an expected increase in media rights fees for premium live events as well as an expected increase in the monetization of third-party original programming and revenues from the staging of a large-scale international event. Management expects higher operating expenses in the final quarter.Considering the stellar performance in the first nine months of the financial year, management now expects 2022 adjusted OIBDA to be at the upper end of the earlier projected range of $370-$385 million. The upbeat guidance suggests a full live event touring schedule, including large-scale international events, and the increased monetization of third-party original programming.

WWE reported adjusted OIBDA of $324.1 million in 2021.Story continuesSegment DetailsMedia Division: Revenues in the Media division went up 15% to $233 million.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, go to Growth Stock Portfolio: 5 Stock Picks By Hedge Funds. Growth fund managers, Wall Street experts, and even small firms have been fairly optimistic in the face of macro challenges which are piling up one after another, ranging from persistent inflation and rising rates to virus restrictions and geopolitical unrest disrupting supply chains and energy provision globally. Investors acknowledge these headwinds, but with the November Fed meeting and Q3 2022 corporate earnings now on the table, there is some relief that the largest surprises are out of the way, which leaves stocks attractively valued. Eric Schoenstein, chief investment officer at Jensen Investment Management, who owns positions in premier tech firms like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), told Bloomberg on November 3: “We’re comfortable looking through the current headwinds and volatility, and we’re comfortable with our conclusion that these are very strong businesses that are going through a bit of a reset in expectations.” Big tech remains largely favored by Wall Street analysts, retail traders, and institutional investors alike. Firms like Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon received Buy ratings from at least 70% of Wall Street experts. As per Vanda Research, retail investors are boosting their equity investments as well. Bloomberg cited Vanda senior vice president Marco Iachini on November 3, who said: “The selloff in mega caps was seen as a buy-the-dip opportunity rather than a capitulation moment.”Our Methodology We selected the following growth stocks based on their popularity among elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022. We have also mentioned the latest analyst coverage, underlying business fundamentals, and the P/E ratios as of November 3. Stocks with a P/E ratio of more than 30 were selected for this list. Story continuesGrowth Stock Portfolio: 12 Stock Picks By Hedge FundsPhoto by Ruben Sukatendel on UnsplashGrowth Stock Portfolio: Stock Picks By Hedge Funds12. Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 80P/E Ratio as of November 3: 36.35Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) is a Washington-based online travel company that operates through Brand Expedia, Vrbo, Classic Vacations, Expedia Cruise, Expedia Partner Solutions, Trivago, and Expedia Group Media brands. Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) is one of the premier picks of elite hedge funds for a growth stock portfolio. On October 28, Truist analyst Naved Khan maintained a Buy rating on Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $175 from $185 part of a broader research note on Online Travel names. The group's Q3 results should be ""healthy"" amid resilient demand and positive traffic patterns. Commentary from Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) on strength in Travel ad spend also supports this view, the analyst wrote in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 80 hedge funds were long Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) at the end of June 2022, compared to 88 funds in the last quarter. Like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), elite hedge funds are largely bullish on Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE). Here is what Artisan Partners specifically said about Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) shares declined 1% during the quarter. Part of this was just the shares finding a bottom after a significant decline in the prior quarter. The business continues to perform well. The core business has largely recovered from the pandemic, with lodging revenues now 9% higher than 2019 levels. The overall travel environment has remained strong, but the big question is whether inflationary pressure on consumer discretionary spending will render the recovery short lived. Time will tell. In the meantime, the business is performing well, and the structural improvements in Expedia’s cost structure made during the pandemic are becoming visible. We estimate the shares are trading at ~10X normalized earnings, which remains attractive.”11. Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 81P/E Ratio as of November 3: 4,323.69Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) provides a cloud-based monitoring and analytics platform for web developers and business users in North America and internationally. On November 3, the company posted market-beating Q3 results, and said that it expects revenue for full-year 2022 between $1.650 billion and $1.654 billion, versus a consensus of $1.63 billion. The company also initiated upbeat Q4 guidance. It is one of the best candidates for a growth stock portfolio. On November 2, Macquarie analyst Frederick Havemeyer initiated coverage of Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) with a Neutral rating and an $85 price target. The rating represents a cautious stance on short-term macro headwinds, the analyst told investors in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 81 hedge funds were bullish on Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) at the end of June 2022, compared to 82 funds in the prior quarter. Henry Ellenbogen’s Durable Capital Partners is the leading position holder in the company, with 3.14 million shares worth $299.5 million. Here is what Baron Global Advantage Fund has to say about Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Another example is Datadog, the leading infrastructure monitoring, application performance monitoring and log management software platform. Datadog’s stock declined 15% during the quarter, despite reporting sparkling operational results, with revenues accelerating to a growth rate of 84% year-over-year with 33% free cash flow margins, while guiding for 2022 significantly above expectations. Datadog added 4,600 new customers in the quarter, while existing customers continued to increase their spending on Datadog products at a rapid pace with the number of customers using four or more products increasing to 33% from 22% last year. While Datadog’s stock was down, its intrinsic value has undoubtedly increased. This is enabled by rapid innovation (Datadog released 13 new products in 2021) into a market that is benefiting from the secular growth in cloud, digital transformation, and the explosion in complexity as the number of vendors, diversity of technologies and related infrastructure continued to expand.”10. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84P/E Ratio as of November 3: 42.98NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), an American multinational semiconductor firm, is one of the top picks of the smart money for a growth stock portfolio. On October 18, Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) announced that they were expanding their current partnership in an effort to advance artificial intelligence adoption in the Oracle enterprise. According to the NVIDIA CEO, the deal would ""put NVIDIA AI within easy reach for thousands of companies.""On October 25, Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill reiterated a Buy rating on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) but trimmed the firm's price target on the shares to $155 from $170 as part of a broader research note on Semiconductors and Semiconductor Equipment. Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management held a significant position in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) at the end of June 2022, comprising 7.6 million shares worth $1.15 billion. Here is what Baron Funds specifically said about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a fabless semiconductor company and a leader in gaming and accelerated computing. NVIDIA is powering the growth of AI from the data center to the edge. Shares detracted due to inventory right sizing in NVIDIA’s gaming segment coupled with the broader market sell-off in growth stocks. Given NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, we believe the company can sustain its growth trajectory. See further discussion of NVIDIA in the top net purchases section below.During the third quarter, we took advantage of its stock sell-off to add to NVIDIA Corporation, a fabless semiconductor mega cap that is a global leader in gaming cards and accelerated computing hardware and software. The sell-off was driven by a near-term inventory correction in gaming as a result of a COVID-related pull forward in demand as well as the shift in the Ethereum cryptocurrency from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Additionally, investors are concerned over the potential slowdown in data center revenues as a result of a weaker macroeconomic environment as well as the recently announced limitations on semiconductor shipments to China. Despite the near-term uncertainty, we believe that NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, would enable the company to benefit from durable growth for years to come and therefore view the stock price where we added shares as a compelling value for long-term investors. With demand for computing power doubling every one to two years, and Moore’s Law slowing down, there is more need for computing than ever. At the same time, “near free” supply growth (that was possible thanks to Moore’s Law) has slowed dramatically. NVIDIA’s accelerated architecture, with parallel computing at scale, answers that need.”9. Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 93P/E Ratio as of November 3: 50.63Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), an American travel technology firm, is one of the firms backed by elite investors for a growth stock portfolio. In Q2 2022, the company reported earnings for the third quarter of 2022. Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) posted a Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $53.03 and a revenue of $6.05 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $3.18 and $130 million, respectively. Gross travel bookings, net of cancellations, were $32.1 billion. This represents an increase of 36% year-over-year. Deutsche Bank analyst Lee Horowitz on November 3 raised the price target on Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) to $2,370 from $2.280 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. The company's Q3 results significantly topped Street expectations, showcasing the resilience of travel recovery across all global regions as well as Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG)’s ability to gain higher share, the analyst told investors in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 93 hedge funds were bullish on Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 99 funds in the prior quarter. Harris Associates is a significant position holder in the company, with 616,383 shares worth more than $1 billion. Here is what RiverPark Large Growth Fund has to say about Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We also bought back a small position in Booking Holdings during the quarter. Booking is the world’s leader in online travel, operating in 200 countries with brands including Booking.com, priceline.com, agoda.com, Kayak, Rentalcars.com and OpenTable. The company has been a dominant on-line travel agency for more than a decade with a high margin business model (40% EBITDA margin for 2019 and 28% for 2021) that requires limited capital expenditures, typically less than 3% of revenue, producing $4.5 billion free cash flow for 2019 and $2.5 billion for 2021 (due to the vast COVID disruption). The company has used its free cash flow for episodic acquisitions as well as to return cash to shareholders. BKNG is well positioned in travel as the largest player in online lodging bookings and the second largest player in alternative accommodations. Like all travel companies, Booking was hit hard by the pandemic, but with its high international exposure, we expect the company’s recovery to be equally strong as travel returns.”8. T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 96P/E Ratio as of November 3: 121.17T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) is an American company providing mobile communications services such as voice, messaging, and data to customers in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands. Although T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) missed revenue estimates in Q3, the company reassured investors about subscriber strength and posted a positive outlook for full-year 2022. T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) is one of the top contenders for a growth stock portfolio. On October 28, Cowen analyst Paul Gallant lifted the price target on T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) to $201 from $187 and reiterated an Outperform rating on the shares following the robust Q3 results. According to the second quarter database of Insider Monkey, 96 hedge funds held stakes worth $6.85 billion in T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS), compared to 91 funds in the last quarter worth $7.2 billion. In its Q4 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments shared its stance on T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS):“As mentioned, the communication services sector has come under some pressure, and irrational pricing competition has negatively impacted wireless industry growth and profitability of late, weighing on T-Mobile. Faced with these headwinds, and with pressure from other wireless carriers and cable companies that could cause the company to cede share in subscriber growth in 2022, we exited our position in the fourth quarter.”7. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 97P/E Ratio as of November 3: 46.54PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), an American multinational payments technology firm, is one of the leading picks of elite investors for a growth stock portfolio. On October 25, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock climbed as e-commerce giant Amazon authorized some of its customers to use PayPal's Venmo at checkout during the holiday shopping season. Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette on October 26 maintained an Overweight rating and a $134 price target on PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) shares. Although the analyst acknowledged that the Amazon-Venmo deal will have an immaterial impact on PayPal’s financials, he views the roll-out as a significant catalyst as it can introduce Venmo to other merchants and boost the overall acceptance network, in addition to improving habituation for Venmo users.According to Insider Monkey’s data, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) was part of 97 hedge fund portfolios at the end of the second quarter of 2022, compared to 100 in the last quarter. Terry Smith’s Fundsmith LLP is a significant position holder in the company, with 9.65 million shares worth $674 million. Here is what RiverPark Large Growth Fund has to say about PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“PayPal, announced better-than-expected 2Q results, positive guidance (including more than $1.3 billion of 2023 cost savings leading to operating margin expansion), a $15 billion stock repurchase program, and the appointment of Blake Jorgensen as CFO, who was previously the well-regarded CFO at Electronic Arts. The company reported 9% revenue growth, in-line with guidance, and $0.93 EPS, exceeding guidance due to robust operating leverage. Management narrowed its 2022 revenue guidance from 11%-13% growth to about 11% growth due to the macro environment but raised its EPS guidance due to greater operating margin leverage and share buybacks. The stock also reacted to the news that activist investor Elliott Management had taken a stake in the company. PYPL operates at significantly lower margins than its payment competitors Visa and Mastercard, and sources suggest that Elliott intends, among other things, to push for the company to improve its margins and drive higher cash flow growth in the near term.PayPal provides direct exposure to the secular growth in ecommerce-driven digital payments as it is the most accepted digital wallet on-line. More than 3/4 of the 1,500 largest online retailers across North America and Europe accept PayPal, which is almost triple the acceptance of Apple Pay, the number two digital wallet. PayPal is also a key beneficiary of the current dramatic shift in consumer buying habits brought on by the pandemic, as well as the relatively newer consumer-to-consumer payment trends through its Venmo peer-to-peer (P2P) payment service. With a 2Q non-GAAP operating margin of 19%, PYPL also has significant margin expansion potential given that competitors Adyen, Visa and Mastercard have 50%-65% operating margins. We believe the combination of the secular growth of eCommerce and P2P payments, along with expanding operating leverage and the strategic use of the company’s significant and growing cash balance should fuel a mid-20% earnings growth rate over the next five years. This, to us, presents an excellent risk/reward profile given that PYPL trades at a modest premium to the market multiple and a 6% 2023 FCF yield.”6. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99P/E Ratio as of November 3: 394.19ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a California-based provider of cloud computing solutions for enterprises worldwide. The company topped analyst estimates with its third quarter earnings. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) reiterated the earlier FY22 operating margin guidance of 25%, while also absorbing an incremental 1% impact from forex headwinds. The revenue grew 21.2% year-over-year to $1.83 billion but fell short of Wall Street consensus. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) reported adjusted earnings of $1.96 per share, beating estimates by $0.11. On November 2, Macquarie analyst Sarah Hindlian-Bowler assumed coverage of ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) with an Outperform rating and a $500 price target. The analyst expects the company to continue to ""deliver a best-in-class platform for making work better.""According to Insider Monkey’s data, 99 hedge funds were long ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) at the end of June 2022, compared to 90 funds in the preceding quarter. Stephen Mandel’s Lone Pine Capital is one of the leading position holders of the company, with 1.3 million shares worth $614.5 million. In addition to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is one of the top stock picks of elite hedge funds. Here is what RiverPark Large Growth Fund has to say about ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“ServiceNow: Despite a strong beat and raise quarter and a positive analyst day where management increased its long-term subscription revenue and operating margin targets, NOW was a top detractor for the quarter as management noted the macro environment created some near-term deal slippage and longer sales cycles. For its 2Q22, the company reported 25% subscription revenue growth (including a 500-basis point currency headwind) and lowered full year subscription revenue guidance to 24% from 26%, on a 400-basis point currency headwind. Still the company reiterated its ambitious long-term targets from its May analyst day, at which the company raised its F24 subscription revenue target by $1 billion to $11 billion (up almost 60% from the $7 billion in revenue expected for 2022), all through organic growth, and increased its operating margin target to 27% (up from its 25% target for 2022).ServiceNow is a best-of-breed provider of both IT Service Management (ITSM) and IT Operations Management (ITOM) solutions to enterprise customers. The company’s products serve mainly its clients’ internal employee base with a current focus on automating the process of IT deployment, configuration and service and management of IT assets across an organization. Both its ITSM and ITOM solutions are delivered as a software-as-a-service (SaaS) and are leading solutions in growing markets, driven by the secular trend of enterprises transitioning all aspects of their business and operations to the cloud. As the company maintains and adds customers, upsells them, and expands into adjacent markets, we believe NOW should sustain a strong long-term revenue and FCF growth trajectory.” Click to continue reading and see Growth Stock Portfolio: 5 Stock Picks By Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:Harvard University's Stock Portfolio11 Best Future Food Stocks To Buy11 Best Midcap Dividend Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Dividend Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks By Hedge Funds. High bond yields have been a positive addition to the portfolios of income investors after years of nominal fixed-income returns. However, dividend stocks still provide essential balance and additional income to an asset portfolio, and they help combat the high inflation effectively. Jenny Harrington, CEO of Gilman Hill Asset Management, told Barron’s on October 29:“You need capital appreciation of the share price and growth of the dividend in an inflationary environment.”Dividend stocks have comparatively outperformed in the market selloff this year. Dividend-paying entities in the S&amp;P 500 have dropped 11%, compared to the 19% decline in the S&amp;P 500 benchmark and the 23% drop in non-dividend stocks so far this year. Income stocks are attractive amid market volatility since they protect investors against plummeting share prices. Stephanie Link, the chief investment strategist and portfolio manager at Hightower Advisors, advised investors to focus on dividend growth prospects rather than high yields alone. She further said:“If companies are going to continue to increase their dividends, then I feel good about them.”Similarly, David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Advisors, noted that although Treasury yield has risen which means that bond payout is attractive at about 4%, dividend stocks provide the potential for increasing payouts while bond payments remain fixed. Some of the best entities for a dividend stock portfolio include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). Our Methodology We selected the following dividend stocks based on their popularity among elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022. We have also mentioned the latest analyst coverage, underlying business fundamentals, and recent dividend payouts by the companies for additional context for readers. The dividend yields are mentioned as of November 2. Story continuesDividend Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks By Hedge FundsPhoto by Mirza Babic on UnsplashDividend Stock Portfolio: Top Stock Picks By Hedge Funds10. S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84Dividend Yield as of November 2: 1.08%S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is a New York-based provider of credit ratings, benchmarks, data analytics, and workflow solutions in the global capital and commodity markets. The company operates through six divisions – S&amp;P Global Ratings, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, S&amp;P Global Mobility, and S&amp;P Global Engineering Solutions. S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) declared on September 28 a $0.85 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on December 12, to shareholders of record on November 18. As of October 27, S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) has completed $11 billion of its $12 billion accelerated share repurchase program year-to-date, and it expects to launch the remaining $1 billion of the authorized repurchase units in December.Argus analyst John Eade on November 1 maintained a Buy recommendation on S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) but lowered the price target on the shares to $365 from $420. The company has almost concluded a multi-year restructuring and is now focused on its rapidly growing financial businesses, including the lucrative and not very competitive business of rating bonds, the analyst told investors in a research note. The analyst also added that he believes S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) management can pull through the tough inflation and high interest rate environment.According to Insider Monkey’s database, 84 hedge funds were bullish on S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) at the end of June 2022, compared to 97 funds in the prior quarter. Chris Hohn’s TCI Fund Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 8.76 million shares worth nearly $3 billion. In addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is one of the top picks of elite investors for a dividend stock portfolio. Here is what Baron Durable Advantage Fund has to say about S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Another example is S&amp;P Global (NYSE:SPGI), the leading rating agency and data provider, whose stock declined 29.0% year-to-date and 17.5% during the second quarter as a result of growing investor concerns over the slowdown in debt issuance. While debt issuance volumes have seen a dramatic decline – the worst quarterly decline in a decade (down 41% year-over-year in the second quarter based on Goldman Sachs estimates), – and this led management to withdraw its 2022 guidance in early June, we do not believe it would result in a permanent loss of capital.First, ratings represent only about 30% of S&amp;P Global’s total revenues. Second, despite inherent volatility in quarterly or annual issuance, over the long-term issuance volumes follow the trends in levels of debt outstanding, which has compounded in the mid-single digits for many years. Lastly, we believe that S&amp;P Global’s strong competitive positioning will enable it to continue benefiting from pricing power, while taking advantage of secular tailwinds such as the growth in passive and ESG investing, international expansion, and the growing demand for data analytics.”9. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84Dividend Yield as of November 2: 0.12%NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), the American multinational technology and semiconductor firm, is one of the most popular picks of hedge funds for a dividend stock portfolio. At the end of October, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock gained as investors turned their attention towards the semiconductor industry in the midst of the Intel and Mobileye spin-off. On October 24, Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis maintained an Overweight rating on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) but lowered the price target on the shares to $140 from $190. The analyst is ""actively looking for a bottom to get more positive"" on the semiconductor sector and sees it closer in some end markets than others, but still believes ""it is too early to pull the trigger across the board."" According to Insider Monkey’s data, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was part of 84 hedge fund portfolios at the end of June 2022, compared to 102 in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is a significant position holder in the company, with 7.6 million shares worth $1.15 billion.  Here is what Baron Funds specifically said about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a fabless semiconductor company and a leader in gaming and accelerated computing. NVIDIA is powering the growth of AI from the data center to the edge. Shares detracted due to inventory right sizing in NVIDIA’s gaming segment coupled with the broader market sell-off in growth stocks. Given NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, we believe the company can sustain its growth trajectory. See further discussion of NVIDIA in the top net purchases section below.During the third quarter, we took advantage of its stock sell-off to add to NVIDIA Corporation, a fabless semiconductor mega cap that is a global leader in gaming cards and accelerated computing hardware and software. The sell-off was driven by a near-term inventory correction in gaming as a result of a COVID-related pull forward in demand as well as the shift in the Ethereum cryptocurrency from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Additionally, investors are concerned over the potential slowdown in data center revenues as a result of a weaker macroeconomic environment as well as the recently announced limitations on semiconductor shipments to China. Despite the near-term uncertainty, we believe that NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, would enable the company to benefit from durable growth for years to come and therefore view the stock price where we added shares as a compelling value for long-term investors. With demand for computing power doubling every one to two years, and Moore’s Law slowing down, there is more need for computing than ever. At the same time, “near free” supply growth (that was possible thanks to Moore’s Law) has slowed dramatically. NVIDIA’s accelerated architecture, with parallel computing at scale, answers that need.”8. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91Dividend Yield as of November 2: 1.20%UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) operates as a diversified health care company in the United States. The company specializes in health insurance, Medicaid plans, and healthcare programs. On October 14, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) reported a Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $5.79 and a revenue of $80.9 billion, outperforming market estimates by $0.35 and $360 million, respectively. There was a double digit growth at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare segments. The company raised its full-year 2022 net earnings outlook to $20.85 to $21.05 per share and adjusted net earnings to $21.85 to $22.05 per share, versus a consensus of $21.89 and prior view of $21.4 to $21.9. On October 18, Deutsche Bank analyst George Hill raised the price target on UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) to $615 from $569 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. The company reported robust Q3 results as membership growth remains resilient and value-based arrangements continue to expand, the analyst told investors in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 91 hedge funds were long UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) at the end of June 2022, compared to 103 funds in the prior quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the largest position holder in the company, with 3.11 million shares worth $1.60 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Carillon Tower Advisers, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and United Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) reported solid quarterly results and raised 2022 guidance modestly. Additionally, managed care is another industry that is viewed as defensive in the current environment, which helped support UnitedHealth and its peer group.”7. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 93Dividend Yield as of November 2: 0.24%Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is a Massachusetts-based provider of life sciences solutions, analytical instruments, specialty diagnostics, and laboratory products and services worldwide. As per elite hedge funds, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is one of the premier picks for a dividend stock portfolio. On October 31, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) announced that it is acquiring the UK-based diagnostic products maker, The Binding Site, for $2.6 billion from private equity firm Nordic Capital in an all-cash transaction. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) also said that throughout Q4, it expects to execute a $1 billion share buyback program, bringing the total capital spent on buybacks in 2022 to $3 billion.Baird analyst Catherine Ramsey Schulte on November 1 reiterated an Outperform rating on Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) but lowered the price target on the shares to $665 from $695. The analyst noted that Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO)’s Specialty Diagnostics segment typically gets the least investor attention and interest, but she forecasts the deal to be accretive to both overall revenue growth and margins. She also updated her model to factor in the acquisition, Q4 and full-year buyback assumptions, and 2023 forex headwinds.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 93 hedge funds were bullish on Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) at the end of June 2022, compared to 101 funds in the prior quarter. Thomas Steyer’s Farallon Capital is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 1.2 million shares worth $675 million. Here is what Baron Funds specifically said about Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is the world’s largest life sciences tools company. Shares fell due to the rotation out of life sciences tools stocks, driven by concerns about a possible global recession, foreign currency exposure, COVID-related lockdowns in China, and reduced levels of biotechnology funding. We continue to believe Thermo Fisher has a strong long-term growth outlook given a large and growing addressable market coupled with its industry-leading scale, commercial infrastructure, e-commerce platform, supply-chain capabilities, and R&amp;D investment.”6. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99Dividend Yield as of November 2: 2.42%Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is an American multinational company that provides banking and financial products and services. The bank operates through Consumer Banking, Global Wealth &amp; Investment Management, Global Banking, and Global Markets segments. On October 17, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) reported earnings for the third quarter of 2022, announcing earnings per share of $0.81 and a revenue of $24.50 billion, topping market estimates by $0.04 and $1.05 billion, respectively. On October 19, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is distributable on December 30, to shareholders of record on December 2. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) delivers a dividend yield of 2.42% as of November 2. BMO Capital analyst James Fotheringham raised the price target on Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) on October 18 to $42 from $41 but kept a Market Perform rating on the shares. The analyst cited Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)’s ""impressive"" Q3 top-line beat and ""meaningful"" operating leverage as its pre-provision net revenue grew 24% compared to Q2 2022. However, the analyst added that it remains too early to purchase bank stocks, and he believes that Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) stock will struggle until the economic backdrop stabilizes.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 99 funds were bullish on Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) at the end of Q2 2022, with collective stakes worth $36 billion. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with more than 1 billion shares worth $31.4 billion. Like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is one of the premier stocks to consider for a robust dividend stock portfolio. Here is what Artisan Partners specifically said about Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“We made only one new purchase during the quarter, initiating a position in Bank of America (BAC). As one of America’s largest banks, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is second only to JPMorgan Chase (JPM) in size and is probably its closest peer. Both are well-run banks, but compared to JPM, since the GFC, BAC has retired more shares, grown EPS faster and currently has more capital and a lower dividend payout. We are attracted to BAC’s strong capital base, high capital generation capacity, large loan loss reserve, low (~50%) loan/deposit ratio, short duration investment securities book, and low dividend payout that provides financial flexibility. BAC has a less volatile earnings stream than JPM with lower capital market sensitive exposures. Additionally, BAC is rigorously stress tested by the Fed every year in quantitative and qualitative fashion. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which we hold in the portfolio, owns 12% of BAC. He petitioned the Fed to own more than 10%, so he clearly likes it. Bank stocks were strong gainers in 2021 on the prospects of higher rates boosting net interest margins, but the stocks pulled back in the first half of 2022 on economic concerns. We believe BAC has massive scale advantages, should benefit from increasing interest rates, particularly in the 2-year part of the yield curve, and should grow over time with the economy. The economic environment is highly uncertain, but current consensus includes the provision for losses more than doubling and capital markets activity slowing. Against that backdrop, our purchase price equated to about 8.5X our estimates of “mid-cycle” earnings. With leading businesses, a double-digit ROE, a prudent capital return strategy and a strong balance sheet, we believe this entry point offers a solid long-term value.” Click to continue reading and see Dividend Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks By Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:10 Best Infrastructure Stocks To Buy Now12 Best Bank Dividend Stocks To Invest In15 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None.

This raises the likelihood that the central bank will continue raising its benchmark interest rate in the coming months, albeit at a slower pace than in previous months.As rates continue inching higher and inflation slowly decelerates, stocks are likely to remain volatile. But the retreat of the markets seen in 2022 (the worst year for equities since the 2008 financial crisis) has left many large-cap stocks deeply undervalued. This presents an opportunity for investors who can tolerate the near-term ups and downs of the market and keep their eyes fixed on the long-term.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHere are seven seriously undervalued large-cap stocks to buy now.AMZNAmazon$83.55NVDANvidia$143NKENike$122AAPLApple$126COSTCostco$452MSFTMicrosoft$224AXPAmerican Express$145Undervalued Large-Cap Stocks: Amazon (AMZN)An image of an Amazon logo on a buildingSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock is now trading under $85 a share, its most affordable level in more than five years.Following Amazon’s disappointing third-quarter earnings and lowered guidance, AMZN stock is down 50% in the last 12 months. Even a 20-for-1 stock split undertaken at the beginning of June hasn’t helped the share price.Having given up most of the gains it achieved during the pandemic when consumers were forced to shop online, AMZN stock seems to have been abandoned by consumers. Yet analysts say that is a mistake, and the company is poised for a rebound.For its part, Amazon is doing what it can to try to raise its share price, as the company earlier this year announced a $10 billion stock buyback program.Story continuesAmazon also completed its second Prime sales event of the year in mid-October, which should give its fourth-quarter earnings a boost. Further, the company has reduced its staff levels and taken other cost-cutting measures as it tries to adjust to the current economic environment.While Amazon’s price-earnings (P/E) ratio remains a hefty 75 times, it is not that high when one considers the company’s nearly $1 trillion market capitalization or that it generates more than $100 billion of revenue each quarter. Take advantage of the shares’ weakness and buy the dip of AMZN stock.Nvidia (NVDA)Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock.Source: ShutterstockFew large-cap technology stocks have been beaten down as much as semiconductor company Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). NVDA stock has tumbled 50% in the last year to $143. In November 2021, the company’s shares were trading above $300, and that was after a 4-for-1 stock split.The share price has been hurt by mounting fears that the demand for Nvidia’s chips and semiconductors will slow along with the global economy. To be sure, the company’s earnings for the third quarter were a disaster with revenue down 17% year-over-year. The Q3 print didn’t help the share price at all.Nvidia has also lowered its forward guidance multiple times this year. It most recently said that it expects about $6 billion of sales in Q4, lower than the average estimate of $6.09 billion among analysts who cover the company.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has stressed that the company is grappling with a “challenging macro environment.” Still, Nvidia, whose chips are used in everything from supercomputers to artificial intelligence applications, remains a solid, long-term buy.Its P/E ratio is high at 61 times, but that has come down over the last year with the share price. And, unlike many tech stocks, Nvidia pays a dividend that yields 0.11%. It’s not the most generous dividend, but it helps make NVDA one of the more reliable undervalued large-cap stocks to buy.Nike (NKE)Nike (NKE) store in a shopping mall in Penang, Malaysia. robinhood stocksSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.comThe shares of the world’s largest supplier of athletic shoes and apparel have been pummeled over the past year. The stock of Oregon-based Nike (NYSE:NKE) has plunged 27% and now trades at $122 per share. The decline, while no doubt troubling to shareholders, makes NKE stock a screaming buy.A year ago, Nike’s stock was trading at $167 a share. Its big decline has been due largely to the same issues that are vexing companies all over the world: Supply chain problems, excess inventories,  Covid-19 lockdowns in China, and slowing consumer spending.Just before Christmas, Nike reported fiscal second quarter earnings that surpassed the average outlook of the analysts on Wall Street, sending its stock more than 10% higher in a single trading session.The shoemaker announced quarterly earnings per share of 85 cents versus the mean estimate of 64 cents. Its revenue came in at $13.32 billion compared to the $12.57 billion that had been expected.NKE’s price-earnings ratio of 34 is slightly high, but it’s justified given the company’s market-leading position. And NKE stock pays a quarterly dividend that yields 1.1%.

Its share price fell 15% in December alone, bringing its 2022 decline to 30%. The consumer electronics giant’s stock is now trading right around $125.Analysts’ median price target on AAPL stock is currently $175 a share, which is nearly 40% higher than its current level. The shares’ P/E ratio of 20 times is the lowest it has been in years and the stock pays a dividend that yields 0.73%.With Apple, investors also get a company that buys back more of its own stock than any other publicly traded concern. The company most recently announced that its board of directors had greenlit a $90 billion share buyback program.Apple is also increasingly diversified, venturing into new areas ranging from streaming to buy now, pay later. Further, with its iPhones and Mac computers., Apple remains the world’s leading consumer electronics companyAs with many companies, Apple is dealing with issues that include supply chain constraints, wage inflation and slowing consumer spending in the face of rising interest rates. Its iPhone production has also been hurt by Covid-19 lockdowns in China.AAPL stock took it on the chin after the company announced that it was scaling back production of its new iPhone 14 due to the issues in China and weaker consumer demand than forecast. The company’s most recent earnings report was mixed but managed to beat analysts’ average expectations.Apple’s lower share price should make the stock more appealing to value investors.Costco (COST)A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.comThe shares of big-box grocery retailer Costco (NASDAQ:COST) are down 19% over the past 12 months. COST’s 52-week low is $406, well below its current level of $452.  The retailer has managed to recover by demonstrating that its sales remain strong despite high inflation and rising interest rates.The company’s November sales figures were mixed. Costco said its net sales for the period came in at $19.17 billion, up 5.7% year over year. However, the firm’s e-commerce sales fell 10.1% during the period. COST stock declined 3% on the data.However, Costco has retained the loyalty of its customers by announcing that it would not raise its membership fees this year, holding them at $60 for a regular annual membership and $120 for an executive membership.The stock’s  P/E ratio of 35 times looks high at first glance, but investors need to keep in mind that Costco is on track to surpass $200 billion of sales for 2022, making it one of the more impressive undervalued large-cap stocks .The company’s stock pays a dividend that yields 0.79%, but Costco has a history of paying out special, one-time dividends as well.Microsoft (MSFT)Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.comSeattle-based Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a seriously undervalued technology stock. Founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in 1975 and publicly traded since March 1986, Microsoft today is a well-diversified and battle-tested technology company that is involved in everything from computer software and video games to online search and cloud computing.The company is hugely profitable and generates positive cash flow. And its stock has been a consistent winner for shareholders over the years.While MSFT stock is down 30% in the last year, it is up 160% over the past five years and has gained more than 500% over the last decade. Today Microsoft has a market capitalization of $1.67 trillion, a reasonable price-earnings ratio of 24, and is one of the few mega-cap tech stocks that actually pays shareholders a quarterly dividend (Its payout currently yields 1.13%).While the company has not been immune to the economic challenges afflicting the global economy, it remains one of the tech giants best positioned to weather the storm and come out stronger on the other side.Currently trading at $224 a share, MSFT stock is definitely worth buying at its current levels.Undervalued Large-Cap Stocks: American Express (AXP)an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocketSource: ShutterstockThe shares of credit-card giant American Express (NYSE:AXP) are fresh off a 52-week low and currently trading right around $145.

It pays a 1.4% quarterly dividend.With people all over the world traveling and vacationing again, there’s every reason to be bullish on AXP stock and the company’s future earnings.But don’t take our word for it. Consider that American Express is one of legendary investor Warren Buffett’s favorite stocks. The Oracle of Omaha has held his current position in AXP stock for more than 30 years and never sold a single share.Besides its traditional credit card loans, American Express also operates an end-to-end payment system that facilitates transactions between consumers and businesses. Revenue from those transactions is today the company’s biggest source of revenue.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA, MSFT and AAPL.

But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. To wit, the McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) share price has flown 187% in the last three years. How nice for those who held the stock! Also pleasing for shareholders was the 15% gain in the last three months. This could be related to the recent financial results, released recently - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading our company report.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for McKesson While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.McKesson became profitable within the last three years. Given the importance of this milestone, it's not overly surprising that the share price has increased strongly.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that McKesson has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, McKesson's TSR for the last 3 years was 195%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that McKesson has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 75% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 24% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

This compares to earnings of $3.61 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -34.22%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this engine maker would post earnings of $4.37 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.77, delivering a surprise of 9.15%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Cummins , which belongs to the Zacks Automotive - Internal Combustion Engines industry, posted revenues of $7.33 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.39%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $5.97 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Cummins shares have added about 10.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -21.1%.What's Next for Cummins?While Cummins has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Cummins: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future.

In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Automotive - Internal Combustion Engines is currently in the top 35% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.

Trading 44% from its highs, investors are hoping Disney’s report can give DIS stock a much-needed boost.Disney stock had historically been thought of as a mixture of value and growth that could play a stable role in many diversified portfolios. However, Disney’s valuation ballooned during the pandemic on the back of streaming exuberance at a time when its theme parks and movie box office segments were crushed by covid. As Disney continues to work on a post-pandemic rebound, its diverse portfolio will be crucial. Along with amusement parks, Disney is a viable player in the digital streaming space through Disney Plus and has various other television, studio, and production networks including ESPN.

Wall Street will be monitoring the growth of three core areas: Disney Media &amp; Entertainment Distribution (DMED), Parks-Experiences, and Consumer Products.OverviewThe majority of Disney’s revenue is derived from its DMED segment which includes Theatrical and Music distribution, domestic and international channels along with a 50% equity investment in A+E Television Networks, Disney+, Disney+ Hotstar, ESPN+, Hulu and Star+ DTC streaming services, Sales/Licensing of film and television content to third-party television and subscription video-on-demand services.Disney’s DMED segment accounts for about 75% of total revenues. Last quarter, the DMED segment revenue climbed YoY 11% to $14 billion. This helped the company bring in $21.50 billion in total revenue which was up 26% from Q3 2021.DIS blasted its fiscal Q3 earnings expectations by 16% at $1.09 per share, up an impressive 36% from $0.80 the prior year. DIS shares spiked 8% the following day but begin declining throughout the quarter as inflationary concerns took their toll on the stock.Story continuesInvestors will be hoping another strong earnings beat in the company’s Fiscal Q4 release can help the stock get going again and produce another, more sustainable rally. Wall Street will also be looking intuitively to the company’s guidance and outlook as we move further from peak entertainment and travel seasons that boost the company’s Parks and Experiences revenue. Fiscal Q4 Outlook The Zacks Consensus for Disney’s Fiscal Q4 earnings is $0.57 per share, which would represent a 54% increase from Q4 2021. Sales are expected to be up 14% at $21.11 Billion. This appears to reflect that the company is adapting to the challenging operating environment.However, earnings estimates for the period are largely down from $0.85 at the beginning of the quarter. Year over year, DIS earnings are expected to rise 66% and another 32% in FY23 at $5.03 per share. Top line growth is also expected, with sales projected to climb 24% this year and another 10% in FY23 to $92.67 billion. It is important to note that this year and FY23 revenue will surpass Disney’s pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $75.12 billion. Performance &amp; Valuation Year to date, DIS is down -36% to underperform the S&amp;P 500’s -22% and roughly match the Media Conglomerates Market’s -33% with notable competitors Liberty Media FWONK and Paramount Global PARA.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDIS is still up +111% over the last decade to crush its Zacks Subindustry’s +18%. Disney has clearly shown itself to be an industry leader for many years and investors are hoping this continued dominance can help the stock rebound. However, it is noteworthy that Disney Plus is facing increasing competition from Netflix NFLX.After reaching 52-week highs of $179.25 last November, DIS currently trades just under $100 per share. At current levels, DIS has a P/E of 20.1X. This is below its peer group’s 30.1X. Even better, DIS trades at a significant discount to its decade-high of 134.4X and near the median of 19.5X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDisney’s Price to Sales also looks attractive again. After spiking above the broader market’s P/S ratio during the pandemic we can see from the above chart that DIS’s P/S of 2.2X is back nicely below the benchmark’s 3.4X. Investors have historically paid a very reasonable price for every dollar of sales the company makes and this is important to see again.Bottom LineDIS currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and its Media Conglomerates Industry is in the top 26% of over 250 Zacks Industries. Despite the economic downturn, Disney’s revenue is set to surpass its pre-pandemic levels. Patient investors could be rewarded for holding DIS as it trades attractively relative to its past. Plus, the Average Zacks Price Target suggests 43% upside from current levels.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Discovery's (WBD) combination service is coming to market earlier than expected.During the streaming giant's third quarter earnings call, WBD CEO David Zaslav said that the target launch date for the platform has been moved up from summer 2023 to spring 2023, adding that the company will be ""aggressively tackling"" an ad-supported streaming market that now includes Netflix (NFLX) and will soon include Disney (DIS).""We expect a healthy inflection with the launch of our combined service and expanded global footprint,"" Zaslav told investors. ""We've been very hard at work. We can make the service available to consumers around the globe and get the business running on all cylinders.""Management hinted that price hikes are likely to come to the platform in 2023, as well.""By 2023 HBO Max will not have raised its price since launch, which we think is an opportunity,"" noted JB Perrette, president of the company's streaming division.'Elvis' (Source: Warner Bros. Pictures)Zaslav revealed that the company has increased its merger synergy target to $3.5 billion from $3 billion, with an eye on doubling down on its strong intellectual property, content deals, and optionality.""We're leaning in on [content],"" Zaslav said on the call, explaining that WBD has spent more on content than ever before — addressing recent headlines of slashed production budgets, shut down projects, along with the removal of several titles from the HBO Max platform. He went on to say that ""it's taken real courage"" to restructure the company as one unit.The stock sank in after-hours trading, down more than 5% as investors digested the company's third quarter earnings results, which missed expectations across the board.Increased restructuring charges, macroeconomic challenges like foreign exchange headwinds, further subscriber losses in linear television, and a slowdown in advertising continued to pressure profits in the quarter.Story continuesRevenue fell 11% to $9.82 billion while the company also reported a net loss of $2.3 billion after a $3.4 billion loss in the second quarter.And despite ""House of the Dragon's"" record-breaking success, the company added just 2.8 million direct-to-consumer subscribers in the third quarter versus expectations of 3.27 million. Management has guided a long-term target of 130 million paying users by 2025.Profitability continues to remain a top concern for investors as faith in streaming fundamentals wanes. WBD reiterated its 2022 adjusted EBITDA guidance between $9 billion and $9.5 billion, a decline from a previous forecast of $10 billion.Alexandra is a Senior Entertainment and Media Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

369,404ba955-1981-3d5c-8ad2-01ef8e7bd078,DIS,2022-11-04,Endeavor Group (EDR) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/endeavor-group-edr-earnings-expected-140002338.html,1667484002,STORY,"['EDR', 'DIS']","[Endeavor Group (EDR) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 10. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis entertainment, sport and content company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.31 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +93.8%.Revenues are expected to be $1.25 billion, down 9.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 5.32% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Endeavor?For Endeavor, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -47.54%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Endeavor will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Endeavor would post earnings of $0.24 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.32, delivering a surprise of +33.33%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Endeavor doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry, Walt Disney (DIS) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.57 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +54.1%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $21.11 billion, up 13.9% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Disney has been revised 7% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -7.48%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Disney will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Butler Jr., currently president and chief operating officer (COO), to the role of president and chief executive officer as of Dec. 31, 2022. Butler also will join Exelon’s Board of Directors.The company recently promoted Butler and expanded his responsibilities as a step in the company’s leadership succession plans. Crane accelerated his retirement plans to focus on his health after learning in recent days that he will require treatment for significant spinal and hip issues. He will work with Butler through the end of the year on the transition process.Crane has been the company’s CEO and a member of the Board of Directors since 2012.During his tenure, Exelon has been an industry leader in improving the reliability and resilience of the grid, as well as combatting climate change through clean energy generation, safety and operational improvements and customer service. Crane established within Exelon and the industry a focus on workforce development in underserved communities, with particular attention on STEM careers for young women and job training and placement for work-ready adults. He is committed to diversity, equity and inclusion, signing the White House Equal Pay Pledge and supporting DACA. He drove diversity, equity and inclusion at all levels of the company, and leaves in place a talented, experienced and highly diverse senior leadership team. Most recently, he led the separation of Exelon and Constellation, unlocking significant value for both companies’ shareholders.Crane joined Exelon (then ComEd) in 1998 and was named chief nuclear officer in 2004. Crane assumed responsibility for Exelon’s fossil, hydro and renewables facilities, in addition to the nuclear fleet, in 2007.

On behalf of the Exelon Board, we are grateful for Chris’ more than two decades of service to Exelon. We will support Chris and Calvin during this transition period and look forward to working with Calvin as he begins his role as the new president and chief executive officer of Exelon.”Crane completed highly successful mergers with Constellation Energy in 2012 and with Pepco Holdings in 2016 to create the nation’s largest energy company by customer count. Exelon’s utilities serve more than 10 million customers today.

The work we do is absolutely vital for the people we serve and the future of our planet,” said Crane.“I truly regret that health challenges are requiring me to step away, but I have great faith in Calvin and his leadership abilities, as well as the rest of the team.”“Calvin is a man of unquestionable integrity, a talented leader and dedicated to our purpose, our values and ensuring that the benefits of clean energy are shared equitably across all of the communities we serve. While I won’t be at the helm after this year, as Exelon leads the transformation of the energy industry, I know the company and our people are in excellent hands, and I will enjoy watching Exelon’s continued success.”Prior to being promoted to president and COO in October 2022, Butler had served as senior executive vice president and COO since February 2022. He previously served as Exelon Utilities CEO, with oversight of Exelon’s six electric and gas delivery companies, since 2019.“Leading Exelon is a privilege and responsibility that I take very seriously,” said Butler.“Chris is a tremendous leader, mentor and friend. As our world has been undergoing significant change, so too has the energy industry, and Chris has been at the forefront of that evolution. At Exelon, we are uniquely positioned to lead the nation and our industry to a clean energy future that is safe, reliable, affordable and equitable for all.”“I appreciate the Board’s confidence in me and will do everything I can to serve our customers and communities, keep our employees safe and move the energy industry forward.”Butler joined the company in 2008, is a 14-year veteran of Exelon and has more than 28 years of leadership experience in the utilities industry and in regulatory, legislative and public affairs.

To help achieve those goals, CEJA calls on ComEd to file a multi-year grid plan and to file new rates. ComEd today announced its intent to file, along with its grid plan, a four-year rate plan that closely aligns with the state’s goal of long-term investments to support clean energy and decarbonization in Illinois.

""These plans will provide the foundation for a grid that is resilient, flexible, and intelligent to withstand more frequent and severe weather due to climate change and enable technologies like solar, battery storage and fleets of electric vehicles.""These plans will provide the ICC, customers and stakeholders insight and an opportunity to provide input into the delivery service investments and rates required over the period from 2024 through 2027 to support the delivery of clean, reliable and resilient electricity to its customers.ComEd is delivering the highest levels of service in its history, providing families and businesses the reliable and resilient clean energy they need and deserve. In fact, ComEd’s reliability performance for the first nine months of 2022 was highest on record for any year in company history. This strong performance would not be possible if not for smart grid improvements that began in 2011. At the same time, ComEd’s rates are among the lowest in America.

The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Exelon shares have lost about 34.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -21.1%.What's Next for Exelon?While Exelon has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Exelon: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.47 on $4.61 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.27 on $19.03 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Utility - Electric Power is currently in the top 31% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the same industry, Algonquin Power &amp; Utilities (AQN), is yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on November 11.This utility operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.16 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +6.7%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.9% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.Algonquin Power &amp; Utilities' revenues are expected to be $614.83 million, up 16.3% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Severely overleveraged is not a good look in a rising-interest-rate environment like the one we are in right now.Finding such stocks isn’t difficult. To start, I’ll narrow down the S&amp;P 500 to only those stocks with yields of 5% or higher. That reduces the field to 27, according to Finviz.com. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThen I’ll select my three pitiful dividend stocks from the companies whose long-term debt exceeds their equity. The list of 13 companies includes many stocks whose shares have been beaten down over the past year.But putting together lists of stocks to sell is difficult because beauty is in the eye of the beholder. What I think is pitiful, you might believe is misunderstood. So do your due diligence on all three of these pitiful dividend stocks.  Boston Properties (BXP)An image of two people with a housing contract, hands holding a pen, hands holding a calculator with a house in the backgroundSource: 89stocker / ShutterstockBoston Properties (NYSE:BXP) has been a public company since June 1997, when it sold 31.4 million shares to the investing public for $25 apiece. At the time, it owned 63 office properties, two hotels, nine industrial properties, and one garage. Its properties totaled more than 11 million square feet.The REIT (real estate investment trust) now has 193 Class A office properties with 53.7 million square feet of premier workspace in Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. The properties generate $3 billion of annualized revenue and $1.8 billion of EBITDAre (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for real estate). Clearly, BXP has become a much bigger business. If you bought shares during the IPO, you have generated a compound annual growth rate of 8.4%, including dividends. That’s 1.1 percentage points better than the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust over the same period.Before the Great Recession,  BXP had only traded this low on one other occasion:  March 2020. Story continuesFitch Ratings, however, wrote earlier this month that the U.S. office utilization rate, while improving, will not return to levels seen before the pandemic. As a result, weaker properties face obsolescence under the “new normal.”Since the beginning of 2010, BXP stock has moved sideways. Its 5.4% yield shouldn’t be enough to get you to bite on this stock.Oneok Inc. (OKE)Illustration of oil pump jacks on sunset sky background to represent oil and gas stocksSource: ShutterstockIn 2022, Oneok Inc. (NYSE:OKE) is up 2.5%. That’s much better than the S&amp;P 500 has done, but it’s nowhere near the performance of the S&amp;P 500 energy sector, which was up 62% in 2022 as of Oct. 28.Analysts are relatively lukewarm about OKE stock. The average rating of the 22 who cover it is “hold,” and their mean price target is $67.Morningstar.com sector strategist Stephen Ellis likes the Oklahoma-based midstream service provider.     “Oneok brings together high-quality assets, some of the strongest near- to medium-term growth prospects in our coverage as Rockies volumes continue their ongoing rebound, a C-Corporation structure, and a well-respected management team in a compelling package,” Ellis wrote in August. While the company’s financial results in 2022 have been good, it’s difficult to determine why the stock has barely moved at a time when most energy stocks are up 20% or more in 2022.One possibility is its net debt. At the end of June, its total debt was $13.88 billion while it had just $135.77 million of cash for net debt of $13.74 billion, nearly four times its annualized EBITDA. Its shareholders can’t absorb another decline of oil and gas prices. Whirlpool (WHR)the Whirlpool (WHR) logo on a corporate buildingSource: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.comEarlier in 2022, I included Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) on a list of ten stocks that I thought had enough pricing power with consumers to pass on rising input costs to the end buyers of their household appliances. At the time, I argued that regression to the mean would eventually move its stock higher. I suggested that buying WHR stock under $200 would make investors money over the next two to three years. Since the end of February, it has tumbled more than 30%.On Oct. 20, Whirlpool reported that its Q3 results were affected by inflation and slowing demand for its products. However, it also said that 2022 would be the second-best year in its 111-year history. There is, however, no way around the fact that, through the nine months that ended on Sept. 30, its sales in 2022 were down by a double digit-percentage year-over-year.  Meanwhile, its free cash flow has fallen by more than $1 billion, dropping to -$24 million from $988 million a year ago. The company says it has a plan to overcome its current difficulties. I’m not so sure if it will work and neither are analysts. Their average rating on WHR stock is “hold“ with a median target price of $140, just barely higher than its current share price.If you don’t want to sell WHR, at the very least, I would wait for some confirmation that it’s on the right path to recovery before buying any more of its shares.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The comments in the earnings call offset quarterly results that showed a wider than expected loss in Q3.Zillow (NASDAQ:ZG) reported a beat on both the top and bottom lines in Q3, though warned of lower revenue in the final quarter of the year as rising mortgage rates weighs on demand.Story continuesIn other news, Boeing (NYSE:BA), a major Dow component, jumped after the aircraft maker detailed plans to increase production and deliveries of new aircraft.On the economic front, weekly jobless claims unexpectedly declined pointing to a robust labor market and stoked expectations for an upside surprise in Friday's monthly jobs report, which will likely fuel further bets on a hawkish Fed.Economists expect that 200,000 new jobs were created last month, which would still be a ""historically strong number, this late in the in the cycle,"" Eric Diton, president and managing director at The Wealth Alliance, said in an interview on Thursday with Yasin Ebrahim's Investing.com.""Job openings increased last month, there's more companies looking for workers, so I don't see how that's going to be followed by a weak October jobs report as that would be inconsistent,"" Diton added.

I mean, can we sort of take away some positive here, especially when you're looking at the retailers that have reported so far?ALEXADNRA SEMENOVA: Absolutely, Akiko. It's another big morning for corporate earnings with a flurry of retailers headlining today's results. Among them is Crocs.Shares are up about 7% after the footwear company reported third quarter figures that beat Wall Street estimates. Quarterly sales and direct to consumer comparable sales rose sharply, as well as revenue for its Hey Dude brand up 87% during the period. The company raised its full year guidance with CEO Andrew Rees citing strong back-to-school performance and 20% constant currency revenue growth in its Crocs brand.Let's turn now to Under Armour also beating estimates for the quarter, but signaling a less optimistic view of what's ahead for the company. The sports brand said sales for the 2023 fiscal year are set to rise in the low single digits. That's down from the 5% to 7% it projected earlier.The company attributed lower expectations to, quote, ""a more challenging retail environment and additional negative impacts from changes in foreign currency"". BMO analyst Simeon Siegel, who is a friend of the show, telling us this morning that he believes shares are still priced too low. He reiterated his outperform rating on the stock this morning.AKIKO FUJITA: And speaking of some positive takeaways here, we've got Etsy. That stock just on a tear today up well over 10%. What's fueling the rally there?ALEXADNRA SEMENOVA: Well, Akiko, results signal today to investors that e-commerce is still holding up better than expected, especially ahead of the all important holiday shopping season. Etsy's revenue came in at $594.5 million. That's up 11.7% from a year ago. Gross merchandise sales down slightly, but still at the higher end of the projected range.The online marketplace also said it expects continued strength in its sales into the fourth quarter. That's helping lift shares today. Analysts from Evercore ISI this morning saying the company maintained its pandemic success and is showing healthy levels of profitability as well.AKIKO FUJITA: OK, some silver linings there to take away.

Are they protecting this house? Yes, they are.All right, the only way is through. It's up by about 15, 16% right now. The athletic wear company posted slightly better than expected second quarter results, but cut back its guidance. Citing the stronger dollar and a, quote, ""more challenging retail environment."" It's challenging indeed.You're taking a look at the actuals versus the estimates on your screen. And turnaround had to start sometime, but it's not a full turnaround here.BRIAN SOZZI: I didn't see really any signs of a turnaround. This is maybe-- this was the Peloton turnaround with the green shoots. Maybe Barry McCarthy should write this company's letter too as well. But look, they came out, lowered their guidance.And one of the biggest concerns this holiday season in retail is all the inventory sitting at various stores. And one of the most promotional brands in the store right now remains Under Armour. And it's just not what this brand was founded on.I remember saving up a lot of money to buy my first moisture wicking Under Armour shirt. I had to pay full price. This was six or seven years ago, maybe even longer than that. But still you go now to TJ Maxx, you go to Marshall's, this stuff is on sale $10, $20 a pop.JULIE HYMAN: Well, and their inventory was up by 29%. So that-- but that's in line with what we've seen from others. They did cut the forecast, as you mentioned, but that forecast cut was largely expected. Analysts were saying they got to cut the forecast. So I guess their acknowledgment of reality was a good thing.Also really surprising here. Asia-Pacific sales up 7%. Like, who else had Asia-Pacific sales?BRIAN SOZZI: Big in basketball.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, yeah. They've been sending Steph Curry there every single summer to do a grassroots, just boots on the ground promotion.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: But still, given how shut down things have been there.BRAD SMITH: No, you're right.JULIE HYMAN: And given what we've been hearing from other companies, that's a bit surprising. Remember they still don't have a permanent CEO, by the way. Remember Patrick Frisk left?BRIAN SOZZI: This has always been Kevin Plank's house. You've covered Under Armour too as a well. Even when Patrick Frisk was in there, I mean, it's very much Kevin Plank's baby, his ship. He may not be running it day-to-day, but he sends an email, you're getting it done.BRAD SMITH: Right. He was steering it. And I think for what Under Armour has gone up against and continues to go up against, this is not going to get any easier for them. And so continuing to have the nostalgia factor that you were mentioning a moment ago.BRIAN SOZZI: I did.BRAD SMITH: Everybody remembers their first Under Armour experience.BRIAN SOZZI: I still have it.BRAD SMITH: You really do?BRIAN SOZZI: I use this shirt to play softball. It helped me recover a lot faster, or at least that's what I told myself. And then I hit better and I threw the ball further. It was amazing, Brad.BRAD SMITH: It was that aura that you take on but--BRIAN SOZZI: I'm still carrying on. I'm wearing it underneath this shirt.BRAD SMITH: And so it's-- really?BRIAN SOZZI: No. Just kidding.[LAUGHTER]JULIE HYMAN: Along with the chain.BRIAN SOZZI: Let's go to the Julie Hyman trade here.]"

The company's market valuation decreased by US$6.9b after the stock price dropped 5.0% over the past week, but insiders were spared from painful losses.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Comcast Comcast Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Executive VP, Daniel Murdock, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$397k worth of shares at a price of US$44.50 each. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$30.38). So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels. Daniel Murdock was the only individual insider to sell over the last year.You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeI will like Comcast better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Does Comcast Boast High Insider Ownership?I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Comcast insiders own 0.9% of the company, currently worth about US$1.2b based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Comcast Tell Us?The fact that there have been no Comcast insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Comcast insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. To assist with this, we've discovered 3 warning signs that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Comcast.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Among the local recipients selected are Tech Goes Home, Central Boston Elder Services, and One Bead. The organizations receiving grants were chosen due to their commitment to digital equity and the funds will support programs specifically designed to provide residents in Boston and surrounding communities with Internet access and digital skill-building services. This announcement is part of Project UP, Comcast's 10-year, $1 billion pledge to advance digital equity through programs and community partnerships that connect people to the Internet, advance economic mobility, and open doors for the next generation of innovators, entrepreneurs, storytellers and creators.""As a media and technology company, we are uniquely positioned to help address the inequities that exists in digital access and adoption. We see this not simply as the reality – but as an imperative, and our responsibility,"" said Dalila Wilson-Scott, EVP and Chief Diversity Officer, Comcast Corporation and President, Comcast NBCUniversal Foundation. ""Through this grant we are excited to deepen our partnerships with these local nonprofit partners and better ensure all residents across the Greater Boston region achieve digital equity.""The three Boston-based recipient organizations will use the funds to create digital navigators, individuals affiliated with trusted community organizations who are trained to help people access the Internet, use devices and acquire digital skills. Once their training is complete, these digital navigators will educate community members in a wide range of digital awareness and literacy skills. Additionally, they will help residents learn about the federal government's Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), which provides eligible low-income households with a credit of up to $30 per month toward their Internet and/or mobile service.Story continues""During our longstanding partnership with Comcast, we've made important progress toward connecting more Bostonians to the power of the Internet,"" said Dan Noyes, Co-CEO of Tech Goes Home. ""Expanding our partnership now to enable more staff and partners to offer individuals and families hands-on, culturally-responsive digital skills support -- including assistance signing up for free broadband programs -- will help reach and connect even more people. These kinds of strong, collaborative ties between our public, private and nonprofit sectors will continue to be vital as we work to expand digital access and adoption, and we're grateful for Comcast's continued partnership.""In addition, 14 other nonprofits received grants to further digital equity efforts – such as conducting digital literacy training across eastern Massachusetts. They are Massachusetts Alliance of Boys &amp; Girls Clubs; BAGLY (Boston Alliance of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Youth); Just A Start; Elder Services of Cape Cod; Metro North Regional Employment Board; YMCA of Metro North; Massachusetts Nonprofit Network; Essex County Community Foundation; Timothy Smith Network; MACIR Career Center; Urban League of Eastern Massachusetts; YMCA of Martha's Vineyard; Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center; and Save the Harbor/Save the Bay.This investment follows the announcement of a nationwide study by the Boston Consulting Group, which found that digital navigators are critical to closing the digital divide and reducing socioeconomic inequalities by helping more people get online. The study surveyed 1,500 individuals across the country who received support from a digital navigator. With the support of these digital case workers:More than 65 percent of survey respondents said they obtained Internet access or a computer or tablet at home; among Hispanic and Black Americans, this increased to 72 percent.More than 85 percent of all respondents said they used the Internet more frequently.Almost half surveyed obtained better healthcare, and 40 percent received support with basic needs like food, rent, and housing.1 in 3 found a new job or earned a higher income.""Comcast knows that access to the Internet is vital but also recognizes that having the digital literacy skills to build and enhance career pathways and opportunities are crucial,"" said Anthony Bowling, Senior Vice President of Comcast's Greater Boston Region. ""That is why we are working side by side with public, private and nonprofit partners to do our part to help bridge that divide, advance digital equity and bring economic opportunity to the Boston area and beyond.""Additional information on the Boston-area partner organizations providing digital navigation services:Tech Goes Home connects families and community members across Eastern Massachusetts with technology, connectivity and digital skills to help them thrive. Comcast's $50,000 grant will empower the organization to launch its digital navigator program and help senior citizens, parents and caregivers with technology training, one-on-one support and assistance signing up for free broadband programs. In addition, Comcast provided 200 laptops to equip the digital navigators with the right tools to get more Bostonians online.Central Boston Elder Services (CBES) provides high-quality, responsive, supportive services and programs to the elderly and the disabled in need of health and human services. Comcast's $47,500 grant will launch its digital navigator program and help CBES provide connectivity and digital literacy training to an elder population that is unconnected today.One Bead is focused on addressing the opportunity gap by partnering exclusively with schools in low-income communities. One Bead will use Comcast's $25,000 grant to launch its digital navigator program to provide digital literacy training sessions for students. Additionally, they will use the funds to provide laptops for students who lack access to devices at home.These efforts are all part of Project UP, Comcast's comprehensive initiative to help build a future of unlimited possibilities. Project UP encompasses digital equity programs such as Internet Essentials, Lift Zones and Comcast RISE. Since its inception in 2011, Comcast's Internet Essentials has connected more than 10 million low-income Americans to broadband service at home, including more than 388,000 in Massachusetts. Additionally, Comcast has launched more than 1,000 Lift Zones in community centers nationwide – with 74 locations in Massachusetts alone – to provide students and families with free, high-speed WiFi. And through Comcast RISE, a multi-year national program that supports small businesses owned by women or people of color in response to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, Comcast has supported more than 100 Massachusetts businesses with tech makeovers or free ad campaigns.For additional information on Project UP and our digital equity initiatives, visit: https://corporate.comcast.com/impact/project-up.About Internet EssentialsIn 2011, Comcast launched Internet Essentials, the nation's largest and most successful private-sector low-income broadband adoption program; since launch it has connected over 10 million people to the Internet at home, most for the very first time.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: EMCOR Group, Inc. EME, Granite Construction Inc. GVA, James Hardie Industries plc JHX and United Rentals, Inc. URI.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:4 Stocks to Buy on a Rise in Construction SpendingSpending on construction projects, rising until a few months back, has been declining. The homebuilding industry has been the biggest casualty of the Fed's aggressive rate hike policy, which has seen a steady decline in spending on construction projects.However, construction spending rose unexpectedly in September, indicating that inflation might be easing. The rise was primarily driven by spending on non-residential structures like mining and oil well drilling and government projects. Given this scenario, stocks like EMCOR Group, Inc., Granite Construction Inc., James Hardie Industries plc and United Rentals, Inc. are likely to benefit in the near term.Construction Spending Increases Despite ChallengesThe U.S. Census Bureau said on Nov 1 that spending on construction projects rose 0.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1,811.1 billion in September after declining 0.6% in August. Economists had expected construction spending to decline 0.5%.Moreover, on a year-over-year basis, construction spending increased 10.9% in September. At the end of the third quarter, or the completion of the first nine months of the year, spending on construction projects totaled $1,353.7 billion, 11.4% higher than the same period last year.Spending on private construction projects increased 0.4% in September after declining 0.7% in August. However, the homebuilding sector, which has been primarily driving spending on construction projects for months, continued its decline.Story continuesSpending on residential construction projects remained unchanged month over month in September, with spending on single-family homes declining 2.6%. Spending on multi-family housing projects rose 0.3% in September.The homebuilding market has been suffering the most as mortgage rates continue to climb as a result of higher interest rates being imposed by the Fed in its fight to curb soaring inflation. However, economic data released last week showed hinted at easing inflation. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index rose 0.3% month over month in September and 6.2% on an annual basis, unchanged from August.This has given people the feeling that inflation might be easing and the Fed might go slow on its aggressive monetary policy after its rate hike in November. The Fed is expected to increase interest rates by another 75 basis points after its two-day policy meeting, which begins on Nov 2. Investors believe this could be the last of major rate hikes by the Fed.If the Fed goes slow on its next rate hikes, the homebuilding industry will likely benefit the most. That said, construction spending in September was driven by private non-residential structures like gas and oil well drilling, which increased 1%. Also, spending on state and local government construction projects gained 0.6%.Our ChoicesGiven this scenario, it will be prudent to invest in stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank that are poised to gain from the rise in construction spending.

Each of these stocks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.EMCOR Group is one of the leading providers of mechanical and electrical construction, industrial and energy infrastructure, as well as building services for a diverse range of businesses.

The Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized an additional $2.5 billion to the share repurchase program. Any amount remaining under the existing program will be incorporated into the new authorization.Kaltenbach commented, ""The additional authorization allows us to continue the share repurchase program that has provided strong returns for our shareholders over many years. We are confident in our future growth prospects, and our balance sheet and cash flow generation remain strong."" The Company expects the additional authorization will be utilized over the next few years. The Company added that the repurchases will be made through open market transactions, and the amount and timing will depend on business and market conditions, stock price, trading restrictions, the level of acquisition activity, and other factors.Outlook The Company stated that forecasting remains challenging. Management cautions that market conditions are dynamic and changes to the business environment can occur quickly. There is uncertainty in the economic environment today including challenges in the global supply chain, inflationary pressures, unfavorable foreign currency, the potential economic impacts from COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine. The estimates include uncertainty, and management acknowledges that market conditions are subject to change.Based on today's assessment of market conditions, management anticipates local currency sales growth for the fourth quarter of 2022 will be approximately 7%, and Adjusted EPS is forecast to be $11.55 to $11.65, a growth rate of 10% to 11%. Included in the fourth quarter guidance is an estimated 10% headwind to Adjusted EPS growth due to adverse currency, which represents a greater headwind to Adjusted EPS than what was contemplated in prior guidance.For the full year 2022, management anticipates local currency sales growth will be approximately 10%, and Adjusted EPS is forecast to be in the range of $38.95 to $39.05, representing growth of approximately 15%. This compares with previous local currency sales growth guidance of 9% to 10% and Adjusted EPS guidance of $38.85 to $39.05. Included in the 2022 guidance is an estimated 6% headwind to Adjusted EPS growth due to adverse currency.The Company said that based on its assessment of market conditions today, management anticipates local currency sales growth in 2023 will be approximately 5%. This sales growth is expected to result in Adjusted EPS in the range of $42.00 to $42.40. At the midpoint of 2022 guidance, this would result in Adjusted EPS growth in 2023 of 8% to 9%. Included in the 2023 guidance is an estimated 4.5% headwind to Adjusted EPS growth due to adverse currency.While the Company has provided an outlook for local currency sales growth and Adjusted EPS, it has not provided an outlook for reported sales growth or EPS as it would require an estimate of currency exchange fluctuations and non-recurring items, which are not yet known.ConclusionKaltenbach concluded, ""We continue to strengthen our market position and benefit from the strong execution of our growth initiatives, as well as favorable market trends such as automation and digitalization. Forecasting remains challenging, and we acknowledge there is greater uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. These uncertainties will require us to remain agile and focus on factors we can control, namely leveraging our strong strategic programs to identify and target profitable growth opportunities. Based on market conditions today, we believe we will generate good sales growth for the remainder of the year and in 2023. Continued execution of our margin and productivity initiatives will support strong financial results.""Other MattersThe Company will host a conference call to discuss its quarterly results tonight (Thursday, November 3) at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time.

This compares to earnings of $1.73 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -0.57%.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.51 billion.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Fidelity National: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock.

This time we're talking pizza. Papa John's the latest chain to fall short of expectations. International same-store sales down 10%. That's where we find former fast food eater, Brian Sozzi. Former?BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, and look, I indulge-- to borrow Andy's word.JULIE HYMAN: Didn't you have Shake Shack like two days ago?BRIAN SOZZI: I did. But you know, this is-- you know, this is the normal. That's not the norm. I mean, getting a little older, can't be eating that stuff. But I will say this, overall, not a good quarter for the likes of the big pizza chains.So Battle of the Cheese, really. I like that title. It's pretty good. So overall, Papa John's North America same-store sales, they came out this morning, were down. Slightly, Pizza Hut, under the Yum Brands umbrella, they reported yesterday, up 1%. Domino's Pizza when they reported, I didn't think it was a good quarter. But relatively speaking, looks pretty good there for Domino's Pizza. Same-store sales up 2%.So you have to think after all of the, really I would say, over two years, these companies were minting money. They were doing very well. But come up with a couple of potential reasons why you're probably starting to see sales slow.First off, people are back out there traveling again. We just talked to Andy Callahan, they're back out in convenience stores buying Twinkies and Ho Hos. Next up, revival of the burger, guys. I think what McDonald's came up with regarding adult Happy Meals. A lot of clever marketing in large part by McDonald's is getting people back into stores like that, instead of ordering pizza.Next, sit-down restaurants offering some great promotions. I talked to Dime Brands CEO last night. He told-- yesterday, he told me they're offering 12 shrimp for $1.00 at Applebee's.Story continuesBRAD SMITH: What?BRIAN SOZZI: That's pretty good. And yes, their shrimp.JULIE HYMAN: You--BRIAN SOZZI: Their shrimp.JULIE HYMAN: --get what you pay for.BRIAN SOZZI: Their shrimp, and they're cooked, I'll take it.BRAD SMITH: Is it real?BRIAN SOZZI: It's real. It's shrimp. This is not Subway we're talking about here. And last but not least, it's just too darn expensive right now, fast food. You can very easily make a good meal at your home. I don't know, a can of sup over some rice, called it a day.JULIE HYMAN: I'm still reeling from--BRAD SMITH: Yeah, just because it's--BRIAN SOZZI: 12 shrimp.BRAD SMITH: --shaped like shrimp.BRIAN SOZZI: It's shrimp. It's--JULIE HYMAN: Even if it's--BRIAN SOZZI: --no filler.JULIE HYMAN: Oh, OK. So what's--BRAD SMITH: All right.BRIAN SOZZI: --your take?BRAD SMITH: Yeah.BRIAN SOZZI: Here's my take. Here's my take. I'm in search of pizza stock catalysts. And you know, honestly, I don't have all the answers. You know, it may seem like I do but I really don't. Tweet me what you think would get these stocks working again because clearly, they have been down in a large, large way.You have Papa John's shares down about 47% year-to-date. Just calling out Papa John's because they reported today. It is unclear what leads to a re-acceleration in sales for these companies.BRAD SMITH: All right, well, my purchase of a pizza while in Target is not gonna do it--BRIAN SOZZI: Not gonna do it.BRAD SMITH: --alone over this holiday season.]"

""We think recent, ongoing and planned investments into the biz (people, equipment, tech, etc.) set to play well long-term for a large-cap global brand capable of weathering macro headwinds.""Here is the vibe on Wall Street on SBUX coming off the results:Jefferies: Andy BarishRating: Buy (reiterated)Price Target: $100""Impressive same-store sales beat in U.S., multiple near/long-term drivers in place. U.S. same-store sales of 11% beat consensus of 8%, with 1% traffic and 10% average check, driven by mid to high single digit percentage pricing, strong food attach, digital (MOP 26% of sales), drive-thru, delivery, Rewards (28.7 million members, +16% year over year, and contributed record 55% of tender), cold beverage platform continuing to increase in mix (up 100bps quarter over quarter to 76%) and with more customizations/mods (now 60% of U.S. co-owned store beverages). FY23 comp guide reiterated: Global near high end of 7-9% range, U.S. 7-9%, China negative in 1Q given recent COVID flare-up but outsized gains rest of year on easy laps; F1Q Global same-store sales closer to 7%; fiscal year total revenue growth of 10-12% even with higher foreign exchange impact. Longer-term, we view ongoing and planned investments into team members (partners), operations, and equipment/tech discussed at the Sept analyst day event as supportive of strong same-store sales momentum. We raise our FY23 estimate to 10% fr 9%, and keep FY24 8%.""Story continuesAn employee services in a Starbucks coffee truck at Wuhan International Plaza on October 6, 2022 in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.

However, we could see the near-term sentiment pendulum swinging with: (1) higher frequency foot traffic data somewhat contradicting company commentary/guidance that suggested building momentum into October in the U.S., and (2) guidance that requires a rapidly improving China backdrop in FY23 (after a setback in F1Q). At the same time, the call did little to clear up a key question coming out of the recent investor day: how revenue, profit and returns accretive will the U.S. initiatives be once fully installed (espescially the Siren remodel program)? Shares may see a pop on a U.S. headline beat/FY23 EPS estimates coming up, but we see little reason for a meaningful, sustained leg-up without color on how these initiatives build to long-term guidance.""Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

However, as the economy rebounds from peak inflation, trade in these penny stocks is likely to explode as retail investors return to the market to make the most of the recovery momentum. Our MethodologyThe companies that are priced at under $5 per share as of November 3 and have high volumes were selected for the list.

View our latest analysis for Prologis How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Prologis is:11% = US$4.2b ÷ US$40b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.11.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Prologis' Earnings Growth And 11% ROETo begin with, Prologis seems to have a respectable ROE. Especially when compared to the industry average of 6.8% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. Probably as a result of this, Prologis was able to see a decent growth of 17% over the last five years.As a next step, we compared Prologis' net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 12%.Story continuespast-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is PLD fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Prologis Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Prologis seems to be paying out most of its income as dividends judging by its three-year median payout ratio of 51%, meaning the company retains only 49% of its income. However, this is typical for REITs as they are often required by law to distribute most of their earnings. Despite this, the company's earnings grew moderately as we saw above.Moreover, Prologis is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 58%. However, Prologis' future ROE is expected to decline to 6.6% despite there being not much change anticipated in the company's payout ratio.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Prologis' performance has been quite good. We are particularly impressed by the considerable earnings growth posted by the company, which was likely backed by its high ROE. While the company is paying out most of its earnings as dividends, it has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's probably a good sign. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future.

TRIP, may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Tripadvisor is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for TRIP in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 43 cents per share for TRIP, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 39 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for TRIP, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +9.69% heading into earnings season.TripAdvisor, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseTripAdvisor, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseTripAdvisor, Inc. price-eps-surprise | TripAdvisor, Inc.

(PCAR) Hits Fresh High: Is There Still Room to Run?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paccar-inc-pcar-hits-fresh-131501499.html,1667481301,STORY,['PCAR'],"[Have you been paying attention to shares of Paccar (PCAR)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 5.3% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $98.89 in the previous session. Paccar has gained 8.4% since the start of the year compared to the -38.6% move for the Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector and the -41.2% return for the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on October 25, 2022, Paccar reported EPS of $2.21 versus consensus estimate of $2.01 while it missed the consensus revenue estimate by 0.69%.For the current fiscal year, Paccar is expected to post earnings of $8.10 per share on $26.55 billion in revenues. This represents a 52.26% change in EPS on a 21.6% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $8.29 per share on $27.67 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 2.33% and 4.23%, respectively.Valuation MetricsPaccar may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Paccar has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are C and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.Story continuesIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 11.8X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 11.8X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 12.1X versus its peer group's average of 12.4X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.18. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Paccar currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Paccar passes the test. Thus, it seems as though Paccar shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.How Does PCAR Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of PCAR have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is IAA, Inc. (IAA). IAA has a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of B, a Growth Score of B, and a Momentum Score of D.Earnings were strong last quarter. IAA, Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 12.73%, and for the current fiscal year, IAA is expected to post earnings of $2.36 per share on revenue of $2.06 billion.Shares of IAA, Inc. have gained 15.1% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 16.55X and a P/CF of 12.77X.The Automotive - Domestic industry is in the top 20% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for PCAR and IAA, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

According to The New York Times, the U.S. equities sector generally follows election-related patterns.“The months leading up to midterm elections have generally been the worst in what is known as the four-year presidential election cycle. But the stock market is about to enter a sweet spot. Stocks have usually rallied in the year after the midterms — no matter which side wins.” Fundamentally, that might be great news for stocks to buy.As well, the latter point may give investors relief. To no one’s surprise, the campaign cycle features incredible vitriol all over the map. And with major geopolitical events in the background, this year’s midterms may be more significant than others. However, if stocks to buy will rise irrespective of which party wins, that’s one factor to help people sleep better.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsStill, some ideas may be better than others. Therefore, the stocks to buy on this list feature a combination of undervalued profiles and fiscal resilience.GOOG GOOGLAlphabet$95.28NVDANvidia$135.26METAMeta Platforms$94.62ADBEAdobe$320.32EWEdwards Lifesciences$71.99TTDTrade Desk$53.42TROWT. Rowe Price$107.57Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comOne of the hardest-hit majors in the broader technology space, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) finds its equity value chopped by more than a third since the start of the year. Fundamentally, this volatility might be overdone. As stated before, the company’s Google ecosystem dominates the internet. For instance, it commands over 92% market share in the search engine sector.Financially, Gurufocus.com labels GOOG and GOOGL as significantly undervalued based on its proprietary calculations. To be fair, under standard assessments, GOOG/GOOGL is priced at 17 times forward earnings, which is middling for the industry.Story continuesHowever, Alphabet brings excellent income statement-related strengths to the mix. For instance, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 25%, better than about 75% of its peers. And its net margin pings at nearly 24%, rating higher than nearly 85% of the competition. Finally, Alphabet allows long-term stakeholders to sleep easier at night due to its balance sheet. Specifically, its Altman Z-Score hits nearly 10 points, reflecting very low bankruptcy risk.Nvidia (NVDA)Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green treesSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comSemiconductor specialist Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is hurting, and it’s no surprise why. In 2021, the company flourished with certain growth sectors like cryptocurrencies absolutely booming. Unfortunately, cryptos deflated badly this year, applying pressure on NVDA. In addition, the company suffered from the usual suspects like global supply chain problems and monetary policy fluctuations. Still, for the patient, NVDA represents one of the stocks to buy on discount.Per Gurufocus.com, Nvidia is significantly undervalued based on proprietary calculations. Based on traditional metrics, it runs a premium, such as its 30-times forward earnings price. However, investors also need to consider its income statement. For instance, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 31%. Its net margin pings at 26%. Both stats rank well above their respective industry median levels.Just as importantly, Nvidia enjoys a stable balance sheet. While it carries a middling cash-to-debt ratio, its Altman Z-Score rates at 12.8. This reflects extremely low bankruptcy risk, providing a discount you can believe in.Meta Platforms (META)Meta Written On The Googles - Man Wearing Virtual Reality Goggles Inside A Metaverse. FTC investigating META.Source: Aleem Zahid Khan / Shutterstock.comAlthough Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) made a big fuss about its transition to the metaverse, both investors and analysts remain unimpressed. For the former category, META dropped nearly 71% of equity value on a year-to-date basis. Clearly, investors aren’t enamored with the pivot. Regarding the latter category, analysts criticized the emphasis on the metaverse.With people asking really basic questions (such as what’s the point?) Meta faces a difficult road ahead. That is, a difficult road for the metaverse. Relating to its massive social media footprint, that’s where the money is. Sure, Meta warned earlier this year about the slowdown in the digital advertising market. However, companies will still need to advertise somewhere. Meta brings nearly a three-billion-strong active user base to the picture. As well, Elon Musk’s Twitter possibly about to nuke its attractiveness, the safe space that is its Facebook platform could be very enticing.META also represents a steal. With strong income-statement metrics, a stable balance sheet and a forward price-earnings ratio of just under 12 times (compared to the industry median 15.5 times), you don’t want to ignore META as one of the potential stocks to buy.Adobe (ADBE)ADBE stock adobe stockSource: ShutterstockOn the surface, the volatility toward Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) might appear rational. Though a compelling tech play, Adobe largely generated its reputation with creatives-related programs. The market for such services seemingly may be at risk considering economically deflationary risks. However, the burgeoning gig economy may help to bring in demand over the next several years.Further, the loss of over 42% of equity value since the beginning of the year may be too much. We’re not talking about some junk company that’s tethered to aspirational projections. Rather, the enterprise features compelling attributes sold at discount. For instance, Adobe’s earnings yield based on investor Joel Greenblatt’s model stands at 4%. In contrast, the median for the industry is 1.3%.Along with that, Adobe’s income statement-related metrics, including three-year revenue growth rate and net margin stand above industry norms, especially for profitability. Factor in the strong balance sheet (with an Altman Z-Score of over 10) and you have a great case for stocks to buy on discount.Edwards Lifesciences (EW)Modern Medical Research Laboratory with Computer, Microscope, Glassware with Biochemicals on the Desk. Scientific Lab Biotechnology Development Center Full of High-Tech Equipment. Biomedical technology stocksSource: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.comA medical technology firm, Edwards Lifesciences (NYSE:EW) specializes in artificial heart valves and hemodynamic monitoring. To be fair, EW represents one of the riskiest stocks to buy, in part because of its recent earnings report. Per Investor’s Business Daily, Edwards slashed its profit guidance due to U.S. hospital staffing challenges and a strong dollar. Since the beginning of this year, EW dropped almost 45% of equity value.Aside from the recent downgrade, the overall picture for EW remains attractive for speculators. For instance, Gurufocus.com rates Edwards as a significantly undervalued business. For example, the company’s earnings yield (Greenblatt model) is 4.15%. In contrast, the industry median is only 0.6%.On the income statement, Edwards features a three-year revenue growth rate of 12.6%, beating out over 64% of its peers. The company’s net margin stands at 27%, beating out over 90% of its rivals in the medical devices segment. Finally, the company features an Altman Z-Score of over 13, reflecting great stability in the balance sheet.Trade Desk (TTD)The logo for The Trade Desk is displayed on a smart phone.Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comAnother high-risk, high-reward idea among stocks to buy during the possible midterms bottom, Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) specializes in real-time programmatic marketing automation technologies, products, and services, designed to personalize digital content delivery to users, per its corporate profile. However, the fundamental headwind to TTD stems from the digital ad space market. Suffering deflationary forces, Trade Desk doesn’t bring a confident canvas to the table.However, it’s also important to point out that entertainment streaming services appear to be enjoying an uptick in demand. This dynamic isn’t just significant for the companies directly involved. Rather, the consumption of entertainment may be pivoting back to the living room. Part of this may center on economic pressures. People still want to be entertained, it’s just that they must seek cheaper alternatives.Well, that spells music to Trade Desk’s ears due to its programmatic marketing specialty. As well, the company brings a stable balance sheet to the picture, with an Altman Z-Score of 9.45.T. Rowe Price (TROW)Graphic of side view of virtual financial charts with tech aesthetic, symbolizing fintechSource: shutterstock.com/whiteMoccaIn 2020 and 2021, with worker bees operating remotely, people couldn’t get enough of the equities market. Fast forward to this year and the term stocks to buy might represent fighting words to some folks. Not surprisingly, T. Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW), an investment management firm, feels the pressure. Since the beginning of this year, TROW slipped over 44% of equity value.Admittedly, it’s not a great look for stocks to buy. With the Federal Reserve committed to a hawkish monetary policy, it rendered limitations for investment opportunities. I don’t want to get bogged down here but the basics is this: higher costs of borrowing generally reduces investor sentiment and confidence. However, if you can get past this little detail, TROW brings an attractive profile to the stage.Based on its price-earnings-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.67 (with the industry median being 1.43) you can make the argument that TROW is undervalued. The company also features a stable growth trek and profitability margins. Further, its return on equity is 28%, reflecting a high-quality business. As well, T. Rowe features an Altman Z-Score of nearly 10, signifying a resilient enterprise.Plus, investors will still invest, making T.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS).Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for United Parcel Service How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for United Parcel Service is:66% = US$11b ÷ US$17b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.66 in profit.Does United Parcel Service Have A Good Return On Equity?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, United Parcel Service has a superior ROE than the average (27%) in the Logistics industry.roeThat is a good sign. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk .How Does Debt Impact ROE?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesUnited Parcel Service's Debt And Its 66% ROEIt's worth noting the high use of debt by United Parcel Service, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.19. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.SummaryReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward.

And despite signs that the economy is slowing, Americans are expected to spend more this year between Thanksgiving and New Year’s than they did in 2021.According to accounting and professional services firm Deloitte, holiday retail sales are likely to boom. Expectations are that retail sales will total between $1.45 trillion and $1.47 trillion from late November to the start of January. That’s up about 5% from the same time last year. E-commerce sales during this year’s holiday sales period are expected to rise even more dramatically, with Deloitte forecasting year-over-year growth of 12.8% to 14.3%. Indeed, the firm says that e-commerce sales could exceed $260 billion, making for a very merry holiday sales season.Clearly, Americans aren’t letting inflation and rising interest rates hold them back from celebrating year-end festivities. Other holiday sales forecasts are equally bullish. So, which companies and stocks are likely to benefit from all that holiday spending?

That could be an especially attractive draw for consumers this year, with inflation in the U.S. continuing to run at a 40-year high, and costs up sharply for everything from turkeys to eggnog.The world’s biggest retailer is following the lead of competitors this year and offering holiday sales earlier than ever before. The company started rolling out deals to consumers in October, rather than waiting until Thanksgiving at the end of November. Over the last month, Walmart has announced price cuts, expanded return options, and an enhanced omnichannel shopping experience. This is in a bid to kickstart its holiday shopping season into high gear.Story continuesIn the coming weeks, Walmart said it will offer thousands more price “rollbacks” to help harried shoppers complete their holiday lists. Currently, WMT stock is only down 1% on the year at $141 per share. That said, a strong holiday boost could help turn the company’s share price green by New Year’s.United Parcel Service (UPS)Close up of UPS logo printed on a delivery truck; partial view of the driver sitting at the wheel, waiting at a red traffic light in south San Francisco baySource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comHelping Santa get all those gifts and packages under the tree this year is the job of United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS). The largest courier company in the world with annual revenues of more than $85 billion, UPS thrives during the holidays. In September, the company announced plans to hire more than 100,000 additional workers to help with the holiday shipping rush. These hires span the spectrum, from drivers to package handlers.UPS said it anticipates package shipments to peak later in December this year and closer to Christmas, as consumers return to pre-Covid patterns and shop for items later and in-person. The company also expects to lose some business to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which is directly handling more of it its own shipments now. Still, the fourth and final quarter of the year is always the busiest for UPS.UPS stock is down approximately 20% this year at $164 per share, mirroring the decline in the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index.Amazon (AMZN)Amazon LOGO ON THE SIDE OF A BUILDING.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comSpeaking of Amazon, the e-commerce giant made headlines around the world in October when it held a second Prime sales event for the year. Traditionally, Amazon’s Prime sales event has been held at Thanksgiving and tied into the Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales extravaganzas. However, Amazon decided to move up this year’s sales to October to try and kickstart holiday shopping early, and give its revenues a big boost in the fourth quarter.While exact sales figures for the October event have yet to be made public by Amazon, preliminary indications are that the company sold more than 100 million items during the two-day event. Additionally, Amazon should continue to benefit from strong e-commerce sales throughout this year’s holidays, especially around Black Friday and during the lead-up to Christmas. Like the other companies on this list, the fourth quarter is typically the strongest for Amazon.AMZN stock is down roughly 45% this year and trading at $90 per share. At this price, the stock is a true gift to investors.CVS Health (CVS)the exterior of a CVS pharmacy storeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comPharmacy retailer CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) just reported its third consecutive earnings beat. The Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based company’s stock popped 3% after it reported Q3 earnings per share of $2.09 versus $1.99 that was expected on Wall Street. Revenue for the July through September period came in at $81.16 billion compared to $76.75 billion that was expected by analysts.A big reason for the company’s continued strong earnings is revenue from CVS Health’s retail sales, which rose 7% year-over-year in the third-quarter. Those retail sales are likely to get a boost during the holidays as people turn to the company’s nearly 10,000 retail outlets for chocolates, stocking stuffers, and other items.December is also cold and flu season, and that should help CVS Health’s pharmacy services, which saw revenue climb 10% higher from a year ago during the most recent quarter. CVS stock is down only 6% this year, outperforming all the major U.S. stock indices.Southwest Airlines (LUV)a southwest airline stocks (LUV) jet flying above the cloudsSource: Carlos E. Santa Maria / Shutterstock.comLet’s not forget holiday travel. After two years of sheltering-in-place at home, Americans are again planning to travel during the holidays this year. Approximately 70% of Americans saying they plan to travel to visit family and friends for Thanksgiving and/or Christmas. Thus, airlines are seeking to capitalize on the busy travel season, with most having already raised their fares by 50% or more from mid-November through early January.One of the airlines most likely to benefit from the holiday travel boom is Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV). The world’s largest low-cost carrier and one of the busiest airlines in the U.S., Southwest carries more domestic passengers than any other airline in America. The company is rushing to resolve its staffing problems in the lead-up to Thanksgiving, announcing plans to hire more than 3,000 pilots this year and next.LUV stock is down 16% this year and trading at $37 per share.Best Buy (BBY)Image of Best Buy logo on storefront during daytime. retail stocksSource: BobNoah / Shutterstock.comAs a purveyor of consumer electronics such as smartphones, video game consoles, and Ultra High Definition (UHD) television sets, Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) is typically ground zero for both Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday sales. Consumers line-up around the country to crash the retailer’s Black Friday sales events at midnight the day after Thanksgiving, while millions more try to score deals online during Cyber Monday.Like the other retailers on this list, Best Buy got a jump on the holidays this year, offering exclusive sales to customers in October. Not only has the company offered early Black Friday deals, it has also announced exclusive offers to its “My Best Buy” members, which, it says, will continue through January as part of what it is calling “Member Mondays.” This strategy could power Best Buy to a strong fourth quarter.So far this year, BBY stock has fallen 34% to $67 a share.Molson Coors (TAP)Molson Coors (TAP) logo on a web browser magnified by a magnifying glassSource: OleksandrShnuryk / Shutterstock.comWe’ll end with a cup of holiday cheer. For that, investors should look to Chicago-based beverage giant and master brewer Molson Coors (NYSE:TAP). According to a survey published on the website Beveragedaily.com, Americans double their intake of alcohol between Thanksgiving and New Year’s, consuming eight alcoholic drinks a week compared to four during the rest of the year.The most popular alcoholic beverages during the holidays are eggnog (40%), coffee with Bailey’s (34%), beer (28%) and cider (27%). Molson Coors, which is the second largest brewer in the U.S. and third largest maker of alcoholic beverages in the world, is sure to benefit from an uptick in sales during the holidays.Strong year-end sales could further help TAP stock, which has benefitted from the economic reopening following the pandemic. Year-to-date, Molson Coors stock is up 5% at just under $50 per share, making it among the rare securities that are on the positive side of the ledger in 2022.Disclosure: On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

These multi-year grants are part of American Express’ Environmental, Social and Governance pillar to advance climate solutions with a goal to back low-carbon communities through at least $10 million in philanthropic funding by 2025.Earlier this year, the company announced $3.1 million in grants to support nature-based solutions and sustainability efforts in local communities. Including the grants in this announcement, American Express has now pledged over $8 million in grants towards its $10 million philanthropic goal.""Combating climate change starts at the local level as the negative impacts of climate-related events are experienced in local communities with regional organizations and leaders on the front lines driving action and disaster response,"" said Madge Thomas, Head of Corporate Sustainability and President of the American Express Foundation. ""We’ve seen the impact of extreme weather events in cities around the world, which is why we’re making it a priority to invest in initiatives that provide cities with infrastructure and tools to prepare for disasters, which can help them to remain safe and thriving centers of community, commerce and tourism.""American Express’ new partnerships include:$2.5 million to Ocean Conservancy to help scale the International Coastal Cleanup® (ICC) and the Urban Ocean® program -- two programs that partner with local groups in cities and coastal communities around the world to help prevent the flow of trash and plastic pollution into the ocean, promote resilience and protect ecosystems.

These systems lower energy costs for businesses and residents, can be more resilient during extreme weather, support local clean energy jobs, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.Story continues$150,000 to the Regional Plan Association to address climate change and disaster resilience in New York City and the greater tri-state region, including northern New Jersey and southeastern Connecticut. Coinciding with the 10-year anniversary of Super Storm Sandy this year, the grant will support the development of a Resilience Agenda for the tri-state region with goals, targets and actions for city leaders and policy makers, informed by research and engagement with community stakeholders. In addition, the grant will support events and workshops focused on opportunities to address and respond to climate change from the local to the regional level.To learn more about American Express’ ESG strategy to support colleagues, customers and communities, check out its 2021-2022 Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Report at https://go.amex/esg.ABOUT AMERICAN EXPRESSAmerican Express is a globally integrated payments company, providing customers with access to products, insights and experiences that enrich lives and build business success.

It is possible that the markets have ignored the company's differing financials and decided to lean-in to the negative sentiment. Fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes so it makes sense to study the company's financials. In this article, we decided to focus on Zimmer Biomet Holdings'  ROE.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Zimmer Biomet Holdings How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Zimmer Biomet Holdings is:2.4% = US$292m ÷ US$12b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.02 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Zimmer Biomet Holdings' Earnings Growth And 2.4% ROEIt is quite clear that Zimmer Biomet Holdings' ROE is rather low. Not just that, even compared to the industry average of 11%, the company's ROE is entirely unremarkable. Therefore, it might not be wrong to say that the five year net income decline of 27% seen by Zimmer Biomet Holdings was possibly a result of it having a lower ROE. However, there could also be other factors causing the earnings to decline. For instance, the company has a very high payout ratio, or is faced with competitive pressures.Story continuesHowever, when we compared Zimmer Biomet Holdings' growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 17% in the same period. This is quite worrisome.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is ZBH fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Zimmer Biomet Holdings Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Despite having a normal three-year median payout ratio of 30% (where it is retaining 70% of its profits), Zimmer Biomet Holdings has seen a decline in earnings as we saw above. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.Moreover, Zimmer Biomet Holdings has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 12% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 12%, over the same period.ConclusionOverall, we have mixed feelings about Zimmer Biomet Holdings. Even though it appears to be retaining most of its profits, given the low ROE, investors may not be benefitting from all that reinvestment after all. The low earnings growth suggests our theory correct. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.

Special items in 2021 included a loss on the early extinguishment of debt.""As we execute our strategy to create technology-enabled utilities of the future and deliver the clean energy transition reliably and affordably, we continue to demonstrate strong operational and financial performance,"" said PPL President and Chief Executive Officer Vincent Sorgi. ""Based on our financial performance year-to-date, we have increased the midpoint of our earnings forecast from $1.37 per share to $1.40 per share.""PPL also narrowed its 2022 ongoing earnings forecast to a range of $1.35 to $1.45 per share from the prior forecast range of $1.30 to $1.45 per share. As with the prior forecast, PPL's narrowed 2022 ongoing earnings guidance reflects a partial-year estimate of contributions from Rhode Island Energy, with the acquisition completed by PPL on May 25, 2022.Story continuesLooking forward, Sorgi said PPL also remains confident in its plan to deliver top-tier annual earnings per share and dividend growth of 6% to 8% annually. PPL's projected compound annual earnings per share and dividend growth of 6% to 8% through at least 2025 is based off its 2022 pro forma forecast range of $1.40 to $1.55 per share, with a midpoint of $1.48 per share. The pro forma forecast range reflects a full year of earnings contributions from Rhode Island Energy.Third-Quarter 2022 Earnings DetailsAs discussed in this news release, reported earnings are calculated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).

Reported earnings in the first nine months of 2021 included net special-item after-tax charges of $2.26 billion, or $2.93 per share, primarily attributable to discontinued operations associated with the U.K. utility business, a U.K. tax rate change and a loss on the early extinguishment of debt.Kentucky Regulated SegmentPPL's Kentucky Regulated segment primarily consists of the regulated electricity and natural gas operations of Louisville Gas and Electric Company and the regulated electricity operations of Kentucky Utilities Company.Reported earnings and earnings from ongoing operations in the third quarter of 2022 were even compared with a year ago. Factors driving earnings results primarily included share accretion, offset by other factors that were not individually significant.Reported earnings in the first nine months of 2022 increased by $0.08 per share compared with a year ago. Earnings from ongoing operations in the first nine months of 2022 increased by $0.10 per share compared with a year ago.

Earnings from ongoing operations in the third quarter of 2022 increased by $0.02 compared with a year ago.

The losses were primarily due to integration expenses and related costs associated with the acquisition, which were treated as special items. Adjusting for the special items, PPL's earnings from ongoing operations increased by $0.04 per share in the third quarter and $0.05 per share since acquisition due to the addition of Rhode Island Energy to PPL's ongoing earnings results.Corporate and OtherPPL's Corporate and Other category primarily includes financing costs incurred at the corporate level that have not been allocated or assigned to the segments, certain non-recoverable costs resulting from commitments made to the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers and the Rhode Island Attorney General's Office in conjunction with the acquisition of Rhode Island Energy, and certain other unallocated costs.Reported earnings in the third quarter of 2022 decreased by $0.03 per share compared with a year ago.

PPL management is not able to forecast whether any of these factors will occur or whether any amounts will be reported for future periods. Therefore, PPL is not able to provide an equivalent GAAP measure for earnings guidance.See the table at the end of this news release for a complete reconciliation of the earnings forecast.About PPLPPL Corporation (NYSE: PPL), based in Allentown, Pennsylvania, is a leading U.S. energy company focused on providing electricity and natural gas safely, reliably and affordably to 3.5 million customers in the U.S. PPL's high-performing, award-winning utilities are addressing energy challenges head-on by building smarter, more resilient and more dynamic power grids and advancing sustainable energy solutions.

Management utilizes ""Earnings from Ongoing Operations"" or ""Ongoing Earnings"" as a non-GAAP financial measure that should not be considered as an alternative to reported earnings, or net income, an indicator of operating performance determined in accordance with GAAP.

PPL, is set to announce earnings on Nov 4.Factors Likely to Influence Q3 Utility ResultsThe Zacks Utilities sector is expected to have benefited from a revival of demand in the commercial and industrial groups of customers. An improvement in economic conditions after the pandemic has been generating fresh demand for utility services.Domestic-focused companies operating in the sector are focused on cost management and implementation of energy-efficiency programs. New rates and customer additions have been creating fresh demand as well as assisting the utilities.Investment in strengthening the infrastructure has been allowing utilities to provide services even during extreme conditions, leading to stable earnings. Domestic-focused operations also insulate the utilities from the adverse impact of currency fluctuation.A clear transition is evident in the Utilities space, with companies operating in this space gradually moving toward clean sources of fuel to produce electricity and lower emission. The stringent regulations related to emissions and the high cost of conventional fuel and government incentives on the usage of clean fuel are also leading the utilities to focus more on clean energy sources. Many utilities have already pledged to provide 100% electricity from clean sources in the next few decades.Utilities need massive funds to upgrade, maintain and expand their infrastructure and operations and are capital-intensive. The performance of the utilities is likely to have been adversely impacted by the increase in interest rates from near-zero levels. The increase in borrowing costs and the possibility of more interest rate hikes this year may have further pushed up capital servicing expenses and adversely impacted earnings.Story continuesPer the updated outlook of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the July-September 2022 average contiguous U.S. temperature was 73.0°F, 2.8°F above average. The above-average temperature during the summer months is likely to have created a higher demand for water and electricity for cooling purposes, benefiting the utilities.Q3 ExpectationsTotal Q3 earnings of Utility stocks are expected to decline 8.4% year over year, while revenues are likely to improve 7.9%.For more details on quarterly releases, you can go through our latest Earnings Outlook.Utilities' Earnings in FocusLet's take a look at three utility companies that are scheduled to report third-quarter 2022 earnings on Nov 4 and find out how things have shaped up prior to the announcements.Dominion Energy delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 0.97%.  Favorable weather conditions in its service territories are expected to have boosted demand and contributed to earnings in the third quarter.However, higher interest expenses and share dilution are expected to have adversely impacted earnings in the third quarter (read more: What's in Store for Dominion Energy in Q3 Earnings?).According to the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

This change outpaced the S&amp;P 500's 1.06% loss on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.46%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.14%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the oil and gas exploration and production company had gained 4.96% over the past month. This has lagged the Oils-Energy sector's gain of 17.04% and outpaced the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.94% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Occidental Petroleum as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be November 8, 2022. The company is expected to report EPS of $2.48, up 185.06% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $9.35 billion, up 37.25% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $10.07 per share and revenue of $37.74 billion. These totals would mark changes of +294.9% and +43.43%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Occidental Petroleum should also be noted by investors. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Unfortunately, circumstances have not panned out well. Primarily, the Federal Reserve may be to “blame,” if you will. Due to wild fluctuations in the M2 money stock, investor sentiment understandably slipped.Now, before we begin this discussion of Reddit’s most popular meme stocks, it’s confession time. I’m not entirely sure whether these ideas represent the absolute most fashionable market plays. Instead, I elected names that various publications focused on while incorporating some diverse industries. That way, we’re not just talking about one specific sector.Further, I used Gurufocus.com to provide an objective ranking of the selected Reddit’s most popular meme stocks by financial stability. While you or I might not agree with the ranking itself, I simply stuck with what was presented. That way, we have an objective baseline to work with.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWithout further ado, here are Reddit’s most popular meme stocks ranked from best to worst.METAMeta Platforms$92.93AAPLApple$149.51NFLXNetflix$280.17AMZNAmazon$94.78OXYOccidental Petroleum$72.31BBBYBed Bath &amp; Beyond$4.30SOFISoFi Technologies$5.18Meta Platforms (META)Meta Written On The Googles - Man Wearing Virtual Reality Goggles Inside A Metaverse. FTC investigating META.Source: Aleem Zahid Khan / Shutterstock.comA social media giant turned into a metaverse specialist, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) undoubtedly saw itself in a different position than where it is right now. Bluntly speaking, the next generation of digital connectivity doesn’t look inspiring for Meta. Further, the company’s increased capital expenditures on its metaverse initiatives raise alarm among several analysts. At the time of writing, META hemorrhaged nearly 72% of equity value on a year-to-date basis.Despite the metaverse miscues, fundamental investors should see tremendous value in the otherwise sterling organization. For instance, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 29.2%, better than 79% of its peers. On the bottom line, Meta’s net margin is 24.4%, ranked better than 85% of the competition. As well, it features a return on equity (ROE) of nearly 23%, reflecting a very high-quality business.Story continuesPlus, you can make the case that META represents a significantly undervalued business. For example, its forward price-earnings ratio is 11.8 times, lower than the industry’s median of 15.7 times. Sure, as a name among Reddit’s most popular meme stocks, META presents risks. However, it’s arguably the smart way to speculate.Apple (AAPL)Close-up of Apple (AAPL) retail store Logo in Honolulu at the Ala Moana Center. Advertising the latest generation of the ipad, iphones, and ipods with a Retina display.Source: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.comOne of the most powerful companies in the world, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) utterly dominates the consumer electronics space. Still, even this dominance hasn’t been enough to spare AAPL from volatility. Since the beginning of this year, shares fell over 17%. Nevertheless, it’s a far better performance than what the underlying Nasdaq Composite index put up. It’s down over 31% during the same period.A major reason why Apple outperformed its tech peers centers on its brand power. Even with economic woes, consumers can’t get enough of Apple’s latest gadgets and gizmos. Naturally, this brand power shows up on the financials. For instance, Apple’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 20%, much higher than the hardware industry’s median rate of 2.85%.Additionally, the tech giant lights up the profitability angle. For example, its net margin stands at a whopping 25.3%. That’s ranked higher than almost 96% of the industry. Furthermore, the company’s ROE is over 160%, reflecting an extremely high business quality. As one of Reddit’s most popular meme stocks, you really can’t go wrong with AAPL.Netflix (NFLX)An image of a phone with the Netflix logo on the screen, laying next to a container of popcorn with popcorn splayed acrossSource: xalien / ShutterstockDuring the immediate aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) eventually made its way toward record highs. Essentially, the streaming service provider benefitted handsomely from a captive audience. But toward the latter half of 2021 and well into 2022, the revenge travel phenomenon took over. Suddenly, people wanted real experiences over digital ones, leaving NFLX reeling. Shares fell 52% YTD.Despite the turmoil, NFLX ranks among Reddit’s most popular meme stocks. Fundamentally, investors took great encouragement at Netflix beating expectations for the third quarter of 2022. What could be intriguing here is that the entertainment space may be on a pivot to the living room. Part of this dynamic may stem from consumers seeking cheaper means of entertainment. If so, NFLX may once again represent a handsome beneficiary.Financially, Netflix still delivers the goodies for prospective stakeholders. Both of its core revenue and profitability metrics stand well above industry norms. Plus, the company has a stable balance sheet, characterized by an Altman Z-Score of 4.53, indicating low bankruptcy risk.Amazon (AMZN)Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stockSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comWith economic headwinds brewing (in part due to the fluctuations and vagaries of Fed policy) consumer sentiment carries vulnerabilities. You know circumstances are bad when the storms also negatively impact e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). For once, Amazon understands what it’s like to get the wind knocked out of it. Since the beginning of the year, AMZN dropped over 43% of its equity value.While a tough pill to swallow for many stakeholders, AMZN consistently ranks among Reddit’s most popular meme stocks. Fundamentally, it’s not a bad place to put your money to work (even though right now, it’s getting worked). For example, Amazon’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 25.1%, above nearly 87% of its peers. Also, its book growth rate during the same period is 45.2%, higher than nearly 92% of the underlying sector.Further, Amazon enjoys some stability in the balance sheet, though the circumstances this year haven’t helped. Nevertheless, Amazon’s Altman Z-Score is nearly 3.7, which is still on the safe zone regarding potential bankruptcy risk.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comWith Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), we’re moving into the riskier realm of Reddit’s most popular meme stocks. To be clear, on paper, it doesn’t look that way. Since the January opener, OXY skyrocketed to the tune of almost 138%. Presently, Occidental enjoys a market capitalization of $67.6 billion. If anybody cleaned up during the wild events of 2022, it’s OXY.Of course, many meme traders jumped aboard Occidental because of legendary investor Warren Buffett’s enthusiasm for the energy company. So, while OXY might be one of Reddit’s most popular meme stocks, it doesn’t necessarily mean you should buy it. Primarily, Gurufocus.com labels Occidental’s business as significantly overvalued.At the moment, the company’s price-to-book ratio is 3.8 times, well above the oil and gas sector’s median of 1.35. As well, Occidental features a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.06 times, which is lower than 86% of its peers. In other words, while OXY isn’t a bad investment, better ideas exist.Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY)Hand holding a chart of hot stocks that are going up in valueSource: Shutter_M / ShutterstockEasily one of Reddit’s most popular meme stocks based on earlier hype this year, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) initially attracted contrarians based on its turnaround potential. Sadly, circumstances didn’t pan out that way, with key supporters dumping shares. Such actions demonstrated the capricious nature of meme trades, yet some folks decided to press on. Presently, BBBY incurred a loss of nearly 71% YTD.According to Gurufocus.com, BBBY may represent a possible value trap. For instance, you’ll notice that its price-to-sales ratio is 0.06 times, favorably below almost 98% of the competition. But then, you look at the three-year revenue growth rate (on a per-share basis) and you’ll notice that it’s negative. What should really scare folks about this figure is that shares outstanding generally declined over the past several quarters. If anything, revenue per share should increase since fewer shares are available to the public. That it still trends negatively suggests deeply seated problems. Unless you have good reason to invest in BBBY, most market participants should step away.SoFi Technologies (SOFI)An image of SoFi headquarters. SOFI stock.Source: Michael Vi / ShutterstockOne of the popular financial technology (fintech) firms, SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) generated plenty of buzz as a leading name among Reddit’s most popular meme stocks. However, the company continues to suffer fundamental challenges. Therefore, Wall Street has taken a dim view of SOFI stock. Since the start of the year, shares dropped over 63% in equity value.To be fair, SOFI did pop up on the Tuesday session by more than 5%. The underlying company beat expectations in the third quarter for revenue and pared down the expected earnings loss. One analyst mentioned that SoFi’s Q3 report was outstanding, leading to broader enthusiasm following the disclosure.While I’ll give credit where it’s due, it’s also important to realize that one quarterly report usually doesn’t change the entire narrative. Fundamentally, a major concern centers on share dilution. For instance, at the end of 2020, SoFi’s shares outstanding count hit 116.2 million. A year later, this metric ballooned to over 828 million. With myriad headwinds built into the economy, now might not be the best time to speculate on dilutive investments.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

(ARHS) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Right now, Arhaus, Inc. is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Ulta Beauty has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that ARHS has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.ARHS currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.03, while ULTA has a forward P/E of 19.06. We also note that ARHS has a PEG ratio of 0.77. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. ULTA currently has a PEG ratio of 1.37.Another notable valuation metric for ARHS is its P/B ratio of 9.12. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, ULTA has a P/B of 11.78.Based on these metrics and many more, ARHS holds a Value grade of B, while ULTA has a Value grade of C.ARHS is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.00bUS$4.57bUS$4.95bUS$5.40bUS$5.73bUS$6.02bUS$6.26bUS$6.47bUS$6.67bUS$6.85bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x5Est @ 6.2%Est @ 4.94%Est @ 4.05%Est @ 3.43%Est @ 2.99%Est @ 2.69% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.3% US$3.8kUS$4.0kUS$4.1kUS$4.2kUS$4.2kUS$4.2kUS$4.1kUS$4.0kUS$3.8kUS$3.7k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$40bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.8b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.3%– 2.0%) = US$162bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$162b÷ ( 1 + 6.3%)10= US$88bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$128b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$311, the company appears quite undervalued at a 38% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Vertex Pharmaceuticals as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.841. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Among his many achievements are National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) records at Georgetown, seven NBA All-Star recognitions, an NBA championship, an Olympic gold medal, and Hall-of-Fame inductions. At the height of his career, Mr. Mourning’s physicians noticed signs of kidney disease during a routine physical and conducted follow-up tests to confirm his diagnosis: a rare kidney disease now known as a form of AMKD. In 2003, he received a kidney transplant and resumed playing professional basketball, leading the Miami Heat to an NBA championship in 2006 before retiring in 2008. Years later, he learned that his disease was genetically driven. Mr. Mourning is now an advocate for kidney health and encourages others to be proactive as well.""I was on top of the basketball world when I first noticed symptoms of kidney disease, and the truth is if it weren’t for my pre-season physical, I probably would have continued to ignore them,"" said Mr. Mourning. ""Many people living with AMKD might not even know that they have this disease and may not be aware that it’s an inherited form of kidney disease, which is why we all need to be active participants in our health. This means knowing your family history of kidney disease, your risk of developing AMKD, and seeing your physician for regular checkups and possible testing. My hope is that Power Forward will serve as an inspiration for others to learn about kidney disease and take charge of their health — because when it comes to kidney disease, an early diagnosis and genetic testing are key.""Story continues""We are proud to partner with Alonzo Mourning to raise awareness of AMKD within communities in the U.S.,"" said Carmen Bozic, M.D., Executive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Officer, Vertex. ""Our teams are working tirelessly to advance a potential treatment for AMKD. At the same time, we recognize the immense need for greater disease awareness, education, and genetic testing resources within the kidney health community. We hope this partnership will empower others to be proactive about kidney health, and we’re excited to team up with Alonzo to work toward this goal.""Power Forward includes a toolkit of educational and actionable content for people who may be at risk for AMKD. This includes a discussion guide that can be used at doctors’ appointments, information on how to get tested if you are at risk for AMKD, and other educational resources. In addition to the Power Forward website, the campaign can be found on social media across Facebook (@PowerForwardTogether), Instagram (@PowerForwardTogether), and Twitter (@Power___Forward). Visit PowerForwardTogether.com to learn more.About AMKDAPOL1-mediated kidney disease is a form of chronic kidney disease associated with having two risk variants of the APOL1 gene and is estimated to affect 100,000 people in the U.S. and Europe. People who inherit two risk variants in the APOL1 gene have an increased risk of developing kidney disease and have a course of kidney disease that is far more aggressive than in the absence of the risk variants. Progressive kidney disease may result in death or the need for dialysis or kidney transplant.APOL1 risk variants are found in people of sub-Saharan African ancestry because they provide protection against human African trypanosomiasis — a parasitic disease endemic in parts of sub-Saharan Africa. In the U.S., an estimated 13% of all African Americans have two APOL1 risk variants and face a higher risk of developing kidney disease. APOL1 risk variants explain some of the disproportionate burden of kidney disease experienced by African Americans. Studies show that 23% of African Americans with hypertension-associated kidney disease and 54-73% of African Americans with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) have two APOL1 risk variants. Their disease is genetically driven: they have AMKD.AMKD is characterized by its rapid progression and like many forms of kidney disease, it lacks symptoms that are visible to the patient until the disease is advanced. Diagnosis depends on a urine test to detect proteinuria, and blood tests to detect reduced kidney function and the two APOL1 risk variants.About VertexVertex is a global biotechnology company that invests in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for people with serious diseases.

(NYSE:WM) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Waste Management The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Waste ManagementOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP &amp; COO, John Morris, for US$3.4m worth of shares, at about US$168 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$157. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).Waste Management insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider Ownership Of Waste ManagementLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Waste Management insiders own about US$113m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Waste Management Insider Transactions Indicate?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Waste Management shares in the last quarter. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Waste Management insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. For example - Waste Management has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.Of course Waste Management may not be the best stock to buy.

When you buy individual stocks, you can make higher profits, but you also face the risk of under-performance. Investors in Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) have tasted that bitter downside in the last year, as the share price dropped 40%. That's well below the market decline of 25%. At least the damage isn't so bad if you look at the last three years, since the stock is down 16% in that time. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 22% in the last 90 days. Of course, this share price action may well have been influenced by the 11% decline in the broader market, throughout the period.So let's have a look and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. View our latest analysis for Whirlpool To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Unhappily, Whirlpool had to report a 79% decline in EPS over the last year. The share price fall of 40% isn't as bad as the reduction in earnings per share. It may have been that the weak EPS was not as bad as some had feared.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Whirlpool's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Whirlpool's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Whirlpool, it has a TSR of -37% for the last 1 year. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 25% in the twelve months, Whirlpool shareholders did even worse, losing 37% (even including dividends). Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 1.0% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 4 warning signs for Whirlpool that you should be aware of before investing here.If you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

Severely overleveraged is not a good look in a rising-interest-rate environment like the one we are in right now.Finding such stocks isn’t difficult. To start, I’ll narrow down the S&amp;P 500 to only those stocks with yields of 5% or higher. That reduces the field to 27, according to Finviz.com. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThen I’ll select my three pitiful dividend stocks from the companies whose long-term debt exceeds their equity. The list of 13 companies includes many stocks whose shares have been beaten down over the past year.But putting together lists of stocks to sell is difficult because beauty is in the eye of the beholder. What I think is pitiful, you might believe is misunderstood. So do your due diligence on all three of these pitiful dividend stocks.  Boston Properties (BXP)An image of two people with a housing contract, hands holding a pen, hands holding a calculator with a house in the backgroundSource: 89stocker / ShutterstockBoston Properties (NYSE:BXP) has been a public company since June 1997, when it sold 31.4 million shares to the investing public for $25 apiece. At the time, it owned 63 office properties, two hotels, nine industrial properties, and one garage. Its properties totaled more than 11 million square feet.The REIT (real estate investment trust) now has 193 Class A office properties with 53.7 million square feet of premier workspace in Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. The properties generate $3 billion of annualized revenue and $1.8 billion of EBITDAre (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for real estate). Clearly, BXP has become a much bigger business. If you bought shares during the IPO, you have generated a compound annual growth rate of 8.4%, including dividends. That’s 1.1 percentage points better than the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust over the same period.Before the Great Recession,  BXP had only traded this low on one other occasion:  March 2020. Story continuesFitch Ratings, however, wrote earlier this month that the U.S. office utilization rate, while improving, will not return to levels seen before the pandemic. As a result, weaker properties face obsolescence under the “new normal.”Since the beginning of 2010, BXP stock has moved sideways. Its 5.4% yield shouldn’t be enough to get you to bite on this stock.Oneok Inc. (OKE)Illustration of oil pump jacks on sunset sky background to represent oil and gas stocksSource: ShutterstockIn 2022, Oneok Inc. (NYSE:OKE) is up 2.5%. That’s much better than the S&amp;P 500 has done, but it’s nowhere near the performance of the S&amp;P 500 energy sector, which was up 62% in 2022 as of Oct. 28.Analysts are relatively lukewarm about OKE stock. The average rating of the 22 who cover it is “hold,” and their mean price target is $67.Morningstar.com sector strategist Stephen Ellis likes the Oklahoma-based midstream service provider.     “Oneok brings together high-quality assets, some of the strongest near- to medium-term growth prospects in our coverage as Rockies volumes continue their ongoing rebound, a C-Corporation structure, and a well-respected management team in a compelling package,” Ellis wrote in August. While the company’s financial results in 2022 have been good, it’s difficult to determine why the stock has barely moved at a time when most energy stocks are up 20% or more in 2022.One possibility is its net debt. At the end of June, its total debt was $13.88 billion while it had just $135.77 million of cash for net debt of $13.74 billion, nearly four times its annualized EBITDA. Its shareholders can’t absorb another decline of oil and gas prices. Whirlpool (WHR)the Whirlpool (WHR) logo on a corporate buildingSource: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.comEarlier in 2022, I included Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) on a list of ten stocks that I thought had enough pricing power with consumers to pass on rising input costs to the end buyers of their household appliances. At the time, I argued that regression to the mean would eventually move its stock higher. I suggested that buying WHR stock under $200 would make investors money over the next two to three years. Since the end of February, it has tumbled more than 30%.On Oct. 20, Whirlpool reported that its Q3 results were affected by inflation and slowing demand for its products. However, it also said that 2022 would be the second-best year in its 111-year history. There is, however, no way around the fact that, through the nine months that ended on Sept. 30, its sales in 2022 were down by a double digit-percentage year-over-year.  Meanwhile, its free cash flow has fallen by more than $1 billion, dropping to -$24 million from $988 million a year ago. The company says it has a plan to overcome its current difficulties. I’m not so sure if it will work and neither are analysts. Their average rating on WHR stock is “hold“ with a median target price of $140, just barely higher than its current share price.If you don’t want to sell WHR, at the very least, I would wait for some confirmation that it’s on the right path to recovery before buying any more of its shares.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

461,9617ec35-7900-37f0-b07a-9bad8c5b61eb,SRE,2022-11-04,Here's What To Make Of Sempra's (NYSE:SRE) Decelerating Rates Of Return,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-sempras-nyse-sre-decelerating-111330206.html,1667560410,STORY,['SRE'],"[There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think Sempra (NYSE:SRE) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Sempra, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.044 = US$3.0b ÷ (US$76b - US$7.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, Sempra has an ROCE of 4.4%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return but it's around the Integrated Utilities industry average of 4.8%. Check out our latest analysis for Sempra roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Sempra compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsThere are better returns on capital out there than what we're seeing at Sempra. The company has employed 57% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 4.4%. Given the company has increased the amount of capital employed, it appears the investments that have been made simply don't provide a high return on capital.Our Take On Sempra's ROCEAs we've seen above, Sempra's returns on capital haven't increased but it is reinvesting in the business. Since the stock has gained an impressive 48% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.Story continuesOne final note, you should learn about the   4 warning signs  we've spotted with Sempra (including 2 which are a bit unpleasant) .While Sempra isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

The best stocks to buy on a dip could even be those that have defied the broader market to deliver a stellar performance in 2022. In the latter case, even a modest pullback may offer a chance to purchase shares at a slight discount before the next leg up.Today’s list of the best stocks to buy on a dip has examples of all of these. Whether trading at a steep discount or taking a momentary breather, these stocks all have the potential to deliver outsized short- and long-term profits for investors who are ready to move some cash off the sidelines and buy the dip now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAMZNAmazon$91.87CPRXCatalyst Pharmaceuticals$16.73SPOTSpotify$76.22TANInvesco Solar ETF$80.55SPWRSunPower$23.91PLUGPlug Power$15.08INMDInMode$35.51Amazon (AMZN)Logistics activity on the Amazon (AMZN) site of Vélizy-Villacoublay in France. Packages are sorted by workers on conveyors.Source: Frederic Legrand - COMEO / Shutterstock.comTo say investors were disappointed with tech giant Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) third-quarter results is an understatement. Shares are down more than 10% since the Oct. 27 announcement.Among investor qualms were lower-than-expected Q3 revenue, slowing cloud growth and an underwhelming forecast for the holiday quarter.Even the online retail and cloud services giant is feeling the sting of inflation. On the bright side, energy prices have come down meaningfully from their peak and there are signs that inflation is easing. While this helped boost stocks since October, Amazon has not been a beneficiary of the broader market rally.Yet, if the market continues higher in the short term based on continued economic optimism, AMZN stock should eventually move higher with it, especially if the company ends up beating its conservative Q4 guidance. Of course, in the long term, investors will likely look back on today’s price levels as a screaming deal in the stock.Story continuesCatalyst Pharmaceuticals (CPRX)A magnifying glass zooms in on the website of Catalyst Pharmaceuticals (CPRX).Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comCatalyst Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:CPRX), which develops drugs for rare diseases, is a buy-the-dip candidate that has bucked the broader market downtrend, with shares jumping 140% so far in 2022.Catalyst’s outperformance this year is largely due to the company’s strong financial results, which indicate rapid uptake of its drug, Firdapse.The Food and Drug Administration approved Firdapse in 2018 for the treatment of Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome, which affects around 3,000 people in the U.S., including 1,400 adults who are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed.Firdapse remains the only approved treatment in this rare disease market, and patients tend to stay on the medication once they start taking it.In the third quarter, the company reported revenue of $57.2 million, up 59% from a year ago. Strong Firdapse sales also helped the company beat analysts’ earnings estimates by a wide margin, reporting 26 cents per share versus their average 19-cent estimate.For the full year, analysts are expecting earnings to jump more than 45% to $210 million and EPS to surge nearly 100% to 73 cents. In 2023, they are calling for revenue growth of 18% to $248 million and earnings growth of 20% to 73 cents per share.CPRX stock is trading at 19.5 times next year’s earnings estimate, a very low valuation for a successful drugmaker. Expect shares to continue higher as the company captures more of the Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome patient market and expands its rare disease portfolio.SpotifySpotify (SPOT) logo is on the screen of a smartphone with headphones plugged in.Source: Kaspars Grinvalds / Shutterstock.comDespite the generally dreary U.S. ad market, Spotify (SPOT), is growing impressively.Despite high inflation and poor ad market trends, SPOT delivered positive free cash flow of 40 million euros last quarter.Spotify’s average revenue per user last quarter was only 0.53 euros. In the longer term, I believe that the company will find ways of generating even better results.SPOT stock is down 28% in the last three months and 67% in 2022, bringing its forward price-sales ratio to a very low level of slightly over one ($14.82 billion market cap/.average 2023 rev estimate of 14.13 billion euros or $14.65 billion).Invesco Solar ETF (TAN)Clean energy stocks: Rows of solar panels are lined up around a center aisle.Source: ShutterstockThe Invesco Solar ETF (NYSEARCA:TAN), a proxy for the solar energy industry, has taken investors on a wild ride in 2022.Shares peaked in mid-August, following the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which included billions in clean energy incentives. However, the stock has given a chunk of that back, trading closer to $80 today.It appears that the retreat is based on two main fears. The concern that the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act will hurt the American solar industry next year and that higher interest rates will hurt rooftop solar demand in the U.S.As I’ve stated in the past, given the tremendously pro-solar sentiment of the Biden administration, I do not expect it to enforce the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act in a way that will significantly damage the solar sector.Further, many companies whose stocks are owned by TAN such as GCL-Poly Energy Holdings and Daqo New Energy (NYSE:DQ) generate much more of their revenue from outside of America than within it.Finally, the rooftop sector does not represent a majority of the U.S. solar industry.SunPower (SPWR)a phone with the sunpower logo in front of a U.S. flagSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comSunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR) provides solar panels globally. Shares reversed lower in September and now sit below their September high. But they’ve also rallied 26% in the last month.The company should get a big boost from the EU’s upcoming mandate of solar panels on all new homes and buildings starting in 2030. In the U.S., the Inflation Reduction Act, which will implement 30% tax credits for all residential solar installations for the next decade, will give rooftop solar a big lift.As I mentioned earlier, I believe concerns about higher interest rates hurting solar panel demand are overdone. The balance sheets of American households remain quite strong, according to Fitch Ratings. The firm called U.S. consumer finances “robust,” noting, “Household debt service and leverage continue to be relatively low compared with historical standards.”Meanwhile, in the U.S. and even more so in Europe, electricity prices have risen sharply, greatly increasing consumers’ financial incentives to install rooftop solar panels. SPWR and its competitors should benefit meaningfully from this trend.Plug Power  (PLUG)Plug Power logo on computer screen. PLUG stock.Source: Postmodern Studio / ShutterstockPlug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG), which develops hydrogen fuel cell systems, is down 47% so far this year.Shares have not yet shown signs of putting in a bottom, making this one of the riskier of today’s best stocks to buy on a dip. However, the industry has huge growth potential and the company’s annual business update, scheduled for Jan. 4, 2023, could provide an upside catalyst for the stock.Between 2021 and 2031, the global green hydrogen market is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 46.5% to $31.6 billion. And recent industry deals show the sector is indeed heating up.For instance, in August, Plug said it struck a deal to provide 10,950 tons of liquified hydrogen per year to Amazon. The online retail giant, which already uses Plug Power’s fuel cells to power its electric forklifts, plans to use liquified hydrogen to fuel transportation and building operations beginning in 2025.Morgan Stanley believes Plug Power “will be a leader in the green hydrogen ecosystem.” The firm rates shares “overweight” with a $48 price target. That implies an upside potential of more than 200% from current levels.InMode (INMD)Blurred hospital images, Patient bed in the hospital, Hospital cleaning, Hospital disinfection cleaning, Patient bed cleaning for emergency patients. Medical Properties Trust (MPW)Source: venusvi / Shutterstock.comInMode (NASDAQ:INMD), a maker of radiofrequency-based medical products used in cosmetic procedures, delivered beat-and-raise Q3 results on Oct. 27.Shares initially popped following the announcement but have since fallen 8% from their post-earnings peak.On Oct. 12, before InMode reported its Q3 results, investment bank Jefferies initiated coverage of the name with a “buy” rating and a $40 price target. The analyst said “continued market growth, higher outside the U.S. penetration, share gains and pipeline contributions” should help InMode exceed analyst expectations.With a forward price-earnings ratio of just 13.8, put INMD on your list of the best stocks to buy on a dip.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer owned shares of PLUG and INMD.  The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Larry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Bank of America Corporation (BAC), AT&amp;T Inc. (T) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Bank of America shares have modestly underperformed the Zacks Major Banks industry over the past year (-23.7% vs. -22.7%), with the uncertain macroeconomic environment as the primary cloud on the horizon for the stock as well as the broader group.Bank of America’s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three and lagged in one of the trailing four quarters. Its third-quarter 2022 results were primarily aided by higher rates and loan growth. The opening of new financial centers, enhancement in digital capabilities and cost-saving efforts are expected to keep aiding the company’s financials.Moreover, supported by continued loan growth, Bank of America's top line is expected to improve further. Given the rise in interest rates, the company is expected to keep witnessing growth in margins in the near term.(You can read the full research report on Bank of America here &gt;&gt;&gt;)AT&amp;T shares have underperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (-25.7% vs. -14.1%). The Zacks analyst believes that the company is struggling with a steady decline in its legacy telephony Internet and wireline services. High-speed Internet revenues are also contracting due to a decline in the legacy digital subscriber line. With the divesture of WarnerMedia, AT&amp;T must build upon its core businesses to improve its value proposition as spectrum crisis and cord-cutting remain potent challenges. However, AT&amp;T reported solid third-quarter 2022 results with healthy wireless traction and customer additions. A customer-centric business model alongside a lower churn rate and higher-tier unlimited plans is providing robust growth in its postpaid wireless business. The company is actively investing in key areas of 5G and fiber to augment its fiber footprint. While optimizing operations, it is aiming to increase efficiencies to lower operating costs.(You can read the full research report on AT&amp;T here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Lockheed Martin have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+43.1% vs. -8.1%). The company remains the largest U.S. defense contractor that has a steady inflow of orders from its leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs.Steady contract flows and subsequent backlog growth bolster its long-term revenue prospects. The budgetary provisions tend to boost its business. Yet, America and Turkey's tiff as a result of the latter accepting Russian products might hurt its component supply from Turkey.Lockheed is facing performance issues concerning some of its products, which, in turn, may hurt its results. Also, an uncertainty revolving around the possible sanction by China on Lockheed might impact the latter.(You can read the full research report on Lockheed Martin here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include The Progressive Corporation (PGR), Constellation Brands, Inc. (STZ), and Biogen Inc. (BIIB).Sheraz Mian Director of ResearchNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

However, exposure to catastrophe loss remains a headwind.Beer Business to Boost Constellation Brands' (STZ) FeatPer the Zacks analyst, Constellation Brands is gaining from strength in beer business on robust consumer demand and share gains for its iconic brands, particularly Modelo Especial and Corona Extra.Biogen's (BIIB) Upcoming Product Launches May Revive GrowthThe Zacks analyst says that potential new product launches like lecanemab, zuranolone and additional biosimilars can help revive growth at Biogen, which is facing multiple challenges at present.Baker Hughes (BKR) Gains from Higher Oilfield Service OrderPer the Zacks analyst, Baker Hughes will secure handsome cash flows from higher oilfield services order intake. However, the company's rising costs and expenses remain a concern.Expanding User Base, Content Portfolio Aids SiriusXM (SIRI)Per the Zacks analyst, SiriusMX is benefiting from strength in subscriber base backed by a solid content portfolio and expanded podcast efforts.Albertsons' (ACI) Strong Digital Endeavors to Boost SalesPer the Zacks analyst, Albertsons Companies has been directing resources toward expanding digital and omni-channel capabilities. The company's second-quarter digital sales rose 36% year on year.Watsco (WSO) Benefits From E-Commerce Business, AcquisitionsPer the Zacks analyst, strength in the e-commerce business, accretive acquisitions and focuses on enhancing shareholder value via dividend hikes are benefiting Watsco.New UpgradesHigher Revenues, Loans &amp; Deposits Support Cullen/Frost (CFR) Per the Zacks analyst, Cullen/Frost's rising revenues is a positive backed by strong loan growth and rising interest rates. Additional branch openings in strategic regions will enhance market share.Diversified Portfolio and Strengthening Backlog Aid FLEXPer the Zacks analyst, Flex's performance benefited from strong revenue growth across all business segments owing to ongoing secular trends. Also, rising customer backlogs are major tailwinds.Insperity (NSP) Strong on Pro-Investor Steps, Solid Top LineThe Zacks analyst is positive about Insperity's top-line growth, driven by a rise in average number of worksite employees paid per month. Also, investor-aiding steps are a tailwind.New DowngradesSupply-Chain Constraints &amp; High Costs Hurt Kennametal (KMT)The Zacks analyst is concerned about persistent supply chain constraints and high raw material costs, which are affecting Kennametal's margins and profits.Knight-Swift (KNX) Grapples With Rising Operating ExpensesPer the Zacks Analyst, high costs related to driver wages, equipment, maintenance, fuel and other expenses are increasing Knight-Swift's operating expenses. This is likely to weigh on the bottom line.Match Group (MTCH) Hurt by Higher Investments &amp; Debt BurdenPer the Zacks analyst, higher investments in Tinder along with higher-than-expected data costs and professional fees might limit margin expansion. Further, highly leveraged balance sheet is a concern.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

484,f712b582-35f8-38d7-bf87-b1cbb48d2342,VLO,2022-11-04,7 Energy Stocks to Buy Before the Market Starts to Soar in 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-energy-stocks-buy-market-170225192.html,1667408545,STORY,"['PFIE', 'EPSN', 'VLO', 'EPM', 'WDS', 'DRQ']","[While the concept of energy stocks to buy might seem overdone at this point of the year, the segment may still offer substantial upside. Fundamentally, one of the catalysts that sparked the wild rally centered on the Federal Reserve. Specifically, its accommodative policies during the initial wave of the coronavirus pandemic blew up the money stock. Now, we’re dealing with the consequences of high inflation. Still, the Fed isn’t the only factor bolstering energy stocks to buy.Geopolitically, 2022 has been a tense and bloody year, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine still ongoing. Further, the Kremlin decided to cut hydrocarbon outflows to Europe, sparking serious concerns about the coming winter. With supply artificially limited against a rising demand backdrop, the energy sector will likely see value appreciation.Nevertheless, not every player among energy stocks to buy presents an equally bullish narrative. To help guide prospective investors to make an appropriate decision for them, I used Gurufocus.com to filter out market ideas that are relatively underappreciated. These trades could offer far greater returns than something that’s already running red hot.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsVLOValero Energy$127.89WDSWoodside Energy$23.63PFIEProfire Energy$1.02DRQDril-Quip$24.05EPMEvolution Petroleum$8.12EPSNEpsilon Energy$7.09SOISolaris Oilfield$12.20Valero Energy (VLO)energy stocksSource: ShutterstockBased in San Antonio, Texas, Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) is an international manufacturer and marketer of transportation fuels, other petrochemical products, and power. Due to unprecedented relevancies, Valero absolutely soared, similar to other energy stocks to buy. On a year-to-date basis, VLO gained over 68%. Further, in the trailing month, shares swung higher by nearly 16%.Following such a robust move, you might think that VLO would be overvalued at this point. However, the opposite rings true, at least according to Gurufocus.com. The investment resource rates the investment as modestly undervalued. For instance, VLO trades for 5.5 times trailing-12-month (TTM) earnings. In contrast, the industry median price-earnings ratio is 8.9 times. Just as importantly, Valero enjoys stability in the balance sheet. Primarily, the company features an Altman Z-Score of 5.36, reflecting very low bankruptcy risk. Also, its debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 0.75, favorably below 73% of the competition. Thus, if you’re looking for discounted energy stocks to buy that will also allow you to sleep easier, VLO may be it.Story continuesWoodside Energy (WDS)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comBased in Perth, Australia, Woodside Energy (NYSE:WDS) is a petroleum exploration and production company. Per its public profile, Woodside also represents Australia’s largest independent dedicated oil and gas company. It’s one of the top-performing energy stocks to buy, with WDS shares returning 49% YTD. Momentum also runs strong recently, with WDS moving up 11% in the trailing month. Financially, Woodside draws much intrigue among investors looking into the hydrocarbon space because of its stability. For example, the company features a cash-to-debt ratio of 3.16 times, ranked higher than nearly 70% of its peers. While cash always presents pertinence, it’s especially critical now due to broader macroeconomic vagaries. So, if the smelly stuff hits the proverbial fan, WDS may be able to better weather the storm than its rivals.Just as well, Woodside represents a profitability machine. For instance, the company’s net margin stands at 31.7%, ranked higher than almost 85% of the competition. In addition, Woodside’s return on equity pings above 17%, reflecting a quality enterprise.Profire Energy (PFIE)Businessman is drawing a growing virtual hologram stock bar chart on dark blue background representing value stocksSource: Costello77 / ShutterstockFounded in 2002, Profire Energy (NASDAQ:PFIE) is an oilfield technology company. Specifically, Profire specializes in the design of burner-management systems and other combustion-management technologies. Unlike many other energy stocks to buy, though, PFIE finds itself in the red. Since the beginning of this year, shares dipped over 7% below parity. However, in the trailing month, PFIE popped up by 10% exactly. For contrarian speculators, this dynamic may open an opportunity. That’s because, unlike your standard market-related gamble, Profire brings the fundamentals to the table. For instance, its cash-to-debt ratio stands at a whopping 53.3 times. In contrast, the industry median is only 0.51 times. This metric provides greater flexibility for Profire if broader circumstances go awry.Additionally, investors should note that the company’s Altman Z-Score stands at 6.55. This indicates very low bankruptcy risk, providing reassurance in a typically volatile sector. Finally, Profire features a profitable track record, with eight years of consecutive positive earnings during the past decade. Therefore, PFIE provides a reasonable platform to roll the dice on energy stocks to buy.Dril-Quip (DRQ)Source: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Houston, Texas, Dril-Quip (NYSE:DRQ) represents one of the world’s leading manufacturers of precision-engineered offshore drilling and production equipment. Its products provide effective solutions for deepwater, harsh environments, and severe service applications. Since the beginning of the year, DRQ gained a relatively modest 10%. However, in the trailing month, shares swung up 12%.While the underlying business itself (which serves the upstream component of the hydrocarbon sector) presents myriad relevancies, during these uncertain times, cash is king. Dril-Quip has plenty of it. Per its balance sheet, the company’s cash-to-debt ratio stands at a stunning 66.7 times. Again, the industry median metric sits at only 0.51 times. Combined with an Altman Z-Score of 7.13, DRQ epitomizes one of the most resilient energy stocks to buy. Plus, as a bonus, it features other intriguing stats. For instance, its three-year free cash flow (FCF) growth rate is 30.4%, better than 72% of the industry. Also, the company enjoys six years of consecutive profitability in the trailing decade.Evolution Petroleum (EPM)Natural Gas Combined Cycle Power Plant with sunset and light orange. Best natural gas stocks to buy.Source: Rangsarit Chaiyakun / Shutterstock.comAlso headquartered in Houston, Texas, Evolution Petroleum (NYSEAMERICAN:EPM) is an independent energy company focused on maximizing total returns to its shareholders through the ownership of and investment in onshore oil and natural gas properties in the U.S., per its website. Since the January opener, EPM gained a very healthy 52.3%. In the trailing month, EPM moved up nearly 9%.Fundamentally, what sticks out the most for Evolution Petroleum is its income-statement metrics. On the top line, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 35.9%, rated higher than nearly 93% of the competition. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the aforementioned period is 25.2%, better than 75% of its peers. On the bottom line, Evolution’s net margin pings just under 30%. In contrast, the industry median is only 3.91%. As well, the company’s return on equity sits just south of 52%, reflecting an extremely high-quality business.Plus, as a bonus, Gurufocus.com rates EPM as a significantly undervalued investment based on proprietary calculations. Thus, if you’re looking for under-the-radar energy stocks to buy, EPM may intrigue certain market participants.Epsilon Energy (EPSN)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comAnother underappreciated player among energy stocks to buy, Epsilon Energy (NASDAQ:EPSN) also hails from the Lone Star State. An independent firm, Epsilon engages in the acquisition, development, gathering, and production of oil and gas reserves. From the beginning of the year, the ticker EPSN (not to be confused with the sports channel ESPN) gained 24%. Also, in the trailing month, the stock gained 11%.Primarily, Epsilon will attract investors in energy stocks to buy because of its fiscal stability. The company has no debt, making it elite within the sector. Not surprisingly, Epsilon also carries an Altman Z-Score of 5.7, reflecting low bankruptcy risk. Again, should outside circumstances go awry, EPSN represents one of the few companies in the space that can absorb shocks. But it’s not just a punching bag either. Epsilon features tremendously strong profitability margins. For instance, its gross, operating, and net margins stand at 73.3%, 63.4%, and 42.7%, respectively. Additionally, the company’s return on equity of 32.7% beats out 80% of the competition, making it a very high-quality business.Solaris Oilfield (SOI)oil pumpsSource: Thaiview / Shutterstock.comIf you want to gamble heavily in energy stocks to buy, Solaris Oilfield (NYSE:SOI) may have something for you. Specializing in providing solutions to optimize wellsite safety, Solaris helps energy infrastructures run at maximum efficiency. Unfortunately, Wall Street didn’t feel safe with Solaris’ third-quarter earnings report, where the company posted worse-than-expected sales results. In turn, SOI plunged nearly 20% in the Nov. 1 session.For the year, though, SOI gained a robust 56%. And even with the Tuesday loss, shares gained almost 11% in the trailing month. That suggests that Solaris may be a resilient business that merely suffered a blip (albeit a sharp one). Over time, it can make up for the losses, suggesting that contrarians should buy the dip.It’s a complicated and risky narrative to be sure. However, one factor that could sway certain traders is the balance sheet. With a cash-to-debt ratio of 1.75 times (better than nearly 66% of the competition), Solaris enjoys fiscal stability.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

This compares to FFO of $0.96 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of -1.05%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this shopping center real estate investment trust would post FFO of $0.95 per share when it actually produced FFO of $1, delivering a surprise of 5.26%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates three times.Regency Centers , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry, posted revenues of $303.99 million for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.76%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $307.38 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Regency Centers shares have lost about 19.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -21.1%.What's Next for Regency Centers?While Regency Centers has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Regency Centers: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus FFO estimate is $0.96 on $303.07 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.96 on $1.23 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, REIT and Equity Trust - Retail is currently in the bottom 38% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the broader Zacks Finance sector, Root, Inc. (ROOT), is yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on November 9.This company is expected to post quarterly loss of $6.01 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +36.9%.

A copy of the Company’s third quarter 2022 supplemental package will be available on the Company's website at investors.regencycenters.com or by written request to: Investor Relations, Regency Centers Corporation, One Independent Drive, Suite 114, Jacksonville, Florida, 32202. The supplemental package contains more detailed financial and property results including financial statements, an outstanding debt summary, acquisition and development activity, investments in partnerships, information pertaining to securities issued other than common stock, property details, a significant tenant rent report and a lease expiration table in addition to earnings and valuation guidance assumptions. The information provided in the supplemental package is unaudited and includes non-GAAP measures, and there can be no assurance that the information will not vary from the final information in the Company’s Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2022. Regency may, but assumes no obligation to, update information in the supplemental package from time to time.Non-GAAP DisclosureWe believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to our Board of Directors, management and investors regarding certain trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. Our management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses, purposes of determining management incentive compensation and budgeting, forecasting and planning purposes.We do not consider non-GAAP measures an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, rather they supplement GAAP measures by providing additional information we believe to be useful to our shareholders. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is they may exclude significant expense and income items that are required by GAAP to be recognized in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, they reflect the exercise of management’s judgment about which expense and income items are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. In order to compensate for these limitations, reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures we use to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be relied upon in evaluating the financial condition, results of operations or future prospects of the Company.Nareit FFO is a commonly used measure of REIT performance, which the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit”) defines as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains on sale and impairments of real estate, net of tax, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Regency computes Nareit FFO for all periods presented in accordance with Nareit's definition. Since Nareit FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and gains on sales and impairments of real estate, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact on operations from trends in percent leased, rental rates, operating costs, acquisition and development activities, and financing costs. This provides a perspective of the Company’s financial performance not immediately apparent from net income determined in accordance with GAAP. Thus, Nareit FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of the Company's operating performance, which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP; and, therefore, should not be considered a substitute measure of cash flows from operations. The Company provides a reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders to Nareit FFO.Core Operating Earnings is an additional performance measure that excludes from Nareit FFO: (i) transaction related income or expenses; (ii) gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt; (iii) certain non-cash components of earnings derived from above and below market rent amortization, straight-line rents, and amortization of mark-to-market of debt adjustments; and (iv) other amounts as they occur. The Company provides a reconciliation of Net Income to Nareit FFO to Core Operating Earnings.Forward-Looking StatementsCertain statements in this document regarding anticipated financial, business, legal or other outcomes including business and market conditions, outlook and other similar statements relating to Regency’s future events, developments, or financial or operational performance or results such as our 2022 Guidance, are “forward-looking statements” made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are identified by the use of words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “estimate,” “believe,” “intend,” “forecast,” “anticipate,” “guidance,” and other similar language. However, the absence of these or similar words or expressions does not mean a statement is not forward-looking. While we believe these forward-looking statements are reasonable when made, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and undue reliance should not be placed on these statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance these expectations will be attained, and it is possible actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Our operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those risk factors described in our SEC filings. When considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully read and consider these risks, together with all other information in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our other filings and submissions to the SEC. If any of the events described in the risk factors actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results, as well as the market price of our securities, could be materially adversely affected. Forward-looking statements are only as of the date they are made, and Regency undertakes no duty to update its forward-looking statements except as required by law. These risks and events include, without limitation:Risk Factors Relating to Current Economic ConditionsRising interest rates, as we have seen in 2022, may adversely affect the cost of and our ability to borrow, the valuation of our real estate, and our stock price. Current economic conditions and challenges may adversely impact our tenants and, therefore, our ability to lease space and the level of rent we may be able to charge.Risk Factors Related to Pandemics or other Health CrisesPandemics or other health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect our tenants’ financial condition, the profitability of our properties, and our access to the capital markets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.Risk Factors Related to Operating Retail-Based Shopping CentersEconomic and market conditions may adversely affect the retail industry and consequently reduce our revenues and cash flow, and increase our operating expenses. Shifts in retail trends, sales, and delivery methods between brick and mortar stores, e-commerce, home delivery, and curbside pick-up may adversely impact our revenues and cash flows. Changing economic and retail market conditions in geographic areas where our properties are concentrated may reduce our revenues and cash flow. In addition, labor challenges and supply delays and shortages due to a variety of macroeconomic factors, including inflationary pressures, could affect the retail industry. Our success depends on the continued presence and success of our “anchor” tenants. A significant percentage of our revenues are derived from smaller “shop space” tenants and our net income may be adversely impacted if our smaller shop tenants are not successful. We may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy. Many of our costs and expenses associated with operating our properties may remain constant or increase, even if our lease income decreases. Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and fire, safety and other regulations may have a negative effect on us.Risk Factors Related to Real Estate InvestmentsOur real estate assets may decline in value and be subject to impairment losses which may reduce our net income. We face risks associated with development, redevelopment and expansion of properties. We face risks associated with the development of mixed-use commercial properties. We face risks associated with the acquisition of properties. We may be unable to sell properties when desired because of market conditions. Changes in tax laws could impact our acquisition or disposition of real estate.Risk Factors Related to the Environment Affecting Our PropertiesClimate change may adversely impact our properties directly, and may lead to additional compliance obligations and costs as well as additional taxes and fees. Geographic concentration of our properties makes our business more vulnerable to natural disasters, severe weather conditions and climate change. Costs of environmental remediation may impact our financial performance and reduce our cash flow.Risk Factors Related to Corporate MattersAn increased focus on metrics and reporting relating to environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks. An uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the insurance coverage on our properties may subject us to loss of capital and revenue on those properties. Failure to attract and retain key personnel may adversely affect our business and operations. The unauthorized access, use, theft or destruction of tenant or employee personal, financial or other data or of Regency’s proprietary or confidential information stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf could impact our reputation and brand and expose us to potential liability and loss of revenues.Risk Factors Related to Our Partnerships and Joint VenturesWe do not have voting control over all of the properties owned in our co-investment partnerships and joint ventures, so we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued. The termination of our partnerships may adversely affect our cash flow, operating results, and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders.Risk Factors Related to Funding Strategies and Capital StructureOur ability to sell properties and fund acquisitions and developments may be adversely impacted by higher market capitalization rates and lower NOI at our properties which may dilute earnings. We depend on external sources of capital, which may not be available in the future on favorable terms or at all. Our debt financing may adversely affect our business and financial condition. Covenants in our debt agreements may restrict our operating activities and adversely affect our financial condition. Increases in interest rates would cause our borrowing costs to rise and negatively impact our results of operations. Hedging activity may expose us to risks, including the risks that a counterparty will not perform and that the hedge will not yield the economic benefits we anticipate, which may adversely affect us. The interest rates on our Unsecured Credit facilities as well as on our variable rate mortgages and interest rate swaps might change based on changes to the method in which LIBOR or its replacement rate is determined.Risk Factors Related to the Market Price for Our SecuritiesChanges in economic and market conditions may adversely affect the market price of our securities. There is no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates.Risk Factors Relating to the Company’s Qualification as a REITIf the Company fails to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, it would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates. Dividends paid by REITs generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates. Certain foreign stockholders may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on gain recognized on a disposition of our common stock if we do not qualify as a “domestically controlled” REIT. Legislative or other actions affecting REITs may have a negative effect on us. Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities.Risk Factors Related to the Company’s Common StockRestrictions on the ownership of the Company’s capital stock to preserve its REIT status may delay or prevent a change in control. The issuance of the Company's capital stock may delay or prevent a change in control. Ownership in the Company may be diluted in the future.Christy McElroy904 598 7616ChristyMcElroy@regencycenters.com]"

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Procter &amp; GambleIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the President, Jon Moeller, sold US$4.5m worth of shares at a price of US$149 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$132). So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.Insiders in Procter &amp; Gamble didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At Procter &amp; Gamble Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Procter &amp; Gamble shares. In total, insiders sold US$26m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Insider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Procter &amp; Gamble insiders own 0.07% of the company, currently worth about US$219m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Procter &amp; Gamble Tell Us?Insiders haven't bought Procter &amp; Gamble stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. But it is good to see that Procter &amp; Gamble is growing earnings. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. You'd be interested to know, that we found 2 warning signs for Procter &amp; Gamble and we suggest you have a look.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

495,f4221f41-84e7-3069-b898-91dd06efe08c,PG,2022-11-04,7 Dow Stocks Set to Soar From 52-Week Lows,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-dow-stocks-set-soar-162221198.html,1667319741,STORY,"['DIS', 'INTC', 'WBA', 'CSCO', 'HD', 'PG']","[Representing some of the biggest names across various industries, the companies listed in the Dow Jones usually facilitate a great starting point for newbie investors. Featuring established track records, Dow stocks typically deliver the goods. And if they don’t, they risk getting the boot. However, the circumstances of the post-pandemic new normal opens doors for contrarian investors.Since the start of the year, the venerable index has fallen 11%, which to be fair is much better than other indices. Still, that’s a double-digit loss, which means several Dow stocks trade in the red. Though some might deserve the crimson stain, others may symbolize potential upside opportunities. This article will focus on the latter.DISWalt Disney$107.25CSCOCisco$45.31INTCIntel$28.13WBAWalgreens Boots Alliance$36.38PGProcter &amp; Gamble$135.24HDHome Depot$296.11GSGoldman Sachs$347.38InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDisney (DIS)Disney logo on a store front. DIS stock.Source: chrisdorney / ShutterstockOne of the powerhouses of the entertainment industry, Disney (NYSE:DIS) usually finds itself dictating terms. However, this year flipped the narrative on the Magic Kingdom. On a year-to-date basis, DIS stock fell 32%, reflecting steep concerns regarding its underlying viability and relevance. At the moment, Disney features a market capitalization of $194 billion.Despite the volatility, Disney may represent one of the Dow stocks to buy based on possibly emerging demand. Back during the heart of the coronavirus pandemic, Disney enjoyed a captive audience. However, revenge travel – or the demand for real experiences following two years of cabin fever – undid much good.Nevertheless, the apparent bounce back of content streaming services implies that entertainment is pivoting back to the living room. If so, this augurs well for DIS as one of the Dow stocks to buy. Additionally, Disney enjoys a strong financial track record. For instance, the company has nine years of consecutive profitability in the trailing decade.Story continuesCisco (CSCO)cisco (CSCO) logo on an office buildingSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in San Jose, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) specializes in digital communications technology. Specifically, it develops, manufactures and sells networking hardware, software, telecommunications equipment and other high-technology services and products, per its corporate profile. Presently, Cisco features a market cap of $186 billion. Since the beginning of the year, CSCO lost 29% of equity value.Although it’s not the most encouraging look, CSCO makes a case for Dow stocks to buy. Fundamentally, boring companies like Cisco offer safe-ish, risk-off exposure. That might pay dividends (metaphorically speaking) during these uncertain times.Speaking of dividends, the company also pays them literally, with a forward yield of 3.4%. Also note the payout ratio of 43.14%, which is arguably reasonable given the troubled macroeconomic circumstances.Financially, Cisco brings two weapons to the table. First, it features a stable balance sheet, with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.57 times (under the industry median of 1.83.) More impressively, it features excellent profitability. For instance, its net margin of 23% ranks better than nearly 95% of its peers. Thus, CSCO is one of the Dow stocks you can’t afford to ignore.Intel (INTC)Close up of Intel sign at their San Jose campus in Silicon ValleySource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comAlthough the circumstances of 2022 have been awful for myriad industries, few have felt the pain like semiconductors. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) provides more than enough material. With global supply chain disruptions disproportionately impacting the chipmakers, firms like Intel endured a new normal within the new normal. Unfortunately, the dour environment hurt INTC, sending shares down almost 47% YTD.Though an ugly loss, contrarians may want to target Intel as one of the Dow stocks to buy. Fundamentally, the innovation space usually bounces back from hardships. Plus, Intel represents too important of an entity to simply waste away. Specifically, its investments and leadership in areas such as data centers may help lift INTC above the muck.If narratives aren’t your thing, then hard data provides a compelling case for the tech firm. According to Gurufocus, INTC rates as a “significantly undervalued” investment. Currently, INTC is priced at less than 9 times trailing-12-month, or TTM, earnings. In contrast, the industry median is 15.3 times.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)Walgreens (WBA) store exterior and sign in Pompano Beach, FloridaSource: saaton / Shutterstock.comAn American-British-Swiss holding company, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) owns the retail pharmacy chains Walgreens and Boots, as well as several pharmaceutical manufacturing and distribution companies. At the moment, Walgreens carries a market cap of $31.3 billion. Since the beginning of this year, WBA dropped over 31% of equity value.Fundamentally, WBA appears poised to benefit from everyday relevance. While its pharmacy business certainly caters to the post-pandemic new normal, stuff happens all the time. From the common cold to the flu to tummy aches, the human body occasionally needs assistance.Investors can tether their portfolios to this constant (arguably inelastic) demand stream while also collecting a forward yield of 5.4%. Not only is this yield generous, but the payout ratio is 43%. Again, this might be reasonable based on the circumstances.Financially, Walgreens presents an attractive case for Dow stocks to buy because of its discount. Per Gurufocus, WBA trades for 7.3 times TTM earnings. In contrast, the industry median is a lofty 22.2 times.Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)A photo of a number of Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) products.Source: monticello / Shutterstock.comWhen faced with troubling economic circumstances, investors should typically target boring Dow stocks. Frankly, it doesn’t get more boring than Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG). About the only thing that’s exciting about this company was that at one point, the firm sued individuals spreading false rumors about its links to Satanism. Aside from that, PG merely represents a household goods giant.Unfortunately for stakeholders, PG suffered unusually steep losses, down over 17% YTD. Frankly, this seems to run counter with established fundamentals and logic. Therefore, it really should be one of the Dow stocks to buy.For instance, the company pays a forward yield of 2.7%. While not the most generous source of passive income, here’s the deal: Procter &amp; Gamble has 66 years of consecutive dividend increases. Believe me, management will not let that simply fade without good reason.Also, the company represents a profitability machine. For example, its net margin is 18%, ranking better than over 91% of its rivals.Home Depot (HD)the outside of a home depot storeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comOn surface level, it’s understandable why Home Depot (NYSE:HD) stands among the Dow stocks suffering sharp losses. Since the beginning of the year, HD dropped more than 28% of equity value. That’s unusual for the home improvement stalwart. Then again, the deterioration of the real estate market – a victim of rising mortgage rates – doesn’t help matters.Still, you can probably guess my next words: HD represents one of the Dow stocks to buy. Fundamentally, Home Depot doesn’t just cater to housing booms. Irrespective of economic conditions, things just foul up around the home, in some cases quite literally. Therefore, the company’s demand flow is at least partially inelastic.Another factor to consider is that Home Depot brings the heat regarding income-statement metrics. For example, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 14.7%, above nearly 79% of its peers. Also, its net margin is nearly 11%, ranked better than over 86% of the industry.Goldman Sachs (GS)In this photo illustration the Goldman Sachs Group (GS) logo displayed on a smartphone screen and a stock market graph in the backgroundSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comFinally, we arrive at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), easily the riskiest name on this list of Dow stocks as far as I’m concerned. Logically, the main headwind for GS centers on global recession fears. With several central banks bolstering their currencies through the unwinding of balance sheets, the resultant money tightening imposes deflationary forces. That is, hawkish monetary policies should spark the opposite outcome of dovishness (i.e. inflation.)Frankly, if Goldman Sachs and other institutions had an option, they might (though it’s speculation) prefer inflation. Sure, deflation brings higher borrowing costs, thus benefiting lenders via increased profitability. But deflation also hurts business sentiment. At least with inflation, people have an incentive to spend money because of currency erosion, thus boosting economic activity.So, why gamble on GS when it’s down 13% this year? Simply, deflationary forces boost Goldman’s wealth management arm with extra relevance. Under an ecosystem of rising prices, anyone can be a stock-picking god. But the real experts know how to make money during economic downturns. Since Goldman clearly has a resource advantage over the little guys in the financial advisory space, it just might outperform.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

500,b399b286-968a-36f0-9484-923d8d439552,DHI,2022-11-04,"Is D.R. Horton, Inc.'s (NYSE:DHI) Latest Stock Performance A Reflection Of Its Financial Health?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/d-r-horton-inc-nyse-155948325.html,1667491188,STORY,['DHI'],"[Most readers would already be aware that D.R. Horton's (NYSE:DHI) stock increased significantly by 6.3% over the past month. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on D.R. Horton's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. Check out our latest analysis for D.R. Horton How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for D.R. Horton is:30% = US$5.6b ÷ US$18b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.30 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of D.R. Horton's Earnings Growth And 30% ROETo begin with, D.R. Horton has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 23% the company's ROE is quite impressive. So, the substantial 35% net income growth seen by D.R. Horton over the past five years isn't overly surprising.As a next step, we compared D.R. Horton's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 28%.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. If you're wondering about D.R. Horton's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is D.R. Horton Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?D.R. Horton's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 9.7%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 90% of its profits. So it looks like D.R. Horton is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth.Moreover, D.R. Horton is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 9.3% of its profits over the next three years. Still, forecasts suggest that D.R. Horton's future ROE will drop to 15% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with D.R. Horton's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out George Soros Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Large-Cap Stock Picks. George Soros, a Hungarian-American businessman, founded Soros Fund Management in 1970. Soros Fund Management is a New York-based hedge fund which carved its place as one of the most profitable funds on Wall Street, however, it is now structured as a family office. The George Soros stock portfolio is worth $5.6 billion as of the second quarter of 2022, and the billionaire makes highly leveraged investments keeping in mind the currency movements and commodity prices, as well as fundamental macroeconomic and market analysis. The condition of the housing market also plays an important role in his investment decisions. Soros tends to invest in large-cap, small-cap, exchange traded funds, and both growth and value plays. Large-cap stocks are usually perceived as less risky. These tend to be companies that are very stable and dominate their respective sectors, with market capitalization ranging from $10 billion to $200 billion. These prominent firms have fortress balance sheets and the ability to withstand market volatility. Large-cap companies also usually return a percentage of their profits to shareholders as dividends, which helps investors navigate a downturn in the economy relatively better. Some of the best large-cap stocks in the George Soros stock portfolio are Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), and Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU). Our Methodology We selected the top large-cap stock picks from George Soros’ stock portfolio as of the end of the second quarter of 2022 for this analysis. Insider Monkey’s database of 895 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2022 was used to assess the hedge fund sentiment around the securities. George Soros Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Large-Cap Stock PicksGeorge Soros Stock Portfolio: Top Large-Cap Stock Picks10. Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) is a Colorado-based communications company that provides a range of wireless, data, video, voice, and managed services to residential customers, businesses, government entities, and educational and medical institutions. In Q2 2022, the George Soros stock portfolio had 1.75 million shares of Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA), worth $202.35 million and representing 3.6% of the total 13F securities. Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) has been part of the Soros portfolio since the second quarter of 2016. Story continuesOn May 10, Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Kraft maintained a Buy recommendation on Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $158 from $196.According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) was part of 27 public stock portfolios, compared to 26 in the prior quarter. Boykin Curry’s Eagle Capital Management held the leading position in the company, comprising 8.30 million shares worth $960.2 million. Like Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), and Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) is one of the top large-cap picks from the George Soros stock portfolio. Alphyn Capital made the following comment about Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“In retrospect, I wish I had cut the position in Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) more aggressively last quarter. Fears of fixed wireless and fiber competition have weighed heavily on Charter and Liberty’s share prices. Tom Rutledge’s unexpected early retirement from the CEO role has not helped matters.I believe the sentiment is now overly pessimistic, and the valuation once again attractive. Revenue growth from broadband ads will likely stall as fixed wireless access programs take a bite out of cable subscribers over the next five years. 4 However, Charter has a fast-growing mobile phone business through an MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) agreement with Verizon. Given its cost-effective access to Verizon’s mobile telephony infrastructure, it provides a branded mobile phone service to retail customers at competitive rates. For example, Unlimited pricing starts at $29.99/month, including taxes and fees, vs. $35-55/month plus taxes and fees for Verizon’s plans.Wireless generates approximately $725m in revenues for Charter per quarter, around 6% of the total, and is growing 40% per year. Should this continue, Wireless could return Charter to mid-single-digit revenue growth and “drive meaningful EBITDA for Charter,” as revenues scale over a low cost base. With approximately 25m non-Charter potential wireless customers within the area it serves, there is plenty of room for growth.”9. Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) is a California-based company that designs, develops, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles and related accessories. Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) is the largest holding in the George Soros stock portfolio, with 17.8 million shares worth $459 million, representing 8.17% of the total securities. Soros Fund Management added Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) to its portfolio in the last quarter of 2021. On October 11, after a conversation with the management, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh said that Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN)’s vehicle recall is ""relatively minor"" and that its manufacturing lines have already been updated. He believes Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) has seen the issue on ""less than 1%"" of vehicles and the company forecasts the cost of fixing the recall to be ""minimal"". The analyst noted that the headlines are ""worse than reality"" and maintained a Buy rating on the shares with a $65 price target.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 35 funds reported owning stakes worth $1.6 billion in Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 29 funds in the prior quarter worth $4 billion. Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management is the biggest position holder in the company, with 18.8 million shares worth $486 million. Here is what Baron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund has to say about Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Rivian Automotive, Inc. designs, manufactures, and sells consumer and commercial electric vehicles. Shares of Rivian declined 48.2% in the second quarter as investors continued rotating out of long-duration assets and have become increasingly concerned about capital intensity and cash burn.At the same time, Rivian continues to be impacted by supply chain issues which are causing delays in its production ramp. Rivian is addressing those challenges by diversifying its supply chain to alleviate shortages while also consolidating the number of variants in development to reduce cash burn (the company guided that current cash will be enough to support the company’s future platform launch ‘R2’ in 2025). Rivian recently reported stronger-than-expected second quarter production numbers while reiterating its annual guidance of producing 25,000 units.As semiconductor shortages ease, we believe that the company will be able to rapidly ramp its production. We retain conviction in the shares given management’s vision, Rivian’s product positioning, the company’s relationship with Amazon.com, and its strong balance sheet. As of the end of the first quarter, Rivian had $17 billion of cash and cash equivalents, which will help it overcome the current challenges while taking advantage of the long-term opportunity as the market transitions to electric vehicles.”8. Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) was founded in 2011 and is based in Dublin, Ireland. The company manufactures and sells electrical, electronic, and safety technology solutions to the automotive and commercial vehicle markets worldwide. In the second quarter of 2022, the George Soros stock portfolio lifted its Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) stake by 1%, holding 246,055 shares worth nearly $22 million. The stock has been part of the Soros portfolio since Q2 2020. On September 28, Berenberg analyst Jared Maymon assumed coverage of Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) with a Buy rating and a $130 price target. The analyst noted that content per vehicle is increasing and Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) is gaining share. He believes Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) is well positioned to capture a significant share of an expanded total addressable market in the long term.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 43 hedge funds were long Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) at the end of June 2022, compared to 48 funds in the earlier quarter. Ian Simm’s Impax Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 4.6 million shares worth $417 million. Here is what ClearBridge Investments Sustainability Leaders Strategy has to say about Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“The acceleration in electrification of transport should support electric vehicle (EV)-related stocks like Aptiv (NYSE:APTV), which came under pressure in the quarter on concerns the auto cycle is past its peak. Aptiv provides a range of solutions for the auto industry, including autonomous driving technologies, safety technologies, components, and wiring. The large exposure of APTV to EVs should lead to long-term value as EVs continue their growth, boosted by their relative attractiveness as prices at the pump hit near-historic highs.”7. D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) is a Texas-based homebuilding company that constructs and sells residential homes under the D.R. Horton, America's Builder, Express Homes, Emerald Homes, and Freedom Homes brands. In Q2 2022, the George Soros stock portfolio featured nearly 3 million shares of D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI), worth $197 million and representing 3.5% of the total holdings. Raymond James analyst Buck Horne on October 21 downgraded D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) to Outperform from Strong Buy with a price target of $77, down from $103. The downgrade factors in the analyst’s more concerned outlook on the housing market as mortgage rates have driven affordability to uncharted highs. However, he remains constructive on D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) in this environment as the sector’s most cost-efficient producer of single-family housing.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) was part of 44 public stock portfolios at the end of June 2022, compared to 52 in the last quarter. John Armitage’s Egerton Capital Limited is the leading position holder in the company, with 7.6 million shares worth $504 million. Here is what Third Avenue Management specifically said about D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) is the largest homebuilder in the US by volume (the company sold more than 90k homes in the past year) with a well-recognized focus on delivering quality product at the entry-level price point (its average selling price is less than $400k) and market-leading positions in key Sunbelt markets.While the near-term outlook for DR Horton remains uncertain given the adjustments occurring in the US residential markets, the medium-to-long-term prospects for volume-based homebuilders with super-strong balance sheets and scale advantages continue to be promising in Fund Management’s view. More specifically, (i) residential inventories remain around record-low levels in most major markets when gauged by aggregate units available (see chart below), (ii) demand for single-family residences seem to have multiple secular drivers as the largest generation in US history (the “millennial cohort”) enters its prime home buying years and desires more space not only due to “life events” but also “remote” and “hybrid” working arrangements, and (iii) significant inflation in rental rates for multi-family units in urban areas has left the rent-to-own proposition for single-family homes in suburban areas in a compelling range (particularly in the Sunbelt region which is experiencing outsized job growth and wage growth relative to broader national figures).In Fund Management’s view, the two industry participants that seem most likely to take part in this shift include DR Horton and Lennar Corp. (a long-held position in the Fund). In conjunction, these two “blue-chip builders” now account for approximately 10% of the Fund’s capital, as well as roughly one out of every five new homes built in the Sunbelt. They would also qualify under Third Avenue Founder Marty Whitman’s “Safe and Cheap” maxim as both companies are nearly “net-cash” (i.e., more cash than debt) with common stocks trading at less than five times trailing earnings, on average.”6. Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) is an American-Irish professional services company, providing technology support, application modernization, enterprise architecture, software and quality engineering, data management, intelligent automation comprises robotic process automation, and natural language processing, among others. Securities filings for the second quarter of 2022 reveal that Soros Fund Management held 119,862 shares of Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN), worth $33.2 million and representing 0.59% of the total portfolio. The hedge fund strengthened its hold on the stock by 4% in Q2 2022. On September 22, Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) declared a $1.12 per share quarterly dividend, a 15.5% increase from its prior dividend of $0.97. The dividend is payable to shareholders on November 15. The company’s board has also approved $3 billion in additional share repurchase authorization, bringing total outstanding repurchase authorization to approximately $6.1 billion.JPMorgan analyst Tien-tsin Huang on October 14 and reiterated an Overweight rating on  Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $306 from $329. The analyst revised estimates down to reflect currency headwinds.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) was part of 61 public stock portfolios at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 63 in the last quarter. Nicolai Tangen’s Ako Capital is the biggest position holder in the company, with 2.3 million shares worth $636 million.In addition to Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), and Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) is one of the premier large-cap stock picks of billionaire George Soros. Here is what Baron Durable Advantage Fund has to say about Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Accenture plc provides consulting and technology services to corporate clients worldwide. Quarterly financial results exceeded Street expectations with 22% revenue growth and 23% operating income growth. However, shares fell 17.5% during the quarter due to adverse foreign currency movements weighing on next quarter’s guidance and investor concerns about macroeconomic uncertainty impacting client demand. We believe demand for Accenture’s services will be resilient over the long term and the company will continue gaining share in a large global market helping its clients digitally transform.” Click to continue reading and see George Soros Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Large-Cap Stock Picks.  Suggested articles:9 Biggest Car Rental Companies in the World10 Cheap Growth Stocks To Buy11 Safe Stocks To Invest In Disclosure: None.

503,2674c9a7-1cd6-3295-b910-b7e8a180b40a,AAL,2022-11-04,American Airlines is 'increasing their costs' with labor talks: Pilot union spokesperson,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/american-airlines-increasing-costs-labor-201402015.html,1667506442,VIDEO,['AAL'],"[Captain Dennis Tajer, Allied Pilots Association Spokesperson, joins Yahoo Finance Live to detail the outlook on negotiations between American Airlines and its employed pilots, the decline in airline profitability, and the detrimental effects of pilot fatigue.Video Transcript- 30,000 pilots from the nation's largest airlines rejecting contracts this week, negotiations derailed by the pandemic now growing tense as the industry contends with a pilot shortage amid escalating costs. For more, we want to bring in Captain Dennis Tajer, Allied Pilots Association spokesperson. His union represents 15,000 American Airlines pilots. Dennis, it's great to have you. So let's start with American Airlines there since you are representing the 15,000 pilots of that carrier. Voted against the tentative agreement this week. Why?DENNIS TAJER: Well, our leadership actually took what was in place and reviewed it and said it didn't get anywhere near meeting what our membership expect for a contract. And it's not just about the money. There's a market rate for pilots. It's gone up dramatically. Inflation has cut away at our purchasing power. We watch Alaska, a national carrier versus us as a global carrier, just settle a deal. And, importantly, they went up 20 plus percent their pay rates.But the number one issue for our pilots is work-life balance and scheduling practices and the Alaska pilots work with their management team to execute a deal that will not only take care of that need for the pilots, but actually frees them up to do even more flying and keeps the schedule more reliable on this program on the financial side. When an airline cancels flights, it affects the unit cost because it's less ASM seat-- available seat miles out there.Right now, American, by having all these canceled flights, is actually increasing their costs. And they haven't even gotten a value out of it if they had actually invested in a pilot contract. So we're going to get this done. But it's not going to be done on the cheap. It's not going to be done with a low-level investment because the revenue opportunity out there is unlike anything we've ever seen. Just listen to the quarterly calls. Every CEO saying record revenue and passenger demand like they've never seen before, even in the so-called shoulder months.Story continues- So then how many of these issues were already brewing before COVID really put a lot more pressure on pilots and airline workers as well versus some of the more specific things that are now coming out?DENNIS TAJER: It's a great question. Some of these issues were fissure cracks within the foundation of operation through management's inattention to that. But the pandemic, when they did not keep pilots trained, they retired airplanes early and didn't retrain pilots for that, furloughed pilots, had early retirements-- I think I might have mentioned that.Bottom line was they had this wave of pilot training that they never did, which was part of the $54 billion investment promise. That part they're still catching up from. So what they've done is they saw the revenue coming in, the demand. They didn't expect it to come back until 2024. Well, they were an outlier because we saw it coming, along with many analysts. So what happened is now they just dumped in ticket sales. Even Delta admitted they just went for the revenue and they overplayed it.So now they have a system that is not trusted, that has been pushed to the edge. And the things that they did to try and keep it rolling, they continue to try and do that. They schedule us to the maximum with very little buffer and we go illegal flight cancels. Or they push us to the point of exhaustion, where by FAA law we cannot fly when we're fatigued and we have to make the right call for safety and actually fatigue off of a flight. These are all undermining the reliability and the revenue stream, not to mention the brand damage.And it's also pushing on the margin of safety. We're going to defend that margin of safety. So no passenger has to worry about that. But we're human. And the first thing that goes when you're fatigued is your judgment. It's a vicious cycle. And it's got to be stopped. And some of the answers are in our contract. I can guarantee you that working with us is going to be a lot less expensive than if you work against us because there's revenue to go get out there. And we want to help you harvest that.- Well, Dennis, as you said, it's not just about the money. In the latest tentative agreement, it did call for 12% raises for pilots on the date of the contract signing plus 5% after one year, 2% after two years. Were you satisfied with that part of it? Or do you want a bigger pay increase?DENNIS TAJER: Well, that did not satisfy it at all. Number one, we've got inflation--- What would satisfy you?DENNIS TAJER: What would satisfy us is actually recognizing that the regional affiliates, the smaller airplanes, they got pay raises up into the 80% range. That's not what we're looking for. We know they were deeply behind. You can get paid more working for a regional affiliate, the smaller airplanes, than you can for mainline. It's upside down. We're going to fix that. The other side of this is that every contract is up for negotiations now. Sans Alaska, who settled, you're not going to be left behind. Dear management team, you're not going to be the outlier.And I got news for you, we will have snap ups because we're all negotiating in this narrow band of time. If someone gets a little bit higher pay rate, you're not going to be an outlier by providing that because we are going to have a snap up that brings us there. It's becoming the industry standard. And all this-- the convergence of the pandemic, the recovery, and these contract negotiations make it a very safe and compelling time to negotiate modern deals with pilots. It's going to be a commoditized not only on a pay rate basis, but actual utilization rate.It's all right here. And it's actually going to be good for the industry. We just have to get management to join us so that we can point, all of our energy toward making a better product. Put more flights out there, which will actually help ease the unit cost the more ASMs you have out there. We get this business. And we want to be a part of it in a functional way. But we will not be exploited while management tries to figure out how to modernize their operation.- We'll certainly be keeping track of how talks are progressing. A big thank you, Allied Pilots Association spokesperson Captain Dennis Tajer. Thank you for joining us this afternoon.]"

The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. This means that investors who purchase Eaton's shares on or after the 9th of November will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 30th of November.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.81 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$3.24 per share. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Eaton has a trailing yield of 2.1% on the current share price of $154.59. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to investigate whether Eaton can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. Check out our latest analysis for Eaton If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Eaton paid out 56% of its earnings to investors last year, a normal payout level for most businesses. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Over the last year, it paid out more than three-quarters (81%) of its free cash flow generated, which is fairly high and may be starting to limit reinvestment in the business.It's positive to see that Eaton's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. This is why it's a relief to see Eaton earnings per share are up 6.5% per annum over the last five years. Decent historical earnings per share growth suggests Eaton has been effectively growing value for shareholders. However, it's now paying out more than half its earnings as dividends. Therefore it's unlikely that the company will be able to reinvest heavily in its business, which could presage slower growth in the future.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Eaton has delivered 7.9% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.To Sum It UpShould investors buy Eaton for the upcoming dividend? Earnings per share growth has been unremarkable, and while the company is paying out a majority of its earnings and cash flow in the form of dividends, the dividend payments don't appear excessive. It might be worth researching if the company is reinvesting in growth projects that could grow earnings and dividends in the future, but for now we're not all that optimistic on its dividend prospects.So if you want to do more digging on Eaton, you'll find it worthwhile knowing the risks that this stock faces. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 2 warning signs with Eaton and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

EMR and AZZ Inc. AZZ.Industry: Manufacturing - ElectronicsLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2012433/3-manufacturing-electronics-stocks-to-watch-amid-industry-woesStrength across end-markets, thanks to continued expansion in manufacturing activities, bodes well for the Zacks Manufacturing - Electronics industry. Despite an increase, there is some slowdown in manufacturing activities, which can be linked to a softness in demand for electronics products. Persistent supply chain constraints and raw material cost inflation are added concerns for the industry. Manufacturing electronics companies have also been battling a perennial problem of labor shortages in the industry.Despite these headwinds, pricing actions to tackle cost inflation should aid the performances of Eaton Corporation plc, Emerson Electric Co. and AZZ Inc..About the IndustryThe Zacks Manufacturing-Electronics industry comprises companies that manufacture electronic products like battery chargers, battery accessories, outdoor cabinet enclosures, power transmission products, electrical motion controls and motive power devices. Some industry players also provide water-treatment products, engineered flow components, process equipment and turn-key systems. These companies also offer state-of-the-art customer support and after-market services to end users.These companies are increasing investments for developing innovative technologies, boosting customer and employee experience as well as supply-chain modernization programs. The manufacturing electronic companies sell products and services in various end markets, including robotics, semiconductor, defense, aerospace, medical equipment and satellite communications.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Manufacturing Electronics IndustrySupply Chain &amp; Cost Woes: The industry is plagued by persistent supply chain constraints, primarily related to semiconductor shortages, which are weighing on volumes and delaying deliveries. Labor shortages have been a perennial problem for the industry participants. High raw material and freight costs are denting the margins of these companies. Pricing actions to tackle inflationary pressure have provided relief to some extent.Story continuesSoftness in Demand: While manufacturing activity continues to expand, it is increasing at a slower pace, indicating some softness in demand for electronics products. In September, Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) manufacturing PMI (Purchasing Managers' Index) touched 50.9% (a figure above 50 implies an expansion in manufacturing), reflecting growth in manufacturing activities for the 28th consecutive month. However, the index dipped 1.9 percentage points from the figure recorded in August, with New Orders and New Export Orders indexes contracting. Amid growing uncertainty in the economy, the demand environment is expected to remain volatile.Strength Across End-Markets: With continued expansion in manufacturing activities, strength across end-markets should drive growth of the industry. Well-diversified end-markets, including marine, mining, metal, energy, chemicals, power, renewable, life sciences, commercial, industrial, food, retail and other non-residential end markets, should help the industry players offset weakness in demand associated with a single market. Additionally, the digitalization of business operations is helping industry participants boost their competitiveness through enhanced operational productivity, product quality and better cost management.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Gloomy ProspectsThe Zacks Manufacturing – Electronics industry, housed within the broader Zacks Industrial Products sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #183. This rank places it in the bottom 27% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the group's 2022 earnings per share has decreased 12.5% over the past year.Despite the industry's drab near-term prospects, we will present a few stocks that you may hold in your portfolios. But before that, it's worth taking a look at the industry's stock market performance and current valuation.Industry Underperforms Sector &amp; S&amp;P 500The Zacks Manufacturing – Electronics industry has underperformed the broader sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite index in the past year.Over this period, the industry has declined 19.8% compared with the sector and the S&amp;P 500 Index's decrease of 16.5% and 18.8%.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12-month Price-to-Earnings (P/E), which is a commonly used multiple for valuing manufacturing stocks, the industry is currently trading at 18.83X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 16.92X. It is also above the sector's P/E ratio of 15.12X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 26.63X, as low as 13.53X and at the median of 18.84X.3 Manufacturing - Electronics Stocks to Keep a Tab OnAZZ: Strategic transformation efforts, pricing actions and operational improvement initiatives are driving AZZ's growth despite adversities such as high labor and raw material costs.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $247.28 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Federal Realty Investment Trust shares have lost about 27.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -21.1%.What's Next for Federal Realty Investment Trust?While Federal Realty Investment Trust has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Federal Realty Investment Trust: mixed.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the food industry and its outlook, and go directly to read 5 Best Food Dividend Stocks to Buy Now. The food industry encompasses all businesses that are involved in the production, transportation, storage, and selling of food and related items. Like many other sectors, the food industry also evolved during the pandemic in 2020 when major companies brought digital operations into play. The execution worked splendidly for the overall industry as analysts expect it to generate $899 billion in sales this year, according to Forbes.The current market environment has investors turning towards safe stocks that are not impacted by the economic downturn. Food stocks, that fall under the consumer staples sector, are a decent inflation hedge as their sales demand continues even if the prices are increased. The sector can also maintain its profitability as the rising prices are likely to be passed on to consumers. Some of the popular food stocks include PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), and Kellogg Company (NYSE:K).This year, food prices have recorded their largest annual increase since 1979, growing by 11.4% year-over-year as of August. The price hike has altered consumers’ shopping patterns and overall eating habits as they look for alternative and cheap ingredients. However, despite these high prices, the sector’s performance is relatively stable this year as demand for food products remained intact. According to a report by the US Census Bureau, retail and food services sales in the country were up by 9.2% in Q3 2022 from the same period last year. Moreover, the S&amp;P Food and Beverage Select Industry Index fell by 1.51% year-to-date, compared with a 21.6% drop in the broader market, as of the close of November 2.According to analysts, investors should focus on food businesses that can reduce their production costs and operating costs to stay afloat during inflationary periods. Moreover, companies with stable cash flows are also recommended by analysts as they often pay dividends to shareholders, which is rewarding in times of financial volatility. Given this, we will discuss some of the best food dividend stocks.Story continues12 Best Food Dividend Stocks to Buy NowPhoto by Heidi Kaden on UnsplashOur Methodology:The stocks mentioned below belong to different segments within the food industry, such as food manufacturers, food processors, beverage companies, and restaurants.

REGN delivered better-than-expected third-quarter 2022 results. It beat estimates for both earnings and sales, driven by growth in Eylea and Dupixent and progress on launches in pediatric atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis.Regeneron’s shares have gained 17.3% in the year so far against the industry’s decline of 22.2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRegeneron reported third-quarter earnings of $11.14 per share, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.65. The year-ago quarter recorded earnings per share of $15.37 due to higher sales.Total revenues in the reported quarter were down 15% year aover year to $2.9 billion but beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.8 billion. Excluding REGEN-COV (a cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies — casirivimab and imdevimab) for COVID-19, sales increased 11%.In January 2022, the FDA revised the authorizations for a few monoclonal antibody treatments, including Regeneron’s REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab), as data indicated that these treatments are highly unlikely to be active against the Omicron variant. Therefore, REGEN-COV is currently not currently authorized for use in U.S. states, territories or jurisdictions.Quarterly HighlightsLead drug Eylea’s sales in the United States were $1.6 billion compared with $1.5 billion in the year-ago quarter. Please note that Regeneron co-developed Eylea with the HealthCare unit of Bayer AG BAYRY.

The PHOTON trial in DME and the PULSAR trial in wet AMD both demonstrated that aflibercept 8 mg 12- and 16-week dosing regimens achieved non-inferiority in vision gains compared to the Eylea 8-week dosing regimen.The FDA accepted for priority review the supplemental biologics license application for Eylea to treat retinopathy of prematurity in preterm infants, with a target action date of Feb 11, 2023. The regulatory body also granted pediatric exclusivity to Eylea, extending its period of U.S. market exclusivity by an additional six months through May 17, 2024.In September 2022, the FDA approved Dupixent for the treatment of adult patients with prurigo nodularis, making Dupixent the first and only medicine specifically indicated to treat prurigo nodularis in the United States.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

522,85f1e44b-a4b0-3899-a3da-65741d2d419d,UNP,2022-11-04,Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) Has More To Do To Multiply In Value Going Forward,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/union-pacific-nyse-unp-more-130049686.html,1667566849,STORY,['UNP'],"[If we want to find a potential multi-bagger, often there are underlying trends that can provide clues. One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. However, after investigating Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Union Pacific, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.17 = US$10b ÷ (US$65b - US$5.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, Union Pacific has an ROCE of 17%.  In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Transportation industry average of 15%. See our latest analysis for Union Pacific roceIn the above chart we have measured Union Pacific's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Union Pacific here  for free.How Are Returns Trending?Over the past five years, Union Pacific's ROCE and capital employed have both remained mostly flat. This tells us the company isn't reinvesting in itself, so it's plausible that it's past the growth phase. With that in mind, unless investment picks up again in the future, we wouldn't expect Union Pacific to be a multi-bagger going forward. With fewer investment opportunities, it makes sense that Union Pacific has been paying out a decent 43% of its earnings to shareholders. Unless businesses have highly compelling growth opportunities, they'll typically return some money to shareholders.Story continuesIn Conclusion...We can conclude that in regards to Union Pacific's returns on capital employed and the trends, there isn't much change to report on. Since the stock has gained an impressive 83% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high.One more thing, we've spotted   1 warning sign  facing Union Pacific that you might find interesting.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Each fitness test panel provides a deep dive into an individual's health to paint a complete picture of overall fitness, including comprehensive tests that measure endurance, nutrition, energy, hydration, and hormone levels. It also informs on muscle and recovery status. This advanced fitness performance testing allows individuals to establish their fitness benchmark and find their competitive edge.Quest Diagnostics Incorporated logo. (PRNewsFoto/Quest Diagnostics Incorporated)""These new tests specifically and conveniently deliver what athletes are asking for, fitness insights and guidance that will tangibly improve performance and help them reduce their vulnerability to injury,"" said Richard Adams, Vice President and General Manager of CIT Franchise &amp; Marketing at Quest.Fitness devotees can pick among three distinct testing profiles depending on their own fitness intensity and goals. Each features a Health Risk Assessment, Heath Quotient Score, Associated Risk Factors, biometrics, and one-on-one discussion with a doctor in reviewing results.The Essentials Profile checks the foundational elements for improving fitness, mitigating risk, and evaluating how the body responds to the fitness routine, including markers of general health (systems that support exercise training tolerance—liver function, measurement of immune cells), energy substrates that provide fuel in exercise metabolic processes, macro and micronutrients, hydration and electrolytes, endurance, and recovery.The Nutrition Profile evaluates adequate nutrition and identifies nutrient deficiencies. It assesses levels of macronutrients and micronutrients that serve as coenzymes in metabolic function, omega fatty acids, and hydration indicators.The Elite Profile targets top athletes who train at high volumes and aims to optimize performance, endurance, training, recovery, and nutrition. This profile evaluates red blood cells and nutrients that support red blood cell replenishment. It offers performance insights for susceptibility to overtraining or tapering training that can lead to higher performance levels. Finally, athletes will gain insight into anabolic and catabolic balance in the body involved in recovery and adaptations. To perfect the Elite Profile, Quest leaned on a long-standing relationship with the New York Football Giants to improve the health and performance of the most elite athletes.Story continuesChris Fleming, 44, was among the first to try the Fitness Profile – Elite test as he geared up for the New York City Marathon, which takes place on Sunday, November 6th. Facing several training challenges for his first marathon, Fleming was most interested in testing to understand how his body was responding to training and proactively arm himself with guidance to improve performance and avoid injury in the homestretch pre-race. ""The Elite Fitness Profile gave me incredible insight into tangible ways to enhance performance and gave me relief, physically and mentally, that I was training appropriately,"" said Fleming.These panels can be purchased on questhealth.com, priced from $269 to $559. They may be reimbursable through health savings accounts (HSA) or flexible spending accounts (FSA). Results are expected 7-14 days from specimen collection and are delivered electronically through questhealth.com.

525,029e91bc-d048-3ed1-aa49-89704ac26230,DGX,2022-11-04,An Intrinsic Calculation For Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (NYSE:DGX) Suggests It's 49% Undervalued,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-quest-diagnostics-incorporated-103242668.html,1667557962,STORY,['DGX'],"[How far off is Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (NYSE:DGX) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Quest Diagnostics The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.05bUS$1.22bUS$1.45bUS$1.52bUS$1.57bUS$1.62bUS$1.67bUS$1.71bUS$1.75bUS$1.79bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 3.58%Est @ 3.1%Est @ 2.76%Est @ 2.53%Est @ 2.36%Est @ 2.25% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.5% US$982US$1.1kUS$1.2kUS$1.2kUS$1.1kUS$1.1kUS$1.1kUS$1.0kUS$991US$951(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$11bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.8b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.5%– 2.0%) = US$40bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$40b÷ ( 1 + 6.5%)10= US$21bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$32b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$143, the company appears quite undervalued at a 49% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Quest Diagnostics as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.883. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For Quest Diagnostics, we've put together three relevant factors you should explore:Risks: We feel that you should assess the 2 warning signs for Quest Diagnostics we've flagged before making an investment in the company.Future Earnings: How does DGX's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

These companies represent the key life/health (L/H) insurance subsidiaries of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (Ameriprise) (headquartered in Minneapolis, MN) [NYSE: AMP] and are collectively known as Ameriprise Financial Group. Concurrently, AM Best has affirmed the FSR of A (Excellent) and the Long-Term ICR of ""a+"" (Excellent) of Ameriprise Captive Insurance Company (ACIC) (Burlington, VT), a property/casualty subsidiary of Ameriprise. The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable. In addition, AM Best has affirmed the Long-Term ICR of ""a-"" (Excellent) and the existing Long-Term Issue Credit Ratings (Long-Term IRs) of Ameriprise. The outlook of these ratings is stable. Please see below for a detailed listing of the Long-Term IRs.The ratings of Ameriprise Financial Group reflect its balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as its strong operating performance, favorable business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management (ERM). The group’s operating performance has remained favorable through 2022 and continues to maintain a trend of high return-on-equity ratios on a statutory reporting basis. Earnings have been accretive to capital growth. While rate increases on the group’s long term care business and economic risks from interest rates rising may present challenges, robust ERM practices mitigate balance sheet risks. Ameriprise has executed on reinsurance transactions on specific lines of business to generate excess capital, improve interest rate risk, improve asset-liability management, while keeping earnings consistent. At the holding company level, Ameriprise maintains moderate financial leverage with good interest coverage. Both measures are within AM Best’s guidelines for Ameriprise’s current ratings. Ameriprise does have a history of returning capital back to shareholders.Story continuesAmeriprise’s life and annuity business is complemented by the enterprise’s larger asset management businesses in the United States and internationally. As a group, the RiverSource companies not only are geographically diversified across the United States, but also offer investment services in addition to life and annuity products. The distribution capabilities are robust through the company’s advisor channel, and the company has achieved innovative delivery and operating efficiencies through its investments in technology.The ratings of ACIC reflect its balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong as well as its strong operating performance, limited business profile and appropriate ERM. ACIC benefits from rating enhancement due to its strategic importance as a single-parent captive insurance provider.The captive has generated strong operating performance as demonstrated by its five-year average pre-tax return on revenue and equity ratios that compare favorably with the averages for AM Best’s commercial casualty composite. Additionally, ACIC benefits from a very low expense ratio.AM Best assesses ACIC’s business profile as limited due to its narrow market focus as a single-parent captive serving just one customer (its parent) for a limited amount of exposure. ACIC provides various coverages to its parent in the form of errors and omissions policies, a workers’ compensation deductible reimbursement policy, fidelity bonds and property terrorism (conventional and nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological).The following Long-Term IRs have been affirmed with stable outlooks:Ameriprise Financial, Inc.-— ""a-"" (Excellent) on $750 million 4.00% senior unsecured notes, due 2023— ""a-"" (Excellent) on $550 million 3.70% senior unsecured notes, due 2024— ""a-"" (Excellent) on $500 million 3.00% senior unsecured notes, due 2025— ""a-"" (Excellent) on $500 million 2.875% senior unsecured notes, due 2026— ""a-"" (Excellent) on $500 million 4.50% senior unsecured notes, due 2032The following indicative Long-Term IRs have been affirmed with stable outlooks under the current shelf registration:Ameriprise Financial, Inc.—— ""a-"" (Excellent) on senior unsecured debt— ""bbb+"" (Good) on subordinated debt— ""bbb"" (Good) on preferred stockAM Best remains the leading rating agency of alternative risk transfer entities, with more than 200 such vehicles rated in the United States and throughout the world.
