Our estimate for adjusted earnings was $1.05 per share.The stock declined more than 4% in early trading, reflecting investors’ bearish sentiments over its lower-than-expected quarterly performance. The full-day trading session will display a clearer picture. Results benefited from higher rates, which led to a rise in net interest income (NII). Thus, revenues witnessed an improvement despite higher volatility hurting trading income. Also, the absence of fee waivers and solid brokerage account numbers acted as tailwinds during the quarter. However, higher expenses were a headwind.Results excluded acquisition and integration-related costs and amortization of acquired intangibles. After considering these, net income available to common shareholders (GAAP basis) was $1.97 billion or 97 cents per share, up from $1.58 billion or 76 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.

(STLD) Hit a 52 Week High, Can the Run Continue?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/steel-dynamics-inc-stld-hit-141502678.html,1674051302,STORY,"['STLD', 'NUE']","[Have you been paying attention to shares of Steel Dynamics (STLD)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 6.8% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $113.71 in the previous session. Steel Dynamics has gained 12.8% since the start of the year compared to the 3.3% move for the Zacks Basic Materials sector and the 15.1% return for the Zacks Steel - Producers industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on October 19, 2022, Steel Dynamics reported EPS of $5.46 versus consensus estimate of $4.97 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 3.16%.For the current fiscal year, Steel Dynamics is expected to post earnings of $10.82 per share on $22.17 billion in revenues. Meanwhile, for the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $8.30 per share on $16.08 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of -50.74% and -27.47%, respectively.Valuation MetricsSteel Dynamics may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Steel Dynamics has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and C, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 10.2X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 10.2X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 6X versus its peer group's average of 2.2X. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Story continuesZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Steel Dynamics currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Steel Dynamics meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though Steel Dynamics shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.How Does STLD Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of STLD have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Nucor Corporation (NUE). NUE has a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of B, a Growth Score of B, and a Momentum Score of D.Earnings were strong last quarter. Nucor Corporation beat our consensus estimate by 0.78%, and for the current fiscal year, NUE is expected to post earnings of $12.76 per share on revenue of $40.7 billion.Shares of Nucor Corporation have gained 15.8% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 12.16X and a P/CF of 5.76X.The Steel - Producers industry is in the top 4% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for STLD and NUE, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 82% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Nucor. View our latest analysis for Nucor ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Nucor?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Nucor already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Nucor, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Nucor is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 13% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 11% and 9.1%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.On further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 10 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.Story continuesWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of NucorWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Nucor Corporation in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$263m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 18% stake in Nucor. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Nucor better, we need to consider many other factors.

Substitution of MDI for less effective materials will remain a key driving factor for the MDI business. The Geismar MDI splitter project will expand the differentiated Polyurethanes business in the Americas. Huntsman should also gain from significant synergies of acquisitions. Its strong liquidity and balance sheet leverage gives it adequate flexibility to continue to develop and expand its core businesses through acquisitions and internal investments. The acquisitions of CVC Thermoset and Gabriel Performance Products are significantly contributing to EBITDA in the Advanced Materials segment.The company expects to deliver around $240 million of annualized cost optimization and acquisition run rate synergies by the end of 2023. Its new European restructuring program is also expected to deliver roughly $40 million of additional savings by the end of this year. The company expects to achieve around $140 million of annualized savings and acquisition integration synergies by first-quarter 2023.A Few HeadwindsThe company faces headwinds from higher raw material, logistics and supply-chain costs as witnessed in the third quarter of 2022. Supply disruptions have led to a rise in raw material costs. The unfavorable impacts from higher costs of raw materials are likely to continue in the fourth quarter. Higher costs, especially in Europe, are likely to remain a headwind in the fourth quarter. Volatility in natural gas prices in Europe is a concern. As such, higher raw material costs may impact margins.Semiconductor shortages have also caused a slowdown in automotive production rates globally. The impacts of the chip shortage are likely to continue over the near term, leading to softer demand in automotive. Demand weakness in Europe is also expected to affect volumes in the fourth quarter. Demand in China is also being impacted by the economic slowdown resulting from pandemic-led restrictions.Story continues Huntsman Corporation Price and Consensus Huntsman Corporation Price and ConsensusHuntsman Corporation price-consensus-chart | Huntsman Corporation Quote Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks worth considering in the basic materials space include Olympic Steel, Inc.

16,f4cdd438-6f34-3cd0-9f41-40f3a2b36cfb,STT,2023-01-19,U.S. Bancorp (USB) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-bancorp-usb-reports-next-150003787.html,1674054003,STORY,"['USB', 'USB-PQ', 'STT']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when U.S. Bancorp (USB) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 25, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.11 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +3.7%.Revenues are expected to be $6.66 billion, up 17.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.37% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for U.S. Bancorp?For U.S. Bancorp, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.87%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that U.S. Bancorp will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that U.S. Bancorp would post earnings of $1.17 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.18, delivering a surprise of +0.85%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.U.S. Bancorp doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, State Street Corporation (STT), is soon expected to post earnings of $2 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates no change from the year-ago quarter. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $3.06 billion, up 0.4% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for State Street Corporation has been revised 10.1% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, reflecting an equal Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that State Street Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

CROX has been gaining from solid consumer demand, as well as strength in the Crocs and HEYDUDE brands. A solid online show bodes well. This led to a top and bottom-line beat for the 10th straight quarter in the third quarter of 2022.Sales and earnings improved year over year. Adjusted earnings of $2.97 per share advanced 20.2% from $2.47 in the year-ago period. Revenues advanced 57.4% (or 63% on a constant-currency basis) year over year to $985.1 million, driven by growth across all regions and channels.The company is on track with the expansion of digital and omnichannel capabilities. We note that digital sales advanced 22% year over year on a cc basis in the third quarter, representing 37.4% of sales. This was mainly driven by growth across all regions and customer acquisitions. Increased focus on the Crocs mobile app and global social platforms aided digital sales. Gains from strategic collaborations, influencer campaigns, and digital and social marketing efforts were upsides.Crocs has been gaining from its acquisition of HEYDUDE, which sells lightweight, casual shoes and sandals for men, women and children. Notably, the HEYDUDE brand’s revenues surged 87% year over year to $269.4 million in the third quarter. Management is optimistic about the HEYDUDE brand. For 2022, revenues related to the HEYDUDE buyout are likely to be $850-$890 million. The brand is expected to attain $1 billion in revenues in 2023.Management outlined its long-term strategy and key initiatives to deliver sustainable growth. It expects to generate revenues of more than $5 billion by 2026, representing compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 17% in the next five years. The company expects to attain the revenue target, driven by strong digital sales, improved market share for sandals, growth in Asia, and innovative product and marketing. Management expects four times revenue growth in sandals by 2026. The company sees long-term opportunities in Asia, primarily in China, which is the second-largest footwear market in the world.Crocs expects revenue growth to see a CAGR of 25% and represent 24% of the total revenues in 2026. The company anticipates at least 50% of total revenues to come from digital channels by the end of 2026. Driven by strong revenue growth, it expects improved profitability and cash flows through 2026. It anticipates the adjusted operating margin to be more than 26% and annual free cash flow in excess of $1 billion by the end of 2026.Driven by these factors, management recently raised its guidance for 2022. It anticipates 2022 revenues to reach $3.55 billion compared with the $3.46-$3.52 billion mentioned earlier. The revised view indicates an increase of 53% from that reported in 2021 versus the prior mentioned 49-52% rise. For the fourth quarter, the company expects year-over-year revenue growth of 60%. It expects an adjusted operating margin of 27% for 2022.The company outlined its initial guidance for 2023, wherein it anticipates year-over-year revenue growth of 10-13%. This indicates revenues of $3.9-$4 billion for the said year.Adjusted earnings are envisioned to be $9.95-$10.30, up from the earlier stated $9.50-$10.30. Adjusted operating income is predicted to be $920-$950 million. The adjusted operating margin is anticipated to be 27% compared with the aforementioned 26-27%.Consequently, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) surged 66.1% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 19.8%.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research However, Crocs is reeling under inflation, higher air freight and logistics costs, which dented margins in the third quarter. The adjusted gross margin contracted 910 basis points (bps) to 55.1%, while the adjusted operating margin contracted 490 bps to 27.9% from the prior-year quarter’s 32.8%.ConclusionWe believe that online strength, solid demand and well-chalked-out endeavors will help Crocs sustain its stellar show. Also, a long-term earnings growth rate of 15% and a VGM score of B reflect its inherent strength. Topping it, earnings estimates for the current financial year have increased 1.5% to $10.43 over the past seven days.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are World Wrestling Entertainment WWE, PVH Corp PVH and Oxford Industries OXM.World Wrestling Entertainment currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The company manufactures and sells instruments, reagents, and consumables used for a wide range of applications in labs.Sales are also well balanced geographically, including leading scale in emerging markets, according to our research.The business meets all our financial guardrails. We view Thermo Fisher as an extremely durable business, and we expect mid- to high-single-digit organic revenue growth over the long term. With expanding margins and wise capital deployment, we expect mid-teens underlying earnings per share growth over the next three to five years.We also think Thermo Fisher’s business would be very durable in an economic downturn as pharma and biotech customers account for roughly 60% of the company’s sales today and roughly 80% of sales are highly recurring consumables and services.

(NYSE:TMO) boasts of strong institutional backing",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/89-ownership-thermo-fisher-scientific-110056671.html,1674126056,STORY,['TMO'],"[If you want to know who really controls Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 89% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Thermo Fisher Scientific, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Thermo Fisher Scientific?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Thermo Fisher Scientific does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Thermo Fisher Scientific's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Thermo Fisher Scientific. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.2% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.8% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.7% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Thermo Fisher ScientificThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$324m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 11% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for Thermo Fisher Scientific  you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Truist Financial Corporation shares have added about 9.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 3.9%.What's Next for Truist Financial Corporation?While Truist Financial Corporation has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Truist Financial Corporation: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.23 on $6.14 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $4.95 on $24.97 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Banks - Major Regional is currently in the top 36% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.U.S. Bancorp (USB), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2022. The results are expected to be released on January 25.This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.11 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +3.7%.

21,f4cdd438-6f34-3cd0-9f41-40f3a2b36cfb,USB,2023-01-19,U.S. Bancorp (USB) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-bancorp-usb-reports-next-150003787.html,1674054003,STORY,"['USB', 'USB-PQ', 'STT']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when U.S. Bancorp (USB) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 25, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.11 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +3.7%.Revenues are expected to be $6.66 billion, up 17.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.37% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for U.S. Bancorp?For U.S. Bancorp, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.87%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that U.S. Bancorp will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that U.S. Bancorp would post earnings of $1.17 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.18, delivering a surprise of +0.85%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.U.S. Bancorp doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, State Street Corporation (STT), is soon expected to post earnings of $2 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates no change from the year-ago quarter. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $3.06 billion, up 0.4% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for State Street Corporation has been revised 10.1% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, reflecting an equal Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that State Street Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(CF) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cf-industries-holdings-inc-cf-140002570.html,1674050402,STORY,['CF'],"[CF Industries (CF) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this fertilizer maker have returned -8.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.8% change. The Zacks Fertilizers industry, to which CF belongs, has gained 1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.CF is expected to post earnings of $4.13 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.3%.The consensus earnings estimate of $15.96 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +276.4%. This estimate has changed -4.1% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $14.49 indicates a change of -9.2% from what CF is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -4.1%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, CF is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CF _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For CF, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.84 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +11.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $11.42 billion and $9.56 billion estimates indicate +74.6% and -16.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCF reported revenues of $2.32 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +70.4%. EPS of $2.55 for the same period compares with $0.96 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.3 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.74%. The EPS surprise was -20.06%.Over the last four quarters, CF surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.CF is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CF. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

CF, a leading producer of ammonia, has joined forces with JERA co., Inc. (“JERA”), Japan’s biggest energy producer, to supply up to 500,000 metric tons of clean ammonia per year. The companies signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) for supplying clean ammonia from the beginning of 2027. The MOU is the result of a supplier comparison and evaluation process for obtaining clean ammonia initiated by JERA last year for the first commercial-scale ammonia co-firing operations worldwide.The MOU has established a framework to evaluate how CF Industries would best supply clean ammonia to JERA under a long-term offtake agreement. Both companies are considering a range of possible supply options for ammonia, which includes an equity investment for building a greenfield clean ammonia facility in Louisiana and a long-term offtake agreement from CF’s Donaldsonville Complex in Louisiana.After successfully conducting a pilot test to produce ammonia, JERA has decided to begin formal demonstration projects from its fiscal 2023 at its Hekinan Power Plant for further research. Also, since clean ammonia will require at least 60% less carbon emissions in its production process than traditionally produced ammonia, JERA has decided to use coal along with clean ammonia at its Hekinan Thermal Power Station to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the facility.CF Industries has entered into industry-leading projects since 2020 to decarbonize its ammonia production network. This has positioned the company to supply large-scale volumes of clean ammonia within the next few years. CF Industries has invested in building a CO2 dehydration and compression facility, enabling it to capture and sequestrate about 2 million tons of CO2 per year at its Donaldsonville Complex beginning in 2025. The company has also started constructing a greenfield clean ammonia facility, backed by a front-end engineering and design study at Ascension Parish, LA. The company will be able to produce up to 20,000 tons of green ammonia after the construction of North America’s first commercial-scale green ammonia capacity at Donaldsonville Complex beginning in 2024.Story continuesCF Industries stated that through its production network and disciplined investments, the company has positioned itself to become a leading supplier of clean ammonia. The company also stated its excitement to join forces with JERA, which will enable it to meet the rising requirements of clean ammonia in Japan.CF Industries’ shares have gained 28.6% in the past year, outperforming industry’s rise of 2.3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe firm sees the supply-demand balance of nitrogen to remain tight into 2025 on a global level, backed by strong agricultural demand and elevated energy prices in Europe and Asia. The company also expects the demand for nitrogen to be driven by the need to replenish global grain stocks. Also, it expects high crop futures prices and healthy farm economics to support high corn and wheat planted acreage in 2023 in North America. CF Industries also sees urea exports from China in the range of 1.5-2 million metric tons for full-year 2022. CF Industries Holdings, Inc. Price and Consensus CF Industries Holdings, Inc.

The company registered strong underlying growth across all product groups. Adjusted EPS grew despite aggressive investment in R&amp;D and commercial infrastructure to support new therapies.Critical Care sales were up 3% on an underlying basis in the third quarter of 2022.

Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.Another factor that can influence investors is FOMO, or the fear of missing out, especially with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Edwards Lifesciences (EW) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to EW for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Edwards Lifesciences' Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Edwards Lifesciences' main business drivers.Edwards Lifesciences Corporation, headquartered in Irvine, CA, deals in products and technologies aimed at treating advanced cardiovascular diseases, especially structural heart disease in critically ill patients. The company is the world’s leading manufacturer of tissue heart valves and repair products used to replace or repair a patient's diseased or defective heart valve. Edwards is also a leading player in hemodynamic monitoring systems used to measure a patient's cardiovascular function in the hospital setting.The company’s products and technologies are categorized into four main areas: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR), Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies (TMTT), Surgical Structural Heart, and Critical Care.TAVR (65.4% of total revenues in 2021, underlying growth rate was 18.4% from 2020): This segment includes the SAPIEN family of valves used to treat heart valve diseases using catheter-based approaches for patients who have severe symptomatic aortic stenosis and certain patients with congenital heart disease.TMTT (1.6%, up 99.7%): This segment consists of the PASCAL transcatheter valve repair system and the Cardioband systems for mitral and tricuspid valve repair, which are commercially available in Europe. The PASCAL system provides a differentiated, minimally-invasive therapy to address the needs of patients with mitral regurgitation through leaflet approximation, while the Cardioband system enables clinicians to restore a patient’s mitral or tricuspid valve to a more functional state by reducing the annulus and lowering regurgitation.Story continuesSurgical Structural Heart (16.9%; up 14.8%): This segment primarily comprises tissue heart valves and heart valve repair products for the surgical repair or replacement of a patient's heart valve.

If you had invested in Edwards Lifesciences ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in January 2013 would be worth $5,170.47, or a 417.05% gain, as of January 18, 2023. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 169.49% and gold's return of 8.72% over the same time frame.Analysts are forecasting more upside for EW too. Edwards Lifesciences exited the third-quarter 2022, with both earnings and revenues missing the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the company registered year-over-year growth on both fronts on strong underlying growth across all product groups. Yet, a slower-than-expected recovery of the U.S. hospital staffing trend and COVID-19 restrictions in Japan marred the growth. Adjusted EPS grew despite aggressive investment in R&amp;D and commercial infrastructure to support new therapies. The company’s long-term growth strategy and strong solvency position look encouraging. In the past year, Edwards Lifesciences has outperformed its industry. Yet, increasing operating costs are worrying. The choppy market conditions due to the continued foreign exchange impact and COVID-19-related hospital staffing issues are concerning. The stock has jumped 7.41% over the past four weeks. Additionally, no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 1 higher, for fiscal 2022; the consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The downdraft in the market during the quarter led to a pile-on. We are being patient with our investment in Medtronic because the company continues to be a strong free cash flow generator and is attractively priced, with a FCF yield of 5% on trailing one-year numbers and a dividend yield of 3%. Medtronic is under new management that is focused on growing the company’s top line, reinvesting in R&amp;D, returning cash to shareholders and growing operating profits. We like new management’s strategy and believe new product launches, increased surgery visits, sound M&amp;A transactions and a shareholder returns focus, should reinvigorate the business. We added to our positions in these health care names during the quarter.”13.

The collective value of stakes owned by these hedge funds is over $4 billion.Third Point mentioned Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) in its recently-published Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)11. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59An American multinational beverage company, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is another one of the best dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds.

Berkshire Hathaway owned the largest stake in the company, worth over $22.4 billion.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”10. The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) is an Ohio-based manufacturing company that specializes in paint and coating materials.

These stakes have a consolidated value of over $2.8 billion.ClearBridge Investments mentioned The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“The third strategy is buying growth companies with idiosyncratic or stock-specific catalysts unrelated to the direction of the market like The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW). The stock is an example of a company we categorize in our cyclical bucket that should experience a step change in earnings over the medium to long term with solid execution and its ability to pass through price increases. While relative performance has been challenged by binary decisions around a handful of mega cap technology stocks, we’re entering a lower-growth period in which we’ve historically delivered strong relative results from our balanced approach.”9. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is an American multinational energy company, based in California.

The company benefited from increased energy demand as COVID-related economic restrictions eased in tandem with concerns regarding supply interruptions related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.”8.  Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is an American multinational retail corporation. In December, Credit Suisse raised its price target on the stock to $170 with an Outperform rating on the shares, calling the company one of the most important defensive names in the inflationary environment.Walmart Inc.

(NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”7. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is an American manufacturer and marketer of consumer goods and other personal care and hygiene products. The company has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 66 years and currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.9133 per share.

The collective value of these stakes is over $4.08 billion. Among these hedge funds, Bridgewater Associates was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”6. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is a popular dividend stock among hedge funds, as 72 funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in the company in Q3 2022, compared with 65 in the previous quarter. These stakes are valued at over $4.8 billion collectively.PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) holds a 50-year track record of consistent dividend growth. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.15 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.61%, as recorded on January 18. The company can be added to dividend portfolios alongside dividend stocks like Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV).JPMorgan gave a positive outlook to the consumer companies heading into 2023 and raised its price target on PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) to $150 with a Neutral rating on the shares.Lindsell Train mentioned PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“At this point, it may help to give a further example of these self-reinforcing moats to illustrate the idea, drawing from the consumer franchises side of our portfolio. In our view, strong consumer brands can similarly exhibit Lindycompatible anti-ageing properties. Consider, that the longer a company invests in its brands through advertising and R&amp;D, the stronger and more resonant they may get. When successful, a self-sustaining feedback loop is established, whereby it becomes ever harder to recreate a heritage-rich brand from scratch, raising barriers to entry, and proportionately increasing its likely lifespan. There are plenty of long-lived portfolio franchises I could reference here, but I’ve gone with PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP); partly because we have good time-series stats on it (beware data bias!) but also, as I hope will become evident, because Pepsi over its 129 years has succeeded in creating some wonderfully deep moats.With Pepsi Cola you get the flagship soft drinks brand, which is both global and generational, but you also get the Frito-Lay salty snacks portfolio assembled alongside it, claiming nearly 40% of the global market. That’s ten-times greater than the nearest competitor and likely higher than the next 65 competitors combined. These are exceptionally strong global bands with market shares to match; the long-term empirical result being Pepsi’s dividend record which over the past 66 years (as far back as we’ve been able to go) has compounded at an annualised rate of 10%. Pepsi is no ‘in at the ground floor’ start-up today, but it wasn’t six decades ago either. Early growth investor Philip Fisher put it well when in 1958 (two years into Pepsi’s current winning streak) he wrote of “companies which in spite of outstanding prospects of major further growth are so financially strong, with roots going so deep into the economic soil, that they qualify under the general classification of ‘institutional stocks’”.

But our next guest still feels somewhat optimistic about the industry in 2023, confident that big box stores like Walmart and Costco could weather a recession or slow down. Now, for more, let's bring in Jan Rogers Kniffen, World Wide Enterprises CEO, Jan Rogers Kniffen.Let me-- Jan, it's always great to see you here-- let me start out with the numbers today, what they mean in the context of this economy. Negative 1.1% for December. That's following negative 1% in November. The holiday season maybe not quite what it was cracked up to be with all the discounting?JAN ROGERS KNIFFEN: Well, the holiday season was OK. The holiday season looked more like a normal year than it did in 2021 or 2020. But it looks more like 2019, where you have normal discounting, you see some pressure on gross margins because the consumer is being a little more particular.Last year, you could put anything in front of them at any price, and they would buy it, because they were definitely convinced that it wouldn't be there if they didn't buy it, and they wouldn't have what they wanted under the Christmas tree. This year was more normal.So you know, the retail sales were up 6% year over year. And any other year in history, we would have thought that was fabulous. But given the inflation rate, we don't think it's fabulous. We think it's just OK.But inflation and discretionary retail didn't run anything close to 6%. So it's OK if you're a retailer that I deal with. It's not great like it was in 2021.- Looking at some of the areas month over month that we did see the biggest declines, and some of them should probably come as no surprise-- gasoline stations going down by about 4.6% month over month. But then you look at some of the other categories where you saw a massive decline in department stores. And so how does this kind of tell a different story among retail even, where, at some parts of retail that are more grocery-based and of course, more necessity-based versus discretionary, they might see even more of those consumer dollars continue, and perhaps even be able to capitalize off of some rotation of those dollars out of department stores?Story continuesJAN ROGERS KNIFFEN: Well, it just depends on who you're selling to and where your life lives. Right? Because if you're a department store, you're selling to the upper 60% of the economy. And if you're a grocery store, you're selling to everybody.And so we have certainly seen compression in the bottom two quantiles of the economy. They've had less money to spend on stuff other than gas and groceries. But they're getting some relief on gas right now. So in general, grocery stores' inflation probably ran 12% last year. So it depends on where you were in the economy.But if you just look at it across the board, it was very tough if you're in home goods, because people weren't trading homes, and they weren't buying home goods because they'd been buying home goods for years. They weren't buying electronics. That was tough.But apparel was actually turned out to be pretty good. Accessories turned out to be pretty good. That space, jewelry, things like that, shoes, were things people wanted to buy to go and do things and go out and travel. And travel was really great, of course.So it just depends on what the consumer wanted to do. Where in 2021, all they really had to do, and in 2020, was to buy stuff. Now they can go and do things, and they can travel. And they couldn't do that before. So the money's moving that way. And then they're getting pinched a little bit by inflation.But all in all, the consumer is pretty healthy. When unemployment's below 4% and JOLTS, the jobs available, are above 10 million, most consumers believe they're going to have a job. Even if they do get laid off, they believe they can get another job. And they believe they can get a job making just as much or more than they were already.And we're seeing wages still rise in the 5%-plus kind of range. So right now, the consumer looks fine for 2023. That doesn't mean it's going to be a great year like it was in 2021, where there were no markdowns, and everybody needed everything, and they had plenty of money to buy it with. It's going to go back to looking like it always did.If you've got the right stuff and you can offer it the right price and you can keep your expenses under control, you'll be a good retailer. If you can't, then the consumer is going to get over on you, and they're going to say, I'm not going to buy that unless you mark it down 50% instead of the 30% we want to mark it down. So it's-- I think 2023 is very likely to be the first normal year, unless we do have a hard landing, or unless we have some exogenous event that we're not expecting.So it's going back to real retailing, where the winners will be people like Walmart and Costco, like you just mentioned. Or it'll be people who are in the right place at the right time. Because Western wear is going to really be big. So Boot Barn can do well. Levi's can do well. Wrangler or Kontoor, [INAUDIBLE] can do well.- Well, I want to get to some of your 2023 predictions here. One of the themes running through your notes here is the importance of brick and mortar. It's not going away. The rise of digital continuing to rise. But you're writing some specific things, and especially notwithstanding the fact that Amazon is so much retrenched from the space.JAN ROGERS KNIFFEN: Well, Amazon really is getting out-positioned at the moment by people like Walmart, who are doing all the things Amazon does and have 5,000 stores to do it out of. Amazon's retrenching on stores. They're basically getting out of the brick-and-mortar business, and they're going to go back and play only in the online space, for all practical purposes.And they're going to live off of AWS and other components of their business besides just retail selling. Where all of the major retailers, well, even the minor retailers, have all learned that they're going to sell online, they're going to sell at the curb, and they're going to sell in the store. So as long as that's true, they're starting to regain some market share.But the market share is not going to the brick-and-mortar stores. It's actually going marginally online every year. Even last year, where we should have had a huge recovery in 2022 in the stores, online still gained a little bit. And it's going to gain more percentage-wise in 2023 as things normalize.So online's still winning. But stores still do, what, 78% of the business. And they're going to going forward for a while. And if you can run the store so that you can be very efficient and you can use it as a distribution center, because everyone is turning their stores into distribution centers, then you can be much more efficient. And you can be closer to the customer. You can reduce your last-mile delivery cost, and you can compete with Amazon.And for 20 years, people had a really hard time competing with Amazon. Because Amazon didn't try to make money in that side of their business. They just tried to drive volume. And they were a very, very difficult competitor. Today, we can compete with Amazon.- Jan, one of your other top predictions just while we have you-- and we only got about 30 seconds here-- I've been tracking and trying to keep tabs on what the new hype beast is of yesterday, today, tomorrow, perhaps, but you think that Western wear is going to take over the world. Break that down for us.JAN ROGERS KNIFFEN: It's going to briefly take over the world. Why is it going to take over the world. It's courtesy of Paramount. Paramount+ basically came out with ""Yellowstone"" and ""1883,"" which was the spinoff, the prequel to ""Yellowstone,"" and ""1923,"" which is another prequel to ""Yellowstone."" And they're the most popular things on television.So people who would never wear Western wear are wearing it. People, like me, who have always worn it, are wearing more of it. And even fashion videos and things are featuring Western wear. And this really started about 10 months ago, maybe a year ago. And it should last about three years. So that's really good if you happen to be Boot Barn or Levi's or Kontoor that I mentioned a while ago, or Tractor Supply that sells lots of Carhartt.Because it's not just Western, it's also outdoor looks. And we're seeing that take over. And if you haven't been invited to a denim and diamonds party, you will be. And you'll have to wear boots and Western look. And that's just where we're going right now.Everybody wants to be Beth Dutton. Everybody wants to meet Beth Dutton in a bar. And everybody wants John Dutton to be their dad. And that's going to cause Western wear to be great.- All right, Jan, I'll look out for my invite coming from you. Jan Rogers Kniffen, J Rogers Kniffen Worldwide Enterprises CEO, thanks for taking the time today.]"

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Dividend Stocks To Buy and Hold. Despite a slowing economy, investors remain confident in dividend growth to cushion their portfolios from financial blows in terms of eroding share prices. Alec Young, chief investment strategist at MAPsignals, told BNN Bloomberg in the beginning of January 2023 that dividend stocks are not only a source of passive income in a volatile environment, but these equities have also contributed about 40% to the overall performance of the US stock market. He noted that data suggests dividend stocks are the best performers during periods of peak inflation, which is the current case for the United States, with CPI inflation between 6% and 7%. Dividend stocks outperform non-dividend payers by a significant margin in times of economic turbulence, as per Young. Similarly, Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFi, anticipates dividend ETFs to be favored this year. He appreciates the Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index Fund (NYSE:VYM), which has companies with above-average dividend yields and provides exposure to defensive sectors. For tech exposure, Rosenbluth recommends the ALPS Sector Dividend Dogs ETF (NYSE:SDOG), a fund that has the five highest-yielding S&amp;P 500 stocks across 10 sectors, with equal weight holdings. For more insights into dividend equities, investors can also check out 11 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats to Buy, 12 Cheap Monthly Dividend Stocks To Buy, and 11 Best Dividend Stocks Yielding Over 6%.

It is a reliable dividend king, and the company will announce its 61st consecutive dividend increase on February 16th, 2023.

We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.”12. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Dividend Yield as of January 17: 1.54%Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) engages in the operation of retail and wholesale units worldwide.

All three instituted enhanced pay practices during the pandemic, with raises, unplanned bonuses and other benefits helping compensate employees for their efforts in a difficult environment. In September 2020 Walmart raised wages for 165,000 employees, including a number of entry positions to $15 an hour. It followed this in February with a raise for 425,000 workers that moved its average pay above $15 an hour.”11.

Its dividend yield is 0.8%. Earnings over the next 3-5 years are forecasted to grow at ~10%. The current P/E multiple is a very pricey 34x for such growth rate. Now, Costco is an outstanding business with consistent profits and cash flows. However, the price that you pay is important (and you tend to pay a very high price for a “cheery consensus”) and if the earnings multiple comes down to say 30x, you internal rate of return (IRR) over the next 4-5 years will be around 6-7% from holding Costco’s stock. It's a decent market-like return, but nothing to be excited about (only a few percentage points over risk-free rate).”10. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74Dividend Yield as of January 17: 3.18%Broadcom Inc.

New drugs impact diabetes but have also demonstrated significant weight loss for patients who are overweight and have other co-morbidity issues as a result. Lilly is one of the two key players in diabetes care and we believe the potential market opportunity is much higher than the consensus forecasts as we are seeing evidence of accelerating adoption.”8.

Here is what the fund said:“Integrated oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil performed well in the second quarter as continued high prices for energy products supported the stock. As the largest refiner in the US, the company has benefitted from wide “crack spreads,” or the margin between the cost of crude oil and the petroleum products extracted from it. Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industry wide has been in steady decline since 2019. We are pleased that Exxon has been using its strong cash flows to reduce debt and to return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.”7. AbbVie Inc.

Given outsized key product risk (patent cliff and generic launches beginning in 2023), AbbVie has broadened its pipeline, highlighted by its Allergan acquisition. Shares fell on results that missed consensus and indications that legacy franchises were outperforming newer product launches, calling into question AbbVie’s long-term strategy. With promising assets in the pipeline and its robust cash flow profile, we believe AbbVie will grow well into the future.”6.

The majority of the group’s sales comes from its collection of pharmaceutical franchises, but a large majority (~45%) comes from its collection of medical device businesses and its consumer brands.Here’s how JNJ makes and spends a dollar of revenues: As of 2021, about 55 cents of that dollar comes from its pharmaceutical sales – sales of drugs to pharmacies and distributors – while 30 cents come from the sale of medical devices, such as surgery equipment and orthopedics.

(RJF) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/raymond-james-financial-inc-rjf-150003199.html,1674054003,STORY,"['RJF', 'RJF-PB']","[The market expects Raymond James Financial, Inc. (RJF) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 25. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.21 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +4.3%.Revenues are expected to be $2.87 billion, up 3.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.67% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Raymond James Financial, Inc.For Raymond James Financial, Inc.The Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Raymond James Financial, Inc. Will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Raymond James Financial, Inc. Would post earnings of $2 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.08, delivering a surprise of +4%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Raymond James Financial, Inc. Doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Gallagher &amp; Co. AJG has acquired First Ireland Risk Management Limited. The acquisition will help AJG expand its footprint in Ireland.Dublin, Ireland-based First Ireland Risk Management Limited was formed in 1982. This retail insurance broker provides commercial and personal insurance products as well as life and pension solutions to clients throughout Ireland. The insurer has been in operation for four decades. Adding these entities will enhance the acquirer’s compelling portfolio and consolidate its presence in the region. The recent buyout marks the fourth acquisition in this year so far.AJG’s revenues are geographically diversified with strong domestic and international operations, which contribute about one-third of revenues and are spread across Australia, Bermuda, Canada, the Caribbean, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The company expects international contribution to total revenues to increase, given the number and size of the non-U.S. acquisitions.Arthur J. Gallagher boasts an impressive inorganic story. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) made 10 buyouts in the fourth quarter of 2022 while closing 19 new tuck-in brokerage mergers, representing about $107 million of estimated annualized revenues in the first nine months of 2022. AJG has a strong merger and acquisition pipeline with about $400 million of revenues, associated with about 50 term sheets either agreed upon or being prepared.A solid capital position supports AJG in its growth initiatives and it thus remains focused on continuing its tuck-in mergers and acquisitions. The company expects M&amp;A capacity at more than $4 billion through the end of 2023.This insurance broker remains focused on long-term growth strategies for delivering organic revenue improvement and pursuing strategic mergers and acquisitions. AJG is focused on productivity improvements and quality enhancements that should help it post sturdy numbers in the future.  Shares of Arthur J. Gallagher have gained 26.6% in a year to date, outperforming the industry’s 11.8% increase. The efforts to ramp up its growth profile and capital position should continue to drive the share price higher.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGiven the insurance industry’s adequate capital level, another player like Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. MMC has been pursuing strategic mergers and acquisitions. Marsh &amp; McLennan’s business, Marsh recently acquired HMS Insurance Associates, Inc. through its subsidiary Marsh McLennan Agency or MMA in January 2023. MMA is expected to gain vastly from HMS Insurance’s robust experience in property and casualty insurance, group captive, employee benefits and surety operations. The move is likely to boost Marsh McLennan Agency’s footprint in the Hunt Valley region.Acquisitions are part of the core growth strategies of the company. MMC made numerous purchases within its different operating units, which have enabled it to enter geographical regions, expand within the existing ones, foray into new businesses, develop segments and specialize within its existing businesses. Marsh &amp; McLennan’s shares have gained 6.1% in the past year.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the insurance industry are Aon plc AON and First American Financial Corporation FAF, both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

Smith Corporation AOS appears in good shape, with its shares having rallied 4.4% in the past six months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Aiding AOS?A. O. Smith is gaining from robust demand for condensing boilers owing to its focus on innovation and decarbonization efforts. Pricing actions to offset high material and transportation costs are driving its North American boiler sales. Price increases have driven its North American water treatment business. Robust demand for water heating and water treating products is supporting sales from India within its Rest of the World segment.The acquisitions made by AOS should continue to drive its top line. Its Atlantic Filter acquisition in June 2022 boosted its position in the water treatment industry and strengthened its customer base in Florida and the adjacent regions. The Canada-based Giant Factories buyout in October 2021 expanded the company’s commercial and water heater offerings. In third-quarter 2022, the Giant Factories acquisition added $25 million to the company’s North American sales.The company’s measures to reward its shareholders through dividend payments and share buybacks are noteworthy. In the first nine months of 2022, A. O. Smith paid dividends worth $131.1 million (up 4.5% year over year) and repurchased 4.5 million shares for $282 million (up 33% year over year).

39,0dba59f0-a3f3-3cc4-97d4-42f39f088235,XYL,2023-01-19,5 Industrial Stocks Set to Beat Q4 Earnings Estimates,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-industrial-stocks-set-beat-141302368.html,1674051182,STORY,"['CAT', 'ITW', 'XYL', 'DE']","[The Zacks Industrial Products sector’s fourth-quarter 2022 performance is likely to have been driven by strength in demand across several end markets. However, persistent supply chain constraints and labor and logistics challenges might have impaired players’ ability to meet the high demand levels. Signs of easing supply-chain issues through the quarter instill hope. While inflationary cost pressure, primarily stemming from raw material, energy and freight, is likely to have dented margins, cost control measures and pricing actions exercised by sector participants are expected to have negated these impacts on their margins.Around 4% of the companies within the Industrial Products sector have reported fourth-quarter earnings numbers so far, with a 100% beat on both earnings and revenues. Earnings increased 9.8% year over year on 13.2% higher revenues. It is too soon to draw a conclusion with the major chunk of companies yet to report. Of these, Caterpillar Inc. CAT, Deere &amp; Company DE, Illinois Tool Works ITW, Parker–Hannifin PH and Xylem Inc. XYL are some of the prominent players, which are poised to deliver an earnings beat this season.Expectations For the Sector for Q4Per the latest Earnings Trends report, the Industrial Sector is likely to deliver 11.6% growth in earnings for the fourth quarter of 2022 on the back of an 8.4% sales increase. The projected growth reflects a deceleration from a 20.5% rise in earnings on a 14.5% increase in revenues in the third quarter. Nevertheless, the sector is one of the eight sectors that are expected to post growth this earnings season. This is commendable, considering the inflationary scenario and the supply chain snarls.Factors at Play During the QuarterPer the Federal Reserve, industrial production decreased 0.2% in November 2022. Manufacturing output dipped 0.6% for the month but remained 1.2% above last year. Overall, industrial production gained 2.5% over the 12-month period that ended November 2022. In December, the Institute for Supply Management’s (ISM) manufacturing index touched 48.9%, contracting for the second month in a row. The average for the past 12 months (ended December 2022), however, stood at 53.5%. Amid the ongoing uncertainty in the global economy and persisting inflationary trends, some customers have been curbing spending.The manufacturing sector had been bearing the brunt of the supply-chain issues. Some of the industry players recently noted that the supply-chain situation is gradually improving. The delivery performance of suppliers to manufacturing organizations was reported to be faster for the third straight month in December.Strength across end-markets such as agriculture, construction, mining, transportation, gas utilities and energy transition is likely to have aided the performances of the industrial companies in the December ended quarter. Stable packaging demand for food, beverages and medicines and rise in e-commerce activities are likely to have aided the performance of companies engaged in the production of packaging materials. Solid backlog levels, cost-control measures, effective pricing and operational execution are expected to have favored performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Story continuesHow to Pick Winners?Given the large number of players operating in the industrial products space, picking the right stocks is not an easy task. But our proven model makes it fairly simple. One can shortlist with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), which increases the odds of an earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they report earnings with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP — the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate — is our proprietary methodology for determining the stocks with maximum chances of delivering positive earnings surprises in their next announcements. Our research shows that for stocks with this perfect combination, the chances of a beat are as high as 70%.Our ChoicesBelow we list five industrial stocks that have the right mix of elements to pull off positive surprises this earnings season.Caterpillar has an Earnings ESP of +1.14% and a Zacks Rank #3. CAT is slated to release fourth-quarter 2022 earnings numbers on Jan 31, before market open. The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 14.7%.Caterpillar Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCaterpillar Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCaterpillar Inc. price-eps-surprise | Caterpillar Inc. QuoteCaterpillar’s results are the most watched in the sector as it is considered a bellwether for the global economy. The world's largest manufacturer of heavy industrial equipment has delivered year-over-year improvement in revenues and earnings for seven straight quarters, thanks to its cost-saving actions, strong end-market demand and pricing actions that offset the impact of supply chain issues and cost pressure. Its fourth-quarter results are likely to reflect these factors as well. Also, the company ended the third quarter of 2022 with an impressive backlog of $30 billion, which is also likely to have boosted the fourth quarter top-line. The fourth quarter of the year is historically the strongest quarter for CAT in terms of sales due to seasonal factors.Deere has an Earnings ESP of +2.83% and a Zacks Rank #2. It is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Feb 17, before market open. The company has a four-quarter trailing average earnings surprise of 7%.Deere &amp; Company Price and EPS SurpriseDeere &amp; Company Price and EPS SurpriseDeere &amp; Company price-eps-surprise | Deere &amp; Company QuoteDeere’s results are likely to reflect the favorable farm fundamentals. Improved commodity prices and the consequent improvement in farm income are likely to have made farmers spend more on agricultural equipment. This is likely to have translated into improved order levels for Deere. Strong replacement demand is also expected to have boosted its top line. While supply-chain issues, high production costs, are likely to have impacted the company’s margin in the quarter, favorable price realization and higher shipment volumes/sales mix are expected to have negated some of these headwinds.Illinois Tool Works has an Earnings ESP of +2.24% and a Zacks Rank #3. ITW is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2022 earnings on Feb 2. The company has a four-quarter trailing average earnings surprise of 4.2%.Illinois Tool Works Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseIllinois Tool Works Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseIllinois Tool Works Inc. price-eps-surprise | Illinois Tool Works Inc. QuoteIllinois Tool’s results for the quarter under review are likely to reflect strong demand in semiconductor businesses, equipment as well as consumables manufacturing operations. Continued strength in industrial applications, construction, U.S. residential and commercial end-markets bode well for the fourth-quarter results. Contributions from recent acquisitions are also likely to have supported results. While supply chain disruptions and raw material cost inflation remained headwinds, pricing actions are expected to have offset some of the impact on margins.Xylem has an Earnings ESP of +1.27% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2022 earnings on Feb 7. The company has a four-quarter trailing average earnings surprise of 13.3%.Xylem Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseXylem Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseXylem Inc. price-eps-surprise | Xylem Inc. QuoteXylem’s fourth-quarter performance is expected to have been aided by its strong backlog levels and solid demand across its end markets. Due to the essential nature of its business, demand remains robust. Its Water Infrastructure segment is benefiting from effective price realization and robust transport demand in Western Europe.  The Applied Water segment is expected to have gained from strong price realization and backlog execution in industrial, commercial and residential end markets. Measurement &amp; Control Solutions is likely to have benefited from robust demand in the advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) end market and modest improvement in chip supply. Pricing actions to mitigate cost inflation and gradual easing of supply-chain constraints are likely to have benefited its bottom line.Parker–Hannifin has an Earnings ESP of +0.21% and a Zacks Rank #3. PH is expected to release second-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings on Feb 2. The company has a four-quarter trailing average earnings surprise of 11.3%.ParkerHannifin Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseParkerHannifin Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseParkerHannifin Corporation price-eps-surprise | ParkerHannifin Corporation QuotePH’s quarterly performance is likely to have been aided by strong demand across end markets and higher order levels. The company is also expected to have gained from its unique Win Strategy (version 3.0 launched in fiscal 2020), which focuses on innovation, strategic positioning, distribution growth and incentive plan changes to drive organic growth. The Win strategy has been supporting the company’s margin expansion. PH’s effective pricing and supply-chain management actions are also expected to have negated the impact of high costs in the quarter.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Swedish activist Greta Thunberg was briefly detained.The government, in which the Greens are a coalition partner, agreed to the mine expansion by RWE on condition the energy firm phased out coal eight years earlier than planned in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia.The Greens viewed that compromise as a win, although the move incensed many environmental activists, particularly as the coal being mined is lignite, one of the most polluting types.""They keep talking about the 1.5 degree target, while it is clear we will break it by 2030 at the latest,"" said Jakob Beyer from the Last Generation climate group, referring to a goal to stop the planet warming by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius.Other Greens supporters saw it as a pragmatic move when Germany needs to replace dwindling Russian gas supplies amid the Ukraine crisis but they said it should be followed by squeezing more from coalition partners to make a faster shift towards renewable energy and to push other climate policies.""Many people understand that other things have been prioritised for now, but this understanding will be exhausted at some point,"" Sascha Mueller-Kraenner, the national managing director of DUH environmental group, told Reuters.He said the Greens needed to secure a faster phase-out for using coal in power generation than the 2038 government agreed deadline, a demand resisted in many eastern German states amid an energy crunch caused by war in Ukraine.Story continuesHURDLES AHEAD""We will continue to fight to ensure that climate protection is implemented, be it on the issue of gas deals, the coal phase-out in east Germany or the transport turnaround,"" Greens lawmaker Lisa Badum said.The party will be measured against the green elements of the government's agenda to ensure renewable energy covers 80% of power output by 2030 and to clean up transport and construction, which missed annual greenhouse gas emission targets in 2022.But analysts say the Greens are facing bureaucratic hurdles and resistance from some regional governments to the renewables rollouts, and they still need to win over the FDP junior coalition partner on some areas of the environmental agenda.""We have the impression that the Greens simply made a lot of compromises last year and have to fight a little harder for climate issues in the government,"" Mueller-Kraenner said.Still, the party is benefiting from the popularity of the Greens leaders, Economy Minister Robert Habeck and Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, who took a lead on the mine saga. Polling shows the party would secure 18% of the vote if an election was held now, four points above the 2021 vote.""The Greens have presented a pragmatically rational style of politics and that has helped them become stronger,"" Manfred Guellner, head of pollster Forsa said.Such a pragmatic approach could help broaden the party's appeal. But it still requires a balancing act to ensure it does not split a party where some want much swifter action.""If the Greens no longer act together with the climate movement ... then of course that weakens our attempt at a climate-friendly transformation,"" said Greens lawmaker Kathrin Henneberger, who fought to save Luetzerath village.

But he’s also openly floated the idea of bankruptcy, cited a “massive drop” in revenue as some advertisers fled from the platform and slashed staff since closing his $44 billion leveraged buyout at the end of October.A group of seven banks, led by Morgan Stanley, own the debt. The drama around Musk’s acquisition and volatile markets left them saddled with the loans, which they normally would have offloaded to investors.Now, after they lost some $4 billion on paper for backing Musk’s Twitter bid, market onlookers see little reason for the banks to go along with any unexpected maneuvers near the interest-payment deadline, roughly around Jan. 27.After all, in most bankruptcies, the equity is wiped out — and lenders eventually take control.“There’s too much at stake for Musk and his co-investors,” said Jordan Chalfin, a senior analyst at credit research firm CreditSights. “Twitter will make its near-term interest payments, come hell or high water, and give the business time to turn around.”Representatives for Morgan Stanley and Musk didn’t respond to requests for comment.Few ReasonsWhile anything is possible with Musk, he doesn’t have many reasons to skip the first interest payment. The longer term is a bigger question: In the Twitter Spaces conversation, he said the company was on pace to lose $3 billion in 2023.Story continues“That is why I spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy,” he said.But in the near term, if Twitter didn’t pay its interest, that could trigger a default, which would allow the banks to force the company into Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Some debt allows for a 30-day grace period, but it’s unclear if that exists for the Twitter loans.Regardless, the consequences for Musk, 51, who owns an estimated 79% of the company, would be immediate and severe.While Twitter is on the hook for the debt, and not Musk personally, he put up more than $20 billion for his stake in the company. That’s now worth an estimated $11.6 billion, a sizable part of his $137.4 billion fortune, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.“If you’re a lender to Twitter and Elon Musk is threatening to not pay the coupon, you go to the standard playbook, which is: ‘OK, I’ll see you in bankruptcy,’” said Philip Brendel, a distressed debt analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.“In terms of who’s got more to lose, it’s certainly Elon Musk,” Brendel said. “Whether he cares whether he loses that or not, that’s a whole different question. He certainly behaves differently than what normal people would do in those situations.”Wider NegotiationsMusk is known for being unpredictable and could use the first payment in wider negotiations with Twitter’s lenders. He and the banks have been trying to find solutions for the interest burden, which has grown more punitive than when he made his offer in April as interest rates soared.Late last year, bankers were considering replacing some of the high-interest debt with new margin loans backed by Tesla Inc. stock that he’d be personally responsible for repaying, one of several options considered at the time.As Musk sold $3.6 billion of Tesla shares last month, some analysts speculated that he could use the money to buy Twitter debt from the banks, putting him in a better position in bankruptcy proceedings. But it’s not clear whether Morgan Stanley and others would willingly sell to him at fire-sale prices.There’s also a chance that Musk decides to give up on Twitter and refocus on his other companies including Tesla and SpaceX.Of course, if Musk walked away, he wouldn’t just hurt himself, but also the other equity backers who joined his investment, such as sovereign wealth fund Qatar Investment Authority, which contributed $375 million.“We engage with the management, with Elon in terms of the plan that he has for the company, and we believe in this, and we trust his leadership in terms of turning around the company,” QIA Chief Executive Officer Mansoor Al Mahmoud said in a Bloomberg TV interview at Davos on Monday.QIA was part of a group of around 20 investors that contributed to the equity commitment, according to a May filing. Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal also rolled over more than 30 million shares, valued at about $1.9 billion using the $54.20 purchase price. Jack Dorsey rolled over his stake, too.Debt DetailsTwitter has three large pieces of debt with interest coming due: $6.5 billion that was meant to be sold to leveraged-loan investors, and $6 billion of bridge loans, split equally between a secured and unsecured tranche, that banks had planned to sell in the form of junk bonds.All the debt appears to have quarterly interest payments, according to an April debt commitment letter and people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named discussing a private transaction.The interest due in the coming weeks is expected to be about $300 million, according to Bloomberg calculations and market participants not involved in the Twitter deal. That’s based on the debt commitment letter and a maximum interest rate of 11.75% on the unsecured tranche.This figure could be higher depending on whether the banks increased the interest rate on the $6.5 billion tranche using their “flex” provision when the deal closed, and whether Twitter is using the one-, three- or six-month version of the benchmark Secured Overnight Financing Rate.

On behalf of Morgan Stanley, I will begin the call with the following disclaimer. This call is being recorded. During today's presentation, we will refer to our earnings release and financial supplement, copies of which are available at morganstanley.com. Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release and strategic update. Within the strategic update, certain reported information has been adjusted as noted. These adjustments were made to provide a transparent and comparative view of our operating performance against our strategic objectives.The reconciliations of these non-GAAP adjusted operating performance metrics are included in the notes to the presentation or the earnings release. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.BankJames Gorman: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. The macro backdrop of the last year presented challenges we haven't seen for some time. The combined impact of persistent inflation and rapid central bank tightening pressured asset levels and led to very little strategic activity and capital raising. Despite volatility throughout the year, Morgan Stanley demonstrated resilience and delivered on an ROTCE of 16%, including integration-related expenses from our deals. The firm did what it was supposed to do with our more stable Wealth and Investment Management businesses offsetting declines in Institutional Securities. This is hard evidence of the transformation we've made to become increasingly durable and a stark contrast to the 8% ROTCE we had in the last notable challenging environment of 2015.Story continuesWhen markets rebound, we will capitalize on growth once again across the full firm and from an even stronger position. Before turning to Sharon to discuss the details of the fourth quarter and the full year, I'll walk you through now how we plan to achieve these goals in our annual strategic update appropriately titled delivering growth through the next decade. Briefly first, I'd like to acknowledge the many contributions Jon Pruzan made as CFO and COO. As you know, he's retiring from Morgan Stanley at the end of this month, and we wish him the absolute best. Please now turn to the deck into Slide 3. What informs our confidence in growth strategy is that we know who we are. We've been clear about that for over a decade. Our clarity of purpose has been a key driver of our success to date, and the next decade will be no different.On Slide 4, you can see we've been consistent since the financial crisis. We have a client-centric franchise with a common objective to facilitate capital flows between those who have it and those who need it. We're committed to our clients and to the markets we're in, clearly illustrated by the leading competitive positions we have. In each of our businesses, we have a significant competitive moat, which will enable us to maintain and further enhance our strength. Slide 5 highlights the strategic decisions we've made over the past decade that are focused on aligning markets -- ourselves to the markets where we perform best. And these are core businesses with scale in major markets that are on the whole more balance sheet-light and benefit from more durable fee-based revenues.We continue to invest in these areas to drive future growth. We have proven track record in our ability to acquire and integrate the businesses that are aligned with this strategy, namely within Wealth and Investment Management. Importantly, we've also taken action to get out of businesses that are not core to this flow of capital. While we may facilitate activities across varied markets, we do not own businesses that are built around unsecured consumer credit payments, physical handling of commodities and the like. Instead, we focus on markets we best, and our ability is there to support our clients in those markets. Please turn to Slide 6. This illustrates the ongoing growth and shift of our business mix. As we continue to grow our client assets, we expect Wealth and Investment Management will become an increasingly larger portion of the firm's pretax profit.The stability of the firm will be further enhanced by this growth, all the while coupled with a preeminent institutional franchise. Fair to say our business model was tested this year, as you can see on Slide 7. 2022 was a paradigm shift. But first the common acts continuation of the first pandemic in 100 years, the first war in Europe over 70 years and the highest inflation in 40 years. Despite lower asset values and an anemic underwriting calendar, the firm performed well. We generated, as I said before, a 16% ROTCE and the most excess risk-based capital of our peers and attracted over $300 billion of net new assets, all while integrating two major acquisitions. So, now moving to the opportunities to maximize growth in the next decade, let's start with Wealth Management.On Slide 8, you can see we have leadership positions across channels, reflecting our combination of best-in-class advice and best-in-class technology. And we have the ability to meet any client wherever they are in their wealth accumulation journey. This allows us to grow with our clients along the way and provides the opportunity for clients to migrate across channels. The growth of our business is reflected in our higher average daily revenues, something I've been tracking for well over a decade. 2022, every trading day saw revenues in excess of $80 million, and over 1/3 of those exceeded $100 million a day. Contrast that with only three years ago, where 95% of trading revenues were each below $80 million, and none exceeded $100 million. It is through the journey as illustrated on Slide 7, Wealth Management has gone through a powerful transformation, as you all know, including with the most significant recent acquisitions in E*TRADE and Solium, which have expanded our client base with two new channels.Today, we have 18 million relationships. We focus on deepening those relationships far up the right product at the right time and consolidating assets under our platform. From here, we're building on the scale and the tools to reach -- and the reach that will propel future growth. Net interest income has certainly been part of the profitability expansion to date, and you can see the driving forces highlighted on Slide 10. We have invested in expanding our bank offerings, allowing us to offer attractive products to our clients on both sides of their balance sheet to meet their needs. We've nearly doubled our lending balances over the last three years, and we expect to continue to grow attractive high-quality loans. On the other side, our deposit franchise has grown significantly since 2019 and will continue to support future NII through various cycles.Approximately 90% of our deposits are sourced from our Wealth Management client base. And in the current rising rate environment, our cost of deposits is more efficient than that we experienced in the last rate hiking cycle. Sharon will discuss this important topic and our outlook around NII further in a few minutes. Let's turn to Slide 11. This now talks about NNA growth, net new assets. Over the last three years, our platform generated nearly $1 trillion of net new assets showing a clear step change from prior periods and marking Morgan Stanley as a leader across our peer group as an asset accumulator. Given the scale and reach of our businesses, we expect to deliver this pace of asset accumulation going forward. Obviously, there will be up and down individual years.But over a three-year period, we expect to drive approximately $1 trillion in net new assets. Most importantly, as you can see on the right-hand side of this page, no single source is accounting for greater than 25% of this net new money. Some people think it's just a result of recruiting. It is absolutely not. It's a combination of several things, which the team has described as filling the funnel of net new money. You can see on Slide 12, which shows our growth in client assets, we have experienced that through our workplace channel. We estimate now that relationships wealth held away has expanded by about 4x in the last three years. Our ability to serve clients across the entire wealth spectrum, we're well positioned to consolidate a portion of these assets.Further, the workplace channel continues to bring new relationships to the platform. We've executed on key steps to deepen those. We've already reached our goal to roll out companion accounts to 90% of workplace participants and to achieve 30% retention of stock plan assets. We look forward to even higher retention. The results of our client-driven strategy are illustrated on Slide 13. The workplace channel has driven the majority of our growth in client relationships and stands at 12 million relationships to date. While it can take several years to deepen those, we've already seen success in some parts of the offering that of our stock plan administrative services. Over the last three years, we've had approximately $350 billion of after-tax vested inflows.Vesting assets gives us more opportunity to deliver an integrated client experience, and that's allowed us to showcase the power of advice. To date, we've already seen advisor-led flows of approximately $150 billion that originated from a workplace relationship. Portion of those assets are the stock plan investor balances, but a larger portion are from assets that were previously held away. In short, we will -- as we deliver our full suite of capabilities, our strategy to attract clients to advice is working. Investment Management has also delivered strong fee-based growth over the course of its own transformation, as you can see on Slide 14, which encapsulates the business together with Eaton Vance. This business has more than doubled its durable asset management and related fees since 2014.And importantly, this significantly larger revenue base is more diversified. Increased diversification from fixed income, customization and alternatives continues to support results in more volatile equity markets. We remain very aligned to key growth areas. Our alternative investment capital is at $210 billion with strong growth in private credit, real assets, including infrastructure, our multi-strategy hedge fund platform and special situations. And customization by our market-leading parametric business continues to be a significant growth engine. Shifting to Institutional Securities on Slide 15, we have a global and balanced franchise. And our integrated investment bank has and continues to focus on meeting clients where they are active.This has served us well as our strength is evident across various market environments. We remain a leader in equity in Investment Banking and have steadily rebuilt our fixed income franchise focused on our strongest capabilities. On Slide 16, you can see our institutional business remains a top three global leader in the industry, as demonstrated by a wallet share position. We have demonstrated our ability to defend share and gain it in relatively more capital-light businesses. At the same time, we've shown prudent several resources as illustrated clearly by the disciplined RWA usage, which actually dropped from '21 to '22 and our consistent G-SIB surcharge of 3%. Let's move to our capital strategy on Slide 17. We have 200 basis points of excess capital above our regulatory requirement.This is intentional. Our capital strategy has focused on bringing the risk down in our businesses, and we've seen a steady decline in our SCB excluding the dividend add-on reflective of our more durable business mix. Our capital position gives us enormous flexibility, and we're comfortable with our decision to be prudently positioned. On Slide 18, you can see our excess capital position enables us to continue to invest in our business for future growth and deliver robust returns to shareholders. Our business transformation, especially the durable earnings from Wealth and Investment Management, enable us to double that dividend -- enabled us to double our dividend in 2021 and further increase it by 11% in 2022. At the same time, we've reduced our shares outstanding from the much higher levels driven by the impact of our recent acquisitions.Taken together, we delivered a 9% capital return to our shareholders last year. We remain committed to ongoing shareholder return, adjusting always for whatever the business performance is and the regulatory requirements demand. Shifting to how we see the future state on Slide 19. Starting with the expected path to $10 trillion in client assets across Wealth and Investment Management, we've demonstrated our ability to generate over the last three years positive net new assets of approximately $300 million a year. Combining that with reasonable average market assumptions give us the confidence this will lead to $10 trillion in client assets in reasonable years ahead. Now let's consider this within the broader firm picture, and bear with me for a minute.In 2022, the firm delivered $14 billion of pretax profit. In this future scenario of $10 trillion of assets, which I believe will happen, generating approximately 50 basis points of revenue which is about what we're doing currently at a 30% pretax margin, which is within 2% of what we're doing currently. If you put that math together, it should create of itself over $14 billion of pretax income. As you can see, that exceeds that of the full firm today just from the wealth and asset management businesses. So if you pull it all together, just to wrap it up, Slide 20 reiterates our confidence in our performance goals. They have not changed on account of what's going on in the markets in the last 12 months. These are the metrics we need to support our longer-term objectives.Of note, we've added a new goal that I spoke to earlier that we've talked about in the last six months to generate $1 trillion in net new assets approximately every three years. Again, I'm sure there will be volatility quarter by quarter, year by year. But as we've demonstrated through the funnel of sources, we expect an outcome over three years of approximately $1 trillion. That's about by the way up to 5% to 7% of beginning period assets within wealth and asset management. As we approach 2023, we do so with quiet confidence, recognizing we have a line of sight with the durability of our Wealth and Investment Management businesses and our market share leading positions across much of Institutional Securities. As always, our objectives are subject to major moves in the economic, political or regulatory environment.However, with a constructive outlook and a proven track record we've delivered thus far, we fully expect to achieve our goals over time. I will now turn the call over to Sharon, who will discuss the fourth quarter and annual results and we'd be delighted to take your questions.See also 10 Best Performing Actively Managed ETFs in 2022 and 10 Best Cryptocurrencies to Invest In.Sharon Yeshaya: Thank you, and good morning. In a complex year, the firm delivered solid results. Full year revenues were $53.7 billion, and PBT was $14.1 billion. The fourth quarter contributed to $12.7 billion in revenues and PBT of $2.8 billion. The strategic investments we have made over the last decade have paid off. Wealth Management had a record year and Fixed Income had its strongest performance in over a decade. While the firm was broadly impacted by increased volatility and economic uncertainty, the business model performed very well in a challenging environment as it was designed to do. The full year results included $470 million of integration-related expenses of which $120 million were incurred in the fourth quarter.Excluding these impacts, EPS was $6.36 and $1.31 for the full year and for the quarter respectively. The full year ROTCE was 15.3% and 15.7% excluding the costs associated with integration. In the quarter, severance expenses of $133 million related to a December employee action and a net discrete tax benefit -- or net discrete tax benefits of $89 million largely offset each other through net income. The full year efficiency ratio was 73.2%. Excluding integration-related expenses, our full year efficiency ratio was 72.4%. Total expenses were approximately flat to the prior year. Lower compensation expenses principally related to movements in DCP and on lower revenues were offset by higher non-compensation expenses primarily driven by investments in technology as well as increased marketing and business development spend.As a reminder, this year also included a $200 million charge related to a legal matter regarding the firm's record-keeping requirement in the second quarter. As the environment evolved over the course of 2022, we actively managed our expense base. Cognizant of the ongoing macro uncertainty, we continue to review efficiency opportunities. We are in the final stages of completing our integration of both E*TRADE and Eaton Vance. And this will be the last quarter we present measures that exclude integration-related expenses from reported results. However, particularly as it relates to the integration of E*TRADE, the final back-office integration remains scheduled to conclude in 2023. We expect to incur approximately $325 million of additional integration-related expenses this year.These expenses will largely be spread evenly across quarters with approximately 2/3 related to E*TRADE and 1/3 related to Eaton Vance. Now to the businesses. Institutional Securities full year revenues of $24.4 billion declined 18% from the record prior year. In the fourth quarter, revenues were $4.8 billion. Overall, quarterly client engagement across fixed income and equities tapered from the higher levels seen in the first nine months of the year, reflective of seasonality and the macroeconomic environment. Weaker Investment Banking results persisted, reflecting the challenging banking backdrop. Investment banking revenues were $5.2 billion for the full year, down 49% from the record prior year. Advisory delivered its second best result, supported in part by the completion of previously announced strategic transactions.Underwriting was more challenged, in line with the broader market. Full year global equity volumes dropped to levels unseen in the last 20 years. Debt volumes contracted following the first quarter. And while the market was receptive to higher quality issuance, activity was limited to constructive market periods. Fourth quarter revenues of $1.3 billion decreased 49% from the prior year. Lower completed M&amp;A and underwriting market volumes weighed on results. As we have highlighted in prior quarters, client dialogue and engagement remains high as clients seek advice to navigate the difficult environment. Greater economic clarity should lead to increased confidence to undertake strategic transactions. And looking ahead, we expect issuers to take advantage of these windows of opportunity.Equity full year trading -- excuse me, equity full year revenues were $10.8 billion, representing another strong year of over $10 billion and making us a global leader in this business. Revenues declined 6% from the record prior year primarily driven by lower market activities. Revenues were $2.2 billion in the quarter, reflecting lower asset levels and volumes. Prime brokerage revenues were lower than the prior year as average client balances declined from record levels driven by lower equity markets and deleveraging. Cash results declined on lower client activity across regions. Derivative results increased slightly as the business navigated the market volatility well. Last year's fourth quarter also benefited from a mark-to-market gain on an investment versus a markdown this quarter.Fixed income revenues of $9 billion for the full year were the highest in over a decade. The divergence between the Fed's guidance on financial tightening and conditions and the market expectations engaged clients and drove revenues in macro while volatile energy markets benefited commodities. Quarterly revenues were $1.4 billion. Macro performance benefited from higher client engagement as inflation expectations moderated, and clients repositioned in rates and foreign exchange. Strength in micro was supported by active secondary markets as expectations for inflation tempered and credit spreads tightened, driving an increase in client activity. Results in commodities were down significantly and primarily reflected lower revenues in the power and gas businesses.Other revenues included $356 million of mark-to-market losses on corporate loans held for sale and loan hedges. These losses were substantially offset by net interest income and fees of $287 million. Turning to Wealth Management. For the full year, Wealth Management produced record revenues of $24.4 billion and a record pretax profit of $6.6 billion, resulting in a PBT margin of 27%. Excluding integration-related expenses of $357 million, the PBT margin was 28.4%. Full year results reflect mark-to-market impacts of our deferred cash-based compensation plans referred to as DCP. This negatively impacts our full year revenues by $858 million with a corresponding decrease of $530 million in compensation expenses. As we have explained historically, there is typically a timing difference between the mark-to-market gains and losses on the economic hedges and the deferred recognition of the compensation expense over the vesting period.The revenue and the expense impact of DCP is now included in our financial supplement. Fourth quarter revenues were a record of $6.6 billion and the PBT margin was 27.8%. Including integration-related expenses of $94 million, the PBT margin was 29.2%. Total client assets were $4.2 trillion. Fee-based flows were $20 billion in the quarter, and asset management revenues were $3.3 billion. Net new assets of $311 billion in the year represent a 6.2% annual growth rate of beginning period assets. Fourth quarter net new assets were $52 billion with contributions across channels. Transactional revenues in the fourth quarter were $931 million. Including the impact of DCP, transactional revenues declined 15% from the prior year. The decline was driven by lower levels of overall retail engagement and fewer new issuance opportunities, partially offset by increased transactions related to fixed income products.Bank lending balances grew by 17% in the year or 13% -- or $17 billion in the year or 13% and stand at $146 billion. The pace of lending growth slowed for the second consecutive quarter and was largely unchanged sequentially. While mortgages and tailored loans continue to grow slowly, this was offset by pay downs in securities-based lending due to the higher interest rate environment. Total deposits rose 6% sequentially to $351 billion driven by continued demand for our savings offering among our Wealth Management clients. We have seen success with our strategy to provide advisers with expanded tools needed to offer their clients choice in varied market environment. Further, the pace of sweep outflows also moderated in the quarter. As a result, we have a favorable deposit mix, largely sourced from our Wealth Management client base with attractive pricing and options to meet our clients' needs.Net interest income was $2.1 billion in the quarter. The 52% increase from the prior year was driven by the benefits of the increased rate environment, an efficient deposit mix and strong lending growth over the last 12 months. Looking ahead, we do not believe that NII is peaked. We entered the year with an attractive deposit base with higher intrinsic value. While we expect the growth of NII to moderate from the pace of the last two quarters, we anticipate continued expansion in the first quarter of approximately 5% sequentially, assuming the forward curve is realized. Investment Management reported full year revenues of $5.4 billion, declining 14% from the prior year. The challenging market backdrop led to lower accrued carried interest in several of our private funds.Also -- and also impacted our AUM, which declined to $1.3 trillion. Fourth quarter revenues were $1.5 billion. Long-term net outflows of $6 billion in the quarter were driven by equities and fixed income, reflecting the challenging public market backdrop, partially offset by demand for alternatives and solutions, particularly parametric customized portfolios as well as our special situation strategies and private credit. Fourth quarter asset management and related fees were $1.4 billion, declining on the back of lower average AUM, partially offset by higher liquidity revenues. As a reminder, performance fees are recognized on an annual basis, largely in the fourth quarter, which drove the increase versus the third quarter. Quarterly performance-based income and other revenues were $90 million.We saw broad-based gains in our private alternatives portfolio, though lower than the prior year. The diversification we gain from having fixed income, parametric customization and alternatives positions us well to perform through the cycle. We continue to invest in this business and leverage our premier global distribution capabilities to support future growth to meet continued global client demand. Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets were $1.2 trillion. Standardized RWAs declined by $9 billion sequentially to $449 billion, reflective of our prudent management of resources. Our standardized CET1 ratio was 15.3%, up 50 basis points from the prior quarter. Solid earnings, lower RWAs and gains in OCIs partially offset by capital actions contributed to our strong CET1 ratio.We continue to execute our buyback program, and we repurchased approximately $1.7 billion of common stock in the quarter. The full year tax rate was 20.7% driven by the resolution of certain historic tax matters and the realization of certain tax benefits. We expect our 2023 tax rate to be approximately 23%, which will exhibit some quarterly volatility. The firm's results demonstrate the ability of our business model to perform in an evolving environment. While there are, of course, uncertainties as we look ahead into 2023, we remain the growth opportunities in the year ahead. Our combined $5.5 trillion of assets across Wealth and Investment Management provides us balance. Importantly, our scale positions us well to capture the asset opportunity when the markets recover.Finally, while still very early in the year, we are encouraged by the levels of client engagement we've seen so far. With that, we will now open the line to questions.Operator: We'll go first to Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.Glenn Schorr: I appreciate all the slides, too. Okay. Two big picture questions, I guess. One, James, with the 200 basis points of excess CET1 requirements, the big buffer served you well. You've got a lot of buybacks, but also it's dilutive to returns. And I'm just curious how you balance that of keeping that buffer or is that buffer more temporary weighting on Basel III end game final results? Or is that something you want -- you plan on sitting at? I'm just curious on your big picture resting spot for that excess capital.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Morgan Stanley in FocusMorgan Stanley (MS) is headquartered in New York, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of 14.19% since the start of the year. The investment bank is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.77 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.19%. This compares to the Financial - Investment Bank industry's yield of 0.45% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.62%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $3.10 is up 5.1% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Morgan Stanley has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 27.74%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Morgan Stanley's current payout ratio is 44%, meaning it paid out 44% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, MS expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $7.20 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 13.21%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Story continuesHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, MS is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Layoffs have rippled across Wall Street with banks, including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, announcing job cuts. But taking a closer look, the picture is actually mixed when it comes to the scale of these cuts for the big banks. Alexandra Semenova has that story for us. Alex.ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: Well, guys, we've been hearing a lot about finance layoffs lately, and they certainly are happening. Goldman Sachs laid off more than 3,000 workers last week. There were even reports that bankers there were calling it ""David's Demolition Day"" after CEO David Solomon.But taking a more nuanced look at what's going on, the layoffs actually, at this point, aren't as widespread as it seems. Yesterday, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley reported their earnings, and also confirmed that they laid off thousands of workers in the past two months, Goldman Sachs about 6% of its workforce and Morgan Stanley about 2%. Then we've also got Wells Fargo that has been steadily cutting jobs as it scales back its mortgage business.But top executives at JP Morgan, Bank of America, Citigroup have all said that they have no immediate plans to cut jobs even in the case of a recession. Bank of America's Brian Moynihan told our own Brian Sozzi yesterday that there are no plans to cut jobs. You have all of these executives on their earnings call saying that they're still in hiring mode.JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said that they'll continue to hire jobs. They have no plans to cut them even in the event of an economic downturn, which differs a lot from what executives like David Solomon and James Gorman have said. For Goldman Sachs, for example, though, its investment banking division makes up more than 50% of its revenue. So because we've seen that sector take such a big hit in the past year, it makes sense that it's being more conservative and cutting jobs where it needs to. And then for Morgan Stanley, it's cutting about 2% of jobs, which is kind of-- it's a natural culling that is happening.Story continuesDuring the pandemic, we saw a pause in these performance reviews that banks normally have in the annual culling that typically happens. But they're bringing that back. It's pretty normal for these banks to let go of bankers who were underperforming at the end of the year. So when it comes to finance layoffs, they're not as widespread as what we're seeing in the technology sector, for example, where it's happening across the board where there are thousands of workers-- seemingly every day we're hearing announcements from companies. In the financial sector, it's a little bit different.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, and within those banks and the segments that they've reported for, it's been interesting to see where some of the disclosed layoffs have taken place or, on the other side, where they've started to cut some of those bonuses as well in the interim period of time too given some of the underperformance year-over-year.ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: Exactly, Brad. Bonuses will be an interesting one too because the anxieties over layoffs now shift to bonuses. And any workers who didn't get laid off will probably wish that they did when they see those really lean numbers come in the coming weeks. And that's kind of what banks are hoping for. They're hoping for that natural attrition to happen. So anyone they didn't lay off, any performers that haven't been up to par will see their bonuses come in at near zero levels or substantially down from last year, and maybe go out and look for another job.And that will lean out those workforces even more. And it's going to be interesting to see what happens when it comes to the different divisions within banks because their performance has varied so much because the trading desks, as we saw in yesterday's earnings, have done very, very well. But then you have the investment banking side at all of the banks, which is down more than 50% from last year. So it'll be a mixed picture, too, when it comes to the bonuses.BRAD SMITH: Yahoo Finance's own Alexandra Semenova breaking down all things financials and big banks for us today. Thanks so much.]"

Swedish activist Greta Thunberg was briefly detained.The government, in which the Greens are a coalition partner, agreed to the mine expansion by RWE on condition the energy firm phased out coal eight years earlier than planned in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia.The Greens viewed that compromise as a win, although the move incensed many environmental activists, particularly as the coal being mined is lignite, one of the most polluting types.""They keep talking about the 1.5 degree target, while it is clear we will break it by 2030 at the latest,"" said Jakob Beyer from the Last Generation climate group, referring to a goal to stop the planet warming by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius.Other Greens supporters saw it as a pragmatic move when Germany needs to replace dwindling Russian gas supplies amid the Ukraine crisis but they said it should be followed by squeezing more from coalition partners to make a faster shift towards renewable energy and to push other climate policies.""Many people understand that other things have been prioritised for now, but this understanding will be exhausted at some point,"" Sascha Mueller-Kraenner, the national managing director of DUH environmental group, told Reuters.He said the Greens needed to secure a faster phase-out for using coal in power generation than the 2038 government agreed deadline, a demand resisted in many eastern German states amid an energy crunch caused by war in Ukraine.Story continuesHURDLES AHEAD""We will continue to fight to ensure that climate protection is implemented, be it on the issue of gas deals, the coal phase-out in east Germany or the transport turnaround,"" Greens lawmaker Lisa Badum said.The party will be measured against the green elements of the government's agenda to ensure renewable energy covers 80% of power output by 2030 and to clean up transport and construction, which missed annual greenhouse gas emission targets in 2022.But analysts say the Greens are facing bureaucratic hurdles and resistance from some regional governments to the renewables rollouts, and they still need to win over the FDP junior coalition partner on some areas of the environmental agenda.""We have the impression that the Greens simply made a lot of compromises last year and have to fight a little harder for climate issues in the government,"" Mueller-Kraenner said.Still, the party is benefiting from the popularity of the Greens leaders, Economy Minister Robert Habeck and Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, who took a lead on the mine saga. Polling shows the party would secure 18% of the vote if an election was held now, four points above the 2021 vote.""The Greens have presented a pragmatically rational style of politics and that has helped them become stronger,"" Manfred Guellner, head of pollster Forsa said.Such a pragmatic approach could help broaden the party's appeal. But it still requires a balancing act to ensure it does not split a party where some want much swifter action.""If the Greens no longer act together with the climate movement ... then of course that weakens our attempt at a climate-friendly transformation,"" said Greens lawmaker Kathrin Henneberger, who fought to save Luetzerath village.

The demand for Salesforce Inc.'s (NYSE:CRM) services is visible in its top-line growth, which increased from $3 billion in 2012 to $26.5 billion 10 years later. Further, the company's operating income rose from $115 million in 2016 to $548 million by 2022.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with CRM. Click here to check it out. CRM 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of CRMPeter Lynch Chart of CRMDespite the current market conditions, Salesforce's price-earnings ratio remains at a high of 523.07. With many stocks trading at bargain prices, overspending for a tech stock looks odd.In addition, there are several issues Salesforce is facing bother internally and externally. Over the past several months, the company has experienced a wave of executive exits, raising concerns among investors. At the same time, it recently announced it will reduce its workforce by 10%, as the company found itself overstaffed due to coronavirus-enforced hiring. The restructuring will also involve closing some of its offices. Analysts are concerned about the possible setbacks that layoffs could have on the company's progress and suggest that investors should factor in the costs of severance fees to be paid out in the coming months.Salesforce has seen positive growth overall in the past few years. However, with recent issues, it is advisable to wait for the share price to drop before making any investment decisions.Yet another executive leavesNews of an executive's departure would not have distressed investors if it were not the latest in a string of exits by high-level employees. On Jan. 11, Taher Elgamal, chief technology officer of cybersecurity at Salesforce, announced he is stepping down from his position. While Elgamal has left to become a general partner at Evolution Equity Partners, his resignation is part of a pattern as Executive Vice President Mark Carter left the company in November. Other big names that have left the company over the last few months include Tableau (DATA) CEO Mark Nelson and Slack CEO and co-founder Stewart Butterfield.Story continuesHowever, the announcement that was a gut-punch for many analysts and investors was that of co-CEO Bret Taylor, who will be leaving the company on Jan. 31. Taylor's exit shocked investors and analysts alike as he was often said to be next in line to take the company into the future. As a result, many interested parties are questioning the reason for Taylor's departure. The exodus has serious implications for the company as Salesforce's rating was downgraded by Atlantic Equities analysts, who cited the departures, among other reasons. The analysts have voiced they fear the company will lose out on future deals due to the top leaders leaving.Further job cuts will incur expenses in the short termIn early January, Salesforce announced plans to lay off 10% of the workforce after a prior round of layoffs a few months ago. Macroeconomic headwinds battered the company in 2022, leading it to come up with a cost-cutting plan that unfortunately included firing around 8,000 employees. In addition to the layoffs, the company is looking to reduce costs by $3 billion to $5 billion by exiting some of its real estate properties and closing down offices across the U.S.Co-CEO Marc Benioff acknowledged the company's hiring frenzy during the Covid-19 pandemic led to a bloated staff that was no longer necessary as demand for services and growth has slowed down exponentially. However, he also highlighted excess office space and a lack of profitable ideas from half of the company's account executives when discussing the cost restructuring process.Investors should refrain from rejoicing at this news because, as per the company's comments, the series of changes will bring about severance charges of $1.4 billion to $2.1 billion, out of which $800 million to $1 billion will need to be dealt with in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Given Salesforce's progress (or lack thereof) over the last few quarters, Bernstein analyst Mark Moerdler said the stock is in a ""growth purgatory"" while calling attention to the decelerating growth that has been ongoing for a while now and was only covered up by frequent acquisitions. He added that the job cuts will not make the difference the company wants and will accelerate the growth decline.Acquisitions turned sour: Slack and TableauSalesforce has long been trying to compete with industry giants and has made many acquisitions to keep up.Two of its biggest recent acquisitions were Slack, which it bought for $27.7 billion in 2021, and Tableau, which cost the company $15.7 billion, in 2019. The original goal behind the acquisitions was to expand its software into new areas, but they have not been very successful yet.In regard to Slack, Liz Herbert, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester Research, said that Salesforce's purchase of Slack had not made it any more compelling than before. At the same time, Katrina Agust, chief information officer at iCarhartt Inc., commented that her firm did not delve deeper into the application after the acquisition.According to Bloomberg, Tableau has suffered more than any other company division. The employees made up most of the numbers that were and will be let go. Slack's team is also coming under greater scrutiny and may be at higher risk of getting the axe than other departments.As such, Salesforce may have hurt itself more by buying these businesses.TakeawaySalesforce has a strong presence in the industry, where it will likely remain. Although the future looks bright, the present situation does not seem particularly optimistic. It will take time for the company to get its costs under control and see solid growth across all of its businesses.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

(NASDAQ:ALGN) share price has gained 24% in the last three months. But that's small comfort given the dismal price performance over the last year. Specifically, the stock price slipped by 51% in that time. Some might say the recent bounce is to be expected after such a bad drop. It may be that the fall was an overreaction.While the stock has risen 5.1% in the past week but long term shareholders are still in the red, let's see what the fundamentals can tell us. See our latest analysis for Align Technology There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Unhappily, Align Technology had to report a 31% decline in EPS over the last year. The share price decline of 51% is actually more than the EPS drop. So it seems the market was too confident about the business, a year ago.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Align Technology's earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Align Technology shareholders are down 51% for the year. Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 13%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 1.9% per year over five years. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Align Technology that you should be aware of before investing here.Story continuesAlign Technology is not the only stock that insiders are buying.

ALGN is set to release fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 1, after the closing bell.The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.36 in the last reported quarter, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 38.5%. The company beat earnings estimates in one of the trailing four quarters and missed on three occasions, the average negative surprise being 10.7%.Let’s look at how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayTotal Clear AlignerAlign Technology is likely to have gained from increasing clear aligners shipments to Invisalign doctors worldwide. In the last reported quarter, the company witnessed increased shipments in Invisalign case volumes across almost all markets — led by Taiwan, Thailand, India and Korea — driven by increased submitters.  Analysts expect this trend to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter, aiding sales growth.Strong potential exists, particularly in the teen segment, with an increase in the number of doctors submitting teen cases in the past few months. Invisalign First for kids has been gaining market share rapidly across all regions. The growing uptake is likely to have sustained, benefiting the company’s top-line growth.During the third quarter, the company commericialized Invisalign innovations for the Align Digital Platform, including the ClinCheck Live Update, Invisalign Practice App, Invisalign Personal Plan, Invisalign Smile Architect, the Invisalign Outcome Simulator Pro with in-face visualization, Cone Beam Computed Tomography with ClinCheck software Invisalign, Virtual AI software and iTero-exocad Connector.As the economies around the world return to normalcy amid COVID-19 concerns, we anticipate Invisalign case volumes to have rebounded across the Americas and international regions. However, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the heightened volatility in foreign exchange rates might have posed hindrances to recovery, hampering business performance in Q4. Staffing shortages and the ongoing inflationary pressure are expected to have dragged the company’s profitability down in Q4.Story continuesOur model shows a 12.8% year-over-year decline in total clear aligner revenues in the fourth quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Clear Aligner revenues is pegged at $721 million, suggesting an 11.5% drop from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Imaging Systems &amp; CAD/CAM Services BusinessAlign Technology is expected to have gained from robust iTero scanner services revenues as it did in the previous quarter. The company has been witnessing continued growth in the iTero scanner installed base. The recent integration of iTero NIRI and intraoral camera images unique to iTero Element 5D imaging systems and exocad Rijeka software release, Align Technology is redefining restorative visualization and treatment planning for doctors and labs.  This growing uptake of iTero scanners and recent development are likely to have sustained, benefiting the company’s top-line growth.The continued rise in intraoral digital scans used for Invisalign case submissions signals an enhanced digital adoption within dental offices. During the third quarter earnings update, the company noted that doctors are affirming the substantial benefits of intraoral scanning and end-to-end digital workflows with the iTero scanner and imaging systems. We anticipate this trend to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter, advancing business performance.Align Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Align Technology, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAlign Technology, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Align Technology, Inc. QuoteThe company’s third-quarter results are likely to benefit from exocad CAD/CAM products and services revenues. During the third quarter, the company introduced iTero NIRI. These offerings, including restorative dentistry, implantology, guided surgery and smile design products, extend the Align Digital Platform toward fully integrated interdisciplinary end-to-end workflows. We expect these products to have contributed to the company’s fourth quarter revenue.Our model projects a 22.1% year-over-year decline in total Imaging Systems &amp; CAD/CAM Services revenues in the fourth quarter. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s revenues is pegged at $183 million, indicating a 15.3% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Q4 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $891.3 million, suggesting a decline of 13.6% from the year-ago reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its fourth-quarter 2022 EPS of $1.54 suggests a 45.58% fall from the year-ago reported figure.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP has higher chance of beating estimates.

75,84c7de6f-5de1-3402-95d5-1a4ee6abff58,MRO,2023-01-19,Those who invested in Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) three years ago are up 123%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/those-invested-marathon-oil-nyse-180253842.html,1674064973,STORY,['MRO'],"[The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But if you buy shares in a really great company, you can more than double your money. To wit, the Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) share price has flown 115% in the last three years. That sort of return is as solid as granite.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. Check out our latest analysis for Marathon Oil In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Marathon Oil became profitable within the last three years. Given the importance of this milestone, it's not overly surprising that the share price has increased strongly.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how Marathon Oil has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Marathon Oil's TSR for the last 3 years was 123%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Marathon Oil shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 42% over one year. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 8% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Marathon Oil better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - Marathon Oil has   2 warning signs  (and 1 which shouldn't be ignored)  we think you should know about.If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

76,7aa1d9e5-1ddd-313b-b8e9-7d2ae3eb5bae,MSI,2023-01-19,"3 Wireless Stocks Set to Ride on 5G Rollout, Cloud Transition",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-wireless-stocks-set-ride-134501413.html,1674049501,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'CMTL', 'MSI', 'JNPR']","[The Zacks Wireless Equipment industry appears well poised to gain from healthy demand trends with the gradual revival in post-pandemic market conditions and a faster 5G rollout. However, large-scale investments to support the 5G transition, margin erosion due to price wars and inflated raw material costs amid a challenging macroeconomic environment and supply chain adversities might erode profitability.Nevertheless, Motorola Solutions, Inc. MSI, Juniper Networks, Inc. JNPR and Comtech Telecommunications Corp. CMTL are likely to benefit from the increasing demand for state-of-the-art wireless products with a vast proliferation of IoT, fiber densification and a gradual shift to cloud services.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Wireless Equipment industry primarily comprises companies that provide various networking solutions, wireless telecom products and related services for wireless voice and data communications through scalable modular platforms. Their product portfolio encompasses integrated circuit devices (chips) and system software for wireless voice and data communications, analog and digital two-way radio, satellite telecommunications, wireless networking and signal processing, and end-to-end enterprise mobility solutions. The firms also provide a broad range of routing, switching and security products, video surveillance and machine-to-machine communication components that secure VPN appliances, enable intrusion detection and thwart data theft. Some firms even provide electronic warfare, avionics, robotics, advanced communications and maritime systems to the defense industry.What's Shaping the Future of the Wireless Equipment Industry?Continuous Infrastructure Upgrade: With the exponential growth of mobile broadband traffic and home Internet solutions, demand for advanced networking architecture has increased manifold. This has forced service providers to spend more on routers and switches to upgrade their networks and support the surge in home data traffic. To maintain superior performance standards, there is a continuous need for network tuning and optimization, which creates demand for state-of-the-art wireless products and services. Moreover, a faster pace of 5G deployment is expected to augment the scalability, security and universal mobility of the telecommunications industry and propel the wide proliferation of IoT. The fiber-optic cable network is vital for backhaul and the last mile local loop, which are required by wireless service providers for 5G deployment. Fiber networks are also essential for the growing deployment of small cells that bring the network closer to the user and supplement macro networks to provide extensive coverage. The industry participants are facilitating its customers to move away from an economy-of-scale network operating model to demand-driven operations and seamlessly migrate to 5G by offering easy programmability and flexible automation through steady infrastructure investments.Profitability Woes Persist: Although higher infrastructure investments will eventually help minimize service delivery costs to support broadband competition and wireless densification, short-term profitability has largely been compromised. Margins are likely to be affected by the high cost of first-generation 5G products, profitability challenges in China, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and pricing pressure in early 5G deals. Uncertainty regarding chip shortage and supply-chain disruptions leading to a dearth of essential fiber materials, shipping delays and shortages of other raw materials are likely to affect the expansion and rollout of new broadband networks. Extended lead times for basic components are also likely to affect the delivery schedule and escalate production costs. High technological obsolescence of most products and a challenging macroeconomic environment have also escalated operating costs with steady investments in R&amp;D.Transition to Cloud Networking Solutions: The majority of the industry participants offer mission-critical communication infrastructure, devices, accessories, software and services that enable its customers to run businesses with increased efficiency and safety for their mobile workforce. These systems drive demand for additional device sales, software upgrades, infrastructure overhaul and expansion, as well as additional services to maintain, monitor and manage these complex networks and solutions. The comprehensive suite of services ensures continuity and reduces risks for constant critical communication operations. The wide proliferation of cloud networking solutions is further resulting in increased storage and computing on a virtual plane. As both consumers and enterprises use the network, there is tremendous demand for quality networking equipment.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bearish ProspectsThe Zacks Wireless Equipment industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #146, which places it in the bottom 42% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few wireless equipment stocks that are well-positioned to outperform the market based on a strong earnings outlook, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms Sector, Lags S&amp;P 500The Zacks Wireless Equipment industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector but lagged the S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has lost 24.2% over this period compared with the S&amp;P 500 and sector’s decline of 13.3% and 26%, respectively.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of trailing 12-month enterprise value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), which is the most appropriate multiple for valuing telecom stocks, the industry is currently trading at 17.91X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 12.09X. It is also trading above the sector’s trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 8.96X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 37.22X and as low as 11.6X and at the median of 18.83X, as the chart below shows.Trailing 12-Month enterprise value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) Ratio3 Wireless Equipment Stocks to Keep a Close Eye onMotorola: Based in Chicago, IL, Motorola is a leading communications equipment manufacturer and has strong market positions in bar code scanning, wireless infrastructure gear and government communications. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 9%. Motorola intends to boost its position in the public safety domain by entering into strategic alliances with other players in the ecosystem.

Here are 5 of the biggest earnings stories since yesterday, all first covered on InvestingPro. Sign up to get this news in real time. Alcoa numbers below consensusAlcoa (NYSE:AA) shares were trading more than 6% lower pre-market today following the company’s reported Q4 EPS miss. EPS came in at ($0.70), worse than the consensus estimate of ($0.67). This represents its second consecutive quarterly loss, with the company noting that it has tried to lessen the impact caused by unfavorable market conditions throughout the year, including high costs for raw materials and energy, as well as decreased prices for alumina and aluminum.Revenue was down 7% sequentially to $2.7 billion (vs. consensus of $2.66B), primarily due to lower prices for both alumina and aluminum. The average realized third-party price of alumina/aluminum fell by 8%/10% sequentially.In 2023, the company expects total alumina shipments, including externally sourced alumina, to be in the range of 12.7 million-12.9 million metric tons, a decrease of 0.5 million metric tons from 2022 due to the partial curtailment of the San Ciprián refinery and lower bauxite quality at the Australian refineries.Discover and Schwab slipDiscover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) shares sank after 4Q net charge-offs came in at $581 million, worse than the $554.7 million consensus estimate, and said it expects the figure to rise 3.5%-3.9% for the year vs. the 2.8% consensus. The firm also reported Q4 EPS of $3.77, $0.12 better than the analyst estimate of $3.65.And Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) shares closed down more than 2% after the company reported worse-than-expected Q4 results. EPS came in at $1.07, compared to the consensus estimate of $1.09, while revenue was $5.5B, compared to the consensus estimate of $5.56B.Microsoft Q2 takes a hitMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced a $0.12 negative impact to its diluted EPS in Q2 due to its workforce reduction plan of approximately 10,000 employees (less than 5% of its total employee base) by the end of Q3/23. Shares closed nearly 2% lower yesterday.Story continuesEnergy Vault surges on higher guidanceEnergy Vault Holdings Inc (NYSE:NRGV) shares surged more than 34% yesterday after the company announced updated Q4 and full-year 2022 expected revenue results. The company now expects full-year total revenue to be in the range of $142 million-$152 million, compared to its prior guidance of $75M-$100M. This is driven by project and supply chain execution ahead of schedule for previously announced battery energy storage systems (BESS) in the U.S., as well as territory expansions in Europe and the Middle East for its gravity energy storage systems (GESS).The revised guidance implies Q4 revenue to be in the range of $96M-$106M, which is significantly better than the consensus estimate of $37.4M.Even though profits have decreased, they are still close to their all-time high, as the company benefits from increased interest rates.***If you’re interested in upgrading your search for new investing ideas, check out InvestingPro.Related Articles5 big earnings reports: Alcoa disappointsU.S. gov't touches debt limit amid standoff between Republicans and DemocratsWhy Discover Financial's guidance 'spooked' investors]"

87,b175f092-24a3-3ed8-a930-cee5abd1818f,WBA,2023-01-19,"Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 59%",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walgreens-boots-alliance-inc-nasdaq-110111570.html,1674126071.0,STORY,['WBA'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 59% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Walgreens Boots Alliance. Check out our latest analysis for Walgreens Boots Alliance ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Walgreens Boots Alliance?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Walgreens Boots Alliance does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Walgreens Boots Alliance's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Walgreens Boots Alliance is not owned by hedge funds. Newcip S.A. is currently the largest shareholder, with 17% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.3% and 6.8%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 16 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Walgreens Boots AllianceWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. in their own names. But they may have an indirect interest through a corporate structure that we haven't picked up on. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$159m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 24% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Private Company OwnershipOur data indicates that Private Companies hold 17%, of the company's shares. Private companies may be related parties. Sometimes insiders have an interest in a public company through a holding in a private company, rather than in their own capacity as an individual. While it's hard to draw any broad stroke conclusions, it is worth noting as an area for further research.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Be aware that  Walgreens Boots Alliance is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those is potentially serious...But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Xcel Energy (XEL) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this utility is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Xcel is 6%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 6.3% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 5.6%.Cash Flow GrowthCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Xcel is 8.4%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 6.1%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 8.5% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 6.1%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for Xcel have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.1% over the past month.Bottom LineXcel has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Xcel is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Xcel basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.For Xcel, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for XcelFor the fiscal year ending December 2022, this utility is expected to earn $3.16 per share, which is a change of 6.8% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Xcel. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0.2%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Xcel to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It sounds bumpy ahead. Still reeling from the disastrous holiday meltdown, the airline's pilots union now planning to hold a vote that could give it the power to call a potential strike. Here to discuss is the president of the Southwest Pilots Union, Captain Casey Murray. Nice to see you, sir. So why are you calling for this vote? And why make this announcement now when a vote couldn't happen until May?CASEY MURRAY: Well, thanks for having me. And, you know, I just-- I want to address. This is about our customers. This is about the heart of Southwest Airlines that we're fighting for here. The consumer confidence currently for Southwest Airlines is at an all-time low. We've seen meltdown after meltdown, and with Christmas being just a huge exclamation point.So really, the time is now to really get Southwest to address the processes that have put them there. And that is part of our negotiations. This isn't about money. And it's not-- it is more about our customers providing confidence and reliability in when they buy a ticket on Southwest.DAVE BRIGGS: How would a potential strike help Southwest customers?CASEY MURRAY: Well, I think that our customers in the short-term need to know that there is some reliability issues, and the confidence is not high moving forward. And a strike vote definitely impacts that. But the core of our negotiations are built around what we've seen Southwest doing for many, many years. And it's connecting pilots to airplanes. And that's where we're failing. There's IT issues. There's infrastructure issues.But if at the end of the day, you're using the same processes that have failed you time and again, then that has to be addressed. Unfortunately, they haven't been, and we've tried to. We've tried to address them in negotiations, and the company just doesn't want to go through the effort of really fixing what is fundamentally wrong with Southwest Airlines right now.Story continuesDAVE BRIGGS: If you were a customer, would you fly Southwest right now?CASEY MURRAY: Well, I wouldn't right now. I think that's clear. I think that's Southwest, and that's really a strong statement because, again, this is really about the heart of Southwest Airlines. Our pilots have been whistleblowers for years over all the things that have been going wrong that have led to our unreliability and these meltdowns that continue to occur.DAVE BRIGGS: So, in your words, that holiday meltdown, more than 16,000 flights canceled, was caused by what? We've heard about this outdated computer system. We've also heard about your problem, which was connecting the pilots to airplanes. They are not on the hub system that other airlines were. What was the heart of that meltdown?CASEY MURRAY: Well, in any of our meltdowns in the past, there is an event, whether it's weather, whether it's an ATC issue, that creates sort of the domino effect that we see Southwest unable to really recover, like our peers. We have a point-to-point network system. It is very complex. And it requires very complex solutions. And that's what we're trying to really talk to Southwest and for Southwest to really look at is not the network itself, but the processes in getting our pilots to airplanes and getting our customers from A to B safely and efficiently.DAVE BRIGGS: The CEO of Southwest, Bob Jordan, has said the need to double down on existing plans to upgrade systems. Do you believe that that process is underway?CASEY MURRAY: Well, I hope. I've seen a little bit of backtracking recently on some of those statements. I also saw where he said, we're looking at investing a billion dollars in technology, and technology is critical to it. But if you program this billion dollars of technology with the same processes that have continued to fail you, then you're doomed to disaster. And that's what we're trying to address.So, really, the time is now to-- and that's why this SAV. And it's why I like to say this is about the heart of Southwest Airlines. This airline has to be here. We are the stakeholders. All of the employees love Southwest. And we just want to see it succeed. And we want to see our customers have confidence in the product that we're offering.DAVE BRIGGS: And the pilots have, quite frankly, never had more negotiating power than they do right now, given the pilot shortage. What are your demands in terms of salary increases? And we also understand that you're calling for gratuity pay for that Christmas meltdown, if you can elaborate on that.CASEY MURRAY: Well, we're not calling for it. It was something offered by the company. We have to negotiate it to put it in writing so that it's done correctly. And that's something we're not against. But as far as demands, the market is going to set economics and all. We're not worried about that. This is more about scheduling. This is about a predictability for our pilots and confidence for our customers. That's what's failing now. And so this is more about our scheduling systems, our scheduling processes, that Southwest needs to address if they're going to address their reliability issues.DAVE BRIGGS: I just want to make sure we get a statement from Southwest regarding the vote. Quote, ""The Southwest Airlines Pilots Association's call for an authorization vote does not affect Southwest's operation or our ability to take care of our customers. The union's potential vote does not hinder our ongoing efforts at the negotiating table. We are scheduled to resume mediation on January 24."" Head of the Southwest Union's Pilots Association, Captain Casey Murray, appreciate you being here, sir. Thank you.CASEY MURRAY: Absolutely.]"

Also, at its third-quarter earnings call, management stated that the number of funeral services performed is trending better than expectations. Cemetery preneed sales production remains strong too.However, lower atneed revenues in the Cemetery segment are a concern. Apart from this, the company is encountering escalated cost concerns. Let’s delve deeper.Main ConcernsCemetery segment revenues have been declining year over year for the past few quarters now. In the third quarter of 2022, consolidated Cemetery revenues came in at $423.8 million, down from $442.1 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Comparable cemetery revenues decreased 4.7%, mainly due to softcore and other revenues. Core revenues fell $17.5 million due to lower atneed revenues. Comparable preneed cemetery sales production rose 5% due to continued strength in sales average. However, this was partly negated by a decline in contract velocity.Service Corporation is encountering inflationary pressure. In the third quarter of 2022, The gross profit decreased to nearly $231 million from around $338 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Corporate general and administrative costs were $41.9 million compared with $41.5 million in the year-ago period. The slight increase was mainly due to higher workers’ compensations and general liability, somewhat compensated by lower incentive compensation costs.The operating income of $203.4 million decreased from $304.3 million reported in the year-ago quarter. These factors also weighed on the bottom line, which declined year over year in the quarter under review. The continuation of such trends remains a concern. Also, management expects persistent pressure from increasing interest costs on its floating rate debt, which is expected to be reflected in the fourth quarter.Service Corporation International Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseService Corporation International Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseService Corporation International price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Service Corporation International QuoteStory continues The UpsidesService Corporation remains committed to pursuing strategic buyouts for both its segments and building new funeral homes to generate greater returns. During the nine months ended Sep 30, 2022, the company incurred capital expenditures of $252.8 million, which included higher capital improvements at existing field locations, corporate systems development, and cemetery development expenditures.Management now expects capital improvement at existing field locations, corporate systems development and cemetery development expenditures in the band of $280-$300 million in 2022.Moving to acquisitions, Service Corporation concluded a minor $2-million deal in the mid-Atlantic region in the second quarter of 2022. After the third quarter, it purchased several funeral home and cemetery locations on the West Coast for nearly $40 million. On its third-quarter earnings call, management stated that it remains encouraged about its acquisition pipeline. Some notable acquisitions made by the company in the past include Alderwoods Group, Keystone North America, The Neptune Society, and Stewart Enterprises. Also, buyouts in the cemetery segment are aimed at exploiting increased opportunities to cater to Baby Boomers.A Look at Q3 &amp; AheadThe company posted third-quarter 2022 results, with the top and bottom lines beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Service Corporation posted adjusted earnings of 68 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 51 cents. Total revenues of $977.7 million came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $880 million. Though revenues declined year over year, it was mainly due to a tough comparison with the year-ago period, which was impacted by increased pandemic-led deaths. Notably, the company witnessed better-than-expected growth compared with the third quarter of 2019 (pre-pandemic period).Encouragingly, management raised its guidance for 2022. Service Corporation now expects adjusted earnings per share (EPS) in the range of $3.60-$3.80, up from the earlier guidance of $3.30-$3.70. We note that the company’s earnings came in at $4.57 per share in 2021.All said we believe that the abovementioned upsides are likely to keep Service Corporation’s growth story going.

During the fourth quarter of 2022, Clip transactions grew by over 336% compared to the prior quarter.“Clip deposit adoption in the US is growing at a rapid rate and it’s incredibly satisfying to see so many American businesses save time, money, and improve their cash flow through our novel solution,” said Joseph Arrage, Clip founder and CEO.The Clip network is bank-agnostic, meaning any businesses can make deposits to any existing bank account in convenient, accessible locations via a ClipDrop. Deposits can be made any time during store business hours by designated business employees. Clip customers are also provided with powerful technology through the ClipApp to manage their cash, assign employees to perform deposit transactions, track transaction history, and collect cash and payment analytics. Retailers receive next business day credit for their deposits which improves cash flow.ClipDrops are installed in high-density retail locations including major malls owned by Simon® and are also available in select Staples retail stores.

HCA, Universal Health Services Inc. UHS, Acadia Healthcare Co. ACHC and Tenet Healthcare Corp. THC.Industry: HospitalLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2039974/investors-should-watch-these-4-hospital-stocks-despite-headwindsThe operating environment for hospital companies is improving with increasing non-Covid utilization, outpatient surgeries and patient days. Staffing challenges are expected to decrease this year. However, recession fears, inflation and resultant escalating costs are eating up Zacks Medical-Hospital industry players' margins.Growing competition in this market remains a common theme. Technological innovations and adoptions are expected to continue boosting hospital companies' efficiency and generating cost savings. Leading industry players like HCA Healthcare Inc., Universal Health Services Inc., Acadia Healthcare Co. and Tenet Healthcare Corp. are set to benefit from these developments.About the Industry The Zacks Medical-Hospital industry comprises for-profit hospital companies that provide healthcare through different types of hospitals, such as acute care, rehabilitation and psychiatric. These hospital entities are engaged in internal medicine, general surgery, cardiology, oncology, neurosurgery, orthopedics and obstetrics, telehealth services, mental health care and diagnostic and emergency services.Revenues of these companies depend on inpatient occupancy levels, medical and ancillary services ordered by physicians and provided to patients, and the volume of outpatient procedures. These hospital companies receive payments for patient services from the government under the Medicare program, Medicaid or similar programs, managed care plans (including plans offered through the American Health Benefit Exchanges), private insurers and directly from patients.Story continues4 Key Trends to Watch in the Hospital IndustryImproving Volumes: Going ahead, non-COVID admissions are expected to continue rising as the intensity of COVID-related utilization of resources declines. Demand for elective procedures is expected to drive patient volumes. Growth in admissions, outpatient surgeries and Medicare reimbursements and deferred procedures can support hospital companies' revenues. However, inflationary pressures and financial constraints can force patients to delay addressing some non-emergency medical needs. The benefits of the Affordable Care Act and similar safety nets can provide customers with some respite, which can help patients navigate tough times.Increasing Expenses: With rising patient volumes, operating costs are bound to go up. High salaries, wages and benefits and increasing costs of hospital supplies due to inflation will likely reduce margins. Also, growth-project investments will keep expenses elevated, putting pressure on the bottom line. Even though labor shortages are expected to keep creating headaches for the industry players, the situation is expected to improve in the coming days. Moreover, renegotiating contracts with suppliers and vendors will provide an impetus.Growth in the Elderly Population: Steady advancements in science, nutrition and healthcare enable the senior population to witness constant growth. This can result in rising demand for hospital services in the long term. The U.S. Census Bureau's revised report suggests that individuals above 65 years are projected to be one of the fastest-growing segments of the country's population, reflecting a climb from 17% in 2020 to 21% in 2030. This demographic change and the rising incidence of diseases will likely be industry drivers. Plus, the increasing number of people signing up for healthcare plans through the Affordable Care Act indicates fewer challenges to visiting hospitals in the future.Technological Improvements: Technological innovations, improvements and wider adoption will continue to be a major theme in the hospital space. The trend should optimize hospital services, minimize unnecessary expenses and enhance the patient experience. The COVID-19 pandemic triggered the adoption of telehealth and telemedicine services, which will likely rise in the future.The industry players are leveraging AI and automation along with real-time analytics to provide quality care. AI helps improve clinical workflow management and medical diagnosis that hospitals utilize. The companies are using the virtual health domain to heighten their efficiency by limiting the patients' waiting time and trimming their treatment costs.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bearish OutlookThe group's  Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. The Zacks Medical-Hospital industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Medical sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #216, which places it in the bottom 14% of nearly 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic about this group's earnings growth potential. The industry's earnings estimates for 2023 have declined 19.1% in the past year. Given the lackluster near-term prospects, companies in the space are expected to take a hit.Before we present the stocks that you may want to watch, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 &amp; Sector The Zacks Medical-Hospital industry has fared better than the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite as well as its broader sector over the past year. During this time period, the stocks in this industry have declined 0.5% compared with the S&amp;P 500's fall of 14.1% and the Zacks Medical sector's decrease of 10.4%.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio, which is commonly used for valuing hospital stocks, the industry trades at 8.21X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 12.09X and the sector's 8.37X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 8.75X, as low as 5.57X and at a median of 7.76X.4 Stocks to Watch ForWe are presenting four stocks with a Zacks Ranks #3 (Hold) from the Medical-Hospital industry.  You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.HCA Healthcare: The company provides services via surgery centers, free-standing emergency rooms, physician clinics and urgent care centers. HCA's inorganic growth strategies enable it to persistently increase patient volumes, expand its network across several markets and add more hospitals in its portfolio.

HCA Healthcare also focuses on boosting shareholders' value with dividend hikes and buybacks.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HCA Healthcare's 2023 EPS indicates 7.2% year-over-year growth.

Shares of the company have jumped 8.4% in the past month.Universal Health Services: The company focuses on behavioral indications like autism, eating disorders, sexual trauma and disorderliness in the military through its patriot support program. This segment holds immense scope for growth in the days ahead, considering the dire need to address behavioral health issues triggered by the pandemic.

It has a strong share buyback plan in place to boost shareholder value.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Universal Health's 2023 bottom line indicates 8.7% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for its revenues in 2023 signals 4.4% increase from a year ago.

The company is expected to have added a total of roughly 300 beds in 2022. Its moves to streamline its portfolio boost operating efficiency and profitability.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ACHC's 2023 bottom line indicates 6.9% year-over-year growth.

The consensus mark for its revenues in 2023 signals 4.6% increase from the prior year. Tenet Healthcare beat earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters, the average surprise being 69.9%.

Ms. Halio, you may begin your conference.Carey Halio: Good morning. This is Carey Halio, Head of Investor Relations and Chief Strategic Officer at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Today, we will reference our earnings presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.gs.com. Note information and forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures appear in the earnings release and presentation. This audiocast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. I am joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon; and our Chief Financial Officer, Denis Coleman. Let me pass the call to David.Copyright: mikewaters / 123RF Stock PhotoDavid Solomon: Thanks, Carey and good morning everyone. Thank you all for joining us today. I will begin with a review of our financial performance. Simply said, our quarter was disappointing and our business mix proved particularly challenging. These results are not what we aspire to deliver to shareholders. We generated revenues of $10.6 billion and net earnings of $1.3 billion and earnings per share of $3.32. After nine straight quarters of double-digit returns, fourth quarter performance was certainly an outlier. Results were impacted by several near-term challenges given the difficult operating environment. On the revenue front, underwriting volumes remained extremely muted despite green shoots that appeared at the end of the third quarter.Thicken equity activities, activity levels dropped after a busy and volatile year for many of our clients and our equity investment portfolio saw continued headwinds. We also saw higher loan loss provision and expenses. While compensation expenses were down 15% for the year, quarterly expenses rose modestly versus the third quarter. We always strive to maintain a pay-for-performance culture. With revenues down, compensation was lower. That said we also recognize that we operate in a talent-driven business and we must continue to invest in our people whose dedication is critical to our world class franchise. On our earnings call last July, we first spoke about the challenging operating environment and the proactive measures we were taking on expenses, including slowing hiring velocity and reducing certain components of our non-compensation costs.Story continuesWe have and continue to be incredibly focused on managing our financial resources, especially in light of the worse-than-expected backdrop in the fourth quarter. Specifically, we reduced the size of our balance sheet, further optimized and reduced our RWA footprint and managed down our G-SIB score to hit our 3% target. We have also started firm-wide expense reduction efforts to offset inflationary pressures and right-size the firm for the current environment. We made the difficult decision to conduct a 6% headcount reduction exercise earlier this month. As we said, we had paused our regular performance management-related reductions during the pandemic and also had a period of strong growth in headcount given the opportunity set in 2021. We feel deeply for the individuals that were impacted by these reductions.They are extremely dedicated and talented individuals and we wish them the best. Additionally, we are taking a number of strategic actions to help us reach our financial targets and create shareholder value. For instance, this quarter, we completed our reorganization, which will further strengthen our core businesses, help us scale our growth platforms and improve efficiency. This is an important and purposeful evolution of our strategic journey. We also narrowed our ambitions on our consumer strategy and made some key decisions. We started a process to cease offering new loans on the Marcus platform. We will likely allow the book to roll down naturally, although we are considering other alternatives. In addition, we have postponed the launch of our checking product.At the right time in the future, we intend to offer checking to our wealth management clients. For now, our priority is to strengthen our deposit franchise, card partnerships and GreenSky. Our narrowed approach will allow us to reduce our forward investment spend and rationalize expenses. We are very focused on developing a path toward profitability and platform solutions and we will provide more detail at our Investor Day next month. As you can see from our new segment reporting, we are committed to providing continued transparency for us  for you to hold us accountable. I want to spend a moment on the broader operating environment. The backdrop over the last year has been incredibly dynamic. There were headwinds we expected, like high inflation, but some we never thought we would see like the ongoing land war in Ukraine.There aren't many signs of widespread distress, balance sheets and company fundamentals are relatively healthy, but it's clear that the outlook for 2023 remains uncertain. In the U.S., Central Bank rate increases have started to have an impact on inflation, but they are also lowering the growth trajectory of the economy. And the labor market remains remarkably tight with an estimated 1.7 job openings available for every unemployed American. Our clients are thinking a lot about how to navigate this complex backdrop. CEOs and Boards tell me they are cautious, particularly for the near-term. They are rethinking business opportunities and would like to see more stability before committing to longer term plans. Many firms have started preparing for tougher times focusing on factors within their control.Taking a step back, I am proud of the significant progress we have made in our strategic evolution since Investor Day 2020. Despite a more challenged fourth quarter performance, we delivered for shareholders in 2022. We generated double-digit returns in a year where rapid monetary tightening and ongoing macro uncertainty drove significant market disruption with both equity and fixed income markets falling for the first time in over 50 years. We grew management and other fees by 13% year-over-year and grew net interest income by 19%. We reduced our on-balance sheet alternative investments by $9 billion. We also returned $6.7 billion of capital in the form of dividends and share repurchases and we grew our book value by 7%. This brings our book value growth since our first Investor Day to almost 40%, roughly twice as much as our next closest competitor.That said, we remain focused on the work ahead of us and we believe we have a lot to play for. As we go forward, we are executing on three key priorities we have laid out for the businesses: number one, growing management fees in our asset and wealth management business; number two, maximizing wallet share and growing financing activities and our global banking and markets business; number three, scaling platform solutions to deliver profitability. We have a proven track record of navigating a wide range of operating environments and we will continue to execute our long-term client-oriented strategy regardless of where we are in the cycle. We have the people in place around the world to serve our clients' broad range of needs with excellence and we are operating from a position of strength with robust capital levels and a clear focus on the path forward.I remain optimistic about the future of Goldman Sachs and confident that we will continue to deliver for shareholders. We look forward to speaking more about this with all of you at our Investor Day on February 28. I will now turn it over to Denis.See also 15 Best Sin Stocks To Buy and Top 10 HR Companies in the World.Denis Coleman: Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start on Page 2 of the presentation. In 2022, we generated net revenues of $47.4 billion, net earnings of $11.3 billion and earnings per share of $30.06. As David highlighted, we have implemented our organizational changes, which form the basis for our earnings presentation today. Turning to performance by business, starting on Page 3. Global Banking and Markets generated revenues of $32.5 billion for the year, down 12% as higher FICC revenues were more than offset by a steep decline in investment banking fees versus record results last year. The exceptional performance of our Global Banking and Markets business over the last 3 years, including the market share gains we have generated has served a strong ballast for firm-wide performance.In the fourth quarter, investment banking fees fell 48% year-over-year driven by a significant decline in both equity and debt underwriting as issuance volumes remain muted amid continued market uncertainty. Advisory revenues, however, were $1.4 billion, the third highest in our history rising 45% quarter-over-quarter on higher completed deal volumes. For 2022, we maintained our number one league table position in completed M&amp;A as we have for 23 of the last 24 years and we ranked second in equity and equity-related underwriting. We also ranked second in high-yield debt underwriting, up from number three last year. Our backlog fell quarter-on-quarter on lower levels of activity, but remain solid, particularly in advisory. That being said, clients are focused on stability and financial conditions, pushing out the timing of transactional activity.While we expect investors will need more certainty before financing markets reopen more broadly, we are seeing some positive signs of activity, particularly in investment grade markets, which have had a strong start to the year in both the United States and Europe. FICC net revenues were $2.7 billion in the quarter, up 44% year-on-year. In intermediation, we saw strength in rates and commodities amid elevated levels of client engagement, catalyzed by increased central bank activity and rate volatility and improved market-making conditions. In FICC financing, we saw increases in secured lending driven by higher balances. Full year FICC revenues of $14.7 billion rose 38%. Equities net revenues were $2.1 billion in the quarter, down 5% year-on-year.The year-over-year decline in intermediation revenues was driven by lower levels of client activity, particularly in derivatives, after strong engagement levels throughout the year. Financing revenues of $964 million were relatively resilient despite a decline in prime balances as clients took risk off throughout the quarter. Across FICC and Equities, financing revenues were up 20% in 2022, consistent with our strategic priority to grow client financing activities. Moving to Asset &amp; Wealth Management on Page 5. For 2022, revenues of $13.4 billion were down 39% year-over-year as a steep decline in revenues from equity and debt investments offset an additional $1 billion of management and other fees and a strong increase in private banking and lending revenues.Fourth quarter management and other fees of $2.2 billion were up 10% year-over-year. Full year management and other fees were $8.8 billion putting us well on track to hit our $10 billion target in 2024. Fourth quarter private banking and lending net revenues reached a record $753 million, up 77% year-over-year due to higher deposit spreads and higher lending and deposit balances. Equity investments produced net revenues of $287 million, driven by $270 million of gains on our $13 billion private equity portfolio and roughly $500 million in operating revenues and gains related to CIEs, partially offset by $485 million of net losses related to investments in our $2 billion public portfolio. Debt investments revenues were $234 million, including net interest income of $360 million.Moving on to Page 6. Total firm-wide assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record $2.5 trillion, driven by market appreciation as well as strong net inflows across fixed income and liquidity products. Let's now turn to Page 7 where I will review a new page in our presentation focused on our alternatives franchise. Alternative AUS totaled $263 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, driving $492 million in management and other fees for the quarter and $1.8 billion for the year. We remain on track to reach our $2 billion target in 2024. Gross third-party fundraising was $15 billion for the quarter and totaled $72 billion for the year. Third-party fundraising since Investor Day stands at $179 billion. The table on the bottom left shows our on-balance sheet alternative investment portfolio, which totaled $59 billion.Despite the challenging environment, we reduced on-balance sheet investments by $9 billion in 2022, of which $2 billion was in the fourth quarter. We remain committed to our strategy to reduce balance sheet density and migrate our alternatives business to more third-party funds. I will turn to Platform Solutions on Page 8. Full year revenues were $1.5 billion, more than double versus 2021. Full year losses of $1.7 billion were driven by $1.7 billion of provisions as we built reserves to reflect $8 billion of loan growth across the portfolio. We also incurred $1.8 billion in expenses as we continue to build out and run these businesses. This included over $200 million of transaction and integration-related costs driven by the GreenSky and GM card portfolio acquisitions.We expect these costs to also impact 2023 results, though at a lower level and decline materially over subsequent years. As David said, our number one priority for this segment is to reach profitability and we look forward to providing you with further details at our Investor Day next month. On Page 9, firm-wide net interest income of $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter was up 2% relative to the third quarter due to higher rates and increased loan balances. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $179 billion, modestly higher versus the third quarter, reflecting growth in collateralized lending and credit cards. Our provision for credit losses was $972 million. For our wholesale portfolio, provisions were driven by impairments and portfolio growth.The overall credit quality of our wholesale lending portfolio remains resilient. In relation to our retail portfolio, provisions were driven by continued portfolio growth, net charge-offs and a worsening of our baseline scenario. We are seeing early signs of credit deterioration that are in line with our expectations. We anticipate further pressure in 2023 given the vintage and nature of our portfolio. Let's turn to expenses on Page 10. Quarterly operating expenses were $8.1 billion. Total operating expenses for the year were $31.2 billion, down 2%. Compensation expenses fell 15% despite a 10% increase in headcount and were partially offset by higher non-compensation expenses. The increase was primarily related to acquisitions, transaction-based costs and continued investments in technology.In addition, client-driven market development costs were higher following lower levels during the pandemic. As previously discussed, we are actively engaged in expense mitigation efforts. This includes targeted reductions across communications and technology spend, professional fees and advertising costs as well as the recent headcount reduction exercise. We expect that the impact of these actions will become more fully reflected in our results over time, remain highly focused on operating efficiency and are committed to our 60% efficiency ratio target as the right place to run the firm. Turning to capital on Slide 11. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 15.1% at the end of the fourth quarter under the standardized approach, up 80 basis points sequentially.This represents a 130 basis point buffer to our new capital requirement of 13.8%. In the fourth quarter, we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $1.5 billion and common stock dividends of $880 million. Based on our capital levels at the end of the quarter, we started 2023 with a strong capital position, enabling us to support our clients and return excess capital to shareholders. As it relates to our funding plan based on current expectations, we intend for 2023 issuance to run significantly below 2022 levels, though we will remain dynamic with respect to business needs and market opportunities. In conclusion, despite the challenging operating environment in 2022, we delivered double-digit returns for shareholders, returned $6.7 billion of capital and made material progress on our strategic initiatives to better serve clients and strengthen and diversify the firm.We remain focused on executing on our strategic priorities and creating value for our shareholders and we look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming Investor Day in February. With that, we will now open up the line for questions.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Goldman Sachs in FocusBased in New York, Goldman Sachs (GS) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 1.9%. The investment bank is paying out a dividend of $2.5 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.86% compared to the Financial - Investment Bank industry's yield of 0.45% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.62%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $10 is up 11.1% from last year. Goldman Sachs has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 29.39%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, Goldman's payout ratio is 27%, which means it paid out 27% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.GS is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $35.65 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 18.60%.Bottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Story continuesBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, GS is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Layoffs have rippled across Wall Street with banks, including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, announcing job cuts. But taking a closer look, the picture is actually mixed when it comes to the scale of these cuts for the big banks. Alexandra Semenova has that story for us. Alex.ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: Well, guys, we've been hearing a lot about finance layoffs lately, and they certainly are happening. Goldman Sachs laid off more than 3,000 workers last week. There were even reports that bankers there were calling it ""David's Demolition Day"" after CEO David Solomon.But taking a more nuanced look at what's going on, the layoffs actually, at this point, aren't as widespread as it seems. Yesterday, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley reported their earnings, and also confirmed that they laid off thousands of workers in the past two months, Goldman Sachs about 6% of its workforce and Morgan Stanley about 2%. Then we've also got Wells Fargo that has been steadily cutting jobs as it scales back its mortgage business.But top executives at JP Morgan, Bank of America, Citigroup have all said that they have no immediate plans to cut jobs even in the case of a recession. Bank of America's Brian Moynihan told our own Brian Sozzi yesterday that there are no plans to cut jobs. You have all of these executives on their earnings call saying that they're still in hiring mode.JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said that they'll continue to hire jobs. They have no plans to cut them even in the event of an economic downturn, which differs a lot from what executives like David Solomon and James Gorman have said. For Goldman Sachs, for example, though, its investment banking division makes up more than 50% of its revenue. So because we've seen that sector take such a big hit in the past year, it makes sense that it's being more conservative and cutting jobs where it needs to. And then for Morgan Stanley, it's cutting about 2% of jobs, which is kind of-- it's a natural culling that is happening.Story continuesDuring the pandemic, we saw a pause in these performance reviews that banks normally have in the annual culling that typically happens. But they're bringing that back. It's pretty normal for these banks to let go of bankers who were underperforming at the end of the year. So when it comes to finance layoffs, they're not as widespread as what we're seeing in the technology sector, for example, where it's happening across the board where there are thousands of workers-- seemingly every day we're hearing announcements from companies. In the financial sector, it's a little bit different.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, and within those banks and the segments that they've reported for, it's been interesting to see where some of the disclosed layoffs have taken place or, on the other side, where they've started to cut some of those bonuses as well in the interim period of time too given some of the underperformance year-over-year.ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: Exactly, Brad. Bonuses will be an interesting one too because the anxieties over layoffs now shift to bonuses. And any workers who didn't get laid off will probably wish that they did when they see those really lean numbers come in the coming weeks. And that's kind of what banks are hoping for. They're hoping for that natural attrition to happen. So anyone they didn't lay off, any performers that haven't been up to par will see their bonuses come in at near zero levels or substantially down from last year, and maybe go out and look for another job.And that will lean out those workforces even more. And it's going to be interesting to see what happens when it comes to the different divisions within banks because their performance has varied so much because the trading desks, as we saw in yesterday's earnings, have done very, very well. But then you have the investment banking side at all of the banks, which is down more than 50% from last year. So it'll be a mixed picture, too, when it comes to the bonuses.BRAD SMITH: Yahoo Finance's own Alexandra Semenova breaking down all things financials and big banks for us today. Thanks so much.]"

That outpaced growth of 12% and 11% for its Asia and Middle East and North Africa regions, respectively, according to one of half a dozen documents viewed by Reuters.The company also expects to report record results for the fourth quarter for its Russian reservoir performance division, according to a separate presentation viewed by Reuters.SLB, which changed its name from Schlumberger last October, did not respond to several requests for interviews or written questions for this story. The company said in March that, while it is continuing operations in Russia, it has halted new investments there.SLB has not likely fallen afoul of U.S. and European sanctions prohibiting financial transactions with Russia, in part because measures taken against Russia's energy sector are not meant to fully curtail oil production, according to sanctions experts interviewed by Reuters.“The Russian energy sector is not subject to comprehensive sanctions, and with care, companies can comply with prohibitions or restrictions that may apply to certain transactions,"" said Peter Kucik, a managing director with Mercury Public Affairs and a former official with the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, a unit of the Treasury Department that administers sanctions.Story continues""Trading with Russia is financing aggression, murder of civilians and destruction of peaceful cities,"" said a spokesperson for Ukraine's embassy in Washington, D.C. in response to a question about SLB's operations in Russia.The Business &amp; Human Rights Resource Centre, an international organization that monitors corporate responses to human rights issues, has warned the firm risks being pulled into the war efforts with Russia's military mobilization.Companies working in Russia must take steps to ""mitigate the increased risk of contributing, or being directly linked, to the armed conflict,” said Ella Skybenko, a senior researcher at that organization. She pointed to SLB's compliance with Russia's military mobilization as an example of being complicit in the conflict.SLB did not respond to requests for comment. Russia's Ministry of Energy and the Russian embassy in Washington, D.C. did not respond to a request for comment.In the months since Russia invaded Ukraine, scores of western companies have shuttered or sold their operations there to avoid running afoul of sanctions or avoid the appearance of aiding Vladimir Putin's war. Others have suspended investment or operations, while some remain in Russia.RUSSIA UNIT GROWSBy contrast, SLB added around 70 employees in Russia in late 2022, including personnel to its key accounts such as Gazprom and Rosneft, according to two sources familiar with the matter who cited this as a sign that its business there is not slowing down.The Curacao-registered company is a major foreign employer in Russia with some 10,000 employees, or around 10% of its global workforce, spread across Russia and neighboring Kazakhstan, where it has also posted sales increases.Russia accounted for 6%, or $1.21 billion, of SLB's total revenue in the first nine months of last year, according to a regulatory filing, up from 5% before the invasion of Ukraine. Business there is further slated to ramp up this summer, according to a source and company documents.One reason SLB is finding new success in Russia is that rivals have exited the region. Halliburton Co and Baker Hughes Co sold their businesses in recent months. The companies did not specify the reason for selling.SLB's regional unit that includes Russia saw revenue grow by 45% between the first and third quarters of 2022, while a similar unit at Halliburton experienced a 6% decline, according to regulatory filings.Halliburton said in September it sold its business to a Russia-based management team made up of former Halliburton employees. It now operates under the name BurService LLC and is independent from Halliburton, the company said.Baker Hughes and Halliburton declined to comment.Weatherford, a smaller competitor remains, but its participation in the industry is diminishing as it has terminated some existing contracts that SLB has been able to pick up, a source working in Russia told Reuters. Reuters was unable to determine how many contracts SLB has gained.SLB is also in line to be the exclusive provider of directional drilling for a major Russian gas project, a source said.""The message from HQ is to take mostly exclusive contracts with high revenue,"" said a SLB employee involved in the business wins. With fewer rivals, SLB has been able to receive price increases and better terms and conditions, the source, who is not authorized to speak to the press, said.Weatherford declined to comment for this story.PAST VIOLATIONSRussia's output has defied predictions of a steep decline, and for January through November of last year rose by 2.2% from year-ago levels, averaging 10.91 million bpd of oil and gas condensate production, Reuters reported last year, citing Russian media. Countries like India, China and Pakistan are buying Russian oil at steep discounts, while production at the Sakhalin-1 project, which was operated by Exxon Mobil Corp before it exited after the Ukraine invasion, is nearing a return to full capacity.SLB is currently a contractor on that Russian Far East mega-project, and is anticipating more business in 2023, including work to help produce more natural gas at the Sakhalin-3 project, according to a recent presentation viewed by Reuters.The company continued to work there in 2014 after the U.S. slapped sanctions on Rosneft, a partner in the project.SLB has previously violated government sanctions imposed on countries where it operates. In 2015, a unit of SLB pleaded guilty to violating sanctions related to Iran and Sudan, paying a $237.2 million fine to the U.S. Justice Department. In a 2015 statement, the company said it ""cooperated with the investigation"" and was ""satisfied that this matter is finally resolved.""In 2021, SLB paid $1.4 million for violations of Ukraine-related sanctions by its subsidiary Cameron International Corp for providing services to Russian energy firm Gazprom-Neft Shelf.(Reporting by Liz Hampton in Denver; Editing by Anna Driver and Gary McWilliams)]"

Schlumberger touches many aspects of the most technically intensive activities in the energy extraction process including software and data management, coiled tubing equipment for downhole mechanical well intervention, reservoir management, and well stimulation among an array of other services.The recent strength in oil prices along with Schlumberger’s broad technical expertise has encouraged a recent boon to the business.SLB is also very committed to ESG policy and moving their business towards net-zero emissions. They are the first energy services company to add scope 3 emissions ambition, which is the highest standard of reduction by the EPA.  This along with its diversified offerings, SLB likely has a long runway to future business expansion.In the near term, however, there may be some risks. Many upstream energy companies have cut capital spending to avoid overextending themselves financially and have instead prioritized returning capital to shareholders. A lack of heavy investment may weigh on Schlumberger’s earnings going forward.Schlumberger reports earnings on Friday January 20 before the market openEarnings ExpectationsSchlumberger has strong sales and earnings growth expectations. Q4 sales estimates are expected to grow 26% to $7.7 billion, while FY 2022 sales are expected to climb 22% to $28 billion.Earnings growth for Q4 is expected to surge 68% to $0.69 per share, with FY 2022 earnings projected to also grow 68% to $2.15 per share.SLB also has a very consistent record with regards to earnings. SLB almost always reports in line with expectations or beats and going back to 2012 there is only one instance of missing, and it was just $-0.01.Story continuesA more recent development is earnings volatility. You can see in the chart below that in the last two reporting sessions, SLB made some big moves following the report. Following the Q2 report the stock rallied 7.5% and after Q3 it was up 14.5%. These moves higher followed fairly significant beats as well.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValuationSchlumberger shares are up 74% over the last six months and 140% over the last two years outpacing the sector during both time periods. The post Covid economy has been very good for SLB.Performance has been so good it looks to me like Schlumberger stock may be fully priced, and the upside may be limited from here.Current valuations are in line with its historical averages. Relative to the sector it is well above its 10-year median. And the current one year forward P/E is just below its 10-year median. Additionally, SLB currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicating a lack of positive earnings growth trend.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConclusionSchlumberger is a very well-positioned business with great long-term prospects. It has made exceptional returns over the past two years. Additionally, this success has put Schlumberger in a position to share some of its profits through increased dividends. The company has committed to splitting FCF to distribute as a dividend, which is now a 1.2% yield.This earnings report should be a very interesting tell for Schlumberger and the Energy services sector.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With a market capitalization of $24.2 billion, the average volume of shares traded in the last three months was 1.7 million.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGrowing premiums attributable to uninterrupted rate hikes, growth-related initiatives and a strong financial position continue to drive HIG.The insurer with a current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) has a solid track record of beating estimates in each of the trailing six quarters. Return-on-equity (ROE) of HIG, which underlines growth potential, stands at 16.5% as of Sep 30, 2022, higher than the industry average of 8.4%.Can HIG Retain the Momentum?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hartford Financial’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $8.38 per share, which suggests 17.5% growth from the 2022 estimate. The consensus mark for revenues stands at $16 billion, which indicates an improvement of 5.9% from the 2022 estimate.The premiums of HIG continue to benefit from the solid performances of its Commercial Lines business. The business is aided by continued rate increases, wider exposure, new business generation and solid retention rates.Growing premiums bode well for Hartford Financial since it accounts for a significant chunk of its top line. Though HIG grapples with catastrophe losses, frequent losses ramp up the policy renewal rate, which keeps premiums flowing.Improved fully insured ongoing premiums driven by robust sales and solid enrolment contribute to the sound performance of HIG’s Group Benefits business.The insurer follows an inorganic growth route through acquisitions to strengthen its capabilities. Hartford Financial keeps an eye on selling off its underperforming businesses to intensify the focus on its U.S. operations. HIG also resorts to numerous cost-cutting measures in the form of restructuring initiatives, that might aid margins in the days ahead.Story continuesA strong financial position equips Hartford Financial to engage in the tactical deployment of capital through share buybacks or dividend payments. The last dividend hike of 10% was approved in the month of October 2022.Hartford Financial boasts an impressive VGM Score of A. VGM Score helps identify stocks with the most attractive value, the best growth and the most promising momentum.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the insurance space are Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated RGA, CNO Financial Group, Inc.

(HOLX) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hologic-inc-holx-attracting-investor-140002760.html,1674050402,STORY,['HOLX'],"[Hologic (HOLX) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this medical device maker have returned +7.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.8% change. The Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, to which Hologic belongs, has gained 5.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Hologic is expected to post earnings of $0.88 per share, indicating a change of -59.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.48 points to a change of -42.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.4%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.93 indicates a change of +13.1% from what Hologic is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.9%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Hologic is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for HOLX _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Hologic, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $980.98 million indicates a year-over-year change of -33.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $3.83 billion and $4.06 billion estimates indicate -21.2% and +6.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryHologic reported revenues of $953.3 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -27.6%. EPS of $0.82 for the same period compares with $1.61 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $866.83 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +9.98%. The EPS surprise was +32.26%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Hologic is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Hologic. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Hologic (HOLX) earns a Zacks Rank #2 14 days from its next quarterly earnings release on February 1, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.91 a share.By taking the percentage difference between the $0.91 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.88 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Hologic has an Earnings ESP of 3.13%.HOLX is part of a big group of Medical stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Exact Sciences (EXAS) as well.Exact Sciences is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on February 28, 2023. EXAS' Most Accurate Estimate sits at -$0.80 a share 41 days from its next earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Exact Sciences is -$0.92, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 12.81%.Story continuesHOLX and EXAS' positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

A copy of the same can be downloaded here. The fund returned -0.28% net in the fourth quarter compared to a 2.20% return for the Russell 1000 Growth Index and a 7.41% return for the S&amp;P 500 Index. In 2022, the fund returned -38.02% net compared to -29.14% and -18.22% returns for the Russell and the S&amp;P 500 Indexes, respectively. Inflation, the Fed’s interest rate hikes, and revenue and earnings slowdowns of the fund’s holding companies led the fund to underperform in the quarter and the year.  In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2022.Polen Capital highlighted stocks like Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in the Q4 2022 investor letter. Headquartered in Los Gatos, California, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is a streaming platform. On January 18, 2023, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock closed at $326.33 per share. One-month return of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) was 9.60%, and its shares lost 35.79% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has a market capitalization of $145.223 billion.Polen Capital made the following comment about Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has nearly doubled since its May 2022 lows and was our top performer for both the quarter and the year. In the summer, we added to our position meaningfully after our research indicated that the company’s two new monetization levers (requiring fees for shared passwords and the introduction of an advertising-supported subscription) would be very additive to the company’s revenue and profits beginning in early 2023. The company has since announced plans to disallow password sharing, which should provide a boost to revenue and profit growth nearly immediately as account holders or those that are borrowing passwords are required to pay to continue to watch Netflix content. The ad-supported subscription tier should also be a clear positive, not only for the company’s financials but also for consumers and marketers alike. While the subscription fee for the ad-supported tier is only about $7/month in the U.S., the ad revenue per subscriber that Netflix earns for consumers choosing this option could easily add another $15 per month or more in the U.S., potentially making Netflix’s ad-supported subscription tier the company’s most revenue generative and profitable. Even if more premium subscribers than expected downgrade to the adsupported option, we think there should be significant revenue uplift for Netflix. It appears market participants have been doing this math as well, driving the stock price higher over the last seven months.”Story continuesPhoto by Thibault Penin on UnsplashNetflix, Inc.

Having moved mountains (and billions of dollars) to try to compete with Netflix after years of letting it run away with the streaming game, media companies are still very early in their direct-to-consumer orientation process.More from DeadlineNetflix Stock Surges To 9-Month High As Wall Street Cheers Q4 Subscriber Gains, Smoothly Executed Succession Plan'Cobra Kai' Renewed For Sixth And Final Season'You People' Review: Eddie Murphy, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Jonah Hill Lead Kenya Barris' Hysterically Funny &amp; Smart Feature Debut“Rather than being the new sliced bread, investors and executives have accepted that streaming is, in fact, not a good business – at least not compared to what came before,” MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman wrote in a note to clients this week. “But that pre-streaming era is now long gone and not coming back. If streaming is a mediocre business, so what? We are in a streaming age now.”Netflix is predicting it will add 4.5 million subscribers in the quarter, reaching 227.6 million global subscribers. Even if it hits that target, the gain would be the smallest during the holiday quarter since 2014. The company added 8.3 million in the comparable period in 2021.Programming milestones during the quarter, certainly, including the meteoric success Wednesday, have the potential to boost the subscriber tally. But profits are due to decline markedly from a year ago, with analysts’ consensus calling for earnings of 44 cents a share, down from $1.33 in the 2021 quarter. Revenue has also been squeezed, with Wall Street’s consensus of $7.8 billion only a touch higher than $7.7 billion a year ago.Story continuesA major theme in the company’s previous earnings report last October, was that Netflix execs believed they were on “a path to reaccelerate growth” after two disastrous backwards quarters earlier in the year. Even so, the cost of content continues to weigh heavily. Netflix has said it plans to hold content spending steady at $18 billion a year, though for a go-go tech player flat is the new down.Two major issues expected to figure prominently in the company’s shareholder letter and video interview with executives (Netflix’s version of the traditional conference call) are password sharing and advertising. After years of ignoring or even winking at the practice of passing along log-in credentials, the company has decided to stop letting subscribers do so at no extra charge. Co-CEO Ted Sarandos conceded at a December appearance at a conference hosted by UBS that the company can expect some complaints. “Consumers aren’t going to love it right out of the gate,” he said, “but we need to show them why they should see value.” Many Wall Streeters see an influx of several billion dollars in new revenue if the company is able to manage the process effectively.Advertising, similarly, is widely seen as a contributor to top-line growth even as the overall trajectory of subscription gains starts to flatten. Early indications about the progress of the cheaper subscription tier with advertising — introduced last November after a stunning reversal of the company’s longtime stance against ads — are that its traction is minimal. Financially, the mid-quarter launch in 12 territories was never expected to be a game-changer in the quarter, but many ears will be listening closely for early descriptions of the effort.Eric Sheridan, a veteran tech industry analyst with Goldman Sachs, described the start to Netflix’s $7-a-month subscription business as “muted” at best. In a note to clients, he questioned the extent of the upside of the effort. “We expect a host of large scaled brand advertisers will adopt the offering but itscurrent framework (large minimum commitment, above industry pricing and limited measurement) could cap the advertising dollar opportunity (absent a wider scale of users, greater measurement/attribution),” he wrote. “In addition, we remain concerned that additional subscriber offerings could cause ‘spin down’ into the lowest priced plans by users in any potential consumer recession over the next 6-12 months.”Sheridan considers Netflix a “show-me stock” and rates shares a “sell.” Taking the opposite view is Cowen &amp; Co.’s John Blackledge, who sees a “large ad opportunity” as a catalyst for shares. In a Cowen survey, Blackledge reported, one-third of digital ad buyers indicated they plan to buy space on Netflix.Netflix still has long-range subscriber growth potential, Blackledge says, with incremental profit margins at 80% to 85%.One investment firm known for years as a Netflix bear, Wedbush Securities, has become a bull. In a report this week, the firm’s Alicia Reese and Michael Pachter argue that the company is “well-positioned in this murky environment as streamers are shifting strategy, and should be valued as an immensely profitable, slow-growth company.”Investors so far this year appear willing to tune in to the Netflix story.

134,ebbe94ef-9f84-3fd1-9bed-8c9d07c93482,NFLX,2023-01-19,Should Investors Buy Netflix Stock With Crucial Q4 Earnings Approaching?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-buy-netflix-stock-crucial-225810115.html,1674082690,STORY,['NFLX'],"[Netflix NFLX shares have been on quite a rally leading up to the company’s fourth-quarter earnings report on January 19.  In fact, Netflix shares are up 13% over the last month, to easily outpace the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq.This leaves many wondering if the rally can continue post-earnings and if it’s time to buy Netflix stock with shares still 38% from their highs.Q4 PreviewBeating quarterly expectations, especially on the bottom line, along with positive guidance and strong subscriber figures has led to strong price movement in Netflix shares in the past. The Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction (ESP) is an insightful feature to help figure out the possibility of a company beating earnings estimates.The Zacks Consensus for Netflix’s Q4 earnings is $0.51 a share with the Most Accurate Estimate at $0.42 per share. This unfortunately gives Netflix an ESP of -17.11% and indicates the company could miss earnings estimates for its fiscal fourth quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNetflix earnings are expected to be down -61% year over year compared to EPS of $1.33 a share in Q4 2021 as the company adjusts to the broader economic challenges.  This is closely associated with operating costs, as top-line sales are expected to be up 1% from the prior year quarter at $7.84 billion.Advertising &amp; Subscribers Wall Street will be paying special attention to the insight and outlook that Netflix can provide on the company’s expansion of its paid-ad service which it offers at a cheaper monthly subscription amount of $6.99.The company’s venture into using its platform to create adverting revenue could be lucrative long-term and help combat increased competition from Disney DIS which has become one of its primary streaming competitors. With the paid-ad subscription service recently launched in October, the company’s results and updates on rumored news that it missed 20% of its ad targets will be heavily monitored after this led to much volatility in Netflix stock before its more recent rebound.  Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStill, many analysts believe Netflix’s advertising segment could bring in billions of additional revenue in the years to come and the company will need to address the rumblings that advertisers reportedly asked the company to return some of the money already paid for advertising slots.Overall, Netflix is expected to have added 4.5 million paid subscribers during Q4, bringing its total paid memberships to 227.6 million. This is significant as Netflix’s price movement has historically been based on subscriber growth and Q4 would almost double the 2.4 million subscribers added during Q3 after the company lost subscribers for the first time in over a decade during Q1 and Q2 of its current fiscal year 2022.  Performance &amp; Valuation Netflix stock is still down -37% over the last year, to underperform the S&amp;P 500’s -13%. This has also trailed the Nasdaq’s -23% and slightly lagged its rival Disney’s -34%. However, over the last decade, Netflix’s +1230% has crushed broader indexes and Disney’s +82%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLast year’s drop and Netflix’s historical performance are reasons for investors to be optimistic about a continued recovery in 2023 and beyond. On that note, monitoring Netflix’s valuation will be important going forward, especially after big rallies to the upside.At current levels of around $326 a share, Netflix has a forward P/E of 30.9X.  This is much higher than the industry average of 15.1X but Netflix has been the leader in its space. Plus, Netflix stock trades well below its own decade high of 513.4X and at a 71% discount to the median of 108X.When dividing the P/E ratio by Netflix’s growth rate we can see that its PEG of 3.5 is still close to the decade median of 3.3. Netflix’s PEG is higher than the industry average of 1.5 but nicely beneath its decade-long high of 23.6.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGrowth OutlookNetflix earnings are now expected to be down -8% for fiscal 2022 but rebound and rise 2% in FY23 at $10.53 a share. Earnings estimate revisions have trended up for FY22 but declined for FY23 over the last 90 days.On the top line, sales are forecasted to be up 6% for FY22 and jump another 7% in FY23 to $33.94 billion. Fiscal 2023 would represent 68% growth from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $20.15 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom Line Netflix currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) going into its fourth-quarter earnings release. Despite the sharp rally in Netflix stock leading up to its quarterly report the company’s valuation is still attractive relative to its past. While an earnings beat looks unlikely, better-than-expected guidance particularly surrounding its advertising business along with continued subscriber growth could certainly lead to more upside in the stock.There could be some short-term weakness in Netflix stock if the company is not able to provide this optimism in its outlook but patient investors may be rewarded for holding on to shares at their current levels.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

135,84ce1b38-883c-3476-82e0-edfc2534f516,NFLX,2023-01-19,"Netflix earnings due out Thursday, 'Avatar' sequel becomes sixth-biggest film of all time",Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/netflix-earnings-due-thursday-avatar-214650113.html,1674078410,VIDEO,['NFLX'],"[Yahoo Finance entertainment reporter Allie Canal previews what to expect from Netflix's fourth-quarter earnings results and also details the success of the 'Avatar' sequel.Video TranscriptDAVE BRIGGS: Shares of Netflix took a beating in '22, but bounced back to start this year, up almost 10%. The streaming giant releases its Q4 earnings after the bell tomorrow. Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal here with the preview. What are we expecting, my friend?ALLIE CANAL: Yeah, Dave. I mean, this is going to be an important quarter for Netflix to really set the tone for 2023. If we think about this point last year, we started 2022 with two straight quarters of subscriber declines. So Netflix is going to want to come into this with a position of strength. And investors, they're going to want a bit of an update on some of those profitability efforts, such as the recently launched ad-supported tier, along with those crackdowns on password sharing.However, analysts have warned us that it's really the long-term game that you want to watch here. You're not going to see those efforts really reflected this quarter, a large part of that being that ad tier launched in November right in the middle of the quarter, only 12 markets. So we're going to have to wait and really see what the executives give us on that earnings call following the announcement.But in terms of the numbers, here's what we're looking at when it comes to consensus estimates on the Street. Revenue expected to come in at 7.85 billion, adjusted EPS at $0.58 a share, and then subscriber net additions at 4.5 million. Now we do have a weakening US dollar. We know the strength of the dollar has been a really big pain point for Netflix. So that weakening could potentially impact revenue, as well as operating income figures.And then in terms of subscribers, we had solid record breaking content in the fourth quarter-- ""Wednesday,"" ""Glass Onion,"" and ""Dahmer."" The list goes on. And we're going to see continued content improvements planned for the current quarter. So although subscriber numbers, they're not as important to investors anymore, the focus has really been on revenue, free cash flow, and profitability.Story continuesA subscriber beat would still be a win here. And as you mentioned about the stock price, I mean, 10% up on the year, 60% over the past six months. So, so far, so good. And we'll see what happens tomorrow.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, we certainly have seen a number of analysts come out in support of Netflix over the last couple of months. A lot of them very bullish on this new ad plan. So we'll see what we get from the company tomorrow. Allie, there's another big story we want to get to. ""Avatar, The Way of Water"" crossing another huge milestone here. Tell us about it.ALLIE CANAL: Nearing 2 billion in global ticket sales, this is the number that James Cameron said this film would have to reach if it wanted to even get close to profitability. So you know he's championing that. But just to put this number into context, how hard this is to accomplish, only five films in history have ever crossed that 2 billion threshold. That was the OG ""Avatar,"" ""Avengers, Endgame,"" ""Titanic,"" ""Star Wars, The Force Awakens,"" and ""Avengers, Infinity War.""So this film has really done incredibly well at the box office, very well internationally, especially since it has not been shown in Russia. And it's outpacing projections in China. And China, by the way-- Disney very happy about this-- greenlighting two Marvel sequels with ""Black Panther"" and ""Ant-Man."" So, overall, I think Disney is very happy with its box office slate right now.DAVE BRIGGS: No doubt. Did you guys see it yet, ""The Way of the Water""?SEANA SMITH: I haven't, no.DAVE BRIGGS: Come on!ALLIE CANAL: I was invited, and then I couldn't go because, again, it's four hours.DAVE BRIGGS: Listen.ALLIE CANAL: I know, I know.DAVE BRIGGS: Explain--ALLIE CANAL: You're gonna yell at me.SEANA SMITH: It's the one movie that it's worth going to the theater for.DAVE BRIGGS: You have to see it in the theater.SEANA SMITH: I'll give you that.DAVE BRIGGS: It's fantastic.SEANA SMITH: All right, we'll see.DAVE BRIGGS: All right.SEANA SMITH: All right, Allie Canal, thanks so--]"

The stock outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 1.56%. At the same time, the Dow lost 1.81%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 4.66%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the oil refiner had lost 0.13% over the past month. This has lagged the Oils-Energy sector's gain of 6.91% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 3.82% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Phillips 66 as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be January 31, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Phillips 66 to post earnings of $4.40 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 49.66%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $36.85 billion, up 9.77% from the year-ago period.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Phillips 66. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 3.33% higher. Phillips 66 is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Looking at its valuation, Phillips 66 is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 6.95. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 8.21, so we one might conclude that Phillips 66 is trading at a discount comparatively.Story continuesMeanwhile, PSX's PEG ratio is currently 0.39. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing was holding an average PEG ratio of 0.6 at yesterday's closing price.The Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry is part of the Oils-Energy sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 84, putting it in the top 34% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

138,906e233d-7082-3007-86b9-3dae9cb9c2e6,PSX,2023-01-19,Phillips 66 (PSX) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/phillips-66-psx-attracting-investor-140002556.html,1674050402,STORY,['PSX'],"[Phillips 66 (PSX) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this oil refiner have returned -0.1%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, which Phillips 66 falls in, has gained 3.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Phillips 66 is expected to post earnings of $4.40 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +49.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.4%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $19.47 points to a change of +241.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +3.3%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $14.76 indicates a change of -24.2% from what Phillips 66 is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +3.3%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Phillips 66 is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PSX _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Phillips 66, the consensus sales estimate of $36.85 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +9.8%. The $170.37 billion and $145.01 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +48.3% and -14.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPhillips 66 reported revenues of $48.76 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +54.9%. EPS of $6.46 for the same period compares with $3.18 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $36.81 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +32.49%. The EPS surprise was +29.72%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Phillips 66 is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Phillips 66. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

""But never ever underestimate the U.S. consumer, that is an import investment rule. Let's see a few more months (of data).""In the currency markets, the yen rose 0.7% to 127.95 per dollar, unwinding some of its drop the previous day when, to the surprise of markets, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) stuck firmly to its approach of ultra-low interest rates.The BOJ has pursued super-easy policy settings for decades in an attempt to generate inflation and growth, but there are doubts it can keep that up, and traders have been selling Japanese government bonds and buying yen to bet on a shift.Story continues""There's an intense amount of speculation in the market that now that the January (BOJ) meeting has happened without any changes ... that we'll see something in March,"" said Shafali Sachdev, head of FX, fixed income and commodities in Asia at BNP Paribas Wealth Management in Singapore.April was another possibility, she added, since by then the BOJ would have a new governor. ""My guess would be that more speculators would look to build positions going into these meetings.""Speculators did, however, give some respite to the BOJ in the bond market. After four days of huge BOJ spending to reel 10-year yields back inside the target band of 0.5% either side of zero, the yield held at 0.41% on Thursday.RECESSION RISKIn Europe, there was plenty going on too.European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde pushed up euro zone bond yields slightly by telling the World Economic Forum's Davos gathering that the bank would stay the course with rate hikes.Minutes from last month's ECB meeting were also due shortly, although Dutch ECB policymaker Klaas Knot, a noted hawk, had also been out saying markets should take more seriously guidance of rates rising in multiples of 50 basis points.Norway's crown had ticked higher as its central bank kept its interest rates at 2.75%, but said they were likely to go up in March, while the New Zealand dollar was down more than 1% after the surprise resignation of Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's who said she had ""no more in the tank"".S&amp;P 500 futures were down 0.75% as the U.S. open approached and close to breaking below the 50-day moving average.On Wednesday, the S&amp;P 500 had lost 1.6% after data showed U.S. manufacturing output had slumped last month and retail sales had fallen by the most in a year.Microsoft's announcement of 10,000 layoffs and hawkish comments from Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard added to the gloom, with both monetary officials expecting U.S. interest rates above 5% this year.Fed officials Lael Brainard and John Williams were due to make public appearances later. Netflix, American Airlines and Procter &amp; Gamble were reporting results, while housing starts numbers, weekly jobless claims and the Philadelphia Fed's Manufacturing Survey will provide more colour on the U.S. economy's health.""The decline in retail spending and industrial production adds to the theme of the economy slowing and heading into recession in 2023, and pushes back on the soft-landing narrative dominating markets since January,"" said National Australia Bank's head of market economics, Tapas Strickland.The dollar slipped into the red after its overnight rise as New York trading loomed. The Australian dollar was still down 0.75% after data showed anunexpected fallin Australian employment last month, but the ECB's talkers had lifted the euro back into positive territory at $1.0822.(Reporting by Marc Jones; editing by John Stonestreet and Alex Richardson)]"

NRG as the Bull of the Day and KB Home KBH as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Tesla TSLA, Lear LEA and Harley-Davidson (HOG).Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:NRG Energy, Inc. is a utility and energy giant that sits at a potentially attractive longer-term entry point.NRG stock tumbled in early December after it announced a deal to buy Vivint Smart Home, as it aims to expand its reach for the age of smart homes and high-tech energy grids. NRG's long-term goal is to become a ""leading provider of essential services for homes and businesses.""NRG Energy is also a worthy consideration for 2023 given its dividend yield and stable, essential business model as the market could easily favor energy and utility stocks again amid all the unknowns. Energy and Beyond NRG is a utility powerhouse that generates electricity and provides energy solutions and natural gas to millions of business and residential customers. The Houston, Texas-based company is now poised to roll out more digital-focused efforts as electric grids, homes, and businesses grow more high-tech by the day.NRG over the last year-plus explored how it could expand its reach to thrive in a world full of smart homes and connected energy grids. CEO Mauricio Gutierrez said on the company's Q3 earnings call in early November that NRG was growing increasingly focused on the rapid expansion of connected devices and appliances within the internet of things revolution.NRG Energy decided it needed to capitalize on the growing smart home market and address a crucial drawback: too many different platforms and screens. ""It is clear that a single interface for the home is of increasing importance and customer attitudes around these services are shifting from nice-to-have to need-to-have,"" Gutierrez said.Story continues""Next, the electrification of the economy through smart technology and clean energy choices is real. We are seeing an increasing number of devices and appliances connected like HVAC, water heaters, battery, rooftop solar and other, in addition to having greater penetration of electric vehicles.""Roughly a month later, NRG announced a big splash to help it expand almost overnight into much more than a utility firm. NRG Energy said on December 6 that it agreed to buy Vivint Smart Home, Inc. for $12 per share or $2.8 billion in an all-cash deal. NRG Energy sees the Vivint purchase, which it paid a 33% premium for compared to its closing price prior to the deal, as a fantastic way to establish itself as a ""leading provider of essential home services.""The deal is projected to close at some point in the first quarter of 2023. The newly beefed-up and diversified NRG will boast a network of approximately 7.4 million customers across North America. NRG will likely incorporate Vivint's backend tech ecosystem across the firm.The beefed-up firm will be able to bundle offerings for utilities, home security, automation, and more, with more people than ever craving high-tech, centralized minimalism for their homes. NRG is preparing for a world where homes and businesses seamlessly manage and optimize energy storage, electric vehicle charging, and beyond.Other Fundamentals Wall Street showed its displeasure with NRG for seemingly stepping out of its lane to buy a smart home company with offerings that include security, lighting, and beyond. NRG sees the acquisition as helping it prepare for a totally connected future as it brings in a company and its tech that already lives inside people's homes.NRG remains confident in its planned acquisition for many reasons. The deal creates more stable and predictable earnings for NRG as it boosts its business beyond fluctuating energy prices, given Vivint's subscription-based model and long customer history.NRG's post-Vivint announcement selloff has it trading around 33% below its highs at roughly $32 per share. NRG is also trading at a 60% discount to its industry at 6.4X forward earnings and 50% below its own 10-year median.The recent tumble has NRG shares neck-and-neck with its industry during the past five years, up 16%. Plus, NRG's Utility - Electric Power industry currently ranks in the top 30% of over 250 Zacks industries. NRG Energy's dividend currently yields 4.4% to crush its industry's 3.1%, with a very sustainable 23% payout ratio.The company also plans to complete its $1 billion buyback program over the near term, of which $360 million was remaining as of November 30. NRG said it plans to use its excess free cash flow to fund the Vivint acquisition, as well as reduce acquisition-related debt, and maintain its common stock dividend growth policy in 2023. NRG then plans to return to its 50% return of capital / 50% growth capital allocation policy in 2024.Bottom LineZacks estimates call for NRG's 2022 revenue to soar 20% to $32.34 billion to help lift its adjusted earnings by 45% to $11.12 per share. The top and bottom line strength is being driven, in part, by soaring energy and utility prices.NRG is projected to see a rather significant pullback in 2023. Yet, its overall earnings outlook has trended largely upward for FY22 and FY23.NRG's bottom-line positivity helps the stock land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now, and it currently trades 19% below its average Zacks price target.Overall, NRG offers investors value and dividends for what could be another turbulent 2023. Plus, NRG will soon be a much more diversified firm prepared to thrive in the world of connected smart homes and tech-centric energy grids.Bear of the Day:KB Home fell short of both earnings and revenue estimates when it reported its fourth quarter fiscal 2022 financial results on January 11. The homebuilder also provided downbeat guidance for 2023 as the housing market continues to cool amid a multitude of headwinds outside of KB Home's control.KB Home OverviewKB Home is one of the largest homebuilders in the U.S., with it currently operating in nearly 50 markets across the country, mostly in highly desirable areas within Colorado, Arizona, Texas, California, Nevada, Washington, and beyond. The company allows buyers to customize many aspects of their homes.KBH is also committed to more energy-efficient offerings. In fact, the firm boasts that it is ""the first builder to make every home we build ENERGY STAR certified.""The Los Angeles-based firm benefitted from the covid housing boom that was driven by ultra-low interest rates, demographic changes, and many other factors that favored KB Home and other home builders.KB Home's revenue soared 37% in 2021 and another 21% in 2022. The firm delivered 2% more homes in 2022 (13,738), with its average selling price up 18% to $500K.The housing market looks a lot different with the average 30-year fixed rate mortgage at around 6.4% at the moment vs. 2.7% in early 2021 and 3.5% in early 2022. KB Home said on January 11 that its ending backlog fell 25% YoY, with Q4 gross orders down 47%. Plus, its cancellation rate as a percentage of gross orders was 68% vs. 13%.KB Home attributed much of the downturn and ""sharply lower demand"" on ""higher mortgage interest rates, inflation and other macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns."" Zacks estimates call for KBH's 2023 revenue to fall 25% YoY to $5.2 billion to come in below its FY21 total of $5.7 billion.KBH's adjusted earnings are projected to slide by 49% to $4.67 per share. And its bottom-line outlook could continue to trend in the wrong direction considering that its FY23 Zacks consensus EPS is down 30% in the last few months and around 25% since its Q4 release, with FY24's figure 35% lower than it was 60 days ago.Bottom LineKB Home's downward EPS revisions help it grab a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) right now, with its most recent analyst estimate for FY24 coming in 8% worse than the current consensus. On top of that, KB Home's Building Products - Home Builders industry is in the bottom 8% of over 250 Zacks industries right now.On the positive side, KB Home shares first began to sell off in May of 2021 and then again in early 2022 as interest rates really began to take off. This means that at least some of the downturn is already priced in.Unfortunately, the stock rebounded rather significantly off its September lows and it's now near overbought RSI levels. KB Home's 1.7% dividend yield can be topped by many other stocks and ETFs with stronger near-term prospects. And the price chart shows us the rather wild ride KBH has been on over the past decade.Additional content:Is Tesla's (TSLA) Earnings Beat Streak in Jeopardy?Teslais set to post fourth-quarter 2022 results on Jan 25, after the closing bell. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter's earnings and revenues is pegged at $1.13 per share and $24.84 billion, respectively.Tesla surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the last reported quarter on higher-than-expected revenues from Energy Generation/Storage and Services/Other segments. Over the trailing four quarters, Tesla beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on all occasions, with the average being 26.4%. This is depicted in the graph below:But will the company be able to maintain its beat streak this time around as well? While investors are keeping their fingers crossed, an earnings beat doesn't look too likely for Tesla this time around.Estimate RevisionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings per share has moved south by a penny in the past seven days. The estimate for the bottom line, however, implies year-over-year growth of 32.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues suggests a year-over-year rise of 40.2%.Factors at PlayThe company delivered 405,278 (388,131 Model 3 and Y, and 17,147 Model S and X) cars worldwide in the fourth quarter, up 31.5% from the year-ago quarter and 18.1% from the prior quarter. While the EV king hit record deliveries, it fell short of Wall Street expectations. Total deliveries also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 407,855 units amid logistics problems and demand cool off in the face of rising interest rates and recessionary fears.Also, COVID resurgence in China caused the company to temporarily suspend and reduce production at its Shanghai factory.In addition to the deliveries miss, Tesla offered steep discounts on its models in the United States, China and elsewhere to spur demand, which is likely to have limited automotive revenues to some extent. Further, high costs of raw materials and logistical constraints are likely to have put pressure on its margins.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total automotive cost of revenues is $16.4 billion, significantly higher than $11.08 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. Overall, weaker-than-expected deliveries, COVID disruptions in China, commodity cost inflation and economic concerns are expected to adversely impact Tesla's upcoming results.The consensus mark for Energy Generation and Storage revenues is pegged at $1,033 million, suggesting a decline from $1,117 million recorded in the previous reported quarter. The consensus estimate for revenues for Tesla's Services and Other segment is pegged at $1,523 million, implying a fall from $1,645 million recorded in the third quarter of 2022.What Does Our Model Say?Our proven model doesn't conclusively predict an earnings beat for Tesla this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. That is not the case here.Earnings ESP: Tesla has an Earnings ESP of -3.95%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged 4 cents lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Tesla currently carries a Zacks Rank of 5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Stocks with a Favorable CombinationWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for Tesla, here are a couple of players from the auto space, which, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat for the quarter to be reported:Lear will release fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 2. The company has an Earnings ESP of +4.29% and a Zacks Rank #3.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Lear's to-be-reported quarter's earnings and revenues is pegged at $2.53 per share and $5.26 billion, respectively. LEA surpassed earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters, with the average surprise being 18%.Harley-Davidson is expected to report fourth-quarter 2022 results by mid-February. The company has an Earnings ESP of +300.00% and a Zacks Rank #1.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Harley-Davidson's to-be-reported quarter's earnings and revenues is pegged at 3 cents per share and $880.5 million, respectively. HOG surpassed earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, with the average surprise being 43.3%.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

155,980f0c55-ec1b-3411-9759-110aa88fb99b,NEE,2023-01-19,NextEra Energy Partners (NEP) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nextera-energy-partners-nep-reports-150003233.html,1674054003,STORY,['NEE-PR'],"[The market expects NextEra Energy Partners (NEP) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 25, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis limited partnership for clean-energy projects is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.52 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +533.3%.Revenues are expected to be $313.13 million, up 35% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 27.91% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for NextEra Energy Partners?For NextEra Energy Partners, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -4.46%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that NextEra Energy Partners will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that NextEra Energy Partners would post earnings of $0.63 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.93, delivering a surprise of +47.62%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.NextEra Energy Partners doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Falling demand signals the increasing likelihood of a global recession in the first half of 2023.""The key findings from December's report:DEMAND: Demand for components, raw materials, commodities and any other items companies need to provide their goods and services declined further in December, especially in North America.INVENTORIES: Global business reports of safety stockpiling are up since November, which is a key factor behind December's increase in GEP's Global Supply Chain Volatility Index.LABOR SHORTAGES: Companies report an uptick in labor shortages, causing supplier capacity to be stretched.MATERIAL SHORTAGES: Global supply shortages are at their lowest level since September 2020 as suppliers continue to adjust to market conditions. Easing demand has reduced competition for items.TRANSPORTATION: Transportation costs are at their lowest in over two years, highlighting weaker pressures on shipping, train, air and road freight.REGIONAL SUPPLY CHAIN VOLATILITY: Supply chains feeding into Europe remain the most stretched, compared to Asia and North America, in December.Story continuesABOUT THE GEP GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN VOLATILITY INDEXThe GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index is produced by S&amp;P Global and GEP. The GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index is derived from S&amp;P Global's PMI™ surveys, sent to companies in over 40 countries, totaling around 27,000 companies. These countries account for 89% of global gross domestic product (GDP) (source: World Bank World Development Indicators).The headline figure is the GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index. This a weighted sum of six sub-indices derived from PMI data, PMI Comments Trackers and PMI Commodity Price &amp; Supply Indicators compiled by S&amp;P Global.The GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index is calculated using a weighted sum of the z-scores of the six indices. Weights are determined by analyzing the impact each component has on suppliers' delivery times through regression analysis.The six variables used are 1) JP Morgan Global Quantity of Purchases Index, 2) All Items Supply Shortages Indicator, 3) Transport Price Pressure Indicator, and Manufacturing PMI Comments Tracker data for 4) stockpiling due to supply or price concerns, and backlogs rising due to 5) staff shortages and 6) item shortages.A value above 0 indicates that supply chain capacity is being stretched and supply chain volatility is increasing. The further above 0, the greater the extent to which capacity is being stretched.A value below 0 indicates that supply chain capacity is being underutilized, reducing supply chain volatility. The further below 0, the greater the extent to which capacity is being underutilized.A Supply Chain Volatility Index is also published at a regional level for Europe, Asia, North America and the UK. The regional indices measure the performance of supply chains connected to those parts of the world.For more information on PMI surveys, PMI Comments Trackers and PMI Commodity Price &amp; Supply Indicators, or the GEP Supply Chain Volatility Index methodologies, please contact economics@ihsmarkit.com.About GEPGEP® delivers transformative supply chain solutions that help global enterprises become more agile and resilient, operate more efficiently and effectively, gain competitive advantage, boost profitability and increase shareholder value.

But they still want test drives, according to new surveySOUTHFIELD, Mich., Jan. 19, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- A survey of US vehicle shoppers who bought cars in 2022 shows that a clear majority would be willing to wait for a vehicle that specifically met their tastes.(PRNewsfoto/S&amp;P Global)Post-COVID car buyers are willing to wait for the right car; want more of the process to be handled online, survey says.According to the Vehicle Buyer Journey survey recently conducted by S&amp;P Global Mobility, 56% of consumers in the US would be willing to wait more than one month for delivery of an ordered vehicle, and 30% would be willing to wait more than three months. The percentages skew higher for those looking to buy a luxury-branded model. The S&amp;P Global Mobility survey also found consumers are desiring more of the purchase process to be handled online, compared to results from a similar survey taken in mid-2020 of consumers who had purchased vehicles during the pandemic lockdown.""We have seen that COVID-19 has changed consumer behavior. The key is what the lasting changes will be,"" said Treffen White, director of consulting for S&amp;P Global Mobility. ""The dealer network of the past is not necessarily the network the industry will need for the future. Having the right digital tools will be more important than the size or appearance of the showroom. And this will impact how OEMs plan their physical locations for dealerships.""This runs counter to the long-standing dealership inventory model that contends that Americans want to walk into a showroom and buy a vehicle straight from the dealer's lot that day. It also represents a clear shift in consumer preferences that highlights the retail transformation happening on a digital level.The S&amp;P Global survey showed that 70% of US customers were willing to select a dealership further away from their homes because the retailer allowed for more online purchase/comparison options ­– female shoppers especially so. Up 8 percentage points from pre-COVID, 60% of customers now expect their next vehicle purchase to be completed entirely online.Story continues""During their next vehicle purchase, two-thirds of people expect to complete some part of the process online, specifically paperwork,"" White said. ""Unfortunately, consumer pessimism regarding the retailing process remains intact. Post-COVID, more people also expect their next vehicle purchase process to become more difficult.""The top areas of vehicle transactions customers wish to conduct online are negotiating vehicle price, F&amp;I paperwork, arranging test drives, and negotiating trade ins, according to the research.That transformation aside, 82% of car buyers still want to test drive a representative model of their planned vehicle purchase before putting down their deposits – nearly identical to the 84% who had the same preference prior to the pandemic. What has changed, however, is how many car shoppers want the test drive to occur with the vehicle delivered to their home or office, instead of at the dealership. The number of home-delivery test drives has doubled between pre- and post-COVID, according to the survey. And while the desire for a test drive remains strong across all cohorts, younger customers are more likely to want one. Males were more likely to participate in in-dealership test drives, while females were more likely to participate in alternative test drive options such as home-delivery, virtual reality, or experience center test drives rather than in-dealership test drives.""There is a direct correlation between loyalty and inventory. Now that inventories are returning, there is an opportunity for OEMs and dealers to gain share,"" White said. ""Dealers embracing new digital processes will be on the leading edge of consumer sentiment for buying their next car, and this will drive loyalty accordingly.""The 1,450 respondents of this most recent survey were split between 1,000 new-car buyers and 450 used-car buyers in the US over the preceding 12 months. S&amp;P Global Mobility also conducted simultaneous surveys of car buyers in China, the United Kingdom, Spain, Germany, Italy, and France.About S&amp;P Global MobilityAt S&amp;P Global Mobility, we provide invaluable insights derived from unmatched automotive data, enabling our customers to anticipate change and make decisions with conviction.

""But never ever underestimate the U.S. consumer, that is an import investment rule. Let's see a few more months (of data).""In the currency markets, the yen rose 0.7% to 127.95 per dollar, unwinding some of its drop the previous day when, to the surprise of markets, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) stuck firmly to its approach of ultra-low interest rates.The BOJ has pursued super-easy policy settings for decades in an attempt to generate inflation and growth, but there are doubts it can keep that up, and traders have been selling Japanese government bonds and buying yen to bet on a shift.Story continues""There's an intense amount of speculation in the market that now that the January (BOJ) meeting has happened without any changes ... that we'll see something in March,"" said Shafali Sachdev, head of FX, fixed income and commodities in Asia at BNP Paribas Wealth Management in Singapore.April was another possibility, she added, since by then the BOJ would have a new governor. ""My guess would be that more speculators would look to build positions going into these meetings.""Speculators did, however, give some respite to the BOJ in the bond market. After four days of huge BOJ spending to reel 10-year yields back inside the target band of 0.5% either side of zero, the yield held at 0.41% on Thursday.RECESSION RISKIn Europe, there was plenty going on too.European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde pushed up euro zone bond yields slightly by telling the World Economic Forum's Davos gathering that the bank would stay the course with rate hikes.Minutes from last month's ECB meeting were also due shortly, although Dutch ECB policymaker Klaas Knot, a noted hawk, had also been out saying markets should take more seriously guidance of rates rising in multiples of 50 basis points.Norway's crown had ticked higher as its central bank kept its interest rates at 2.75%, but said they were likely to go up in March, while the New Zealand dollar was down more than 1% after the surprise resignation of Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's who said she had ""no more in the tank"".S&amp;P 500 futures were down 0.75% as the U.S. open approached and close to breaking below the 50-day moving average.On Wednesday, the S&amp;P 500 had lost 1.6% after data showed U.S. manufacturing output had slumped last month and retail sales had fallen by the most in a year.Microsoft's announcement of 10,000 layoffs and hawkish comments from Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard added to the gloom, with both monetary officials expecting U.S. interest rates above 5% this year.Fed officials Lael Brainard and John Williams were due to make public appearances later. Netflix, American Airlines and Procter &amp; Gamble were reporting results, while housing starts numbers, weekly jobless claims and the Philadelphia Fed's Manufacturing Survey will provide more colour on the U.S. economy's health.""The decline in retail spending and industrial production adds to the theme of the economy slowing and heading into recession in 2023, and pushes back on the soft-landing narrative dominating markets since January,"" said National Australia Bank's head of market economics, Tapas Strickland.The dollar slipped into the red after its overnight rise as New York trading loomed. The Australian dollar was still down 0.75% after data showed anunexpected fallin Australian employment last month, but the ECB's talkers had lifted the euro back into positive territory at $1.0822.(Reporting by Marc Jones; editing by John Stonestreet and Alex Richardson)]"

    Wednesday, Jan. 18, 2023Apple's decision to design its own components could mean better designs and salesApple (AAPL) on Tuesday debuted its latest MacBook Pro and Mac mini line of computers. And while the systems look similar to their predecessors on the outside, it’s what inside that counts. Both the Pro and mini come equipped with Apple’s latest version of its M2 chip: the M2 Pro. The MacBook Pro also gets access to Apple’s high-powered M2 Max.The move is just the latest in Apple’s quest to own and develop everything that goes into its products from the bottom up. It’s also reportedly working on its own modem, a chip that combines Wi-Fi and Bluetooth modem capabilities, and its own display technology, according to Bloomberg.All of this is part of Apple’s larger strategy of bringing more of its technology under its own roof rather than relying on contract partners like Intel (INTC), Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (AVGO), and Samsung. While ditching pricey contracts with other tech companies is sure to save Apple some cash, the effort is about more than that.Apple's M2 Max promises better performance and battery life. (Image: Apple)By designing everything on its own, the world’s richest company can control everything from the looks to the functionality of the devices it sells. That might matter more than cutting its expenses.“This is a smart strategic poker strategy by Apple and [CEO Tim] Cook,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance. “Apple is beating Intel at its own game on the chip front and this innovation is significantly underestimated by the Street.”Improved performance and better designs could win more market shareApple’s latest computers promise better performance and battery life than their predecessors running either Intel’s chips or Apple’s own M1 chips. In fact, the company claims a MacBook Pro outfitted with Apple’s M2 Pro can get as much as 22 hours of battery life on a single charge. That’s an absolutely wild claim and one that, if true, would make the MacBook Pro one of the longest-lasting laptops around.Story continuesAnd that’s exactly the kind of performance enhancement that could give Apple’s market share a boost in the long run. Simply put, with better overall capabilities, Apple’s hardware will be far more appealing to consumers than comparable Windows-based laptops and desktops.Apple's latest MacBook Pro comes with either an M2 Pro or M2 Max chip. (Image: Apple)According to market research firm Gartner, in Q4 2022, Apple’s Mac line of desktops and laptops made up just 10.7% of the global market. That’s below the likes of Dell at 16.7%, HP at 20.2%, and Lenovo at 24%. While 10.7% is the highest market share Apple has held in Q4 in the last three years, the company is still far from a dominant force in the laptop and desktop space.By improving its chips, and further differentiating what it can do relative to Windows PCs, however, Apple can claim more of the PC market for itself, even at a time when PC sales are falling.“The beauty of the Apple model is that they'll continue to make their chips faster than any other hardware company, selling the benefits of speed for decades to come,” Gene Munster, managing partner at Loup Ventures, wrote in an analyst note.“When it comes to retaining customers and growing Mac revenue, speed is the gift that keeps giving.”Screens and design changesOf course, there’s more to owning its own chip and component designs than performance increases. Apple’s move to control things like its display technology will give the iPhone maker even more of a say over the look and feel of everything from its Apple Watch to its smartphones.According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple is working on its own microLED display technology for its upcoming Apple Watch, with plans to eventually bring the feature to its iPhone. MicroLED tech promises the same deep blacks and vibrant colors found on OLED screens, with the brightness of standard LCD panels. With the new panel, Apple could further hone the Apple Watch’s, and eventually the iPhone’s, design to its liking without being at the mercy of third-party partners.Outside of design, bringing more aspects of its product line in-house gives Apple the ability to update its devices more frequently.Apple’s Intel-based Macs were known for languishing without receiving upgrades for years at a time. But with its M-series chips, Apple is breathing fresh life into its laptops and desktops on a regular basis, giving consumers a reason to make the jump to a new Mac or MacBook more often.Then there’s the supply chain aspect of Apple’s plan. No, the company isn’t going to physically build the chips and displays that will eventually work their way into their devices. So its supply chain will continue to have some weak points as we saw this year when workers at iPhone builder Foxconn’s plants in China.But by reducing the complexity of its supply chain by taking over even one piece of the overall product development, Apple can head off future slowdowns in its manufacturing process.Apple is still far away from designing every aspect of its devices. And it’s already had to contend with hiccups in developing its own chips. It was initially expected to put its own modems into its 2023 iPhone, but had to lean on Qualcomm for another year for the chips.But as the company further streamlines its design and production processes, expect to see not only a boost to its bottom line but the potential for all new features and designs that would otherwise be impossible for the iPhone maker.Now we’ll just have to wait to see how and when those changes become a reality.By Daniel Howley, tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Qualcomm (QCOM).Qualcomm currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.78, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 16 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.78 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 16 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 10 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 62.5% and 6.3% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for QCOMBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for QCOMCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Qualcomm here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Qualcomm, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is QCOM a Good Investment?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Qualcomm, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 1.2% over the past month to $10.14.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Qualcomm. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for Qualcomm with a grain of salt.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this chipmaker have returned +7.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.8% change. The Zacks Wireless Equipment industry, to which Qualcomm belongs, has gained 4.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Qualcomm is expected to post earnings of $2.35 per share, indicating a change of -27.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $10.14 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -19.1%. This estimate has changed -1.2% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.95 indicates a change of +17.9% from what Qualcomm is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.8%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Qualcomm is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for QCOM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Qualcomm, the consensus sales estimate of $9.59 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -10.4%. The $39.94 billion and $45.61 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -9.7% and +14.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryQualcomm reported revenues of $11.4 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.1%. EPS of $3.13 for the same period compares with $2.55 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.38 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.13%. The EPS surprise was +0.32%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Qualcomm is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Qualcomm. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

About 83 minutes after liftoff, U.S. Space Force and Lockheed Martin engineers at the company's Denver Launch &amp; Checkout Operations Center confirmed signal acuistion of GPS III SV06 and now have the space vehicle ""flying"" under their control.GPS III SV06 is the 25th Military-Code satellite introduced to the constellation. The satellite will provide advanced technology to aide Space Force operators in their mission by providing positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) data to military and civil users worldwide.""Lockheed Martin is incredibly proud to support the Space Force's GPS team as it continues to add world-class capabilities that underpin U.S. national security with enhanced performance and accuracy,"" said Andre Trotter, Lockheed Martin vice president for Navigation Systems. ""With the last GPS III satellite complete and ready to launch, production of the first GPS IIIF vehicle is underway.""GPS is a satellite-based radio navigation system that delivers the gold standard in PNT services to America's military, U.S. allies and civil users. The satellites serve as a crucial technological foundation for internet, financial, transportation and agricultural operations, with more than 4 billion users depending on the PNT signals.GPS III vehicles provide three times greater accuracy and eight times greater anti-jamming capability over existing satellites in the constellation. To better address mission needs and emerging threats, Lockheed Martin intentionally created GPS III with a modular design, allowing new technology and capabilities to be added in the future.Story continuesLockheed Martin has completed production on its original GPS III SV1-10 contract, with the Space Force declaring SV10 Available for Launch on Dec. 8, 2022. GPS III SV06 will soon join SV01-05 in orbit. GPS III SV07-10 are completed and in storage at the company's facility waiting for the U.S. Space Force to call them up for launch.Lockheed Martin is also designing and building the GPS III Follow On (GPS IIIF) for the Space Force, which will feature even more innovative capabilities than its predecessors. GPS IIIF satellites will feature an accuracy-enhancing laser retroreflector array, a new search and rescue payload, a fully digital navigation payload and more next-generation technology. In November 2022, Space Systems Command announced it exercised the third production option valued at approximately $744 million for the procurement of three additional GPS IIIF satellites from Lockheed Martin, meaning the company is now contracted to build SV11-20.For additional GPS information, photos and video visit: www.lockheedmartin.com/gps.About Lockheed MartinHeadquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, Lockheed Martin Corporation is a global security and aerospace company that employs approximately 114,000 people worldwide and is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services.Please follow @LMNews on Twitter for the latest announcements and news across the corporation, and @LMSpace to learn more about the latest technologies, missions and people driving the future of space.Lockheed Martin Logo.

At this time last year, it was reading 83.NAHB Chair Jerry Konter, who is a developer in Savannah, Georgia, said in a press release that many home builders continue to use incentives such as price reductions to improve sales.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Dividend Stocks To Buy and Hold. Despite a slowing economy, investors remain confident in dividend growth to cushion their portfolios from financial blows in terms of eroding share prices. Alec Young, chief investment strategist at MAPsignals, told BNN Bloomberg in the beginning of January 2023 that dividend stocks are not only a source of passive income in a volatile environment, but these equities have also contributed about 40% to the overall performance of the US stock market. He noted that data suggests dividend stocks are the best performers during periods of peak inflation, which is the current case for the United States, with CPI inflation between 6% and 7%. Dividend stocks outperform non-dividend payers by a significant margin in times of economic turbulence, as per Young. Similarly, Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFi, anticipates dividend ETFs to be favored this year. He appreciates the Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index Fund (NYSE:VYM), which has companies with above-average dividend yields and provides exposure to defensive sectors. For tech exposure, Rosenbluth recommends the ALPS Sector Dividend Dogs ETF (NYSE:SDOG), a fund that has the five highest-yielding S&amp;P 500 stocks across 10 sectors, with equal weight holdings. For more insights into dividend equities, investors can also check out 11 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats to Buy, 12 Cheap Monthly Dividend Stocks To Buy, and 11 Best Dividend Stocks Yielding Over 6%.

We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.”12. Walmart Inc.

Its dividend yield is 0.8%. Earnings over the next 3-5 years are forecasted to grow at ~10%. The current P/E multiple is a very pricey 34x for such growth rate. Now, Costco is an outstanding business with consistent profits and cash flows. However, the price that you pay is important (and you tend to pay a very high price for a “cheery consensus”) and if the earnings multiple comes down to say 30x, you internal rate of return (IRR) over the next 4-5 years will be around 6-7% from holding Costco’s stock. It's a decent market-like return, but nothing to be excited about (only a few percentage points over risk-free rate).”10. Broadcom Inc.

Given outsized key product risk (patent cliff and generic launches beginning in 2023), AbbVie has broadened its pipeline, highlighted by its Allergan acquisition. Shares fell on results that missed consensus and indications that legacy franchises were outperforming newer product launches, calling into question AbbVie’s long-term strategy. With promising assets in the pipeline and its robust cash flow profile, we believe AbbVie will grow well into the future.”6.

The downdraft in the market during the quarter led to a pile-on. We are being patient with our investment in Medtronic because the company continues to be a strong free cash flow generator and is attractively priced, with a FCF yield of 5% on trailing one-year numbers and a dividend yield of 3%. Medtronic is under new management that is focused on growing the company’s top line, reinvesting in R&amp;D, returning cash to shareholders and growing operating profits. We like new management’s strategy and believe new product launches, increased surgery visits, sound M&amp;A transactions and a shareholder returns focus, should reinvigorate the business.

The collective value of stakes owned by these hedge funds is over $4 billion.Third Point mentioned Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) in its recently-published Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)11. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59An American multinational beverage company, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is another one of the best dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds.

Berkshire Hathaway owned the largest stake in the company, worth over $22.4 billion.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”10. The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) is an Ohio-based manufacturing company that specializes in paint and coating materials.

These stakes have a consolidated value of over $2.8 billion.ClearBridge Investments mentioned The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“The third strategy is buying growth companies with idiosyncratic or stock-specific catalysts unrelated to the direction of the market like The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW). The stock is an example of a company we categorize in our cyclical bucket that should experience a step change in earnings over the medium to long term with solid execution and its ability to pass through price increases. While relative performance has been challenged by binary decisions around a handful of mega cap technology stocks, we’re entering a lower-growth period in which we’ve historically delivered strong relative results from our balanced approach.”9. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is an American multinational energy company, based in California.

(NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is an American multinational retail corporation.

(NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”7. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is an American manufacturer and marketer of consumer goods and other personal care and hygiene products.

Among these hedge funds, Bridgewater Associates was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”6. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is a popular dividend stock among hedge funds, as 72 funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in the company in Q3 2022, compared with 65 in the previous quarter. These stakes are valued at over $4.8 billion collectively.PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) holds a 50-year track record of consistent dividend growth. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.15 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.61%, as recorded on January 18. The company can be added to dividend portfolios alongside dividend stocks like Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV).JPMorgan gave a positive outlook to the consumer companies heading into 2023 and raised its price target on PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) to $150 with a Neutral rating on the shares.Lindsell Train mentioned PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“At this point, it may help to give a further example of these self-reinforcing moats to illustrate the idea, drawing from the consumer franchises side of our portfolio. In our view, strong consumer brands can similarly exhibit Lindycompatible anti-ageing properties. Consider, that the longer a company invests in its brands through advertising and R&amp;D, the stronger and more resonant they may get. When successful, a self-sustaining feedback loop is established, whereby it becomes ever harder to recreate a heritage-rich brand from scratch, raising barriers to entry, and proportionately increasing its likely lifespan. There are plenty of long-lived portfolio franchises I could reference here, but I’ve gone with PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP); partly because we have good time-series stats on it (beware data bias!) but also, as I hope will become evident, because Pepsi over its 129 years has succeeded in creating some wonderfully deep moats.With Pepsi Cola you get the flagship soft drinks brand, which is both global and generational, but you also get the Frito-Lay salty snacks portfolio assembled alongside it, claiming nearly 40% of the global market. That’s ten-times greater than the nearest competitor and likely higher than the next 65 competitors combined. These are exceptionally strong global bands with market shares to match; the long-term empirical result being Pepsi’s dividend record which over the past 66 years (as far back as we’ve been able to go) has compounded at an annualised rate of 10%. Pepsi is no ‘in at the ground floor’ start-up today, but it wasn’t six decades ago either. Early growth investor Philip Fisher put it well when in 1958 (two years into Pepsi’s current winning streak) he wrote of “companies which in spite of outstanding prospects of major further growth are so financially strong, with roots going so deep into the economic soil, that they qualify under the general classification of ‘institutional stocks’”. PepsiCo fits this description well…” (Click here to see the full text) Click to continue reading and see Dividend Aristocrats Ranked: Top 5 According To Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:13 Best Communication Services Stocks To Invest In12 Best DRIP Stocks To Own12 Best Holding Company Stocks To Invest InDisclosure.

The concept involves an aircraft with extra-long, ultrathin wings stabilized by diagonal struts and higher-aspect ratios that could eventually accommodate advanced propulsion systems.Boeing chief engineer Greg Hyslop said the program ""represents an opportunity to design, build and fly a full-scale experimental plane, while solving novel technical problems.""Single-aisle aircraft account for nearly half of worldwide aviation emissions.

205,8da4d767-4420-3262-a063-953175647a21,TEL,2023-01-19,Analysts Estimate TE Connectivity (TEL) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-te-connectivity-tel-150003845.html,1674054003,STORY,['TEL'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when TE Connectivity (TEL) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 25. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis electronics maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -14.2%.Revenues are expected to be $3.76 billion, down 1.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.51% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for TE Connectivity?For TE Connectivity, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.33%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that TE Connectivity will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that TE Connectivity would post earnings of $1.87 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.88, delivering a surprise of +0.53%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.TE Connectivity doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:NKE) were solid performers in the quarter as some of the doom and gloom narratives around these companies have waned as they both saw strong recent business results. Nike has been dealing with weak demand in China (mostly due to rolling COVID lockdowns) but also a bloated inventory position in North American apparel as well. Supply chain issues caused delays in last year’s inventory shipments. As those were overcome, newer orders came in earlier than expected causing the spike in inventory. On its most recent earnings call, it became clear to us that this inventory spike is a temporary supply issue and narrowly focused in apparel. Demand for Nike products is strong, especially for footwear where nearly every geography grew over 30% in constant currencies in the past quarter. The company expects the inventory issue to be largely behind it in the next two to three quarters and is already seeing inventory levels decline sequentially.”Story continuesnike, store, symbol, logo, clothing, popular, mall, nobody, retail, outlet, corporate, clothes, day, architectural, consumerism, commercial, beijing, outside, chain, fashion,TonyV3112 / Shutterstock.comNIKE, Inc.

A steadily growing direct-to-consumer (DTC) business and the China reopening are some of the key positives in the Nike story.These big-picture positives notwithstanding, the Zacks analyst flagged margin pressures due to higher costs and bigger markdowns. The company provided a bleak view for fiscal 2023 and second-quarter driven by expectations of higher markdowns during the holiday season and slowed demand for NIKE's brands, including Jordan and Converse, due to reduced discretionary spending.The Zacks analyst believes that the gross margin headwinds and the weakness in Greater China to continue hurting NIKE results in the quarters ahead.However, NKE's robust surprise trend continued in the fiscal first quarter with earnings and sales surpassing estimates for the ninth and fourth straight quarter, respectively.(You can read the full research report on NIKE here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Novartis have gained +0.6% over the past year against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry's gain of +14.6%.

Dominion is seeking $1.6 billion in damages.Murdoch, 91, is the most high-profile figure to face questioning in the case.Fox has argued that it had a right to report on election-fraud allegations made by Trump and his lawyers, and that Dominion’s lawsuit would stifle press freedom. Fox declined to comment on the litigation and referred Reuters to an earlier statement: “There is nothing more newsworthy than covering the president of the United States and his lawyers making allegations of voter fraud.""A judge rejected the network’s bid to toss the case in December 2021. ""From the highest levels down, Fox knowingly spread lies about Dominion,"" the election machine company said in a statement.Murdoch is expected to be questioned in person in Los Angeles on Thursday and Friday by lawyers for Dominion, according to a filing in Delaware Superior Court. The session will be closed to the public. Murdoch’s deposition had previously been scheduled for Dec. 13 and Dec. 14, 2022.Dominion has also sought communications from Murdoch, his son Lachlan Murdoch and other Fox News personnel, as it seeks to prove that the network either knew the statements it aired were false or recklessly disregarded their accuracy. That is the standard of “actual malice,” which public figures must prove to prevail in defamation cases.Doug Mirell, a defamation lawyer who has followed the litigation, said he believes Dominion has an ""air-tight"" case for actual malice because Fox hosts pressed forward with vote-rigging allegations ""well after it was quite clear that these claims were demonstrably false.""Dominion alleged in its March 2021 lawsuit that Fox amplified the false theories to boost its ratings and stay abreast of hard-right competitors including One America News Network, which Dominion is also suing. The complaint cited instances in which Trump allies like Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell appeared on Fox News and falsely claimed Dominion software may have manipulated vote counts in favor of Biden. A five-week trial in the case is scheduled to begin on April 17. (Reporting by Helen Coster and Jack Queen in New York Editing by Noeleen Walder and Matthew Lewis)]"

Many, including us, were hopeful that growth would begin to reaccelerate in 4Q’22 (there were signs of this in 3Q’22), but both companies gave cautious guidance for the holiday quarter as consumer spending came under pressure. That said, we see both companies growing earnings above normal in 2023, even if a recession occurs. According to our research, both companies should see a return to more normal revenue growth as comparisons ease and both companies also undergo significant cost reduction plans, which should allow for strong incremental profit margins. Amazon, in particular, should see a very sharp rebound in margins.""Story continuesImage by mohamed Hassan from PixabayPayPal Holdings, Inc.

The company is on track with increased investments toward core brands and innovations. Strength across its Coors Light and Miller Lite brands, as well as its beyond-beer approach, bodes well.Molson Coors reported a top-line beat in the third quarter of 2022, driven by the continued benefit from a favorable sales mix and improved pricing trends across regions. Sales also improved year over year. On a constant-currency basis, net sales rose 7.9%. Net sales per hectoliter increased 9.2% on a brand-volume basis.However, consumer inflationary pressures, a strike at its Quebec brewery and the cycling of a solid shipment in the prior-year quarter hurt the company’s results. Consequently, its adjusted earnings per share declined 24.6% year over year and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Despite the odds, shares of Molson Coors have gained 0.3% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 6.5%. The stock’s performance also compared favorably against the Consumer Staples sector’s fall of 3.5% and the S&amp;P 500’s decline of 13.2% in the same period.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s current financial year’s sales suggests growth of 4.3% from the year-ago period’s reported number, while earnings estimates indicate a decline of 7%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Molson Coors’ Strategies on TrackMolson Coors is witnessing significant benefits from its revitalization plan focused on achieving sustainable top-line growth by streamlining the organization and reinvesting resources into its brands and capabilities. It intends to invest in iconic brands and growth opportunities in the above-premium beer space; expand in adjacencies and beyond beer, without hampering the support for its existing large brands; and create digital competencies for commercial functions, supply-chain-related system capabilities and employees.To facilitate these investments, TAP plans to generate savings of $150 million by simplifying its structure. It is also building on the strength of its iconic core brands. Additionally, the company’s cost-savings program, announced in 2020, targets delivering cost savings of $600 million over three years.Molson Coors is also committed to growing its market share through innovation and premiumization. With a view to accelerating portfolio premiumization, the company has been aggressively growing its above-premium portfolio in the past few years.The company highlighted that it is making efforts to change the shape of its product portfolio and expand in growth areas. Its U.S. above-premium portfolio witnessed sales that outpaced its U.S. economy portfolio, driven by rapid growth of its hard seltzers, the successful launch of Simply Spiked Lemonade, and the continued strength in Blue Moon and Peroni’s.Despite the continued uncertainties related to the pandemic, as well as rising cost inflation, management retained the 2022 view. Net sales are projected to grow in the mid-single digits in constant currency. Underlying EBIT is likely to grow year over year in the high-single digits in constant currency. Underlying depreciation and amortization are projected to be $700 million, plus or minus 5%, compared with the $750 million mentioned earlier.Story continuesHeadwinds to AddressMolson Coors has been witnessing lower brand and financial volume. Sluggishness in the America segment, owing to lower Canada shipments and continued impacts of the Québec labor strike, hurt brand volumes in the third quarter. Financial volume was hurt by a soft industry performance in the Americas and the Québec labor strike, as well as the impacts of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and consumer inflationary pressures across Central and Eastern European countries.Inflationary pressures are likely to be other headwinds.

238,0b91386c-2fa5-35ab-91ef-afa5bbb7d0dc,AES,2023-01-19,7 Top-Rated Utility Stocks to Warm Up Your Portfolio,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-top-rated-utility-stocks-110021870.html,1673866821,STORY,"['CWEN-A', 'AESC', 'LNG', 'AEE', 'ATO', 'ET-PD']","[Utility stocks are on the move, so this may be an ideal time to jump into or add to an existing position.Whether you’re an optimist or a pessimist, it would be silly not to account for the possibility that the U.S. is headed into a recession. True, inflation improved in December, which suggests that a recession is anything but a sure thing.Many CEOs surveyed by the Wall Street Journal say they are expecting a recession this year. The World Bank is warning about the possibility of a recession spreading around the globe.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsUtility stocks represent one of the most resistant industries to recessionary pressures because their earnings largely stay consistent, regardless of if the economy is in a boom or bust cycle.So many investors will leap out of growth and value stocks and shift into utilities stocks as a safety net if they feel like the market is going to suffer.It’s a sound strategy, assuming that you’re also picking top-rated utility stocks. That’s where my Portfolio Grader comes in. The Portfolio Grader assigns stocks an “A” through “F” grade based on earning performance, analyst sentiment, dividend history, momentum and qualitative measurements.These are seven top-rated utility stocks that all have an “A” or “B” grade in the Portfolio Grader.CWENClearway Energy$34.32ETEnergy Transfer $12.67LNGCheniere Energy$156.51AEEAmeren Corporation$155.57AEPAmerican Electric Power$94.84ATOAtmos Energy$114.74AESThe ACS Corporation$27.86Clearway Energy (CWEN)the clearway energy (CWEN) logo on a web browser under a magnifying glassSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comClearway Energy (NYSE:CWEN) operates in the solar and wind generation space.It doesn’t give you the massive kind of earnings that an oil and natural gas producer provided in 2022. But as a wind and solar power provider, Clearway has been relatively consistent over the last year. As demand grows for more green energy alternatives, utility stocks like Clearway will be best positioned to profit.Story continuesThe New Jersey-based company is pretty small with a market capitalization of less than $7 billion and revenues in the last quarter of only $340 million. But it’s also pretty affordable, trading at a trailing price-earnings ratio of 7 and a price-book ratio of less than 2. And for income investors, CWEN has an attractive dividend yield of 4.2%.CWEN stock has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Energy Transfer (ET)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comEnergy Transfer (NYSE:ET) is responsible for transporting roughly 30% of crude oil and gas in the U.S., using 120,000 miles of pipelines that stretch across 41 states.Not only that, but the company is continuing to grow. It’s building a Lake Charles LNG export terminal in Louisiana and signed several sale and purchase agreements with liquified natural gas buyers. That should help ET, which is up 37% over the last 12 months, to continue to bring in profits in 2023.Earnings for the third quarter included $22.94 billion in revenue and earnings per share of 35 cents. Analysts were expecting $24.04 billion and EPS of 26 cents making it one of the utility stocks to watch this year.Don’t overlook ET’s generous dividend yield of more than 8%. ET stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Cheniere Energy (LNG)LNG stock: the Cheniere logo displayed on a phoneSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comCheniere Energy (NYSEAMERICAN:LNG) is another LNG stock – that’s apparent from the ticker – but there are some distinct differences between it and Energy Transfer.While the latter has much of its operations in the U.S., Cheniere is making serious money in Europe. The company shipped 70% of its production to European customers during 2022 as Moscow cut Europe off from Russian gas in retaliation for the West imposing sanctions to punish Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Energy supplies could get even tighter this year as China begins reopening from its Covid lockdowns. Should the Chinese economy shift back into high gear, you can expect energy prices to also increase – and so would Cheniere’s profits.LNG stock gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Ameren Corporation (AEE)Production operator communicate between central control room by using radio to operate ball valve at offshore oil and gas processing platform for control gases and liquid crude oil process. Energy Stocks. CEI stockSource: Oil and Gas Photographer / Shutterstock.comAmeren Corporation (NYSE:AEE) is a gas and electric delivery company with operations in Illinois and Missouri. It provides service to 2.4 million electric customers and 900,000 natural gas customers.Ameren doesn’t provide amazing returns – the stock is relatively flat over the last year, although its shown a nice 15% return since October as recessionary fears realty took hold in the market.Even so, there’s plenty to like here. The forward price-earnings ratio of 20 is reasonable, as well as the price-book ratio of 2.2.Cautious investors will also appreciate that AEE stock has a beta of 0.5, which means that the stock will move slower than the market – that will give you plenty of time to make an adjustment should the market tumble more than you expect.Earnings in the third quarter included revenue of $2.22 billion, which was a 28.5% increase from a year ago. Ameren also beat analysts’ expectations of $1.89 billion in revenue, and beat EPS expectations by a penny by reporting $1.74 per share. This is definitely one of the utility stocks worth putting on your watch list.AEE stock has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.American Electric Power (AEP)the American Electric Power logo is magnified on a websiteSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comAmerican Electric Power (NYSE:AEP) is another flavor of utility stock. AEP stock will get you exposure to 11 states stretching from West Virginia to Texas. AEP has 5.5 million customers, and its transmission network of 40,000 miles is the largest in the nation.AEP has had much the up-and-down year – the stock chart is very similar to Ameren’s. But its return over the last 12 months is a strong 8%, and that includes a gain of 16% since October.AEP is also fairly priced with a forward P/E of 18.2 and a P/B ratio of just 2. And you can’t forget the dividend yield of 3.4% as an added bonus.AEP stock probably won’t increase too much in the next year – the consensus price target is only 8% higher than the current stock price. But if you’re worried about a sharp economic downturn, American Electric Power can keep your money warm. This surly is one of the utility stocks to buy now.AEP stock has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Atmos Energy (ATO)Large tanker ship carrying natural gas at dusk in harborSource: shutterstock.com/Wojciech WrzesienBased in Dallas, Atmos Energy (NYSE:ATO) specializes in natural gas delivery. It’s the nation’s largest natural gas-only distributor, serving 3 million customers in eight states, stretching from Virginia to Colorado.The stock is up 11% in the last year, but I’m most struck by the company’s resilience in the face of adversity. Shortly after the Christmas holiday, Atmos asked its customers in Texas to curb natural gas usage during a winter freeze. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott ordered an investigation of the company, and the stock price took a 5% hit.But since then, smart investors realized that ATO stock was on sale and the stock made up – and then some – all the gains it lost over the Christmas holiday.Atmos stock is well priced with a price-earnings ratio of 19 and a beta of 0.6. It has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.The AES Corporation (AES)Numerous electric lines are seen at sunset.Source: Pand P Studio / Shutterstock.comIf you’re looking for a utility stock with global reach, then The ACS Corporation (NYSE:AES) is the stock for you. AES is based in Virginia, but generates and distributes power in 15 countries.In the U.S., its major subsidiaries are AES Ohio and AES Indiana. It also has properties in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, the U.K., Bulgaria, the Netherlands, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Vietnam and the Philippines.In December, AES and Air Products (NYSE:APD) announced a $4 billion joint venture to build a hydrogen plant, using solar and wind power to manufacture the hydrogen plant in Texas.IT would be the largest facility in the U.S. powered by wind and solar. The planned construction takes advantage of a law passed in the U.S, last year that makes tax incentives available for clean-power projects.That should keep the money flowing through AES’s coffers. The company reported beats on both top and bottom lines in the third quarter, with revenue of $3.63 billion and EPS of 63 cents beating expectations of $3.05 billion and EPS of 53 cents.AES stock has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.On the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in LNG.

The latest filing signals an escalation in the dispute as workers accuse GM's India unit and its executives, including CEO Mary Barra, of failing to follow court orders.In a filing to the High Court of Bombay dated Jan 16, the General Motors Employees Union of 1,086 factory workers states the company has failed to pay them compensatory wages of 50% of their monthly salary starting April last year, as ordered by a local industrial court while it continues to hear the dispute, the documents show.A union leader told Reuters that GM so far owes the workers around 250 million rupees ($3 million) in wages, based on the industrial court's order.A GM spokesperson said the company remains ""very confident"" of its legal position. Adding: ""GM is continuing to explore options for the sale of the (plant) site.""In its earlier court filings, it has said the industrial court acted beyond its power in ordering the compensation. The company has previously said it has tried to settle the issue amicably and has offered workers a generous severance package.The union disagreed, and said GM continues to ""blatantly violate"" the industrial court's order by not paying the workers a single cent.

251,96af501d-f6ae-33ec-8608-db83e4818a10,UAL,2023-01-19,United CEO Says U.S. Airline Industry Unprepared for Post-Pandemic Realities,Skift,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-ceo-says-u-airline-202000278.html,1674073200,STORY,"['UAL', 'DAL']","[United CEO Scott Kirby says other airlines need to acknowledge the industry's post-Covid constraints. Denver International AirportUnited Airlines CEO Scott Kirby came out swinging with a stinging critique of the U.S. aviation system on Wednesday. Despite what he views as profound structural changes during the past four years, other players are in “denial” and failing to accept these changes — to the detriment of travelers and the entire industry.The changes in question are fundamental to running an airline. Staffing tops the list as the U.S. pilot shortage, or captain shortage, continues to plague regional airlines, and everything from maintenance technicians to air traffic controllers remain in short supply. Technology is inadequate and not up to the challenge of the regular disruptions, like weather, that impact the industry. Delays building and delivering new planes at Airbus and Boeing are limits on growth. And, in a nod to investors, costs are permanently higher than they were in 2019.“You can’t run your airline like it’s 2019 or you will fail,” Kirby said during United’s fourth-quarter earnings call. The Chicago-based carrier estimates that it needs 10 percent more pilots and 5 percent more planes than it had in 2019 to operate the same schedule, he added.The U.S. airline industry has been rocked by two large technology-related snafus in recent weeks. The first was the meltdown of Southwest Airlines between Christmas and New Years that resulted in more than 16,700 flight cancellations, and cost the carrier an initial $825 million and an untold amount of customer good will. The second was the outage of a key flight safety communications system due to a corrupted file that prompted the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to halt all flight departures nationwide for nearly two hours earlier in January.Kirby did not name Southwest in his comments but repeatedly referred to “competitors” that were in “denial” over the structural changes to the industry. He did reference the FAA, and its air traffic control organization, saying they needed additional investment in both technology and staff.Story continuesDelta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian also called for additional FAA funding following the nationwide ground stop.The net result of Kirby’s critical outlook for the U.S. industry is that airline capacity will be hamstrung for an extended period of time. Rosy capacity forecasts by individual carriers will prove overly optimistic — as they were in 2022 — this year and in the future; and even when capacity has recovered to pre-pandemic levels, growth will be slower than before. That will mean higher airfares for travelers, especially as more corporate traffic returns and U.S. travel demand exceeds 2019 levels, which it is expected to this year.“We’re near the limit on capacity — on flights in the system,” he said.Will United Benefit?United, of course, is well positioned to take advantage of this dire situation in Kirby’s estimation. The airline’s orders for hundreds of new Airbus and Boeing aircraft during the pandemic sets it up well to grow by adding seats rather than flights; in other words, replacing smaller planes with larger ones. And its investments in technology prior to and during the crisis has set it up well to manage through a struggling aviation system.The buffers the carrier has put in place during the past year — that 10 percent more staff and 5 percent more planes than before the pandemic, plus technology upgrades — are serving it well during periods of irregular operations. “Buffers are much less expensive than the cost of the otherwise inevitable operational meltdowns,” Kirby said.United did avoid any of the major disruptions that befell many of its competitors last year. In addition to Southwest’s holiday meltdown, Alaska Airlines, Delta, JetBlue Airways, and Spirit Airlines in the U.S. all faced significant operational issues that grabbed headlines at some point during the year. And all, as a result of their distress, pulled back on their schedules while also making investments in additional staffing and other measures. American Airlines, while it did not grab headlines for operational issues in 2022, did the year before.One could argue this bodes well for United, avoiding meltdowns when it was subject to many of the same weather events and air traffic control issues as its competitors. But one year does not make a trend in the airline industry, which has rarely looked kindly on executives that boast about the so-called superiority of their carrier.For now, United does look set to be a top performer this year. Executives on Wednesday affirmed their forecast of a roughly 9 percent adjusted pre-tax margin in 2023; it posted an adjusted pre-tax margin of 9.4 percent in 2019. Revenues and capacity are expected to grow in the “high teens” percentage range year-over-year. And costs per available seat mile (CASM) — a measure of how much it costs an airline to transport a passenger one mile — excluding fuel, which as Kirby said remain higher than pre-pandemic across the industry, are forecast flat compared to 2022.International BenefitUnited’s leading international network among the U.S. Big Three is proving a big asset for the airline in the recovery. Chief commercial officer Andrew Nocella said international travel demand is “incredibly strong,” with the segment on track for “record” profitability in 2023. The airline plans to fly 10-11 percent more capacity across the Atlantic this summer than it did last year; Latin America is performing the “best” Nocella has ever seen; and Asia-Pacific travel is forecast to come back in a meaningful way led by strong demand in Australia and South Korea.“The setup for our global network is, I think, unbelievably good,” he said. “It’s really a very simple math — there’s very little capacity growth out there and a lot of GDP.”In 2022, United flew 17 percent more international capacity than its closest U.S. competitor — American — according to Diio by Cirium schedules. That gap is only scheduled to expand in the first six months of this year with United flying 37 percent more international capacity than Delta, and 43 percent more than American.Of course international can be a double-edged sword, as United has learned in the past. If the European economy takes a deeper turn for the worst than is forecast, United could be flying a lot of empty planes — or selling a lot of seats at a loss to fill said planes — across the Atlantic, while its competitors would post smaller losses on less exposure to the market. The same is true for Asia and Latin America.China, which reopened its borders to the world on January 8, does not yet appear to be a big air travel story of 2023. Nocella acknowledged that flights remain constrained by Covid-era restrictions that limit United to just four weekly flights; it operated up to 11 daily flights prior to the pandemic. And even if travel demand rebounds quickly, the airline does not have the “green light to go beyond what we’re currently flying.”And in Japan, another market that recently reopened to visitors, local ticket sales remain slow, Nocella said. This has United taking a measured approach to restoring its schedule to the country, which was once one of its largest destinations in Asia.Trade group Airlines for America (A4A) on Tuesday asked the Department of Transportation to grant U.S. airlines waivers for their flight rights to both China and Tokyo’s Haneda airport through October. The organization, which represents American, Delta, United, and others in Washington, D.C., cited an uncertain demand outlook in both markets for the request.And the NumbersUnited made a $1.4 billion operating profit on $12.4 billion in revenues in the fourth quarter. Its net result was $843 million. Compared to 2019, revenues were up nearly 14 percent. Key unit revenue and cost metrics, total revenues per available seat mile (TRASM) and CASM excluding fuel, were up 25.8 and 11.2 percent, respectively, compared to three years earlier. The airline flew 9.5 percent less capacity.For the full year, United made a $2.3 billion operating profit on nearly $45 billion in revenues; the latter a 4 percent increase compared to 2019. Its net result was $737 million. Total unit revenues and unit costs excluding fuel increased 19.5 and 14.9 percent, respectively, year-over-three-years. The carrier flew 14 percent less capacity.Looking ahead, United forecasts a roughly 3 percent pre-tax margin on a 50 percent year-over-year jump in revenues in the first quarter. It plans to fly roughly 20 percent more capacity, which would still represent an about 2.5 percent decrease compared to 2019. Total unit revenues are expected to increase roughly a quarter year-over-year, while unit costs excluding fuel are forecast to decrease 3-4 percent.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

AA, Discover Financial Services DFS, and Kinder Morgan Inc. KMI.So far, there have been several companies stealing the spotlight in earnings season so far, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing TSM, United Air Lines UAL, and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co JPM.Below is a chart illustrating the year-to-date performance of all three stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s take a closer look at each one.United AirlinesUnited Airlines transports passengers and cargo throughout North America and destinations in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America.The company came out of the gates and reported EPS of $2.46, nearly 19% above our consensus estimate and reflecting a sizable year-over-year change.Price, Consensus, and EPSZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQuarterly revenue was reported at $12.4 billion, roughly 1.4% above expectations and representing a 51% year-over-year increase.Insiders must have known it was shaping up to be a strong quarter; Edward Shapiro, a director, purchased 25,000 UAL shares in December for roughly $1 million.Scott Kirby, CEO, said, “Over the last three years, United has made critical investments in tools, infrastructure and our people – all of which are essential investments in our future. That’s why we’ve got a big head start, and we’re now poised to accelerate in 2023 as our United Next strategy becomes a reality.”Taiwan Semiconductor ManufacturingTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is the world’s largest circuit foundry. Recently, the stock has come under a lot of attention following a purchase from the legendary Warren Buffett.TSM exceeded the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate of $1.80 per share by roughly 1%, reporting EPS of $1.82. Quarterly revenue totaled $19.9 billion, marginally below our consensus estimate and reflecting a sizable 26% year-over-year increase.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, the company provided guidance for Q1 2023; TSM expects revenue in the range of $16.7 billion – $17.5 billion and a gross profit margin between 53.5% and 55.5%.JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.Headquartered in New York, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. is one of the biggest global banks.Many were anxious heading into the big banks’ releases, but JPM managed to exceed expectations; the company posted EPS of $3.57, nearly 15% above our $3.11 per share consensus estimate.The financial titan generated $34.5 billion in revenue, roughly 2% ahead of estimates and reflecting an 18% change from the year-ago quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchJamie Dimon, CEO, said, “Our lines of business performed well in the quarter, and we continued to see momentum in our areas of strategic focus. In Consumer &amp; Community Banking, debit and credit card sales were up 9%, while card loans were up 19% with total revolving balances now back to pre-pandemic levels.He continued, ""In the Corporate &amp; Investment Bank, Markets revenue rose 7% as client activity remained strong in Fixed Income. Global Investment Banking fees were down significantly in a challenging environment, although we maintained our #1 ranking in 2022. Commercial Banking loans were up 14% on new loan originations and higher revolver utilization. And in Asset &amp; Wealth Management, revenue increased 3% as higher net interest income more than offset the impact of lower market levels.”Bottom LineWith earnings season kicking into higher gear, investors are more than ready to face the music and find out how the quarter went.We’ll have a plethora of companies reporting for some time, but all three companies above – Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing TSM, United Air Lines UAL, and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co JPM – have gotten their results out of the way already, positively surprising investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. We'll use ROE to examine Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), by way of a worked example.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for Target How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Target is:31% = US$3.4b ÷ US$11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.31 in profit.Does Target Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Target has a higher ROE than the average (25%) in the Multiline Retail industry.roeThat's what we like to see. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . You can see the 4 risks we have identified for Target by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining Target's Debt And Its 31% Return On EquityTarget clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.51. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.SummaryReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward.

ISRG is well-poised for growth on the increasing adoption of the da Vinci Surgical System and strong global presence. Although the company is facing inflationary headwinds, its improved margins in the third quarter and lower-than-previously-expected operating expense growth are boosting sentiments.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have dropped 10.8% compared with the industry’s decline of 14.1% in the past year. The S&amp;P 500 Index has declined 13.2% in the same period.ISRG — with a market capitalization of $91.49 billion — designs, manufactures and markets the da Vinci Surgical System, and its related instruments and accessories. The da Vinci Surgical System is an advanced robot-assisted surgical system.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company anticipates its earnings to improve 11.9% over the next five years. It beat earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same once, the average earnings surprise being 3.41%.What’s Favoring the Stock?Intuitive Surgical’s robot-based da Vinci Surgical System enables minimally-invasive surgery that reduces the risks associated with open surgery. The company continues to gain from this system, which, in turn, bolsters the overall performance.The company shipped 305 da Vinci Surgical Systems in the quarter, taking the total installed base to 7,364 by the end of third-quarter 2022. This reflected growth of 12.9% year over year. For 2022, the company projects procedure growth of 17-18%.For digital capabilities, ISRG remains focused on improving the ecosystem. On the third-quarter 2022 earnings call, the company stated that the My Intuitive app community continued to increase on a year-over-year basis.The My Intuitive app is currently available in several countries, including Japan, Germany, France, Ireland, Switzerland, the UK, and the United States, with more launches for the upcoming quarters. The app enables surgeons to manage their da Vinci experience, log into da Vinci systems, manage their training and view their operative data from the palm of their hand.Story continuesIntuitive Surgical’s Ion system is also experiencing a strong uptake as its installed base increased to approximately 254 systems in the third quarter, compared with approximately 98 systems in the year-ago period. The system expands the company’s service beyond surgery into diagnostic procedures.Intuitive Surgical’s teams in Israel and the United States have developed the Intuitive Hub with its Orpheus technology. Intuitive Hub — a unified hardware and software solution for the operating room — allows OR teams to capture, edit and share video clips from clinical procedures and partner virtually by utilizing existing workflows and intuitive systems.The Intuitive Hub grew 21% from the third quarter of 2021. Moreover, software updates to the Hub installed base improved usability and enabled telepresence.The FDA clearance earlier this year for integrating mobile cone-beam CT imaging technology with its minimally-invasive, robot-assisted bronchoscopy system, Ion Endoluminal System, is likely to benefit ISRG. The technology will allow the biopsy of small and difficult-to-access lesions in the lung and the peripheral areas and provide the necessary stability for precision in the process.In the third quarter of 2022, outside the United States, revenues totaled $474.4 million, up 5.2% on a year-over-year basis. This was driven by substantial growth in the procedure volume. Outside the United States, Intuitive Surgical placed 130 systems in the third quarter compared with 109 in the prior-year period. Of these, 54 were in Europe, 32 in Japan and 17 in China.Meanwhile, Intuitive Surgical’s gross and adjusted operating margins improved year over year in the third quarter. The expansion buoys optimism. The company now expects its pro-forma operating expense to grow 21-23%, lower than the previous guidance of 23-25%.The company also expects its operating expenses to decline in 2023. A decrease in the expense guidance amid macro headwinds like inflation buoy optimism for the stock. However, intense competition in the global MedTech space is a concern.What’s Weighing on ISRG?The pandemic adversely impacted the global supply of semiconductors and other materials used in Intuitive Surgical’s products. Although the company has been making efforts to secure the supply for fulfilling consumer demand, global shortages might result in higher output costs or delay in production.Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

The positive data sent all three major U.S. indices into the green territory after the opening bell today. However, later in the day, equities paired gains and markets closed in the red.

(V): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-visa-inc-140002631.html,1674050402,STORY,['V'],"[Visa (V) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this global payments processor have returned +8.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, which Visa falls in, has gained 8.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Visa is expected to post earnings of $2 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.28 points to a change of +10.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.50 indicates a change of +14.7% from what Visa is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Visa is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for V _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Visa, the consensus sales estimate of $7.67 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +8.7%. The $31.74 billion and $35.3 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +8.3% and +11.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVisa reported revenues of $7.79 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.7%. EPS of $1.93 for the same period compares with $1.62 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.55 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.12%. The EPS surprise was +3.76%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Visa is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Visa. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Amphenol How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Amphenol is:28% = US$1.9b ÷ US$6.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.28 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Amphenol's Earnings Growth And 28% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Amphenol has an impressive ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 14% the company's ROE is quite impressive. This likely paved the way for the modest 16% net income growth seen by Amphenol over the past five years. growthNext, on comparing Amphenol's net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 18% in the same period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. If you're wondering about Amphenol's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Amphenol Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Amphenol's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 25% (implying that it retains 75% of its income), which is on the lower side, so it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business.Besides, Amphenol has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 26%. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Amphenol's future ROE will be 24% which is again, similar to the current ROE.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with Amphenol's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

""But never ever underestimate the U.S. consumer, that is an import investment rule. Let's see a few more months (of data).""In the currency markets, the yen rose 0.7% to 127.95 per dollar, unwinding some of its drop the previous day when, to the surprise of markets, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) stuck firmly to its approach of ultra-low interest rates.The BOJ has pursued super-easy policy settings for decades in an attempt to generate inflation and growth, but there are doubts it can keep that up, and traders have been selling Japanese government bonds and buying yen to bet on a shift.Story continues""There's an intense amount of speculation in the market that now that the January (BOJ) meeting has happened without any changes ... that we'll see something in March,"" said Shafali Sachdev, head of FX, fixed income and commodities in Asia at BNP Paribas Wealth Management in Singapore.April was another possibility, she added, since by then the BOJ would have a new governor. ""My guess would be that more speculators would look to build positions going into these meetings.""Speculators did, however, give some respite to the BOJ in the bond market. After four days of huge BOJ spending to reel 10-year yields back inside the target band of 0.5% either side of zero, the yield held at 0.41% on Thursday.RECESSION RISKIn Europe, there was plenty going on too.European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde pushed up euro zone bond yields slightly by telling the World Economic Forum's Davos gathering that the bank would stay the course with rate hikes.Minutes from last month's ECB meeting were also due shortly, although Dutch ECB policymaker Klaas Knot, a noted hawk, had also been out saying markets should take more seriously guidance of rates rising in multiples of 50 basis points.Norway's crown had ticked higher as its central bank kept its interest rates at 2.75%, but said they were likely to go up in March, while the New Zealand dollar was down more than 1% after the surprise resignation of Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's who said she had ""no more in the tank"".S&amp;P 500 futures were down 0.75% as the U.S. open approached and close to breaking below the 50-day moving average.On Wednesday, the S&amp;P 500 had lost 1.6% after data showed U.S. manufacturing output had slumped last month and retail sales had fallen by the most in a year.Microsoft's announcement of 10,000 layoffs and hawkish comments from Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard added to the gloom, with both monetary officials expecting U.S. interest rates above 5% this year.Fed officials Lael Brainard and John Williams were due to make public appearances later. Netflix, American Airlines and Procter &amp; Gamble were reporting results, while housing starts numbers, weekly jobless claims and the Philadelphia Fed's Manufacturing Survey will provide more colour on the U.S. economy's health.""The decline in retail spending and industrial production adds to the theme of the economy slowing and heading into recession in 2023, and pushes back on the soft-landing narrative dominating markets since January,"" said National Australia Bank's head of market economics, Tapas Strickland.The dollar slipped into the red after its overnight rise as New York trading loomed. The Australian dollar was still down 0.75% after data showed anunexpected fallin Australian employment last month, but the ECB's talkers had lifted the euro back into positive territory at $1.0822.(Reporting by Marc Jones; editing by John Stonestreet and Alex Richardson)]"

ALGN is set to release fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 1, after the closing bell.The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.36 in the last reported quarter, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 38.5%. The company beat earnings estimates in one of the trailing four quarters and missed on three occasions, the average negative surprise being 10.7%.Let’s look at how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayTotal Clear AlignerAlign Technology is likely to have gained from increasing clear aligners shipments to Invisalign doctors worldwide. In the last reported quarter, the company witnessed increased shipments in Invisalign case volumes across almost all markets — led by Taiwan, Thailand, India and Korea — driven by increased submitters.  Analysts expect this trend to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter, aiding sales growth.Strong potential exists, particularly in the teen segment, with an increase in the number of doctors submitting teen cases in the past few months. Invisalign First for kids has been gaining market share rapidly across all regions. The growing uptake is likely to have sustained, benefiting the company’s top-line growth.During the third quarter, the company commericialized Invisalign innovations for the Align Digital Platform, including the ClinCheck Live Update, Invisalign Practice App, Invisalign Personal Plan, Invisalign Smile Architect, the Invisalign Outcome Simulator Pro with in-face visualization, Cone Beam Computed Tomography with ClinCheck software Invisalign, Virtual AI software and iTero-exocad Connector.As the economies around the world return to normalcy amid COVID-19 concerns, we anticipate Invisalign case volumes to have rebounded across the Americas and international regions. However, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the heightened volatility in foreign exchange rates might have posed hindrances to recovery, hampering business performance in Q4. Staffing shortages and the ongoing inflationary pressure are expected to have dragged the company’s profitability down in Q4.Story continuesOur model shows a 12.8% year-over-year decline in total clear aligner revenues in the fourth quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Clear Aligner revenues is pegged at $721 million, suggesting an 11.5% drop from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Imaging Systems &amp; CAD/CAM Services BusinessAlign Technology is expected to have gained from robust iTero scanner services revenues as it did in the previous quarter. The company has been witnessing continued growth in the iTero scanner installed base. The recent integration of iTero NIRI and intraoral camera images unique to iTero Element 5D imaging systems and exocad Rijeka software release, Align Technology is redefining restorative visualization and treatment planning for doctors and labs.  This growing uptake of iTero scanners and recent development are likely to have sustained, benefiting the company’s top-line growth.The continued rise in intraoral digital scans used for Invisalign case submissions signals an enhanced digital adoption within dental offices. During the third quarter earnings update, the company noted that doctors are affirming the substantial benefits of intraoral scanning and end-to-end digital workflows with the iTero scanner and imaging systems. We anticipate this trend to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter, advancing business performance.Align Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Align Technology, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAlign Technology, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Align Technology, Inc. QuoteThe company’s third-quarter results are likely to benefit from exocad CAD/CAM products and services revenues. During the third quarter, the company introduced iTero NIRI. These offerings, including restorative dentistry, implantology, guided surgery and smile design products, extend the Align Digital Platform toward fully integrated interdisciplinary end-to-end workflows. We expect these products to have contributed to the company’s fourth quarter revenue.Our model projects a 22.1% year-over-year decline in total Imaging Systems &amp; CAD/CAM Services revenues in the fourth quarter. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s revenues is pegged at $183 million, indicating a 15.3% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Q4 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $891.3 million, suggesting a decline of 13.6% from the year-ago reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its fourth-quarter 2022 EPS of $1.54 suggests a 45.58% fall from the year-ago reported figure.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP has higher chance of beating estimates.

MMSI is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, backed by its strong product portfolio. A robust third-quarter 2022 performance, along with its solid international exposure, is expected to contribute further. However, headwinds related to higher consolidation in the healthcare industry and lack of direct sales and marketing capabilities persist.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 25.6% against a 2.7% decline of the industry and a 13.2% decline of the S&amp;P 500.This renowned medical-devices provider has a market capitalization of $4 billion. The company is projected to record 11% growth over the next five years on the back of its continued strong segmental performance. It delivered an earnings surprise of 25.35% for the past four quarters, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strong Product Portfolio: We are upbeat about Merit Medical’s continued gains on the significant momentum of its new products. We are also optimistic about the company’s product pipeline, including radio and electrophysiology products. In November, the company launched two new devices — the basixALPHA Inflation Device and the PreludeSYNC EZ Radial Compression Device — for streamlining angioplasty procedures and optimizing hemostasis for radial artery procedures, respectively.Last year, the company also announced the launch of the SCOUT Mini Reflector, which has been designed for use in soft tissues, such as breast and lymph nodes.International Exposure: We are upbeat about Merit Medical’s current global operations, including its territories in Europe, Africa, Asia, Oceania, Central and South America, Mexico, Canada, and the Middle East. In the third quarter of 2022, Merit Medical confirmed that its international sales (42.7% of net sales) improved 6.1% from the corresponding period of 2021. This included increased sales of 5.7% in APAC operations, 17.4% in Rest of the World operations and 4.7% in EMEA operations.Story continuesStrong Q3 Results: Merit Medical’s robust third-quarter 2022 results buoy optimism. The company also saw solid segmental growth and growth across all product categories within its Cardiovascular unit. Solid product sales and robust performances in the United States and abroad were also witnessed. Strong execution and improving customer demand trends raised the overall top line. Expansion of the adjusted operating margin also bodes well.RiskLack of Direct Sales and Marketing Capabilities: Merit Medical lacks direct sales and marketing capabilities in many countries. The company wholly depends on third-party distributors for the commercialization of products in countries like China, Japan, Russia and India. Per management, because of inefficiencies in the distributor base, Merit Medical often fails to successfully commercialize its products in these countries.Merit Medical Systems, Inc.

TRV estimates fourth-quarter catastrophe loss of about $362 million ($459 million pre-tax). The loss primarily stemmed from the winter storm that impacted much of the United States and Canada in late December.Travelers projects net income to be $819 million or $3.44 per share while core income is expected to be $810 million or $3.40 per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is currently pegged at $4.25 per share, which indicates a decline of 18.3% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. We expect estimates to move south once analysts start incorporating loss estimates into their numbers.TRV stated fourth-quarter results should include underlying underwriting gain of $571 million ($723 million pre-tax, net investment income of $531 million after-tax ($625 million pre-tax), comprising $510 million after-tax ($601 million pre-tax) from the fixed income portfolio and net favorable prior year reserve development of $145 million ($185 million pre-tax).While pricing momentum continued in the fourth quarter, all the business segments witnessed solid net written premium growth. Focus on implementing pricing and other actions should continue increasing returns and more importantly, improving profitability.Being a P&amp;C insurer, Travelers remains exposed to catastrophe loss, rendering substantial volatility to the insurer’s underwriting results. TRV has been witnessing a high level of catastrophe losses with combined ratio deterioration. Catastrophe losses in the first nine months of 2022 were $529 million. The losses in the first nine months of 2022 included the hurricanes Ian and Fiona and severe storms in several regions of the United States.Nonetheless, Travelers has an active catastrophe reinsurance program, which should aid in absorbing losses. It entered into a reinsurance agreement in May 2022, which will provide coverage to the company through May 24, 2026 for certain losses from tropical cyclones, earthquakes, severe thunderstorms or winter storms. For the period from May 25, 2022 through May 24, 2023, the treaty provides up to $575 million part of $700 million coverage, subject to a $2.2 billion retention. From the start of the year through Sep 30, the company accumulated $1.4 billion of qualifying losses for the aggregate retention of $2 billion on the property aggregate catastrophe XOL treaty.Underwriting profit thus jumped 54.2% in the first nine months with combined ratio improving 80 basis points.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) property-casualty underwriter have gained 15.6% in a year, outperforming the industry’s increase of 2%. A compelling product portfolio, high retention rate, pricing gains, positive renewal rate changes, strong capital position, inorganic growth and prudent underwriting practices position Travelers well.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOther Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks from the insurance industry are Root, Inc.

(NYSE:APD) boasts of strong institutional backing",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/85-ownership-air-products-chemicals-140058612.html,1674050458,STORY,['APD'],"[If you want to know who really controls Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 85% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Air Products and Chemicals. See our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Air Products and Chemicals?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Air Products and Chemicals. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Air Products and Chemicals' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Air Products and Chemicals. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.2% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 6.6% of common stock, and State Farm Insurance Companies, Asset Management Arm holds about 5.8% of the company stock.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 22 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Air Products and ChemicalsThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$226m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 15% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Air Products and Chemicals better, we need to consider many other factors.

Dominion is seeking $1.6 billion in damages.Murdoch, 91, is the most high-profile figure to face questioning in the case.Fox has argued that it had a right to report on election-fraud allegations made by Trump and his lawyers, and that Dominion’s lawsuit would stifle press freedom. Fox declined to comment on the litigation and referred Reuters to an earlier statement: “There is nothing more newsworthy than covering the president of the United States and his lawyers making allegations of voter fraud.""A judge rejected the network’s bid to toss the case in December 2021. ""From the highest levels down, Fox knowingly spread lies about Dominion,"" the election machine company said in a statement.Murdoch is expected to be questioned in person in Los Angeles on Thursday and Friday by lawyers for Dominion, according to a filing in Delaware Superior Court. The session will be closed to the public. Murdoch’s deposition had previously been scheduled for Dec. 13 and Dec. 14, 2022.Dominion has also sought communications from Murdoch, his son Lachlan Murdoch and other Fox News personnel, as it seeks to prove that the network either knew the statements it aired were false or recklessly disregarded their accuracy. That is the standard of “actual malice,” which public figures must prove to prevail in defamation cases.Doug Mirell, a defamation lawyer who has followed the litigation, said he believes Dominion has an ""air-tight"" case for actual malice because Fox hosts pressed forward with vote-rigging allegations ""well after it was quite clear that these claims were demonstrably false.""Dominion alleged in its March 2021 lawsuit that Fox amplified the false theories to boost its ratings and stay abreast of hard-right competitors including One America News Network, which Dominion is also suing. The complaint cited instances in which Trump allies like Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell appeared on Fox News and falsely claimed Dominion software may have manipulated vote counts in favor of Biden. A five-week trial in the case is scheduled to begin on April 17. (Reporting by Helen Coster and Jack Queen in New York Editing by Noeleen Walder and Matthew Lewis)]"

296,50d3f955-852c-3af4-b2db-408782b86c85,CMI,2023-01-19,Is Trending Stock Cummins Inc. (CMI) a Buy Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-cummins-inc-cmi-140002299.html,1674050402,STORY,['CMI'],"[Cummins (CMI) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this engine maker have returned +4.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.8% change. The Zacks Automotive - Internal Combustion Engines industry, to which Cummins belongs, has gained 5.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Cummins is expected to post earnings of $4.88 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +71.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.5%.The consensus earnings estimate of $15.48 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +5.5%. This estimate has changed -2.1% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $20.52 indicates a change of +32.5% from what Cummins is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.1%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Cummins is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CMI _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Cummins, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.36 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +25.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $27.66 billion and $31.05 billion estimates indicate +15.2% and +12.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCummins reported revenues of $7.33 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.9%. EPS of $3.21 for the same period compares with $3.61 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.96 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.39%. The EPS surprise was -34.22%.Over the last four quarters, Cummins surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Cummins is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Cummins. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Ron DeSantis, shown addressing a crowd in April, poses as an opponent of discrimination but is actually an opponent of anti-discrimination protections. (Daniel A. Varela / Associated Press)Most children, probably by the age of 10, have learned the lesson that the worst way to placate bullies is to give them what they want.This truism apparently escaped the notice of the National Hockey League, which turned 105 in November. Otherwise, why would the NHL capitulate so cravenly to America's outstanding political bully, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis?The focus of DeSantis' bullying was an NHL job fair that was open, according to a post in the league's LinkedIn page, to ""participants aged 18 or over, based in the US, who identify as female, Black, Asian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic/Latino, Indigenous, LGBTQIA+, and/or a person with a disability.""""Discrimination of any sort is not welcome in the state of Florida.""Bryan Griffin, Ron DeSantis' spokesman, cracking a cynical jokeThe event, which is called the ""Pathway to Hockey Summit,"" is scheduled for Feb. 2 as part of the NHL's All-Star Game festivities in Fort Lauderdale.Bad choice for a venue. Scheduling an event in Florida aimed at connecting with ""diverse job seekers who are pursuing careers in hockey,"" as the NHL put it, was like waving a red cape in front of the Republican DeSantis, who reacts with theatrical revulsion at anything smacking of ""diversity.""Unsurprisingly, DeSantis threw a conniption.“Discrimination of any sort is not welcome in the state of Florida,"" his spokesman declared, ""and we do not abide by the woke notion that discrimination should be overlooked if applied in a politically popular manner or against a politically unpopular demographic.”The spokesman, Bryan Griffin, added that DeSantis called on the NHL “to immediately remove and denounce the discriminatory prohibitions it has imposed on attendance to the 2023 ‘Pathway to Hockey’ summit.”The NHL backed down. The league removed the Linkedin post and issued a sedative statement, calling the Pathway to Hockey Summit merely an ""informational and networking event designed to encourage all individuals to consider a career in our game — and, in particular, alert those who might not be familiar with hockey to the opportunities it offers.""Story continuesSo much for outreach. (The league didn't respond to my request for comment.)A few pertinent observations:First, if DeSantis is implying that the NHL was discriminating against any group not listed in its original invitation — white males, say — he must be out of his mind. It's hard to find a professional sports league anywhere on the globe less diverse than the NHL.A demographic study the league released last year found that its workforce, at league and team level, was 83.6% white, 3.74% Black and 3.71% Latino. Of employees, nearly 62% were male. More than 93% identified as straight or heterosexual, 1.12% as gay and 0.81% as lesbian.Of the league's 32 teams, how many have a Black general manager? One: Mike Grier, hired by the San Jose Sharks last year as the league's very first Black GM.The other major sports leagues had reached that landmark decades earlier: Major League Baseball with Bill Lucas of the Atlanta Braves in 1976 (team owner Ted Turner kept the GM title, but it was Lucas who ran the team); the National Basketball Assn. in 1972 with Wayne Embry of the Milwaukee Bucks; the National Football League in 2002 with Ozzie Newsome of the Baltimore Ravens.The NHL in its diversity report claimed to be ""working diligently to bring about a new era of inclusion, diversity, and equality in hockey,"" including by hiring a full-time recruiting director ""focused on attracting diverse talent to the organization.""The report acknowledged, however, that ""there is much more work to be done.""What's most sickening about the NHL's craven capitulation to DeSantis is that the league is certainly big and rich enough to push back at Florida's little tin-pot dictator. It could have stood its ground, explaining to the public its goal of diversity, maintaining the character of its outreach event and daring DeSantis to do something about it.DeSantis might make some noise, but it's unlikely that he would have any legal grounds to block the Ft. Lauderdale event or punish the NHL. So the league's supine response to DeSantis' power play (so to speak) only encourages him to swank around more as the GOP's culture-warrior-in-chief.Perhaps the league figured that challenging DeSantis was more trouble than it's worth. But the seriousness of its diversity program is now cast in doubt because it backed away from a loudmouthed bully; that's the price of giving in. And if the NHL thinks it's made a friend of DeSantis, it should think again. Bullies don't care about having friends, just targets.Turning to the assertion by Griffin, DeSantis' mouthpiece, that ""discrimination of any sort is not welcome in the state of Florida,"" one can only assume that this is some sort of cynical joke.DeSantis declared in his second inaugural speech on Jan. 3 that ""Florida is where woke goes to die.” In actuality, Florida is where anti-discrimination initiatives go to die.Chief among them are initiatives aimed at protecting the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals. Last year, DeSantis' education commissioner, Manny Diaz Jr., instructed local school officials that they were free to ignore federal guidance barring discrimination in school programs based on gender identity.""Nothing in these guidance documents requires you to give biological males who identify as female access to female bathrooms, locker rooms, or dorms; to assign biological males who identify as female to female rooms on school field trips; or to allow biological males who identify as female to compete on female sports teams,” Diaz wrote.In 2021, DeSantis signed a law banning transgender girls and women in public secondary schools and colleges from participating on girls’ and women’s sports teams. Last year, Florida's Medicaid program ceased covering most gender-affirming care.Then there's the notorious ""Don't Say Gay"" law (formally the ""Parental Rights in Education Law"") which DeSantis signed to great fanfare last year.The law prohibits classroom instruction on gender identity and sexuality for students in kindergarten through third grade and forbids instruction that isn't ""age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate"" for older pupils.Those terms are undefined, which creates a chilling effect on schools and teachers, because parents are empowered to sue over their grievances and teachers could be subject to the revocation of their teaching certificates.The Human Rights Campaign, an anti-discrimination watchdog, called the law ""a shameful attack on students already struggling with the weight of discrimination"" and ""a slapdash, mean-spirited, impossible-to-comply-with law designed to make LGBTQ+ students feel shame and isolation at school.""In truth, DeSantis is a nearly perfect illustration of the essayist and critic Lionel Trilling's description of conservative and reactionary impulses. These, Trilling wrote, do not express themselves in ideas but only in ""irritable mental gestures which seek to resemble ideas.""Trilling, who was writing in the immediate postwar period and basing his conclusions on the behavior of Nazi Germany, warned that ""it is just when a movement despairs of having ideas that it turns to force, which it masks in ideology.""Indeed, DeSantis has not been shy about backing up his ideology with force. Recall his treatment last year of the Special Olympics, which made the mistake of imposing a COVID vaccine mandate on participants in its USA Games in Orlando.DeSantis didn't let his appointment as the Games' honorary chairman keep him from threatening the Special Olympics with a record $27.5-million fine for its mandate.The organization had been in the forefront of groups supporting the vaccine. It reported on its website that vaccination is especially urgent for people with intellectual disabilities, including Down syndrome, Fragile X syndrome and autism — the core of the organization’s community of participants — who are especially vulnerable to COVID-19.Despite the threat to participants' health and the ""expert medical advice"" on which its mandate had been based, the organization backed down and lifted the mandate. DeSantis canceled the fine, because he's such a mensch.Then there's the governor's highly-publicized spat with the Walt Disney Co., Florida's largest private employer. This erupted after then-Disney Chief Executive Bob Chapek came out against the ""Don't Say Gay"" law; Chapek had remained silent, perhaps hoping the law would just go away, until Disney employees demanded that the company take a stand.DeSantis moved to revoke Disney's quasi-governmental authority over the site of Walt Disney World. As it happens, DeSantis' action, which won't go into effect until this July, would endow Disney with an annual tax break estimated at $164 million and stick Orlando-area taxpayers with the bill.If all this makes DeSantis' ostensible fight against discrimination and ""woke"" corporations, whatever that means, appear to be just a pose, no kidding.As he has been girding for a presidential run, DeSantis has not been shy about collecting political donations from rich businesses and individuals, including Duke Energy, the Seminole Tribe (owners of six of Florida's seven tribal casinos) and hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin — all presumably ""non-woke."" But two lobbyists for Disney, the target of DeSantis' anti-woke campaign, were among the top fundraisers for DeSantis' inauguration events, the Washington Post reported.The fundamental error made by the Special Olympics and the NHL was to schedule their events in Ron DeSantis' Florida. They made themselves convenient whipping boys for his brand of performative ideology. He doesn't even pretend to have ideas; just irritations, which he is more than willing to exploit for maximum publicity.What business organization would put themselves in DeSantis' crosshairs, given this record? None that has any self-respect or cares about principle, that's for sure.This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

Full Play Group paid or committed to pay up to $90 million, he said.“The bribes fulfilled that purpose extremely well,” Burzaco said, adding that the benefits to Fox were “immense” and helped the defendants turn the company's struggling South American broadcasting business into a profit center.Walt Disney Co bought most of 21st Century Fox in 2019. Disney is not a defendant, and a representative of the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Lopez, Martinez and Full Play Group have pleaded not guilty to crimes including wire fraud and money laundering.The case stems from a wider probe that has led to more than two-dozen convictions since federal prosecutors first unveiled indictments in 2015.Prosecutors accused Lopez and Martinez of scheming to bribe officials of South America’s soccer federation CONMEBOL to win media and marketing rights to various tournaments, using shell companies and sham consulting contracts to hide the scheme.Full Play, which is based in Buenos Aires but incorporated in Uruguay, is accused of targeting officials at CONMEBOL and the North American federation CONCACAF to win rights for events including Copa Libertadores and World Cup qualifying matches.During opening statements on Tuesday, lawyers for the defendants denied wrongdoing and attacked Burzaco’s credibility, telling jurors his testimony could not be trusted.Story continuesBurzaco, who gave similar testimony in the 2017 trial of three soccer executives, on Wednesday described a culture of widespread corruption in South American soccer and its global governing body, FIFA, where executives were treated like “royalty.”The former chief executive of Argentine sports media company Torneos has yet to be cross-examined and was set to continue testifying on Wednesday afternoon.(Reporting by Jack Queen in New York; Editing by Noeleen Walder and Bill Berkrot)]"

Diluted earnings per common share measured in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") were $4.29 in the fourth quarter of 2022, up from $3.37 in the year-earlier quarter and $3.53 in the third quarter of 2022. GAAP-basis net income was $765 million in the recent quarter, $458 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 and $647 million in the third 2022 quarter. GAAP-basis net income expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets was 1.53% in the fourth quarter of 2022, improved from 1.15% in the corresponding 2021 period and 1.28% in the third quarter of 2022. That net income produced a return on average common shareholders' equity of 12.59% in the recent quarter, 10.91% in the similar 2021 period and 10.43% in the third quarter of 2022. The results reflect non-operating merger-related expenses associated with the acquisition of People's United Financial, Inc. (""People's United"") of $45 million ($33 million after-tax effect, or $.20 of diluted earnings per common share) in the recent quarter, compared with $21 million ($16 million after-tax effect, or $.12 of diluted earnings per common share) in the year-earlier quarter and $53 million ($39 million after-tax effect, or $.22 of diluted earnings per share) in the third quarter of 2022.The recent quarter's results reflect two noteworthy items. In the fourth quarter of 2022, M&amp;T sold its retail insurance subsidiary, M&amp;T Insurance Agency, Inc. (""MTIA""), to Arthur J. Gallagher &amp; Co. The sale resulted in a gain of $136 million. Also during the fourth quarter of 2022, M&amp;T made a $135 million tax-deductible contribution to The M&amp;T Charitable Foundation.Darren J. King, Chief Financial Officer, commenting on M&amp;T's results noted, ""We are extremely pleased with our results, both in the fourth quarter as well as full year 2022. Diluted net operating earnings per share increased in each quarter following our acquisition of People's United, including by 19% in the fourth quarter. The integration of the acquired franchise, expansion of the net interest margin and solid growth in commercial loan balances position M&amp;T to continue its strong performance into 2023.""Story continuesEarnings HighlightsChange 4Q22 vs.($ in millions, except per share data)4Q224Q213Q224Q213Q22Net income$765$458$64767%18%Net income available to common shareholders ̶ diluted$739$434$62170%19%Diluted earnings per common share$4.29$3.37$3.5327%22%Annualized return on average assets1.53%1.15%1.28%Annualized return on average common equity12.59%10.91%10.43%For the year ended December 31, 2022, diluted earnings per common share were $11.53, compared with $13.80 in 2021. GAAP-basis net income was $1.99 billion and $1.86 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets and average common shareholders' equity, GAAP-basis net income in 2022 was 1.05% and 8.67%, respectively, compared with 1.22% and 11.54%, respectively, in 2021. Merger-related expenses in 2022 were $580 million ($432 million after tax-effect, or $2.63 of diluted earnings per common share), compared with $44 million ($34 million after-tax effect, or $.25 of diluted earnings per common share) in the prior year.Supplemental Reporting of Non-GAAP Results of Operations. M&amp;T consistently provides supplemental reporting of its results on a ""net operating"" or ""tangible"" basis, from which M&amp;T excludes the after-tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and the related goodwill and core deposit and other intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax amounts) and expenses associated with merging acquired operations into M&amp;T (when incurred), since such items are considered by management to be ""nonoperating"" in nature. The amounts of such ""nonoperating"" expenses are presented in the tables that accompany this release.Merger-related expenses generally consist of professional services, temporary help fees and other costs associated with actual or planned conversions of systems and/or integration of operations and the introduction of M&amp;T to its new customers, costs related to terminations of existing contractual arrangements to purchase various services, severance, travel costs and, in the second quarter of 2022, an initial provision for credit losses of $242 million on loans not deemed to be purchased credit deteriorated (""PCD"") on the April 1, 2022 acquisition date of People's United. GAAP requires that acquired loans be recorded at estimated fair value, which includes the use of interest rate and expected credit loss assumptions to forecast estimated cash flows. GAAP also provides that an allowance for credit losses on loans acquired, but not classified as PCD also be recognized. Given the requirement to recognize such losses above and beyond the impact of forecasted losses used in determining the fair value of acquired loans, M&amp;T considers that initial provision to be a merger-related expense. Although ""net operating income"" as defined by M&amp;T is not a GAAP measure, M&amp;T's management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results. The amounts of merger-related expenses in 2022 and 2021 are presented in the tables that accompany this release.Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $4.57 in the fourth quarter of 2022, improved from $3.50 in the year-earlier quarter and $3.83 in the third quarter of 2022. Net operating income aggregated $812 million in the recent quarter, $475 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 and $700 million in 2022's third quarter. Expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity, net operating income in the fourth quarter of 2022 was 1.70% and 21.29%, respectively, 1.23% and 15.98%, respectively, in the similar quarter of 2021 and 1.44% and 17.89%, respectively, in the third quarter of 2022.Diluted net operating earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2022 totaled $14.42, compared with $14.11 in 2021. Net operating income in 2022 was $2.47 billion, up from $1.90 billion in 2021. Net operating income expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity was 1.35% and 16.70%, respectively, in 2022, compared with 1.28% and 16.80%, respectively, in 2021.Taxable-equivalent Net Interest Income. Taxable-equivalent net interest income totaled $1.84 billion in the recent quarter, up from $937 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 and $1.69 billion in the third quarter of 2022. The increase compared with the earlier quarters reflects a higher net interest margin and, additionally, when compared with the 2021's fourth quarter, the impact of earning assets associated with the acquisition of People's United. Average earning assets totaled $179.9 billion in the recent quarter, compared with $144.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021 and $182.4 billion in the third quarter of 2022. Average loans outstanding were $129.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, up from $93.3 billion in the year earlier quarter and $127.5 billion in the third quarter of 2022. Reflecting the impact of rising interest rates, the net interest margin increased to 4.06% in the fourth quarter of 2022 from 2.58% in the corresponding quarter of 2021 and 3.68% in the third quarter of 2022. Taxable-equivalent net interest income rose to $5.86 billion in 2022, compared with $3.84 billion in 2021. Average loans outstanding were $119.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared with $96.6 billion in 2021. Taxable-equivalent net interest income and average loans outstanding in 2022 reflect three quarters of additional earning assets, including loans, obtained in the acquisition of People's United. Reflecting actions taken by the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates in the recent year, the net interest margin increased 63 basis points to 3.39% in 2022 from 2.76% in 2021.Taxable-equivalent Net Interest IncomeChange 4Q22 vs.($ in millions)4Q224Q213Q224Q213Q22Average earning assets$179,914$144,420$182,38225%-1%Net interest income ̶ taxable-equivalent$1,841$937$1,69196%9%Net interest margin4.06%2.58%3.68%Provision for Credit Losses/Asset Quality. The provision for credit losses was $90 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and $115 million in the third quarter of 2022, compared with a $15 million recapture of provision in the fourth quarter of 2021. The provision for credit losses was $517 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared with a $75 million recapture of provision in 2021. As previously described, included in the second quarter of 2022 was the $242 million provision, recorded in accordance with GAAP, related to loans obtained in the People's United acquisition that were considered non-PCD. In addition to that merger-related provision, M&amp;T recorded a provision for credit losses of $275 million in 2022. Net loan charge-offs were $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, $31 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 and $63 million in 2022's third quarter. Expressed as an annualized percentage of average loans outstanding, net charge-offs were .12% and .13% in the fourth quarters of 2022 and 2021, respectively, and .20% in the third quarter of 2022. Net loan charge-offs during all of 2022 and 2021 aggregated $160 million and $192 million, respectively, representing .13% and .20%, respectively, of average loans outstanding.Loans classified as nonaccrual totaled $2.44 billion at December 31, 2022, $2.43 billion at September 30, 2022 and $2.06 billion at December 31, 2021. The balance of nonaccrual loans at the end of the two most recent quarters as compared with December 31, 2021 reflects loans obtained in the acquisition of People's United. Nonaccrual loans as a percentage of total loans were 1.85% at December 31, 2022, improved from 2.22% a year earlier and 1.89% at September 30, 2022. Assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans were $41 million at December 31, 2022, $24 million at December 31, 2021 and $37 million at September 30, 2022.Allowance for Credit Losses. M&amp;T regularly performs comprehensive analyses of its loan portfolios and assesses forecasted economic conditions for purposes of determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. As a result of those procedures and reflecting the impact of loan growth, the allowance for credit losses totaled $1.93 billion or 1.46% of loans outstanding at December 31, 2022 compared with $1.47 billion or 1.58% of loans outstanding at December 31, 2021 and $1.88 billion or 1.46% at September 30, 2022. The acquisition of People's United loans and leases resulted in a $341 million increase in the allowance for credit losses as of April 1, 2022, including $99 million related to PCD loans and $242 million related to non-PCD loans. Including the impact of the acquisition, M&amp;T's allowance for credit losses was $1.81 billion on April 1, 2022, or 1.42% of then outstanding loans.Asset Quality MetricsChange 4Q22 vs.($ in millions)4Q224Q213Q224Q213Q22At end of quarterNonaccrual loans$2,439$2,060$2,42918%—Real estate and other foreclosed assets$41$24$3773%12%Total nonperforming assets$2,480$2,084$2,46619%1%Accruing loans past due 90 days or more (1)$491$963$477-49%3%Nonaccrual loans as % of loans outstanding1.85%2.22%1.89%Allowance for credit losses$1,925$1,469$1,87631%3%Allowance for credit losses as % of loans outstanding1.46%1.58%1.46%For the periodProvision for credit losses$90$(15)$115—-22%Net charge-offs$40$31$6331%-36%Net charge-offs as % of average loans (annualized).12%.13%.20%(1)Predominantly government-guaranteed residential real estate loans.Noninterest Income and Expense. Noninterest income totaled $682 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared with $579 million in the year-earlier quarter. The increase reflects the impact of acquired operations from People's United (predominantly increases in trust income, credit-related fees and service charges on deposit accounts, net of conversion-related fee waivers) and higher trust income from legacy operations, as well as the $136 million gain recorded on the sale of MTIA. Those increases were partially offset by a decline in mortgage banking revenues resulting from lower volumes of residential and commercial mortgage loans originated for sale, lower income recorded from M&amp;T's investment in Bayview Lending Group, and a planned reduction of insufficient funds fees reflected in service charges on deposit accounts. Noninterest income was $563 million in 2022's third quarter. The comparative increase in the recent quarter was driven by the $136 million gain recorded on the sale of MTIA and higher trust income, partially offset by lower service charges on deposit accounts, credit-related fees, bank owned life insurance income and MTIA-related insurance revenues.Noninterest IncomeChange 4Q22 vs.($ in millions)4Q224Q213Q224Q213Q22Mortgage banking revenues$82$139$83-41%-2%Service charges on deposit accounts106105115—-8%Trust income19516918715%4%Brokerage services income22192119%7%Trading account and non-hedging derivative gains1465133%176%Gain (loss) on bank investment securities(4)2(1)——Other revenues from operations26713915392%74%Total$682$579$56318%21%Noninterest income rose to $2.36 billion in 2022 from $2.17 billion in 2021. Acquired operations associated with the People's United acquisition (predominantly increases reflected in trust income, service charges on deposit accounts and other revenues from operations, including credit-related fees), the $136 million gain on sale of MTIA, and trust income from legacy operations were most impactful to the higher levels of noninterest income in 2022. Those increases were partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenues and the planned reduction of fees reflected in service charges on deposit accounts.In December 2022, Wilmington Trust National Association (a subsidiary of M&amp;T) announced the sale of its Collective Investment Trust business to a private equity firm. That sale is expected to close in the first half of 2023. Trust income associated with this business totaled approximately $165 million and $151 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. After considering expenses, the results of operations of that business were not material to M&amp;T's net income in either year.Noninterest expense totaled $1.41 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared with $928 million in the similar quarter of 2021 and $1.28 billion in the third quarter of 2022. Excluding expenses considered to be nonoperating in nature, such as amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets and merger-related expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $1.35 billion in the recent quarter, $904 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 and $1.21 billion in 2022's third quarter. The higher level of operating expenses in the recent quarter as compared with the year-earlier quarter was predominantly due to the impact of operations obtained in the People's United acquisition and the $135 million contribution to The M&amp;T Charitable Foundation. The charitable contribution was the largest factor contributing to higher operating expenses in 2022's fourth quarter as compared with 2022's third quarter. Higher expenses in the recent quarter as compared with the third quarter of 2022 for equipment and net occupancy, outside data processing and software and a seasonal increase in advertising and promotional spending were offset by a decline in salaries and employee benefits expenses, reflecting lower employee staffing levels following the conversion of People's United's operating systems with those of M&amp;T and one less pay day in the fourth quarter.Noninterest ExpenseChange 4Q22 vs.($ in millions)4Q224Q213Q224Q213Q22Salaries and employee benefits$697$515$73635%-5%Equipment and net occupancy1378312765%8%Outside data processing and software108799537%13%FDIC assessments24192827%-15%Advertising and marketing32212154%53%Printing, postage and supplies1581585%2%Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets18218801%-4%Other costs of operations37720123988%58%Total$1,408$928$1,27952%10%]"

This would be ExxonMobil’s largest and most expensive project.The development is expected to cost $12.68 billion, 27% more than the company’s fourth development. According to the Guyana government’s estimate, its oil would start flowing in 2027 and continue for two decades.Guyana is one of the hottest sources of oil and gas, with about 11 billion barrels discovered so far. A consortium managing the country’s crude production expects to extract 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2027, nearly triple of last year’s peak production.Guyana estimates its fields to hold 25 billion barrels and aims to produce 1.64 million bpd by the end of the decade. The project would require up to 600 workers at the peak of drilling activity and hire up to 160 people later. The project is expected to release 1 million tons per year of carbon dioxide emissions.ExxonMobil submitted a development plan for the Uaru oilfield. If the plan is approved by the Guyana government, the company and its partners could sanction spending on the project. It will consider bids on new blocks as Guyana is due to hold its first competitive auction for new exploration areas.In 2022, Guyana revealed a fiscal regime that raised the country’s share of oil riches to 27.5% from 14.5% through a combination of royalties and shared production.

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of 67 cents per share on revenues of $5.6 billion.Let’s delve into the factors that might have influenced the oilfield service firm’s performance in the December quarter. But it’s worth taking a look at HAL’s previous-quarter performance first.Highlights of Q3 Earnings &amp; Surprise HistoryIn the last reported quarter, this Houston, TX-based provider of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells beat the consensus mark on stronger-than-expected profit from both its divisions. Halliburton had reported adjusted net income per share of 60 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents. Revenues of $5.4 billion also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.3 billion.HAL beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, which resulted in an earnings surprise of 5.5%, on average. This is depicted in the graph below:Halliburton Company Price and EPS SurpriseHalliburton Company Price and EPS SurpriseHalliburton Company price-eps-surprise | Halliburton Company QuoteTrend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third-quarter bottom line has remained unchanged in the past seven days. The estimated figure indicates an 86.1% improvement year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues suggests a 30.5% increase from the year-ago period.Factors to ConsiderDespite pulling back from their multi-year highs, oil and natural gas prices have remained robust due to stable demand and geopolitical tensions. Consequently, drilling activity — an important factor for services companies — has been picking up. In the United States, a region on which Halliburton is highly dependent, rig count at the end of the fourth quarter was 779 compared with 765 three months ago and 586 a year back.This is in sync with the strength in commodity prices. The number of active units in Canada and international markets has gained sharply too. The steady growth in rig count is an encouraging indicator of contracting activity.Considering the improved operating environment, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter operating income of Completion &amp; Production, and Drilling &amp; Evaluation is pegged at $629 million and $364 million, respectively, indicating an increase of 81.3% and 35.3% year over year.Story continuesWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model predicts an earnings beat for Halliburton this season.

Price and EPS SurpriseF5, Inc. price-eps-surprise | F5, Inc. QuoteFactors to ConsiderF5’s fiscal first-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the hybrid work environment and the ongoing digital transformation wave, which is boosting the demand for secured communication networks.F5’s sustained focus on transitioning the business into a software-driven model is anticipated to have aided the company’s overall performance in the fiscal first quarter. The surging demand for multi-cloud application services is expected to have been a key growth driver during the quarter.Growing traction for the Enterprise License Agreement and annual subscriptions by customers are likely to have boosted software growth in the to-be-reported quarter. F5 expects revenues from the Software segment to increase in the 15-20% range for full-fiscal 2023.However, the ongoing industry-wide supply-chain constraints for components are likely to have negatively impacted F5’s Systems division sales during the fiscal first quarter. This, in turn, is expected to have partially offset the benefits of the growth projection for the software business, thereby leading to much slower growth in overall Product segment revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Product revenues stands at $349 million. This implies an estimated 1.7% increase from the Product segment’s revenues of $343 million in the year-ago quarter.Story continuesAdditionally, enterprises are postponing their large IT spending plans due to a weakening global economy amid ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical issues. This may have hurt F5’s overall financial performance in the fiscal first quarter.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for FFIV this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.

Moreover, analysts see another record for dividend spending this year.Dividend stocks have surpassed the inflation rate over the years, recording their best performance during periods of high inflation.

The downdraft in the market during the quarter led to a pile-on. We are being patient with our investment in Medtronic because the company continues to be a strong free cash flow generator and is attractively priced, with a FCF yield of 5% on trailing one-year numbers and a dividend yield of 3%. Medtronic is under new management that is focused on growing the company’s top line, reinvesting in R&amp;D, returning cash to shareholders and growing operating profits. We like new management’s strategy and believe new product launches, increased surgery visits, sound M&amp;A transactions and a shareholder returns focus, should reinvigorate the business. We added to our positions in these health care names during the quarter.”13. Linde plc (NYSE:LIN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 56Linde plc (NYSE:LIN) is an Ireland-based multinational chemicals company that provides its services and products to a variety of industries.

Linde and Schlumberger announced that they entered into a collaboration of carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration (CCUS) projects to accelerate decarbonization solutions across industrial and energy sectors. The collaboration will combine decades of experience in carbon dioxide capture and sequestration. The collaboration will focus on hydrogen and ammonia production where carbon dioxide is a by-product. The International Energy Agency estimates that 6 Gigatons of carbon dioxide will need to be abated with CCUS in order to reach net zero by 2050.

The collective value of stakes owned by these hedge funds is over $4 billion.Third Point mentioned Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) in its recently-published Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)11. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59An American multinational beverage company, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is another one of the best dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds. The stock also gained positive ratings from analysts due to its strong performance. In December, Atlantic Equities raised its price target on the stock to $69 with an Overweight rating on the shares, highlighting its ongoing investment and strong execution.The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.85%, as of January 18. The company is one of the strongest dividend payers in the market, making consistent dividend payments since 1920. Moreover, it has raised its payouts for the past 60 years.As of the end of Q3 2022, 59 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned stakes in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), with a collective value of $25 billion. Berkshire Hathaway owned the largest stake in the company, worth over $22.4 billion.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”10. The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) is an Ohio-based manufacturing company that specializes in paint and coating materials.

In December, both Citigroup and JPMorgan raised their price targets on the stock to $270 and $260, respectively.The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 43 years. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.60 per share for a dividend yield of 0.97%, as recorded on January 18.The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) is one of the best dividend stocks according to hedge funds, as 63 funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in the company in Q3 2022, up from 52 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a consolidated value of over $2.8 billion.ClearBridge Investments mentioned The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“The third strategy is buying growth companies with idiosyncratic or stock-specific catalysts unrelated to the direction of the market like The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW). The stock is an example of a company we categorize in our cyclical bucket that should experience a step change in earnings over the medium to long term with solid execution and its ability to pass through price increases. While relative performance has been challenged by binary decisions around a handful of mega cap technology stocks, we’re entering a lower-growth period in which we’ve historically delivered strong relative results from our balanced approach.”9. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is an American multinational energy company, based in California. The company has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 35 years. It currently offers a per-share dividend of $1.42 every quarter for a dividend yield of 3.15%, as of January 18.

Here is what the firm had to say:“Other top contributors in Q1 included multinational energy company Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX). The company benefited from increased energy demand as COVID-related economic restrictions eased in tandem with concerns regarding supply interruptions related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.”8.  Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is an American multinational retail corporation. In December, Credit Suisse raised its price target on the stock to $170 with an Outperform rating on the shares, calling the company one of the most important defensive names in the inflationary environment.Walmart Inc.

(NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”7. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is an American manufacturer and marketer of consumer goods and other personal care and hygiene products. The company has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 66 years and currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.9133 per share.

The collective value of these stakes is over $4.08 billion. Among these hedge funds, Bridgewater Associates was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”6. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is a popular dividend stock among hedge funds, as 72 funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in the company in Q3 2022, compared with 65 in the previous quarter. These stakes are valued at over $4.8 billion collectively.PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) holds a 50-year track record of consistent dividend growth. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.15 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.61%, as recorded on January 18. The company can be added to dividend portfolios alongside dividend stocks like Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV).JPMorgan gave a positive outlook to the consumer companies heading into 2023 and raised its price target on PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) to $150 with a Neutral rating on the shares.Lindsell Train mentioned PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“At this point, it may help to give a further example of these self-reinforcing moats to illustrate the idea, drawing from the consumer franchises side of our portfolio. In our view, strong consumer brands can similarly exhibit Lindycompatible anti-ageing properties. Consider, that the longer a company invests in its brands through advertising and R&amp;D, the stronger and more resonant they may get. When successful, a self-sustaining feedback loop is established, whereby it becomes ever harder to recreate a heritage-rich brand from scratch, raising barriers to entry, and proportionately increasing its likely lifespan. There are plenty of long-lived portfolio franchises I could reference here, but I’ve gone with PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP); partly because we have good time-series stats on it (beware data bias!) but also, as I hope will become evident, because Pepsi over its 129 years has succeeded in creating some wonderfully deep moats.With Pepsi Cola you get the flagship soft drinks brand, which is both global and generational, but you also get the Frito-Lay salty snacks portfolio assembled alongside it, claiming nearly 40% of the global market. That’s ten-times greater than the nearest competitor and likely higher than the next 65 competitors combined. These are exceptionally strong global bands with market shares to match; the long-term empirical result being Pepsi’s dividend record which over the past 66 years (as far back as we’ve been able to go) has compounded at an annualised rate of 10%. Pepsi is no ‘in at the ground floor’ start-up today, but it wasn’t six decades ago either. Early growth investor Philip Fisher put it well when in 1958 (two years into Pepsi’s current winning streak) he wrote of “companies which in spite of outstanding prospects of major further growth are so financially strong, with roots going so deep into the economic soil, that they qualify under the general classification of ‘institutional stocks’”. PepsiCo fits this description well…” (Click here to see the full text) Click to continue reading and see Dividend Aristocrats Ranked: Top 5 According To Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:13 Best Communication Services Stocks To Invest In12 Best DRIP Stocks To Own12 Best Holding Company Stocks To Invest InDisclosure.

Here are three Consumer Staples stocks that could be geared to beat expectations and see their stocks rise with better-than-expected quarterly reports.Procter &amp; Gamble PG Starting the list and set to report its second-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings on January 19 is Procter &amp; Gamble. Landing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Proctor &amp; Gamble is expected to see solid annual top and bottom-line growth.Proctor &amp; Gamble’s three segments include products for Beauty, Grooming, and Health Care. Earnings estimates for the current quarter have started to trend higher over the last week leading up to the report at $1.58 per share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchYear over year, PG’s earnings are expected to be virtually flat in fiscal 2023 but pop 7% in FY24 at $6.24 per share. Fiscal 2023 earnings estimates have remained unchanged and started to trend higher again for FY24. On the top line, sales are projected to be down -1% for Q2 at $20.61 billion. Annual sales are forecasted to be flat in FY23 but rise 4% in FY24 to $82.91 billion.More importantly, FY24 would represent 22% growth from pre-pandemic levels which is impressive for a mature company of Proctor &amp; Gambles’ size.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchProctor and Gamble stock is down -9% over the last year compared to the S&amp;P 500’s -14%. This has mostly been on par with the Zacks Soap &amp; Cleaning Preparations Markets -6%. Even better, when including its dividend, PG’s total return over the last five years is +84% to easily beat the benchmark’s +56% and its Zack Subindustry’s +39%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn regard to PG’s dividend, the annual yield is 2.43% which is slightly above the industry average of 2.41% and easily tops the S&amp;P 500’s 1.6% average. Trading around $147 per share, the average Zacks Price Target suggests 4% upside for PG stock.Story continuesColgate-Palmolive CLAnother Consumers Staples stock investors may want to consider is Colgate-Palmolive which is set to report Q4 earnings on January 27. The iconic toothpaste and oral care provider could post a solid earnings beat on its bottom line.The Zacks consensus for Colgate’s fourth-quarter earnings is $0.76 per share with the Most Accurate Estimate at $0.78 a share, implying an Expected Surprise Prediction (ESP) of 2.13%. This could get Colgate’s stock rallying if the company can significantly top estimates and perhaps offer stronger than expected guidance.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchColgate earnings are now expected to dip -7% to round out its current fiscal 2022 but then rebound 6% in FY23 at $3.16 per share. Earnings estimates have slightly trended down over the last 90 days.On the top line, Q4 sales are expected to be up 3% at $4.54 billion. Year over year, sales are now expected to be up 2% for FY22 and rise another 3% in FY23 at $18.44 billion. With 2019 sales at $15.69 billion, FY23 would be a 17% increase from pre-pandemic levels.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWith shares trading at $77 and only 9% from their highs, Colgate’s dividend also sticks out. Colgate’s 2.40% annual yield is on par with the industry average and nicely above the benchmark. For now, Colgate’s stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with the average Zacks Price Target still suggesting 4% upside from current levels.Clorox CLXLastly, set to report fiscal Q2 earnings on February 2, The Zacks Consensus for Clorox stock is $0.65 a share with the Most Accurate Estimate at $0.68 per share. This gives CLX stock a 4.22% Earnings ESP leading up to its fiscal second-quarter report.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchClorox’s fiscal 2023 earnings are expected to be virtually flat YoY at $4.11 per share. However, Fiscal 2024 earnings are projected to climb 30% to $5.34 a share. Earnings estimate revisions are higher for both FY23 and FY24 over the last quarter.Second quarter sales are expected to decline -2% at $1.66 billion. Year over year, Clorox’s sales are expected to be down -1% in FY23 but rise 3% in FY24 at $7.30 billion. Fiscal 2024 would be a 17% increase from pre-pandemic levels which is significant as consumption among Clorox’s bleach and cleaning products received a huge boost from Covid-19 but had begun to slow.Also supporting Clorox’s growth concerns is its PEG ratio of 2.6, which is getting closer to the optimum level of less than 1. While Clorox’s PEG is higher than the S&amp;P 500’s 1.6, it is well below the industry average of 4.1. Clorox’s PEG is 50% below its decade-long high of 5.6 and 20% beneath the median of 3.3, further supporting the stock’s valuation from a historical growth rate perspective.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTrading around $144 a share, Clorox stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and offers a generous 3.19% annual dividend yield which is well above the industry average of 2.41% and the benchmark’s 1.6%.Bottom Line These Consumer Staples stocks are starting to stand out leading up to their earnings report.

320,7aa1d9e5-1ddd-313b-b8e9-7d2ae3eb5bae,JNPR,2023-01-19,"3 Wireless Stocks Set to Ride on 5G Rollout, Cloud Transition",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-wireless-stocks-set-ride-134501413.html,1674049501,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'CMTL', 'MSI', 'JNPR']","[The Zacks Wireless Equipment industry appears well poised to gain from healthy demand trends with the gradual revival in post-pandemic market conditions and a faster 5G rollout. However, large-scale investments to support the 5G transition, margin erosion due to price wars and inflated raw material costs amid a challenging macroeconomic environment and supply chain adversities might erode profitability.Nevertheless, Motorola Solutions, Inc. MSI, Juniper Networks, Inc. JNPR and Comtech Telecommunications Corp. CMTL are likely to benefit from the increasing demand for state-of-the-art wireless products with a vast proliferation of IoT, fiber densification and a gradual shift to cloud services.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Wireless Equipment industry primarily comprises companies that provide various networking solutions, wireless telecom products and related services for wireless voice and data communications through scalable modular platforms. Their product portfolio encompasses integrated circuit devices (chips) and system software for wireless voice and data communications, analog and digital two-way radio, satellite telecommunications, wireless networking and signal processing, and end-to-end enterprise mobility solutions. The firms also provide a broad range of routing, switching and security products, video surveillance and machine-to-machine communication components that secure VPN appliances, enable intrusion detection and thwart data theft. Some firms even provide electronic warfare, avionics, robotics, advanced communications and maritime systems to the defense industry.What's Shaping the Future of the Wireless Equipment Industry?Continuous Infrastructure Upgrade: With the exponential growth of mobile broadband traffic and home Internet solutions, demand for advanced networking architecture has increased manifold. This has forced service providers to spend more on routers and switches to upgrade their networks and support the surge in home data traffic. To maintain superior performance standards, there is a continuous need for network tuning and optimization, which creates demand for state-of-the-art wireless products and services. Moreover, a faster pace of 5G deployment is expected to augment the scalability, security and universal mobility of the telecommunications industry and propel the wide proliferation of IoT. The fiber-optic cable network is vital for backhaul and the last mile local loop, which are required by wireless service providers for 5G deployment. Fiber networks are also essential for the growing deployment of small cells that bring the network closer to the user and supplement macro networks to provide extensive coverage. The industry participants are facilitating its customers to move away from an economy-of-scale network operating model to demand-driven operations and seamlessly migrate to 5G by offering easy programmability and flexible automation through steady infrastructure investments.Profitability Woes Persist: Although higher infrastructure investments will eventually help minimize service delivery costs to support broadband competition and wireless densification, short-term profitability has largely been compromised. Margins are likely to be affected by the high cost of first-generation 5G products, profitability challenges in China, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and pricing pressure in early 5G deals. Uncertainty regarding chip shortage and supply-chain disruptions leading to a dearth of essential fiber materials, shipping delays and shortages of other raw materials are likely to affect the expansion and rollout of new broadband networks. Extended lead times for basic components are also likely to affect the delivery schedule and escalate production costs. High technological obsolescence of most products and a challenging macroeconomic environment have also escalated operating costs with steady investments in R&amp;D.Transition to Cloud Networking Solutions: The majority of the industry participants offer mission-critical communication infrastructure, devices, accessories, software and services that enable its customers to run businesses with increased efficiency and safety for their mobile workforce. These systems drive demand for additional device sales, software upgrades, infrastructure overhaul and expansion, as well as additional services to maintain, monitor and manage these complex networks and solutions. The comprehensive suite of services ensures continuity and reduces risks for constant critical communication operations. The wide proliferation of cloud networking solutions is further resulting in increased storage and computing on a virtual plane. As both consumers and enterprises use the network, there is tremendous demand for quality networking equipment.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bearish ProspectsThe Zacks Wireless Equipment industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector.

321,8ecfbbbb-f606-31a8-a67f-d64ede809c56,CMCSA,2023-01-19,Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Has A Pretty Healthy Balance Sheet,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/comcast-nasdaq-cmcsa-pretty-healthy-110106270.html,1674126066,STORY,"['CMCSA', 'BRK-A']","[The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. As with many other companies Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) makes use of debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?When Is Debt A Problem?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together. Check out our latest analysis for Comcast What Is Comcast's Debt?As you can see below, Comcast had US$97.6b of debt at September 2022, down from US$102.4b a year prior. However, it also had US$5.70b in cash, and so its net debt is US$91.9b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is Comcast's Balance Sheet?Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Comcast had liabilities of US$28.0b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$145.0b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$5.70b in cash and US$11.9b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$155.4b.This is a mountain of leverage even relative to its gargantuan market capitalization of US$165.5b. This suggests shareholders would be heavily diluted if the company needed to shore up its balance sheet in a hurry.Story continuesIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.Comcast's net debt is sitting at a very reasonable 2.5 times its EBITDA, while its EBIT covered its interest expense just 5.7 times last year. While these numbers do not alarm us, it's worth noting that the cost of the company's debt is having a real impact. If Comcast can keep growing EBIT at last year's rate of 15% over the last year, then it will find its debt load easier to manage. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Comcast's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. During the last three years, Comcast produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 65% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.Our ViewComcast's conversion of EBIT to free cash flow was a real positive on this analysis, as was its EBIT growth rate. Having said that, its level of total liabilities somewhat sensitizes us to potential future risks to the balance sheet. When we consider all the factors mentioned above, we do feel a bit cautious about Comcast's use of debt. While debt does have its upside in higher potential returns, we think shareholders should definitely consider how debt levels might make the stock more risky. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For example - Comcast has   4 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.If you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet.Have feedback on this article?

(NYSE:PRU) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/59-ownership-shares-prudential-financial-110051522.html,1674126051,STORY,['PRU'],"[Every investor in Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 59% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Prudential Financial. See our latest analysis for Prudential Financial ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Prudential Financial?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Prudential Financial does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Prudential Financial, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Prudential Financial is not owned by hedge funds. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.0% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.6% and 4.8% of the stock.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Prudential FinancialWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Prudential Financial, Inc. in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$47m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 41% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

327,3e28c941-4d8b-3363-b3d0-c36a7043e0c3,URI,2023-01-19,United Rentals (URI) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-rentals-uri-reports-next-150003608.html,1674054003,STORY,['URI'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when United Rentals (URI) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 25. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis equipment rental company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $10.04 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +35.9%.Revenues are expected to be $3.29 billion, up 18.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.95% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for United Rentals?For United Rentals, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +5.32%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that United Rentals will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that United Rentals would post earnings of $9 per share when it actually produced earnings of $9.27, delivering a surprise of +3%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.United Rentals appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Just in its latest release, AVGO penciled in a nearly 2% EPS surprise and reported revenue marginally above estimates.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOracle Oracle is one of the largest enterprise-grade database, middleware, and application software providers, offering cloud solutions and services that can be used to build and manage various cloud deployment models.Story continuesThe company’s annual dividend currently yields 1.5%, nicely above its Zacks sector average. Impressively, Oracle carries a solid 14% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchInternational Business MachinesInternational Business Machines has gradually evolved as a provider of cloud and data platforms, with its Red Hat acquisition strengthening its position in the hybrid cloud market. The company sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).IBM’s dividend metrics could be the most impressive of all; IBM’s annual dividend yield sits at 4.6%, nowhere near its Zacks sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, the company’s valuation multiples aren’t stretched, further bolstered by its Style Score of “B” for Value. IBM shares currently trade at a 14.9X forward earnings multiple, above the five-year median but below the Zacks sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineInvestors love dividends, as they give a nice cushion, provide a reliable income stream, and offer more than one way to profit from an investment.Still, when thinking of dividend-paying stocks, the technology sector certainly isn’t an area that receives attention.However, all three stocks above – Oracle ORCL, International Business Machines IBM, and Broadcom AVGO – are exceptions, rewarding their shareholders handsomely.For those seeking income paired with tech exposure, all three deserve consideration.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:HAS)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bullish-insiders-bet-us-1-124908658.html,1674132548,STORY,['HAS'],"[Over the last year, a good number of insiders have significantly increased their holdings in Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS). This is encouraging because it indicates that insiders are more optimistic about the company's prospects.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Hasbro Hasbro Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe CEO &amp; Director Christian Cocks made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$905k worth of shares at a price of US$89.71 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, even at a higher price than the current share price (being US$64.17). Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. It is generally more encouraging if they paid above the current price, as it suggests they saw value, even at higher levels.In the last twelve months Hasbro insiders were buying shares, but not selling. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeHasbro is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Does Hasbro Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Hasbro insiders own about US$514m worth of shares (which is 5.8% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Hasbro Insiders?The fact that there have been no Hasbro insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. On a brighter note, the transactions over the last year are encouraging. It would be great to see more insider buying, but overall it seems like Hasbro insiders are reasonably well aligned (owning significant chunk of the company's shares) and optimistic for the future. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Hasbro.

The acquisition will help AJG expand its footprint in Ireland.Dublin, Ireland-based First Ireland Risk Management Limited was formed in 1982. This retail insurance broker provides commercial and personal insurance products as well as life and pension solutions to clients throughout Ireland. The insurer has been in operation for four decades. Adding these entities will enhance the acquirer’s compelling portfolio and consolidate its presence in the region. The recent buyout marks the fourth acquisition in this year so far.AJG’s revenues are geographically diversified with strong domestic and international operations, which contribute about one-third of revenues and are spread across Australia, Bermuda, Canada, the Caribbean, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The company expects international contribution to total revenues to increase, given the number and size of the non-U.S. acquisitions.Arthur J. Gallagher boasts an impressive inorganic story. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) made 10 buyouts in the fourth quarter of 2022 while closing 19 new tuck-in brokerage mergers, representing about $107 million of estimated annualized revenues in the first nine months of 2022. AJG has a strong merger and acquisition pipeline with about $400 million of revenues, associated with about 50 term sheets either agreed upon or being prepared.A solid capital position supports AJG in its growth initiatives and it thus remains focused on continuing its tuck-in mergers and acquisitions.

Moreover, analysts see another record for dividend spending this year.Dividend stocks have surpassed the inflation rate over the years, recording their best performance during periods of high inflation.

(NYSE:CAT), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV). We will further discuss top dividend aristocrats according to hedge funds.Photo by Karolina Grabowska: https://www.pexels.com/photo/hands-holding-us-dollar-bills-4968630/Story continuesOur Methodology:Dividend aristocrats are the companies in the S&amp;P 500 index that have increased their dividends consistently over the past 25 consecutive years. We scanned Insider Monkey's database of 920 hedge funds and picked the top 15 dividend aristocrats, which means the stocks mentioned in this list are the most popular dividend aristocrats among the elite hedge funds in America. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in the companies.Dividend Aristocrats Ranked: Top 15 According To Hedge Funds15. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 53Founded in 1940, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is an American multinational fast food chain. In January, Loop Capital raised its price target on the stock to $328 with a Buy rating on the shares, highlighting the company's same-store sales growth. The company is one of the best dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds.McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.52 per share, having raised it by 10% in October. The company has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 46 years. The stock's dividend yield on January 18 came in at 2.22%.In addition to other dividend stocks like Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), investors and analysts are appreciating McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) due to the company's strong dividend growth record.McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) was a part of 53 hedge fund portfolios in Q3 2022, up from 50 in the previous quarter, according to Insider Monkey’s data. The stakes owned by these hedge funds are worth over $1.8 billion collectively. Among these hedge funds, Bridgewater Associates was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3.14. Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) is a multinational medical device company that provides other medical services and solutions to its consumers. On December 8, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share, which fell in line with its previous dividend. The company maintains a 45-year streak of consistent dividend growth, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds. The stock has a dividend yield of 3.39%, as of January 18.For the six months that ended in October, Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) reported an operating cash flow of $2 billion and its free cash flow for the period came in at $1.2 billion. In fiscal Q2 2023, the company posted revenue of roughly $7.6 billion.In January, RBC Capital gave a Sector Perform rating on Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) with an $89 price target, presenting a positive outlook on the medical supply and device stocks.At the end of Q3 2022, 55 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned stakes in Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), up from 54 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is over $2.6 billion.Artisan Partners mentioned Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“While Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT)’s procedure volumes recovered to pre-COVID levels, foreign exchange headwinds overshadowed underlying business value growth, and supply chain issues, including those related to China’s lockdowns, impacted the surgical innovations business. The downdraft in the market during the quarter led to a pile-on. We are being patient with our investment in Medtronic because the company continues to be a strong free cash flow generator and is attractively priced, with a FCF yield of 5% on trailing one-year numbers and a dividend yield of 3%. Medtronic is under new management that is focused on growing the company’s top line, reinvesting in R&amp;D, returning cash to shareholders and growing operating profits. We like new management’s strategy and believe new product launches, increased surgery visits, sound M&amp;A transactions and a shareholder returns focus, should reinvigorate the business. We added to our positions in these health care names during the quarter.”13. Linde plc (NYSE:LIN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 56Linde plc (NYSE:LIN) is an Ireland-based multinational chemicals company that provides its services and products to a variety of industries. In the third quarter of 2022, the company reported an operating cash flow of $2.6 billion, which showed a 3% growth from the same period last year.

The collective value of stakes owned by these hedge funds is over $4 billion.Third Point mentioned Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) in its recently-published Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)11.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”10. The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) is an Ohio-based manufacturing company that specializes in paint and coating materials.

These stakes have a consolidated value of over $2.8 billion.ClearBridge Investments mentioned The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“The third strategy is buying growth companies with idiosyncratic or stock-specific catalysts unrelated to the direction of the market like The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW). The stock is an example of a company we categorize in our cyclical bucket that should experience a step change in earnings over the medium to long term with solid execution and its ability to pass through price increases. While relative performance has been challenged by binary decisions around a handful of mega cap technology stocks, we’re entering a lower-growth period in which we’ve historically delivered strong relative results from our balanced approach.”9.

(NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter.

I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”7. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is an American manufacturer and marketer of consumer goods and other personal care and hygiene products.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”6. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is a popular dividend stock among hedge funds, as 72 funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in the company in Q3 2022, compared with 65 in the previous quarter. These stakes are valued at over $4.8 billion collectively.PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) holds a 50-year track record of consistent dividend growth. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.15 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.61%, as recorded on January 18.

(NYSE:ABBV).JPMorgan gave a positive outlook to the consumer companies heading into 2023 and raised its price target on PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) to $150 with a Neutral rating on the shares.Lindsell Train mentioned PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“At this point, it may help to give a further example of these self-reinforcing moats to illustrate the idea, drawing from the consumer franchises side of our portfolio. In our view, strong consumer brands can similarly exhibit Lindycompatible anti-ageing properties. Consider, that the longer a company invests in its brands through advertising and R&amp;D, the stronger and more resonant they may get. When successful, a self-sustaining feedback loop is established, whereby it becomes ever harder to recreate a heritage-rich brand from scratch, raising barriers to entry, and proportionately increasing its likely lifespan. There are plenty of long-lived portfolio franchises I could reference here, but I’ve gone with PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP); partly because we have good time-series stats on it (beware data bias!) but also, as I hope will become evident, because Pepsi over its 129 years has succeeded in creating some wonderfully deep moats.With Pepsi Cola you get the flagship soft drinks brand, which is both global and generational, but you also get the Frito-Lay salty snacks portfolio assembled alongside it, claiming nearly 40% of the global market. That’s ten-times greater than the nearest competitor and likely higher than the next 65 competitors combined. These are exceptionally strong global bands with market shares to match; the long-term empirical result being Pepsi’s dividend record which over the past 66 years (as far back as we’ve been able to go) has compounded at an annualised rate of 10%. Pepsi is no ‘in at the ground floor’ start-up today, but it wasn’t six decades ago either. Early growth investor Philip Fisher put it well when in 1958 (two years into Pepsi’s current winning streak) he wrote of “companies which in spite of outstanding prospects of major further growth are so financially strong, with roots going so deep into the economic soil, that they qualify under the general classification of ‘institutional stocks’”. PepsiCo fits this description well…” (Click here to see the full text) Click to continue reading and see Dividend Aristocrats Ranked: Top 5 According To Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:13 Best Communication Services Stocks To Invest In12 Best DRIP Stocks To Own12 Best Holding Company Stocks To Invest InDisclosure.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Dividend Stocks To Buy and Hold. Despite a slowing economy, investors remain confident in dividend growth to cushion their portfolios from financial blows in terms of eroding share prices. Alec Young, chief investment strategist at MAPsignals, told BNN Bloomberg in the beginning of January 2023 that dividend stocks are not only a source of passive income in a volatile environment, but these equities have also contributed about 40% to the overall performance of the US stock market. He noted that data suggests dividend stocks are the best performers during periods of peak inflation, which is the current case for the United States, with CPI inflation between 6% and 7%. Dividend stocks outperform non-dividend payers by a significant margin in times of economic turbulence, as per Young. Similarly, Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFi, anticipates dividend ETFs to be favored this year. He appreciates the Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index Fund (NYSE:VYM), which has companies with above-average dividend yields and provides exposure to defensive sectors. For tech exposure, Rosenbluth recommends the ALPS Sector Dividend Dogs ETF (NYSE:SDOG), a fund that has the five highest-yielding S&amp;P 500 stocks across 10 sectors, with equal weight holdings. For more insights into dividend equities, investors can also check out 11 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats to Buy, 12 Cheap Monthly Dividend Stocks To Buy, and 11 Best Dividend Stocks Yielding Over 6%.

While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.”12. Walmart Inc.

Its dividend yield is 0.8%. Earnings over the next 3-5 years are forecasted to grow at ~10%. The current P/E multiple is a very pricey 34x for such growth rate. Now, Costco is an outstanding business with consistent profits and cash flows. However, the price that you pay is important (and you tend to pay a very high price for a “cheery consensus”) and if the earnings multiple comes down to say 30x, you internal rate of return (IRR) over the next 4-5 years will be around 6-7% from holding Costco’s stock. It's a decent market-like return, but nothing to be excited about (only a few percentage points over risk-free rate).”10. Broadcom Inc.

Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Prologis: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus FFO estimate is $1.22 on $1.39 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $5.56 on $6.23 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, REIT and Equity Trust - Other is currently in the bottom 23% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.EastGroup Properties (EGP), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2022.

350,163d0694-bd5b-3c05-a036-733040760ef3,NWL,2023-01-19,Newell Brands' (NASDAQ:NWL) earnings trajectory could turn positive as the stock rallies 4.9% this past week,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/newell-brands-nasdaq-nwl-earnings-175543986.html,1674064543,STORY,['NWL'],"[Newell Brands Inc. (NASDAQ:NWL) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 22% in the last month. But over the last half decade, the stock has not performed well. You would have done a lot better buying an index fund, since the stock has dropped 50% in that half decade.Although the past week has been more reassuring for shareholders, they're still in the red over the last five years, so let's see if the underlying business has been responsible for the decline. Check out our latest analysis for Newell Brands To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Newell Brands moved from a loss to profitability. That would generally be considered a positive, so we are surprised to see the share price is down. Other metrics may better explain the share price move.The steady dividend doesn't really explain why the share price is down. While it's not completely obvious why the share price is down, a closer look at the company's history might help explain it.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-and-revenue-growthIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. You can see what analysts are predicting for Newell Brands in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Newell Brands, it has a TSR of -37% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Newell Brands shareholders are down 30% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 13%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 6% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for Newell Brands  you should be aware of, and 1 of them is concerning.There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

351,e6f80b26-c686-344a-94e8-20aa476b66cc,PCAR,2023-01-19,Tesla (TSLA) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-tsla-reports-next-week-150003131.html,1674054003,STORY,"['TSLA', 'PCAR']","[Tesla (TSLA) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 25. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis electric car maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.05 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +23.5%.Revenues are expected to be $24.82 billion, up 40.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.25% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Tesla?For Tesla, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -9.52%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Tesla will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Tesla would post earnings of $0.95 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.05, delivering a surprise of +10.53%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Tesla doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, Paccar (PCAR) is soon expected to post earnings of $2.24 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +52.4%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $7.1 billion, up 12.8% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Paccar has been revised 1.2% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 1.21%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Paccar will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The iconic consumer packaged food and beverage company is focused on transforming its business to unleash its full potential.KHC’s shares have increased 16.6% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 10.1% growth.Let’s delve deeper.Pricing Actions Fuel GrowthSolid pricing initiatives have been aiding Kraft Heinz for a while now. In third-quarter 2022, the company’s pricing rose 15.4 percentage points year over year, reflecting growth in both segments. The upside can be attributed to measures undertaken to counter increasing input costs. In the North America segment, pricing moved up 15.3 percentage points. The International segment’s pricing moved up 15.7 percentage points. Robust pricing efforts boosted quarterly net sales, increasing year over year and beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company generated net sales of $6,505 million, up 2.9%, while organic net sales increased 11.6%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGrowth Efforts on TrackThe Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s top-line momentum is driven by three pillars of growth, including Consumer Platforms, Foodservice opportunities and expansion in Emerging Markets. In its last earnings call, management highlighted that it remains encouraged about sales growth in its segments, driven by its three growth pillars — GROW platforms in North America, Foodservice and Emerging Markets.In the third quarter of 2022, demand in GROW platforms across North America, including Taste Elevation, was solid. The company’s Foodservice business across North America and International Zone is growing faster than the industry. The company witnessed accelerated organic net sales growth across the emerging market.Management has been expanding its presence in Emerging Markets via a sustainable and repeatable Go-To-Market model delivering accelerated growth. In April 2022, Kraft Heinz acquired a majority stake in a Brazil-based condiments and sauces company — Companhia Hemmer Indústria e Comércio (""Hemmer""). In January 2022, Kraft Heinz acquired an 85% stake in Germany-based Just Spices GmbH (“Just Spices”). Management acquired the sauces-focused business — Assan Foods — from privately-held Turkish conglomerate Kibar Holding in October 2021.The company is committed to accelerating its profit and boosting long-term shareholders’ value. As part of its transformation phase, management unveiled AGILE@SCALE in February 2022. The strategy will help Kraft Heinz to enhance its agile expertise and capabilities via partnerships with technology giants and cutting-edge innovators.Story continuesHurdles on the WayIn the third quarter of 2022, Kraft Heinz’s gross profit of $1,843 million declined by 9.1% from the $2,028 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA fell 5.5% to $1,398 million, reflecting the adverse impact of divestitures and unfavorable currency translation. The company’s adjusted EBITDA was hurt by escalated commodity costs (particularly across dairy, soybean, packaging materials, energy and vegetable oils), supply-chain costs (including inflation across logistics, procurement and manufacturing costs) and an adverse volume/mix.In its last earnings call, management highlighted that it expects the industry to continue facing several headwinds like elevated input costs, ongoing supply chain challenges, currency volatility and increasing interest rates. Such headwinds continue to impact below-the-line costs and consumer health and consumption trends.Nevertheless, the upsides mentioned above are likely to keep Kraft Heinz afloat amid such hurdles.3 Solid Staple PicksSome other top-ranked stocks are Conagra Brands CAG, Lamb Weston LW and Mondelez International, Inc.

This reporting cycle will be important as market participants will closely monitor any sign of earnings, revenues or margin decline. A large section of economists and financial experts are concerned that the U.S. economy may face at least a mild recession in 2023 with a higher interest rate regime and tighter monetary control adopted by the Fed.However, five consumer staple stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank are poised to beat on earnings. The combination of a favorable Zacks Rank and a possible earnings beat should drive their stock prices in the near-term. These companies are - The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. PG, Corteva Inc. CTVA, e.l.f. Beauty Inc. ELF, Mondelez International Inc. MDLZ and TreeHouse Foods Inc.

However, among the remaining 10 sectors, consumer staples suffered marginally by declining 0.8% last year while the benchmark itself tumbled 19.4%.The consumer staples sector is mature and fundamentally strong as demand for such services is generally immune to the changes in the economic cycle. The consumer staples sector includes companies that provide necessities and products for daily use. This makes the sector defensive in nature.Therefore, this has always been a go-to place for investors, who want to play it safe during extreme market fluctuations irrespective of internal or external disturbances. Consequently, consumer staples stocks performed relatively well in fourth-quarter 2022, which was extremely volatile unlike other years.Our Top PicksFive consumer staples companies’ earnings are set to beat estimates. Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a positive Earnings ESP.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 25, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis maker of Cessna small planes and Bell helicopters is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.01 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +7.5%.Revenues are expected to be $3.67 billion, up 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Textron?For Textron, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -5.14%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Textron will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Textron would post earnings of $0.94 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.06, delivering a surprise of +12.77%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Textron doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Price and EPS SurpriseCovenant Logistics Group, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCovenant Logistics Group, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Covenant Logistics Group, Inc. QuoteAgainst this backdrop, let’s take a look at the factors that might have shaped the company’s December-quarter performance.Given supply-chain woes and the inflationary pressure, freight demand has slowed down. Therefore, we expect the trucking company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter to have been dented by lower freight revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for freight revenues indicates a 4.1% decline from third-quarter 2022 actuals.Due to lower freight revenues, total revenues for CVLG’s truckload operations are likely to have been hit. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for truckload revenues (combined truckload) indicates a 23.2% decline from third-quarter 2022 actuals.However, fuel surcharge revenues are likely to have been high due to increased fuel price. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fuel surcharge revenues indicates a 45% increase from fourth-quarter 2021 actuals.What Does the Zacks Model Say?The proven Zacks model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Covenant Logistics this time around. The combination of a positive  Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates, which is not the case here.

Moreover, analysts see another record for dividend spending this year.Dividend stocks have surpassed the inflation rate over the years, recording their best performance during periods of high inflation.

He further emphasized the significance of strong fundamentals when investing in dividend stocks.Some of the companies that have shown solid dividend growth over the years include Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV).

The stakes owned by these hedge funds are worth over $1.8 billion collectively. Among these hedge funds, Bridgewater Associates was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3.14. Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) is a multinational medical device company that provides other medical services and solutions to its consumers. On December 8, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share, which fell in line with its previous dividend.

The downdraft in the market during the quarter led to a pile-on. We are being patient with our investment in Medtronic because the company continues to be a strong free cash flow generator and is attractively priced, with a FCF yield of 5% on trailing one-year numbers and a dividend yield of 3%. Medtronic is under new management that is focused on growing the company’s top line, reinvesting in R&amp;D, returning cash to shareholders and growing operating profits. We like new management’s strategy and believe new product launches, increased surgery visits, sound M&amp;A transactions and a shareholder returns focus, should reinvigorate the business. We added to our positions in these health care names during the quarter.”13. Linde plc (NYSE:LIN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 56Linde plc (NYSE:LIN) is an Ireland-based multinational chemicals company that provides its services and products to a variety of industries.

Linde and Schlumberger announced that they entered into a collaboration of carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration (CCUS) projects to accelerate decarbonization solutions across industrial and energy sectors. The collaboration will combine decades of experience in carbon dioxide capture and sequestration. The collaboration will focus on hydrogen and ammonia production where carbon dioxide is a by-product. The International Energy Agency estimates that 6 Gigatons of carbon dioxide will need to be abated with CCUS in order to reach net zero by 2050.

The collective value of stakes owned by these hedge funds is over $4 billion.Third Point mentioned Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) in its recently-published Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)11. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59An American multinational beverage company, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is another one of the best dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds. The stock also gained positive ratings from analysts due to its strong performance.

The company is one of the strongest dividend payers in the market, making consistent dividend payments since 1920. Moreover, it has raised its payouts for the past 60 years.As of the end of Q3 2022, 59 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned stakes in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), with a collective value of $25 billion. Berkshire Hathaway owned the largest stake in the company, worth over $22.4 billion.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”10. The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) is an Ohio-based manufacturing company that specializes in paint and coating materials.

In December, both Citigroup and JPMorgan raised their price targets on the stock to $270 and $260, respectively.The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 43 years. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.60 per share for a dividend yield of 0.97%, as recorded on January 18.The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) is one of the best dividend stocks according to hedge funds, as 63 funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in the company in Q3 2022, up from 52 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a consolidated value of over $2.8 billion.ClearBridge Investments mentioned The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“The third strategy is buying growth companies with idiosyncratic or stock-specific catalysts unrelated to the direction of the market like The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW). The stock is an example of a company we categorize in our cyclical bucket that should experience a step change in earnings over the medium to long term with solid execution and its ability to pass through price increases. While relative performance has been challenged by binary decisions around a handful of mega cap technology stocks, we’re entering a lower-growth period in which we’ve historically delivered strong relative results from our balanced approach.”9. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is an American multinational energy company, based in California. The company has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 35 years. It currently offers a per-share dividend of $1.42 every quarter for a dividend yield of 3.15%, as of January 18.

Here is what the firm had to say:“Other top contributors in Q1 included multinational energy company Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX). The company benefited from increased energy demand as COVID-related economic restrictions eased in tandem with concerns regarding supply interruptions related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.”8.  Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is an American multinational retail corporation. In December, Credit Suisse raised its price target on the stock to $170 with an Outperform rating on the shares, calling the company one of the most important defensive names in the inflationary environment.Walmart Inc.

(NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”7. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is an American manufacturer and marketer of consumer goods and other personal care and hygiene products. The company has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 66 years and currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.9133 per share.

The collective value of these stakes is over $4.08 billion. Among these hedge funds, Bridgewater Associates was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”6. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is a popular dividend stock among hedge funds, as 72 funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in the company in Q3 2022, compared with 65 in the previous quarter. These stakes are valued at over $4.8 billion collectively.PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) holds a 50-year track record of consistent dividend growth. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.15 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.61%, as recorded on January 18. The company can be added to dividend portfolios alongside dividend stocks like Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV).JPMorgan gave a positive outlook to the consumer companies heading into 2023 and raised its price target on PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) to $150 with a Neutral rating on the shares.Lindsell Train mentioned PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“At this point, it may help to give a further example of these self-reinforcing moats to illustrate the idea, drawing from the consumer franchises side of our portfolio. In our view, strong consumer brands can similarly exhibit Lindycompatible anti-ageing properties. Consider, that the longer a company invests in its brands through advertising and R&amp;D, the stronger and more resonant they may get. When successful, a self-sustaining feedback loop is established, whereby it becomes ever harder to recreate a heritage-rich brand from scratch, raising barriers to entry, and proportionately increasing its likely lifespan. There are plenty of long-lived portfolio franchises I could reference here, but I’ve gone with PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP); partly because we have good time-series stats on it (beware data bias!) but also, as I hope will become evident, because Pepsi over its 129 years has succeeded in creating some wonderfully deep moats.With Pepsi Cola you get the flagship soft drinks brand, which is both global and generational, but you also get the Frito-Lay salty snacks portfolio assembled alongside it, claiming nearly 40% of the global market. That’s ten-times greater than the nearest competitor and likely higher than the next 65 competitors combined. These are exceptionally strong global bands with market shares to match; the long-term empirical result being Pepsi’s dividend record which over the past 66 years (as far back as we’ve been able to go) has compounded at an annualised rate of 10%. Pepsi is no ‘in at the ground floor’ start-up today, but it wasn’t six decades ago either. Early growth investor Philip Fisher put it well when in 1958 (two years into Pepsi’s current winning streak) he wrote of “companies which in spite of outstanding prospects of major further growth are so financially strong, with roots going so deep into the economic soil, that they qualify under the general classification of ‘institutional stocks’”. PepsiCo fits this description well…” (Click here to see the full text) Click to continue reading and see Dividend Aristocrats Ranked: Top 5 According To Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:13 Best Communication Services Stocks To Invest In12 Best DRIP Stocks To Own12 Best Holding Company Stocks To Invest InDisclosure.

Alec Young, chief investment strategist at MAPsignals, told BNN Bloomberg in the beginning of January 2023 that dividend stocks are not only a source of passive income in a volatile environment, but these equities have also contributed about 40% to the overall performance of the US stock market. He noted that data suggests dividend stocks are the best performers during periods of peak inflation, which is the current case for the United States, with CPI inflation between 6% and 7%. Dividend stocks outperform non-dividend payers by a significant margin in times of economic turbulence, as per Young. Similarly, Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFi, anticipates dividend ETFs to be favored this year. He appreciates the Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index Fund (NYSE:VYM), which has companies with above-average dividend yields and provides exposure to defensive sectors. For tech exposure, Rosenbluth recommends the ALPS Sector Dividend Dogs ETF (NYSE:SDOG), a fund that has the five highest-yielding S&amp;P 500 stocks across 10 sectors, with equal weight holdings. For more insights into dividend equities, investors can also check out 11 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats to Buy, 12 Cheap Monthly Dividend Stocks To Buy, and 11 Best Dividend Stocks Yielding Over 6%.

We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.”12. Walmart Inc.

Its dividend yield is 0.8%. Earnings over the next 3-5 years are forecasted to grow at ~10%. The current P/E multiple is a very pricey 34x for such growth rate. Now, Costco is an outstanding business with consistent profits and cash flows. However, the price that you pay is important (and you tend to pay a very high price for a “cheery consensus”) and if the earnings multiple comes down to say 30x, you internal rate of return (IRR) over the next 4-5 years will be around 6-7% from holding Costco’s stock. It's a decent market-like return, but nothing to be excited about (only a few percentage points over risk-free rate).”10. Broadcom Inc.

As the largest refiner in the US, the company has benefitted from wide “crack spreads,” or the margin between the cost of crude oil and the petroleum products extracted from it. Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industry wide has been in steady decline since 2019. We are pleased that Exxon has been using its strong cash flows to reduce debt and to return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.”7. AbbVie Inc.

The company is on track with increased investments toward core brands and innovations. Strength across its Coors Light and Miller Lite brands, as well as its beyond-beer approach, bodes well.Molson Coors reported a top-line beat in the third quarter of 2022, driven by the continued benefit from a favorable sales mix and improved pricing trends across regions. Sales also improved year over year. On a constant-currency basis, net sales rose 7.9%. Net sales per hectoliter increased 9.2% on a brand-volume basis.However, consumer inflationary pressures, a strike at its Quebec brewery and the cycling of a solid shipment in the prior-year quarter hurt the company’s results. Consequently, its adjusted earnings per share declined 24.6% year over year and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Despite the odds, shares of Molson Coors have gained 0.3% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 6.5%. The stock’s performance also compared favorably against the Consumer Staples sector’s fall of 3.5% and the S&amp;P 500’s decline of 13.2% in the same period.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s current financial year’s sales suggests growth of 4.3% from the year-ago period’s reported number, while earnings estimates indicate a decline of 7%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Molson Coors’ Strategies on TrackMolson Coors is witnessing significant benefits from its revitalization plan focused on achieving sustainable top-line growth by streamlining the organization and reinvesting resources into its brands and capabilities. It intends to invest in iconic brands and growth opportunities in the above-premium beer space; expand in adjacencies and beyond beer, without hampering the support for its existing large brands; and create digital competencies for commercial functions, supply-chain-related system capabilities and employees.To facilitate these investments, TAP plans to generate savings of $150 million by simplifying its structure. It is also building on the strength of its iconic core brands. Additionally, the company’s cost-savings program, announced in 2020, targets delivering cost savings of $600 million over three years.Molson Coors is also committed to growing its market share through innovation and premiumization. With a view to accelerating portfolio premiumization, the company has been aggressively growing its above-premium portfolio in the past few years.The company highlighted that it is making efforts to change the shape of its product portfolio and expand in growth areas. Its U.S. above-premium portfolio witnessed sales that outpaced its U.S. economy portfolio, driven by rapid growth of its hard seltzers, the successful launch of Simply Spiked Lemonade, and the continued strength in Blue Moon and Peroni’s.Despite the continued uncertainties related to the pandemic, as well as rising cost inflation, management retained the 2022 view. Net sales are projected to grow in the mid-single digits in constant currency. Underlying EBIT is likely to grow year over year in the high-single digits in constant currency. Underlying depreciation and amortization are projected to be $700 million, plus or minus 5%, compared with the $750 million mentioned earlier.Story continuesHeadwinds to AddressMolson Coors has been witnessing lower brand and financial volume. Sluggishness in the America segment, owing to lower Canada shipments and continued impacts of the Québec labor strike, hurt brand volumes in the third quarter. Financial volume was hurt by a soft industry performance in the Americas and the Québec labor strike, as well as the impacts of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and consumer inflationary pressures across Central and Eastern European countries.Inflationary pressures are likely to be other headwinds. COGS per hectoliter continues to be affected by cost inflation on materials, transportation and energy costs, and mix impacts from both portfolio premiumization. Molson Coors has been witnessing weakened consumer demand across the beer industry in its Central and Eastern European regions. This is mainly due to muted disposable income stemming from inflationary pressure.Stocks to Bet OnWe highlighted three better-ranked stocks in the Consumer Staples sector, namely Anheuser-Busch InBev BUD, The Coca-Cola Company KO and PepsiCo Inc.

As much as Suh enjoys sacking quarterbacks and tackling running backs - his Philadelphia Eagles are on a playoff push hoping to reach the Super Bowl - there is something else he enjoys just as much: Teaching children about financial literacy.""They need to understand how to take care of their finances,"" said Suh, whose Suh Family Foundation, with wife Katya, is partnering with the firm Intuit Inc to bring personal finance curriculum to schools around the United States. ""Especially in marginalized communities, this can be a tough conversation to have, so I want to bring some light to it.""Some NFL players and other well-paid professional athletes run into money troubles after their playing careers end. Indeed, when young players suddenly come into millions of dollars, without a lot of financial education, amid high-spending lifestyles, with agents and managers and entourages all taking a cut - the money can go away much more quickly than one would think.In contrast, Suh, 36, has been mapping out his post-football life for years. He traces his money savvy back to his childhood in Portland, Oregon, and his parents - his mother was a teacher, his father was an engineer. As a kid, he would go to job sites with his dad, doing odd jobs like sweeping and cleaning, while his mom would give him $10 or $20 to cut lawns in the neighborhood.In fact, it was his mother who first introduced him to the importance of credit scores, by adding him as an authorized user to one of her cards, in order to build his own record.Story continues""When you get to the NFL, one of the first things they do is help you run your credit - and my score was almost 800,"" an exceptional credit score, Suh said. ""That was all thanks to the lessons my mom gave me.""It is a long way from those early beginnings to his current line of work, where his biggest contract averaged more than $19 million a year, according to sports financials site Spotrac.But Suh did fall into a typical money trap early in his career, spending more than he should have.""Most athletes make the mistake of looking around the locker room and comparing themselves to other guys,"" Suh said. ""You see veterans with their Mercedes, and end up living beyond your means. Personally I made the mistake of going out to nightclubs and spending $25,000 to $50,000, versus taking that money and investing it.""After those missteps he became more thoughtful about building wealth for his family, and - knowing that in the NFL, ""your career could be over at a moment's notice"" - has worked diligently at building his own empire.That has included starting his own real estate development company, with multiple projects completed and more underway. He also steers an investment portfolio under his House of Spears Management, owns several restaurants and is a fan of private equity, which includes working with famed VCs Andreessen Horowitz.His business decisions and his charitable work - everything from providing scholarships at the University of Nebraska, his alma mater, to helping victims of domestic violence in Tampa - are undertaken with the help of his wife.""I would say she is more risk-averse than I am,"" Suh said with a laugh. ""She pulls me back on some investments, and says, 'Hey, maybe we should wait and see.'""His financial literacy curriculum for kids includes hitting all the basics - spending, saving, taxes, budgeting and investing. It is his hope that beyond the current target cities, the money smarts initiative with Intuit will go global.Suh's main advice for kids?""Keep it simple: Spend only what you need, and save the rest,"" he said. ""Learn to create and grow generational wealth, which I what I'm trying to do for my twin baby boys. And don't be afraid to ask for help, or seek mentorship. Like my mom always taught me, 'Don't be afraid to ask questions - and there are no stupid questions.'"" (Editing by Lauren Young and Will Dunham Follow us @ReutersMoney)]"

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest Colorado Companies and Stocks.If all U.S. states were countries, Colorado would be the 46th largest country in the world with a GDP of $436 billion in 2021, larger than the UAE, Bangladesh and South Africa. Currently, Colorado's economy has been outpacing the growth demonstrated by the U.S. overall, signaling its strong recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. However, there are significant challenges being faced by the state as well including high inflation, rising interest rates and continuing supply chain shortages.25 biggest Colorado companies and stocksloneroc/Shutterstock.comCurrently, Colorado's unemployment rate stands at 3.5% and while not among the states with the lowest unemployment rates, it still had the 10th best comeback in terms of jobs after Covid-19. This has been led by sharp increases in various states including professional and business services, and leisure and hospitality. In fact, it is now one of only 15 states which has reached pre-pandemic levels though some important sectors are still behind their peak employment levels before the pandemic struck, which demonstrates that the recovery isn't exactly even. While 2022 is expected to show positive national GDP growth, the state's GDP did contract for the second consecutive quarter.Colorado's diversified economy means it is home to a host of major industries which include the aerospace industry, and ranks number 1 in the nation in terms of private aerospace employment. In terms of concentration of STEM workers, Colorado ranks 4th in the country while according to the Milken Institute, the state ranked second for technology and science, all of which bode really well for the biggest Colorado companies and stocks.But perhaps the most important ranking is being the best state to start a business in and in this metric, Colorado ranks an incredible second in the U.S. according to FitSmallBusiness.com as well as third in startup early job creation according to the Kauffman Foundation. Incentives and tax credits are offered to companies and businesses, especially those creating growth and jobs which includes better access to capital for early-stage advanced industries businesses by reducing investor risk. Other programs provide support and relief to new businesses which are located in distressed areas of rural Colorado.Story continuesTo determine the biggest Colorado companies and stocks, we obtained all companies which are part of Fortune 500. Since Fortune 500 didn't have 25 companies headquartered in the state, we then searched for other major companies in the state. In fact, the biggest company in Colorado doesn't appear in Fortune 500 as it is a subsidiary of an international company. We obtained revenue from Fortune 500 or the annual reports of each company while the market cap was determined from Yahoo Finance. Where the company wasn't listed, its ranking was based on revenue alone. We then assigned 60% weightage to revenue and 40% to market cap. Thanks to a poor year for stocks, the average returns for these companies over the past year -11.8%. So, let's now take a look at the most important companies to Colorado's economy, starting with:25.

Choua and family-husband, KongPheng, daughters Yuna and Arinya and son Vegeta faced multiple challenges that brought them to the point of seeking a better future.""We really hoped to have our own home. We live in a small space on the second floor with no room for our children to play and with no yard for them to play outside. We also have so many mice in our home, no matter what we do. We know it's not safe for our children to play surrounded by mouse waste daily.""Choua's friends and family urged her to apply to Greater Fox Cities Area Habitat for Humanity's homeownership program. She did.""Getting accepted was a weight off our shoulders,"" she says. ""All we have wanted was enough room for our family and a healthy place to raise our kids.""""We all felt very excited and cannot wait to see our new home. We look forward to celebrating holidays and birthdays in our home. Home, to me, is the happiness you feel, and the family around you.""""We no longer have to stress about where we will raise our children, or if it's safe, or if we can find a place to live. Our goal is to take great care of our house and keep it clean and maintained.""The family will move into their new home in Appleton, Wisconsin next year. This house is being built as part of Habitat for Humanity's BuildBetter with Whirlpool initiative, an expansion of Habitat's existing BuildBetter program that is building more than 250 climate-resilient and energy-efficient homes to help hundreds of families in need of affordable housing over the next three years.The family's new seven-bedroom home will have energy-efficient features to help reduce the costs of utilities. Chou and KongPheng will also receive an energy-efficient refrigerator and range, which Whirlpool Corporation donates to every Habitat-built home in North America.The broadened initiative sits at the heart of Whirlpool Corporation's global corporate social responsibility strategy ""House+Home"": building houses and improving housing adequacy to ensure everyone has a comfortable place to live and developing resilient, vibrant neighborhoods through education and community development in the communities where it does business. Through House+Home, Whirlpool Corporation will help Habitat for Humanity construct homes designed to better withstand storm winds, natural disasters and other severe weather events that are intensifying.Story continuesChoua is grateful for the support she received as she attained home ownership. ""Habitat has changed my outlook on the future,"" she says. ""They've taught me to know better and take better care of my property and home.""She is looking forward to being a responsible homeowner. ""They've also taught me how to be a good neighbor. The first thing we will do in our home is make it beautiful. We no longer have to stress about where we will raise our children, or if it's safe, or if we can find a place to live. Our goal is to take great care of our house and keep it clean and maintained.""We are so proud of all the hard work we put in to make a Habitat home possible for our family. We are so thankful that this is happening.""Choua's children are also looking forward to their new home. Yuna cannot wait to decorate her room with lots of Hello Kitty and fairy and LED lights. Vegeta wants to decorate his room with dinosaurs and Sonic the Hedgehog.

However, the company has an impressive earnings surprise history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters while missing in one.Let’s see how things are shaping up for General Electric this earnings season.General Electric Company Price and EPS SurpriseGeneral Electric Company Price and EPS SurpriseGeneral Electric Company price-eps-surprise | General Electric Company QuoteFactors to NoteGeneral Electric’s fourth-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from strong performance of the Aerospace segment owing to continued recovery in the commercial market. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Aerospace segment revenues in the fourth quarter indicates a 25.9% jump from the year-ago reported number.However, lower US onshore wind volumes and continued pressure from onshore North America market dynamics is likely to have weighed on the Renewable Energy segment’s performance. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Renewable Energy segment revenues hints at an approximate 1% dip from the year-ago reported figure.Supply-chain disruptions, including labor and material shortages and high logistics costs, are expected to have dented GE’s bottom-line performance. Given the substantial international presence, adverse foreign currency movements might have impacted sales in the to-be-reported quarter.What Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for General Electric this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates, which is not the case here, as elaborated below. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Earnings ESP: General Electric has an Earnings ESP of -5.82% as the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged at $1.04, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.10.

The bottom line declined significantly year over year. Total revenues of $19,084 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19,035 million. The top line increased in low-single digits year over year, thanks to higher Aerospace revenues, driven by growth in commercial services due to a significant increase in shop visits, strong spare part sales and favorable prices.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider as, according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this reporting cycle.Caterpillar CAT has an Earnings ESP of +1.14% and a Zacks Rank #3.

The consensus estimate suggests an increase of 64% from the year-ago reported number.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s revenues of $6.1 billion indicates a 9.8% improvement from the year-ago reported figure.Factors to ConsiderThe West Texas Intermediate crude price was considerably higher in the fourth quarter of 2022. High oil prices were favorable for the exploration and production operations in the December-end quarter.With higher exploration operations, the demand for oilfield services was promising since oilfield service firms help upstream companies efficiently set up oil wells. Thus, the higher oil price is likely to have aided Baker Hughes’ oilfield service business in the fourth quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating income from the company’s Oilfield Services is pegged at $384 million, suggesting a massive increase from $256 million in the December-end quarter of last year.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating income from the company’s Digital Solutions segment is pegged at $36.2 million, suggesting a decline from $51 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of 67 cents per share on revenues of $5.6 billion.Let’s delve into the factors that might have influenced the oilfield service firm’s performance in the December quarter. But it’s worth taking a look at HAL’s previous-quarter performance first.Highlights of Q3 Earnings &amp; Surprise HistoryIn the last reported quarter, this Houston, TX-based provider of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells beat the consensus mark on stronger-than-expected profit from both its divisions. Halliburton had reported adjusted net income per share of 60 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents. Revenues of $5.4 billion also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.3 billion.HAL beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, which resulted in an earnings surprise of 5.5%, on average. This is depicted in the graph below:Halliburton Company Price and EPS SurpriseHalliburton Company Price and EPS SurpriseHalliburton Company price-eps-surprise | Halliburton Company QuoteTrend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third-quarter bottom line has remained unchanged in the past seven days. The estimated figure indicates an 86.1% improvement year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues suggests a 30.5% increase from the year-ago period.Factors to ConsiderDespite pulling back from their multi-year highs, oil and natural gas prices have remained robust due to stable demand and geopolitical tensions. Consequently, drilling activity — an important factor for services companies — has been picking up. In the United States, a region on which Halliburton is highly dependent, rig count at the end of the fourth quarter was 779 compared with 765 three months ago and 586 a year back.This is in sync with the strength in commodity prices. The number of active units in Canada and international markets has gained sharply too. The steady growth in rig count is an encouraging indicator of contracting activity.Considering the improved operating environment, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter operating income of Completion &amp; Production, and Drilling &amp; Evaluation is pegged at $629 million and $364 million, respectively, indicating an increase of 81.3% and 35.3% year over year.Story continuesWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model predicts an earnings beat for Halliburton this season.

Alec Young, chief investment strategist at MAPsignals, told BNN Bloomberg in the beginning of January 2023 that dividend stocks are not only a source of passive income in a volatile environment, but these equities have also contributed about 40% to the overall performance of the US stock market. He noted that data suggests dividend stocks are the best performers during periods of peak inflation, which is the current case for the United States, with CPI inflation between 6% and 7%. Dividend stocks outperform non-dividend payers by a significant margin in times of economic turbulence, as per Young. Similarly, Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFi, anticipates dividend ETFs to be favored this year. He appreciates the Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index Fund (NYSE:VYM), which has companies with above-average dividend yields and provides exposure to defensive sectors. For tech exposure, Rosenbluth recommends the ALPS Sector Dividend Dogs ETF (NYSE:SDOG), a fund that has the five highest-yielding S&amp;P 500 stocks across 10 sectors, with equal weight holdings. For more insights into dividend equities, investors can also check out 11 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats to Buy, 12 Cheap Monthly Dividend Stocks To Buy, and 11 Best Dividend Stocks Yielding Over 6%.

We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.”12. Walmart Inc.

Its dividend yield is 0.8%. Earnings over the next 3-5 years are forecasted to grow at ~10%. The current P/E multiple is a very pricey 34x for such growth rate. Now, Costco is an outstanding business with consistent profits and cash flows. However, the price that you pay is important (and you tend to pay a very high price for a “cheery consensus”) and if the earnings multiple comes down to say 30x, you internal rate of return (IRR) over the next 4-5 years will be around 6-7% from holding Costco’s stock. It's a decent market-like return, but nothing to be excited about (only a few percentage points over risk-free rate).”10. Broadcom Inc.

Horton (NYSE:DHI) On Your Watchlist?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-time-put-d-r-152545925.html,1674055545,STORY,['DHI'],"[It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide D.R. Horton with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. View our latest analysis for D.R. Horton How Fast Is D.R. Horton Growing?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. To the delight of shareholders, D.R. Horton has achieved impressive annual EPS growth of 58%, compound, over the last three years. Growth that fast may well be fleeting, but it should be more than enough to pique the interest of the wary stock pickers.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Not all of D.R. Horton's revenue last year was revenue from operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers used in this article might not be the best representation of the underlying business. The good news is that D.R. Horton is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 3.6 percentage points to 23%, over the last year. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.Story continuesIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of D.R. Horton's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Are D.R. Horton Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of D.R. Horton, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$329m. Holders should find this level of insider commitment quite encouraging, since it would ensure that the leaders of the company would also experience their success, or failure, with the stock.Is D.R. Horton Worth Keeping An Eye On?D.R. Horton's earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. That sort of growth is nothing short of eye-catching, and the large investment held by insiders should certainly brighten the view of the company. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So based on this quick analysis, we do think it's worth considering D.R. Horton for a spot on your watchlist. You still need to take note of risks, for example - D.R. Horton has   3 warning signs  (and 2 which make us uncomfortable)  we think you should know about.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

Horton (DHI) to Report Q1 Earnings: Here's What to Expect,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/d-r-horton-dhi-report-140802240.html,1674050882,STORY,['DHI'],"[D.R. Horton Inc. DHI is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Dec 31, 2022) results on Jan 24, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings and revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.7% and 4%, respectively. Yet, earnings and revenues of this homebuilding company grew 26% and 19%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figures.Markedly, D.R. Horton reported better-than-expected earnings in 14 of the last 15 quarters.The Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings has moved south over the past seven days to $2.25 from $2.26 per share. This indicates a 29% decrease from the year-ago earnings of $3.17 per share. The consensus mark for revenues is $6.5 billion, suggesting a 7.9% year-over-year decline.D.R. Horton, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  D.R. Horton, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseD.R. Horton, Inc. price-eps-surprise | D.R. Horton, Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteD.R. Horton’s Homebuilding revenues are expected to have declined in the fiscal first quarter from the year-ago level due to soft housing demand and prevailing industry headwinds. The U.S. housing market has been grappling with uncertainties arising from high mortgage rates. This may have impacted DHI’s revenues and orders in the to-be-reported quarter. DHI anticipates total revenues of $6-$6.8 billion.Also, higher land, labor and material costs are expected to reflect on fiscal first-quarter margins to some extent. The company has been witnessing significant supply-chain disruptions, including shortages and delayed delivery of certain building materials and a tight labor market. These may have created difficulties for DHI in fulfilling customer demand, thereby affecting deliveries.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Homebuilding revenues of $6.21 billion suggests a 7.1% decrease from a year ago. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the average selling price of homes closed is pegged at $387,000, suggesting growth from the year-ago level of $384,000.The same for Financial Services revenues of $148 million suggests a fall of 19.6% from the year-ago level of $184 million.For the fiscal first quarter, lower lumber prices and a higher average price of settlements are helping this one of the country’s largest homebuilders. In addition, the company’s industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and affordable product offerings across multiple brands may have somewhat aided the top line.Story continuesOther ProjectionsDHI expects fiscal first-quarter homes closed within 15,000-16,500. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for homes closed is pegged at 15,676 units, suggesting a fall of 14.8% from the year-ago period.DHI expects the home sales gross margin for the fiscal first quarter to be within a 23-24% range. DHI anticipates homebuilding SG&amp;A (as a percentage of revenues) for the fiscal first quarter to be 8-8.4%.Financial services’ pre-tax profit margin is expected to be around 20%. The income tax rate is likely to be 23% for the fiscal first quarter. DHI expects home orders to decline 25-30% in the fiscal first quarter.The consensus estimate for net sales orders is currently pegged at 18,394 units. This suggests a decrease from 21,522 units a year ago. The same for the backlog is currently pegged at 18,400 units, which suggests a decrease from 29,347 units a year ago. The consensus estimate for the value of the backlog is $7.33 billion, implying a significant decline from $11.063 billion in the corresponding fiscal 2022 quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for D.R. Horton for the quarter to be reported. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: DHI has an Earnings ESP of -4.40%.

The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index was 35, according to data released Wednesday. That is up four points from the prior month, beating expectations.While a reading of 35 is still negative – anything below 50 is – it is the highest reading since October, when the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage peaked over 7%. It is now back down to around 6.23%.Shares of KB Home (NYSE:KBH) rose 1.7% on Wednesday. Shares of DR Horton Inc (NYSE:DHI) were up 0.8%, and PulteGroup Inc (NYSE:PHM) shares rose 0.7%.The index measures builder confidence in the market for newly built single-family homes. It dipped to 31 in December. At this time last year, it was reading 83.NAHB Chair Jerry Konter, who is a developer in Savannah, Georgia, said in a press release that many home builders continue to use incentives such as price reductions to improve sales. The boost in sentiment “also means that cycle lows for permits and starts are likely near, and a rebound for home building could be underway later in 2023,” he said.The index measuring current sales condition rose four points to 40, while sales expectations for the next six months rose two points to 37. The buyer traffic index rose three points, to 23.NAHB is still forecasting a drop in single-family starts this year compared to 2022, the statement said.Related ArticlesHome builder sentiment improves for the first time in a yearRobinhood must face lawsuit concerning order flowsAirlines sound bullish on travel demand despite recession risk]"

I was actually surprised that Alaskan Airlines did as well as they did. But that came in at number two, and then Southwest at number three. So those were your top three. And you could see where some of the rest stacked up. Jetblue bringing up the caboose here. And let's take a look at some of the year over year performance to see where airlines have trended.And one thing that you can make note of is the fact that Delta, yeah, they've held on to that number one position for two years now. However, one of the biggest moves that we did see to the downside, yeah, that Spirit here went from number four all the way to a net, net number seven at the end of the day. And then additionally here, we're kind of looking at Jetblue. And one interesting thing about where all of these airlines ranked, I mentioned Alaskan Airlines and how they came in overall at number two. They were actually the second worst, though, in mishandled baggage. Only American Airlines did worse in handling people's baggage.Story continuesHowever, on the other side of this, you had Southwest that was actually the best in complaints, however, with the caveat there, because this was actually measured over 12 months that concluded in October. So perhaps some of those cancellations and the headaches that really plagued travelers who were flying with Southwest over the 2022 holiday season, that best showed up or was apparent in some of the canceled flight recordings as well there because that was more of a full year scope there, Rachelle. So that's where we really saw that kind of stack up.And in terms of some of the stock price movement here on the day on this report because at the end of the day, it's a question of how investors evaluate this, but also what do consumers read into this, and how does this change their own perception, and perhaps who they may book with in the future? You're taking a look at some of the travel stocks here on the day. And on-- and this is on a one-year basis, so I'm going to put this on an intraday basis here, so we can get a good look at things.United Airlines, you're seeing that lower by about 2 and 1/2% on the day. It's important to remember that that's a company that did just report earnings as well. And they just had their call at 10:30 AM Eastern time, so that's down 2 and 1/2%, perhaps moving a little bit more on earnings. But you've got Delta Airlines number one in the list. That's up by about 7/10 of a percent.And then just lastly here, let me pull up Jetblue. That was the worst overall in the list. That's down by about 9/10 of a percent. But if there's one thing that customers repeatedly come back to and do comparison on, it's price, Rachelle. So we'll see if any of this perhaps moves the dial in one way or another when it comes down to their own booking strategies in the future, too.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And you never forget a bad experience on a flight. So I know that the holiday kerfuffle for Southwest especially, they're saying that might cost the company about $825 million. So not only did it cost it, like, that top spot in terms of best and worst airlines, also hitting their bottom line as well. I remember every bad experience. I still hold a grudge against Continental Airlines. They lost my luggage when I was a kid. I never forgot it to this day.BRAD SMITH: Rachelle, I 100% second that. I remember which airline I've said the most prayers on, and that has been Spirit Airlines repeatedly in the past.RACHELLE AKUFFO: You never do forget it. Great stuff there. Brad Smith there for us.]"

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Principal Financial Group (NASDAQ:PFG). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. View our latest analysis for Principal Financial Group Principal Financial Group's Improving ProfitsInvestors and investment funds chase profits, and that means share prices tend rise with positive earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. Which is why EPS growth is looked upon so favourably. Commendations have to be given in seeing that Principal Financial Group grew its EPS from US$6.30 to US$21.63, in one short year. When you see earnings grow that quickly, it often means good things ahead for the company. This could point to the business hitting a point of inflection.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. Our analysis has highlighted that Principal Financial Group's revenue from operations did not account for all of their revenue in the previous 12 months, so our analysis of its margins might not accurately reflect the underlying business. The music to the ears of Principal Financial Group shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 15% to 36% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.Story continuesIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Principal Financial Group's future EPS 100% free.Are Principal Financial Group Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Principal Financial Group, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Given insiders own a significant chunk of shares, currently valued at US$70m, they have plenty of motivation to push the business to succeed. That's certainly enough to let shareholders know that management will be very focussed on long term growth.Is Principal Financial Group Worth Keeping An Eye On?Principal Financial Group's earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. This level of EPS growth does wonders for attracting investment, and the large insider investment in the company is just the cherry on top. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. So based on this quick analysis, we do think it's worth considering Principal Financial Group for a spot on your watchlist. What about risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Principal Financial Group   you should know about.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

For example, at my company, over three decades ago, our Chairman and CEO Dan Amos said, ""I don't want everyone at the table to look like me,"" and he began building a culture of diversity and inclusion that still stands strong today. A big part of this is active listening. It's key. Whether you're in a position of leadership or an individual contributor, getting direct feedback will help you better understand how you can best serve your employees, consumers, communities and each other - and by putting what you learn into action, you're building trust and rapport with those around you.What are your ""5 things employers should do to attract and retain top talent during the labor shortage?""A competitive benefits and compensation package is critical in the current environment. Many companies are willing to offer top dollar in sign-on bonuses and relocation, so if that talent is critical to the business, employers may have to take special measures for retention. Untraditional services and perks like extended childcare benefits, personal leave, or family leave options are a few trends we're seeing.Companies need to be clear on what their strategy is moving forward, and honest communication to employees will be key. With the economy's current unpredictability, companies need to keep employees informed and engaged on priorities and what lies ahead in terms of market changes, special projects, etc.Flexibility in work location is also a hot topic. Many workers are linking their physical and mental wellness to being able to work remotely or in a hybrid setting. Try to be flexible, if possible, but the business must not suffer as a result.Clarity on career paths is mandatory. As discussed previously, the worker of now is at a crossroads in their quest for the career that they love. To help them, employers must make career paths obtainable and clear.Diversity at all levels is key.

According to a report by Wall Street Journal, companies in the S&amp;P 500 distributed over $561 billion in dividends last year, compared with $511.2 billion in 2021. Moreover, analysts see another record for dividend spending this year.Dividend stocks have surpassed the inflation rate over the years, recording their best performance during periods of high inflation. Dividends have grown at an average of 5.7% per year since 1957 versus a 3.63% growth in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) during the same time, as reported by Wisdom Tree. Similarly, the S&amp;P 500 dividends grew by 5.45% over the last 30 years, compared with a 2.51% growth in the CPI.

As of December 31, high dividend stocks delivered an 8.38% return to shareholders, compared with a 29.1% decline in growth equities and a 7.54% drop in value stocks.Achilleas Taxildaris, a portfolio manager at Bristol Gate Capital Partners, spoke to Morningstar about dividend stocks in his January interview.

He further emphasized the significance of strong fundamentals when investing in dividend stocks.Some of the companies that have shown solid dividend growth over the years include Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV).

The downdraft in the market during the quarter led to a pile-on. We are being patient with our investment in Medtronic because the company continues to be a strong free cash flow generator and is attractively priced, with a FCF yield of 5% on trailing one-year numbers and a dividend yield of 3%. Medtronic is under new management that is focused on growing the company’s top line, reinvesting in R&amp;D, returning cash to shareholders and growing operating profits. We like new management’s strategy and believe new product launches, increased surgery visits, sound M&amp;A transactions and a shareholder returns focus, should reinvigorate the business. We added to our positions in these health care names during the quarter.”13.

The collective value of stakes owned by these hedge funds is over $4 billion.Third Point mentioned Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) in its recently-published Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)11. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59An American multinational beverage company, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is another one of the best dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds. The stock also gained positive ratings from analysts due to its strong performance. In December, Atlantic Equities raised its price target on the stock to $69 with an Overweight rating on the shares, highlighting its ongoing investment and strong execution.The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.85%, as of January 18. The company is one of the strongest dividend payers in the market, making consistent dividend payments since 1920. Moreover, it has raised its payouts for the past 60 years.As of the end of Q3 2022, 59 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned stakes in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), with a collective value of $25 billion. Berkshire Hathaway owned the largest stake in the company, worth over $22.4 billion.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”10. The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) is an Ohio-based manufacturing company that specializes in paint and coating materials.

In December, both Citigroup and JPMorgan raised their price targets on the stock to $270 and $260, respectively.The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 43 years. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.60 per share for a dividend yield of 0.97%, as recorded on January 18.The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) is one of the best dividend stocks according to hedge funds, as 63 funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in the company in Q3 2022, up from 52 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a consolidated value of over $2.8 billion.ClearBridge Investments mentioned The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“The third strategy is buying growth companies with idiosyncratic or stock-specific catalysts unrelated to the direction of the market like The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW). The stock is an example of a company we categorize in our cyclical bucket that should experience a step change in earnings over the medium to long term with solid execution and its ability to pass through price increases. While relative performance has been challenged by binary decisions around a handful of mega cap technology stocks, we’re entering a lower-growth period in which we’ve historically delivered strong relative results from our balanced approach.”9.

(NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is an American multinational retail corporation.

I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”7. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is an American manufacturer and marketer of consumer goods and other personal care and hygiene products.

Among these hedge funds, Bridgewater Associates was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”6. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is a popular dividend stock among hedge funds, as 72 funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in the company in Q3 2022, compared with 65 in the previous quarter.

The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.15 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.61%, as recorded on January 18. The company can be added to dividend portfolios alongside dividend stocks like Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV).JPMorgan gave a positive outlook to the consumer companies heading into 2023 and raised its price target on PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) to $150 with a Neutral rating on the shares.Lindsell Train mentioned PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“At this point, it may help to give a further example of these self-reinforcing moats to illustrate the idea, drawing from the consumer franchises side of our portfolio. In our view, strong consumer brands can similarly exhibit Lindycompatible anti-ageing properties. Consider, that the longer a company invests in its brands through advertising and R&amp;D, the stronger and more resonant they may get. When successful, a self-sustaining feedback loop is established, whereby it becomes ever harder to recreate a heritage-rich brand from scratch, raising barriers to entry, and proportionately increasing its likely lifespan. There are plenty of long-lived portfolio franchises I could reference here, but I’ve gone with PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP); partly because we have good time-series stats on it (beware data bias!) but also, as I hope will become evident, because Pepsi over its 129 years has succeeded in creating some wonderfully deep moats.With Pepsi Cola you get the flagship soft drinks brand, which is both global and generational, but you also get the Frito-Lay salty snacks portfolio assembled alongside it, claiming nearly 40% of the global market. That’s ten-times greater than the nearest competitor and likely higher than the next 65 competitors combined. These are exceptionally strong global bands with market shares to match; the long-term empirical result being Pepsi’s dividend record which over the past 66 years (as far back as we’ve been able to go) has compounded at an annualised rate of 10%. Pepsi is no ‘in at the ground floor’ start-up today, but it wasn’t six decades ago either. Early growth investor Philip Fisher put it well when in 1958 (two years into Pepsi’s current winning streak) he wrote of “companies which in spite of outstanding prospects of major further growth are so financially strong, with roots going so deep into the economic soil, that they qualify under the general classification of ‘institutional stocks’”. PepsiCo fits this description well…” (Click here to see the full text) Click to continue reading and see Dividend Aristocrats Ranked: Top 5 According To Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:13 Best Communication Services Stocks To Invest In12 Best DRIP Stocks To Own12 Best Holding Company Stocks To Invest InDisclosure.

HCA, Universal Health Services Inc. UHS, Acadia Healthcare Co. ACHC and Tenet Healthcare Corp. THC.Industry: HospitalLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2039974/investors-should-watch-these-4-hospital-stocks-despite-headwindsThe operating environment for hospital companies is improving with increasing non-Covid utilization, outpatient surgeries and patient days. Staffing challenges are expected to decrease this year. However, recession fears, inflation and resultant escalating costs are eating up Zacks Medical-Hospital industry players' margins.Growing competition in this market remains a common theme. Technological innovations and adoptions are expected to continue boosting hospital companies' efficiency and generating cost savings. Leading industry players like HCA Healthcare Inc., Universal Health Services Inc., Acadia Healthcare Co. and Tenet Healthcare Corp. are set to benefit from these developments.About the Industry The Zacks Medical-Hospital industry comprises for-profit hospital companies that provide healthcare through different types of hospitals, such as acute care, rehabilitation and psychiatric. These hospital entities are engaged in internal medicine, general surgery, cardiology, oncology, neurosurgery, orthopedics and obstetrics, telehealth services, mental health care and diagnostic and emergency services.Revenues of these companies depend on inpatient occupancy levels, medical and ancillary services ordered by physicians and provided to patients, and the volume of outpatient procedures. These hospital companies receive payments for patient services from the government under the Medicare program, Medicaid or similar programs, managed care plans (including plans offered through the American Health Benefit Exchanges), private insurers and directly from patients.Story continues4 Key Trends to Watch in the Hospital IndustryImproving Volumes: Going ahead, non-COVID admissions are expected to continue rising as the intensity of COVID-related utilization of resources declines. Demand for elective procedures is expected to drive patient volumes. Growth in admissions, outpatient surgeries and Medicare reimbursements and deferred procedures can support hospital companies' revenues. However, inflationary pressures and financial constraints can force patients to delay addressing some non-emergency medical needs. The benefits of the Affordable Care Act and similar safety nets can provide customers with some respite, which can help patients navigate tough times.Increasing Expenses: With rising patient volumes, operating costs are bound to go up. High salaries, wages and benefits and increasing costs of hospital supplies due to inflation will likely reduce margins. Also, growth-project investments will keep expenses elevated, putting pressure on the bottom line. Even though labor shortages are expected to keep creating headaches for the industry players, the situation is expected to improve in the coming days. Moreover, renegotiating contracts with suppliers and vendors will provide an impetus.Growth in the Elderly Population: Steady advancements in science, nutrition and healthcare enable the senior population to witness constant growth. This can result in rising demand for hospital services in the long term. The U.S. Census Bureau's revised report suggests that individuals above 65 years are projected to be one of the fastest-growing segments of the country's population, reflecting a climb from 17% in 2020 to 21% in 2030. This demographic change and the rising incidence of diseases will likely be industry drivers. Plus, the increasing number of people signing up for healthcare plans through the Affordable Care Act indicates fewer challenges to visiting hospitals in the future.Technological Improvements: Technological innovations, improvements and wider adoption will continue to be a major theme in the hospital space. The trend should optimize hospital services, minimize unnecessary expenses and enhance the patient experience. The COVID-19 pandemic triggered the adoption of telehealth and telemedicine services, which will likely rise in the future.The industry players are leveraging AI and automation along with real-time analytics to provide quality care. AI helps improve clinical workflow management and medical diagnosis that hospitals utilize. The companies are using the virtual health domain to heighten their efficiency by limiting the patients' waiting time and trimming their treatment costs.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bearish OutlookThe group's  Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. The Zacks Medical-Hospital industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Medical sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #216, which places it in the bottom 14% of nearly 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic about this group's earnings growth potential. The industry's earnings estimates for 2023 have declined 19.1% in the past year. Given the lackluster near-term prospects, companies in the space are expected to take a hit.Before we present the stocks that you may want to watch, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 &amp; Sector The Zacks Medical-Hospital industry has fared better than the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite as well as its broader sector over the past year. During this time period, the stocks in this industry have declined 0.5% compared with the S&amp;P 500's fall of 14.1% and the Zacks Medical sector's decrease of 10.4%.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio, which is commonly used for valuing hospital stocks, the industry trades at 8.21X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 12.09X and the sector's 8.37X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 8.75X, as low as 5.57X and at a median of 7.76X.4 Stocks to Watch ForWe are presenting four stocks with a Zacks Ranks #3 (Hold) from the Medical-Hospital industry.  You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.HCA Healthcare: The company provides services via surgery centers, free-standing emergency rooms, physician clinics and urgent care centers. HCA's inorganic growth strategies enable it to persistently increase patient volumes, expand its network across several markets and add more hospitals in its portfolio.

The consensus mark for its revenues in 2023 signals 4.6% increase from the prior year. Tenet Healthcare beat earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters, the average surprise being 69.9%.

421,1b7d1d69-62c4-33e2-957b-19b5d927c90c,FCX,2023-01-19,Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/freeport-mcmoran-fcx-expected-beat-150003274.html,1674054003,STORY,['FCX'],"[Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 25. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis mining company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.40 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -58.3%.Revenues are expected to be $5.38 billion, down 12.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.53% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Freeport-McMoRan?For Freeport-McMoRan, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +6.96%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Freeport-McMoRan will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Freeport-McMoRan would post earnings of $0.34 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.26, delivering a surprise of -23.53%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Freeport-McMoRan appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The project was started in 2019 and supported by the California Climate Investments (CCI) initiative, in conjunction with the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District (SJVAPCD) and the California Air Resources Board (CARB), to demonstrate the sustainability benefits of zero-emission (ZE) and near zero-emission (NZE) technologies.Frito-Lay logoThe Frito-Lay Modesto site is one of the largest Frito-Lay manufacturing facilities in the United States at 500,000 square feet, sitting on 80 acres and employing more than 1,100 associates. The facility is the first Frito-Lay manufacturing facility to implement site-wide alternative fuel vehicles, on-site renewable energy generation, energy storage equipment and employee electric vehicle charging stations.""At Frito-Lay and PepsiCo, we are dedicated to operating within our planetary bounds and inspiring positive change. The transformation at Modesto is in direct support of our PepsiCo Positive (pep+) commitment to building a circular and inclusive value chain and achieving net zero emissions by 2040,"" said Steven Williams, CEO of PepsiCo Foods North America. ""To date, the Frito-Lay Modesto transformation has resulted in a 91 percent reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from direct fleet operations, or 5,250 metric tons of GHG emissions. If the standard 4-person compact SUV drives on average 15,000 miles per year with an average MPG of 25.5, this reduction is the equivalent of removing just over 1,000 standard compact SUVs from the road.""Story continuesNow near completion, the transformation at Modesto is a template for and can help accelerate the continued proliferation of large-scale commercialization of ZE and NZE technologies at freight facilities and warehouses, magnifying emissions reduction benefits on a broad scale.The upgrades in Modesto employ the latest in sustainable technology to reduce environmental impact, while also offering employees on-the-job training to maintain and operate the new high-tech equipment. These updates include the replacement of diesel fleet assets with ZE and NZE alternatives, fueling and charging infrastructure for the new fleet, and on-site renewable energy generation and storage. These technology upgrades are another step in achieving our pep+ goals:Three BYD 8Y electric yard tractors improve operations efficiency, and the associated tailpipe emission reductions contribute to our commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions across our value chain. Each yard tractor operates 20 hours per day and moves more than 150 trailers while only charging for two hours every day.1-megawatt solar carport with energy storage, which doubles the amount of solar generation capacity at the facility by supplementing the site's 1-megawatt of rooftop solar panels.12 Crown Li-ion forklifts powered by lithium-ion batteries to improve energy and time efficiency.2.7 megawatt-hours of on-site battery storage to help reduce the site's electricity costs and support grid capacity by reducing the facility's electricity load on the grid during peak times.Electric Tesla over the road semis and four Tesla 750kW charging stations to provide the semis with up to 400 miles of range in 1 hour of charging. PepsiCo and Frito-Lay are now the first company to have a commercial fleet featuring the electric semi.38 Volvo VNL compressed natural gas (CNG) tractors fueled by CNG with RNG attributes from a nearby, public access CNG fueling station owned and operated by Beyond6.Six Peterbilt 220EV electric box trucks that provide zero emission last mile delivery into the Modesto community, reducing tailpipe emissions and allowing Frito-Lay to deliver products directly to retail customers.Seven dual-head employee electric vehicle charging stations capable of charging up to 14 vehicles at one time.Additionally, in 2021 the Frito-Lay Modesto site achieved sourcing 100 percent of its electricity from renewable sources. On-site solar power provides up to 20 percent of the Modesto facility's energy use daily.""CARB's approach to fighting local air pollution is to work with industry and other partners on projects that demonstrate how a fleet can protect public health by shifting to clean vehicle technologies and equipment. This includes zero-emission trucks and related charging infrastructure,"" said CARB Executive Officer, Dr. Steven Cliff.  ""The transformation of the Frito-Lay facility in Modesto is a notable example of this approach. It also makes the case to other fleets and freight facilities in California — and throughout the nation — that a shift by companies and fleets to the cleanest trucks and equipment directly improves the air for communities adjacent to these facilities.""The Frito-Lay Modesto project was supported by the ""California Climate Investments"" (CCI) initiative in conjunction with the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District (SJVAPCD), and the California Air Resources Board (CARB). The total grant for $15.4 million covered a portion of the Frito-Lay transformation and the placement of a publicly accessible CNG station, owned by Beyond6, formerly known as American Natural Gas. The grant share for Frito-Lay was $12.2 million and the match funding required $13.5 million in cash and in-kind services. Other project participants include Café Coop, CALSTART, Project Clean Air, University of California and Riverside CE-CERT. Equipment and technology suppliers for the project include BYD Motors LLC, ChargePoint, Crown, Meritor, Peterbilt, Tesla and Volvo. California Climate Investments is a statewide initiative that puts billions of cap-and-trade dollars to work reducing greenhouse gas emissions, strengthening the economy, and improving public health and the environment — particularly in disadvantaged communities.

The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in the companies.Dividend Aristocrats Ranked: Top 15 According To Hedge Funds15. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 53Founded in 1940, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is an American multinational fast food chain. In January, Loop Capital raised its price target on the stock to $328 with a Buy rating on the shares, highlighting the company's same-store sales growth.

The stakes owned by these hedge funds are worth over $1.8 billion collectively. Among these hedge funds, Bridgewater Associates was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3.14. Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) is a multinational medical device company that provides other medical services and solutions to its consumers. On December 8, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share, which fell in line with its previous dividend. The company maintains a 45-year streak of consistent dividend growth, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds. The stock has a dividend yield of 3.39%, as of January 18.For the six months that ended in October, Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) reported an operating cash flow of $2 billion and its free cash flow for the period came in at $1.2 billion.

The downdraft in the market during the quarter led to a pile-on. We are being patient with our investment in Medtronic because the company continues to be a strong free cash flow generator and is attractively priced, with a FCF yield of 5% on trailing one-year numbers and a dividend yield of 3%. Medtronic is under new management that is focused on growing the company’s top line, reinvesting in R&amp;D, returning cash to shareholders and growing operating profits. We like new management’s strategy and believe new product launches, increased surgery visits, sound M&amp;A transactions and a shareholder returns focus, should reinvigorate the business. We added to our positions in these health care names during the quarter.”13.

As a signatory, Linde has committed to aligning its strategy and activities with the UNGC’s Ten Principles across human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption.”12. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is a multinational consumer products company, based in New York, US.

The collective value of stakes owned by these hedge funds is over $4 billion.Third Point mentioned Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) in its recently-published Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Third Point recently acquired a significant position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL). The investment fits several important criteria in the current investment environment. First, the business is defensive and has significant pricing power in inflationary conditions. Second, there is meaningful hidden value in the company’s Hill’s Pet Nutrition business, which we believe would command a premium multiple if separated from Colgate’s consumer assets. Third, there is a favorable industry backdrop in consumer health, with new entrants via spin-offs and potential for consolidation. Finally, the current valuation is attractive both because earnings growth is poised to inflect higher, and because shareholders are paying very little for the optionality around Hill’s or Colgate’s ability to participate in further consolidation in the consumer health sector.Colgate has a strong portfolio of brands and operates across four categories that should perform well across most economic conditions: oral care, home care, personal care, and pet nutrition. Although Colgate has delivered organic sales growth of 5-6% over the past few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, and the stock has become a perennial underperformer. Foreign exchange headwinds have pressured reported results. Business reinvestment, supply chain disruption, and inflationary pressures have weighed heavily on margins; those headwinds are now reversing. Stepped up investments in demand generation, product innovation, and digital capabilities are starting to pay off. Global supply chain bottlenecks are easing and product availability on the shelf is improving. And, most importantly, raw material, transportation, and wage pressures are stabilizing, and even reversing in some areas, at the same time additional pricing takes effect. Taken together, the stage is set for Colgate to deliver several years of outsized earnings growth, as sales continue to increase, foreign exchange movements are annualized, and margins finally recover…” (Click here to view the full text)11. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59An American multinational beverage company, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is another one of the best dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds. The stock also gained positive ratings from analysts due to its strong performance. In December, Atlantic Equities raised its price target on the stock to $69 with an Overweight rating on the shares, highlighting its ongoing investment and strong execution.The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.85%, as of January 18. The company is one of the strongest dividend payers in the market, making consistent dividend payments since 1920. Moreover, it has raised its payouts for the past 60 years.As of the end of Q3 2022, 59 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned stakes in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), with a collective value of $25 billion. Berkshire Hathaway owned the largest stake in the company, worth over $22.4 billion.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”10. The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) is an Ohio-based manufacturing company that specializes in paint and coating materials. The company has business in around 109 countries. In the first nine months of the 2022, the company generated strong cash to fulfill shareholder obligations. Its operating cash flow for the period came in at $1.28 billion and it returned $1.2 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases.The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) also gained strong ratings from the Street analysts due to its performance during a market downturn. In December, both Citigroup and JPMorgan raised their price targets on the stock to $270 and $260, respectively.The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 43 years. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.60 per share for a dividend yield of 0.97%, as recorded on January 18.The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) is one of the best dividend stocks according to hedge funds, as 63 funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned stakes in the company in Q3 2022, up from 52 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a consolidated value of over $2.8 billion.ClearBridge Investments mentioned The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“The third strategy is buying growth companies with idiosyncratic or stock-specific catalysts unrelated to the direction of the market like The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW). The stock is an example of a company we categorize in our cyclical bucket that should experience a step change in earnings over the medium to long term with solid execution and its ability to pass through price increases. While relative performance has been challenged by binary decisions around a handful of mega cap technology stocks, we’re entering a lower-growth period in which we’ve historically delivered strong relative results from our balanced approach.”9. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is an American multinational energy company, based in California. The company has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 35 years. It currently offers a per-share dividend of $1.42 every quarter for a dividend yield of 3.15%, as of January 18.

The company benefited from increased energy demand as COVID-related economic restrictions eased in tandem with concerns regarding supply interruptions related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.”8.  Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is an American multinational retail corporation.

(NYSE:WMT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”7. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is an American manufacturer and marketer of consumer goods and other personal care and hygiene products. The company has been raising its dividends consistently for the past 66 years and currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.9133 per share.

The collective value of these stakes is over $4.08 billion. Among these hedge funds, Bridgewater Associates was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3.Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”6. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 72PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is a popular dividend stock among hedge funds, as 72 funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in the company in Q3 2022, compared with 65 in the previous quarter. These stakes are valued at over $4.8 billion collectively.PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) holds a 50-year track record of consistent dividend growth. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.15 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.61%, as recorded on January 18. The company can be added to dividend portfolios alongside dividend stocks like Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV).JPMorgan gave a positive outlook to the consumer companies heading into 2023 and raised its price target on PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) to $150 with a Neutral rating on the shares.Lindsell Train mentioned PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“At this point, it may help to give a further example of these self-reinforcing moats to illustrate the idea, drawing from the consumer franchises side of our portfolio. In our view, strong consumer brands can similarly exhibit Lindycompatible anti-ageing properties. Consider, that the longer a company invests in its brands through advertising and R&amp;D, the stronger and more resonant they may get. When successful, a self-sustaining feedback loop is established, whereby it becomes ever harder to recreate a heritage-rich brand from scratch, raising barriers to entry, and proportionately increasing its likely lifespan. There are plenty of long-lived portfolio franchises I could reference here, but I’ve gone with PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP); partly because we have good time-series stats on it (beware data bias!) but also, as I hope will become evident, because Pepsi over its 129 years has succeeded in creating some wonderfully deep moats.With Pepsi Cola you get the flagship soft drinks brand, which is both global and generational, but you also get the Frito-Lay salty snacks portfolio assembled alongside it, claiming nearly 40% of the global market. That’s ten-times greater than the nearest competitor and likely higher than the next 65 competitors combined. These are exceptionally strong global bands with market shares to match; the long-term empirical result being Pepsi’s dividend record which over the past 66 years (as far back as we’ve been able to go) has compounded at an annualised rate of 10%. Pepsi is no ‘in at the ground floor’ start-up today, but it wasn’t six decades ago either. Early growth investor Philip Fisher put it well when in 1958 (two years into Pepsi’s current winning streak) he wrote of “companies which in spite of outstanding prospects of major further growth are so financially strong, with roots going so deep into the economic soil, that they qualify under the general classification of ‘institutional stocks’”. PepsiCo fits this description well…” (Click here to see the full text) Click to continue reading and see Dividend Aristocrats Ranked: Top 5 According To Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:13 Best Communication Services Stocks To Invest In12 Best DRIP Stocks To Own12 Best Holding Company Stocks To Invest InDisclosure.

It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. We can see that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) does use debt in its business. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?When Is Debt Dangerous?Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals What Is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals's Net Debt?As you can see below, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals had US$1.98b of debt, at September 2022, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. But on the other hand it also has US$7.02b in cash, leading to a US$5.04b net cash position.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Strong Is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' Balance Sheet?We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals had liabilities of US$2.88b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$3.36b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$7.02b in cash and US$5.55b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it actually has US$6.33b more liquid assets than total liabilities.Story continuesThis short term liquidity is a sign that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals could probably pay off its debt with ease, as its balance sheet is far from stretched. Succinctly put, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!On the other hand, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals's EBIT dived 14%, over the last year. We think hat kind of performance, if repeated frequently, could well lead to difficulties for the stock. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Regeneron Pharmaceuticals's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. During the last three years, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 65% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.Summing UpWhile we empathize with investors who find debt concerning, you should keep in mind that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has net cash of US$5.04b, as well as more liquid assets than liabilities. So we are not troubled with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals's debt use. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals   you should know about.Of course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today.Have feedback on this article?

Union Pacific (UNP), which belongs to the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This railroad has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 4.07%.For the last reported quarter, Union Pacific came out with earnings of $3.19 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.06 per share, representing a surprise of 4.25%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $2.82 per share and it actually produced earnings of $2.93 per share, delivering a surprise of 3.90%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Union Pacific, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Union Pacific has an Earnings ESP of +0.06% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on January 24, 2023.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

433,d020e67d-a403-39e0-a384-d7219c07e177,UNP,2023-01-19,Norfolk Southern (NSC) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/norfolk-southern-nsc-reports-next-150003162.html,1674054003,STORY,['UNP'],"[The market expects Norfolk Southern (NSC) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 25. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis railroad is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.41 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +9.3%.Revenues are expected to be $3.17 billion, up 11.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.69% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Norfolk Southern?For Norfolk Southern, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.55%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Norfolk Southern will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Norfolk Southern would post earnings of $3.64 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.10, delivering a surprise of +12.64%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Norfolk Southern appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry, Union Pacific (UNP) is soon expected to post earnings of $2.74 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +3%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $6.26 billion, up 9.3% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Union Pacific has been revised 2.7% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.06%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Union Pacific will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In collaboration with a growing number of partners, we're addressing disparities that historically have made it difficult for underserved communities to access the care and resources they need to experience better health outcomes.And while we've made progress, I'm keenly aware, as are many of you, of the work that lies ahead. To make meaningful changes, we need to address the health inequities that act as barriers to care for underserved communities. To accomplish this, we will continue to support and expand efforts with local and national partners focused on health equity while increasing access to affordable diagnostic testing and education to help patients take control of their health.I've seen firsthand how those hardest hit by COVID-19-low-income communities and communities of color in particular-have come to rely on Quest for access to testing and information that can help reduce the spread of the virus among the most vulnerable.

436,73e43742-4205-3a35-a1eb-342592f258ee,AMP,2023-01-19,Ameriprise Financial Services (AMP) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ameriprise-financial-services-amp-reports-150003879.html,1674054003,STORY,"['AMP', 'IVZ']","[The market expects Ameriprise Financial Services (AMP) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 25. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis financial services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $6.35 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +3.3%.Revenues are expected to be $3.42 billion, down 7.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.89% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ameriprise?For Ameriprise, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.72%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Ameriprise will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Ameriprise would post earnings of $5.82 per share when it actually produced earnings of $6.43, delivering a surprise of +10.48%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Ameriprise appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerInvesco (IVZ), another stock in the Zacks Financial - Investment Management industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.36 for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -58.1%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.06 billion, down 22.7% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Invesco has been revised 6.1% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 5.12%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Invesco will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But if you buy individual stocks, you can do both better or worse than that. Unfortunately the Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) share price slid 19% over twelve months. That falls noticeably short of the market decline of around 13%. However, the longer term returns haven't been so bad, with the stock down 4.3% in the last three years.With the stock having lost 4.3% in the past week, it's worth taking a look at business performance and seeing if there's any red flags. View our latest analysis for Cisco Systems To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Even though the Cisco Systems share price is down over the year, its EPS actually improved. It's quite possible that growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.It seems quite likely that the market was expecting higher growth from the stock. But other metrics might shed some light on why the share price is down.Revenue was pretty flat on last year, which isn't too bad. But the share price might be lower because the market expected a meaningful improvement, and got none.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-and-revenue-growthCisco Systems is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. If you are thinking of buying or selling Cisco Systems stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst consensus estimates for future profits.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Cisco Systems the TSR over the last 1 year was -17%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 13% in the twelve months, Cisco Systems shareholders did even worse, losing 17% (even including dividends). Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 5%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. Importantly, we haven't analysed Cisco Systems' dividend history. This free visual report on its dividends is a must-read if you're thinking of buying.But note: Cisco Systems may not be the best stock to buy.

At least that’s what Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins said on Wednesday when asked what he was hearing from his C-suite peers.“Publicly, everybody is being asked, ‘Do you think we’re going to have a recession?’ And most people are saying, ‘Yeah, we’re probably going to have a mild one.’ Beyond that, we’re not really talking about it,” he told CNBC. “And I think most people are generally—over the near-term and the long-term—very optimistic.”While recent retail sales data shows consumers are cutting back for fear of a recession, and layoffs at many tech firms are mounting, Robbins said he is continuing to invest in Cisco’s future.“We’re actually investing this year,” he said. “We’ll actually spend more in the fiscal year this year—that we end in July—than we did last year.”The CEOs comments contrast with statements from other attendees, including Nick Studer, chief executive of the Oliver Wyman Group consulting firm, who told the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that the mood at the event was “somber.” But Studer did add that many attendees are “hoping” that any coming recession “is either short or shallow.”The world’s top investors also gave mixed forecasts at Davos this week. Billionaire co-chairman of private equity giant Carlyle Group David Rubenstein argued that investors should begin to look for opportunities despite the fact that there is “some uncertainty” about the economy’s direction.“I think it’s a good time to invest now, because markets are not going to see another 20% drop in prices. I think that’s past us,” he told CNBC on Wednesday. “I think we’re probably coming back to the point where people are going to feel very comfortable investing.”But not every investor was so bullish. Guggenheim Partners Investment Management chief investment officer Anne Walsh said a recession will hit by the middle of this year because of the Fed’s overly aggressive interest rate hikes and quantitative tightening—or the process of shrinking the central bank’s balance sheet in an attempt to decrease the money supply and slow inflation.Story continues“Equities haven’t repriced yet, and as we go through a recessionary timeline, we will see that,” Walsh told CNBC on Wednesday.Walsh recommended investors look to fixed income investments because higher interest rates have increased the average return for the first time in a decade.“There’s one thing the Fed has done for us, they’ve put the income back in fixed income,” she said.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: Air India slammed for ‘systemic failure’ after unruly male passenger flying business class urinated on a woman traveling from New YorkMeghan Markle’s real sin that the British public can’t forgive–and Americans can’t understand‘It just doesn’t work.’ The world’s best restaurant is shutting down as its owner calls the modern fine dining model ‘unsustainable’Bob Iger just put his foot down and told Disney employees to come back into the office]"

Achieving a goal focused on better outcomes for the people who work in and with our company is a complicated effort that involves many fronts: taking efforts to support social justice efforts, working to address the issue of climate change, and working to address human rights issues in our supply chain.Making sure human rights are upheld and people are treated fairly is important across Cisco's operations and supply chain. Cisco's commitment to human rights is set forth in our Global Human Rights Policy, and operationalized within our supply chain due diligence system, which is consistent with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), and the OECD Due Diligence Guidelines for Responsible Business Conduct. Our Supplier Ethics Policy reflects our pledge to uphold the human rights of people who work in our supply chain while our Supplier Code of Conduct outlines our policies on labor and working conditions in the supply chain.The success of our work to respect human rights in our supply chain depends on the commitment and support of people across our supply chain teams. It is this work we want to highlight as part of Human Rights Day.For example, Gordon Buckle, head of specialty technology in Cisco's Global Supplier Management division, worked earlier this year with a supplier that pushed back on remediating a human rights issue. Gordon worked to ensure that the supplier's management understood what the human rights violation was and how to come into compliance with our Supplier Code of Conduct. In parallel, Buckle examined possible alternative sourcing options should the supplier be unable to conform to Cisco's Supplier Code of Conduct. Ultimately, a solution was reached, the human rights issue was addressed, and Cisco was able to continue doing business with the supplier.Story continues""We believe in a world with equal access to opportunity, a world in which businesses operate with all aspects of society in mind,"" Buckle said. ""As we endeavor to bring these ideals to life by leveraging our standards and policies, my team and I have developed a strong cohesive partnership with the Supply Chain Sustainability team.""Buckle and others are part of Cisco's Champions of Sustainability program, which highlights employees who advance sustainable and ethical business practices as part of their daily responsibilities. Cisco is recognizing those employees who have found purpose in improving worker well-being in our supply chain by helping suppliers better their health and safety protections, working conditions, and ethical sourcing.By making this part of how we do business, Cisco supply chain employees are helping to advance the company on its journey toward powering an inclusive future for all.View original content here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/735680/Finding-Purpose-in-Improving-Supply-Chain-Worker-Well-Being]"
