You might want to begin with Schwab International Index (SWISX). SWISX has no Zacks Mutual Fund Rank, but we have been able to look into other metrics like performance, volatility, and cost.History of Fund/ManagerSchwab Funds is based in San Francisco, CA, and is the manager of SWISX. The Schwab International Index made its debut in May of 1997 and SWISX has managed to accumulate roughly $7.13 billion in assets, as of the most recently available information. David Rios is the fund's current manager and has held that role since April of 2017.PerformanceObviously, what investors are looking for in these funds is strong performance relative to their peers. SWISX has a 5-year annualized total return of 4.6% and it sits in the top third among its category peers. Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3-year annualized total return of 9.04%, which places it in the top third during this time-frame.It is important to note that the product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sale charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. SWISX's standard deviation over the past three years is 18.82% compared to the category average of 18.42%. The fund's standard deviation over the past 5 years is 18.45% compared to the category average of 18.42%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsInvestors should not forget about beta, an important way to measure a mutual fund's risk compared to the market as a whole. SWISX has a 5-year beta of 0.87, which means it is likely to be less volatile than the market average. Alpha is an additional metric to take into consideration, since it represents a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark, which in this case, is the S&amp;P 500. SWISX has generated a negative alpha over the past five years of -5.52, demonstrating that managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.Story continuesExpensesAs competition heats up in the mutual fund market, costs become increasingly important. Compared to its otherwise identical counterpart, a low-cost product will be an outperformer, all other things being equal. Thus, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is vital for investors. In terms of fees, SWISX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.06% compared to the category average of 0.79%. So, SWISX is actually cheaper than its peers from a cost perspective.This fund requires a minimum initial investment of $0, while there is no minimum for each subsequent investment.Fees charged by investment advisors have not been taken into considiration. Returns would be less if those were included.Bottom LineThis could just be the start of your research on SWISXin the Mutual Fund Equity Report category.

Both U.S. and European companies with exposure to China could be hit by that economy's sluggish growth as its post-COVID momentum has faltered rapidly.China's weak economic figures have weighed on its stock market, limiting the Shanghai Composite Index's gain in 2023 to 2.6%, compared to the S&amp;P 500's 18% increase.""The post-zero COVID reopening has been disappointing by basically all measures in China, and the country's hesitance to do broad-based consumer-facing stimulus is weighing on sentiment,"" said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird. ""That's going to have a spillover effect on the European and U.S. companies that are levered to the country.""Early reports suggest that spillover is real. Swiss engineering group ABB said Thursday that its orders in China fell 9% in the second quarter, while Cartier-owner Richemont this week posted quarterly sales in Asia that were slightly lower than expected.Richemont's outlook for the year was ""somewhat tempered"" due to uncertainties in the Chinese macroeconomy that could affect both high-end and aspirational consumers, according to analysts at Bernstein who took part in a call with executives.With China's youth unemployment hitting a record 21% in June, young consumers may favor moderately-priced products and services and forgo big ticket purchases.Tesla sold a record 247,217 China-made vehicles in the second quarter, but on Wednesday reported lower gross margins due to the company's price war with rivals, including Chinese competitors NIO and Xpeng.Story continuesUpcoming reports from NXP Semiconductors NV on July 24 and Texas Instruments on July 25 will serve as barometers for chip demand. China accounted for 36% of NXP's revenue last year and half of Texas Instruments' revenue.Analysts estimate NXP reporting a 3.2% drop in quarterly revenue, with Texas Instruments' revenue tumbling 16%, which would be its steepest drop since 2009, according to Refinitiv.Credit Suisse Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Jonathan Golub said in a report this week that weakness in China that hampers U.S. growth might limit stock-market gains.Corning Inc, whose Gorilla glass is used in smartphones made by Apple and Samsung Electronics, is expected on July 25 to report a 21% drop in adjusted net income, according to Refinitiv.The specialty glass maker blamed ""anticipated recession-level demand"" for weak results in its previous quarterly report last April. China accounted for 30% of Corning's net sales last year.Apple, the world's most valuable company, saw its sales in China dip 2.9% in its March quarter, worse than the 2.5% drop in overall revenue. Analysts on average see the iPhone maker's revenue falling 1.7% to $81.6 billion for the June quarter, which would be the lowest in two years, according to Refinitiv.Coffee maker Starbucks in May reported quarterly results that beat estimates, powered by recovering demand in China.U.S. companies that operate in China are also facing uncertainty related to trade disputes between Washington and Beijing, particularly in semiconductors. Chipmakers are currently grappling with Washington's sweeping set of rules imposed in October to hobble China's chip industry.""Many companies' manufacturing base is heavily Chinese-based, so are companies planning to diversify their manufacturing base or even 're-shore' back to the US? If so, that's presumably higher-cost and would weigh on gross margins,"" said David Klink, senior analyst with Huntington Private Bank.(Reporting by Noel Randewich in Oakland, California; additional reporting by Chavi Mehta in Bangalore, Caroline Valetkovitch in New York and Mimosa Spencer in Paris; editing by David Gaffen and Nick Zieminski)]"

Its deepening focus on accelerating free cash flow generation is likely to have been another positive. The impacts of all these factors are expected to be reflected in the company’s second-quarter results.However, widespread weakness in the personal electronics, communication equipment and enterprise systems markets might have been a major headwind.A weakening demand environment, primarily due to inventory reductions by customers, is expected to have impacted the performance of both Analog and Embedded Processing segments during the quarter to be reported.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Analog revenues is pegged at $3.27 billion, reflecting a decline of 18.2% from the year-ago reported figure.The consensus mark for Embedded Processing revenues is $815 million, indicating a fall of 0.7% from the reported figure in the prior-year quarter.Supply-chain constraints, geopolitical tensions and rising inflation are expected to have weighed on TXN in the quarter under review.Story continuesWhat Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Texas Instruments this time around.

7,e939dda8-818b-3a48-a86d-3f3ff6326b7f,NUE,2023-07-21,Analysts Estimate United States Steel (X) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-united-states-steel-140224393.html,1689861744,STORY,"['X', 'NUE']","[United States Steel (X) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 27. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis steel maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.88 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -51.3%.Revenues are expected to be $4.91 billion, down 22% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.7% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for U.S. Steel?For U.S. Steel, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.22%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that U.S. Steel will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that U.S. Steel would post earnings of $0.61 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.77, delivering a surprise of +26.23%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.U.S. Steel doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Steel - Producers industry, Nucor (NUE) is soon expected to post earnings of $5.59 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -42.2%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $9.73 billion, down 17.5% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Nucor has been revised 9.2% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, an equal Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Nucor will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis medical equipment maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.21 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -5.3%.Revenues are expected to be $729.53 million, up 3.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Teleflex?For Teleflex, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.49%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Teleflex will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Teleflex would post earnings of $2.97 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.09, delivering a surprise of +4.04%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Teleflex doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO), is soon expected to post earnings of $5.43 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -1.5%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $10.99 billion, up 0.2% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Thermo Fisher has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 1.18%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Thermo Fisher will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.

A copy of the same can be downloaded here. So far, 2023 was one of the most challenging periods in the firm’s history. The fund had a fractional loss through the first six months of 2023 which compared poorly against the S&amp;P 500 Index’s return of just under 17% and the Russell 1000 Value Index’s return of just over 5%.  In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2023.Coho Partners Relative Value Equity Fund highlighted stocks like U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) in the second quarter 2023 investor letter. Headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is a financial service holding company. On July 20, 2023, U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) stock closed at $39.14 per share. One-month return of U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) was 22.77%, and its shares lost 17.96% of their value over the last 52 weeks. U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) has a market capitalization of $59.998 billion.Coho Partners Relative Value Equity Fund made the following comment about U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:""U.S. Bancorp (USB) has a well-deserved reputation of being a high quality, conservative lender and historically the company has performed well versus peers during challenging times. We believe the near-term pressure on USB’s share price stems from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic. USB has been caught up in the regional bank issues, but we believe it has a bright future. Since our initial purchase during the pandemic, USB has performed in line or ahead of our expectation. We were also very positive on the company’s decision to acquire Union Bank, which operated primarily in California, a market in which USB had limited exposure. Union Bank’s customers were primarily small businesses, where USB saw potential to leverage its cash management and payment offerings to gain meaningful revenue growth with above average margins. The conversion of Union Bank to USB programs went without a glitch.We believe USB is well capitalized but with the Union Bank deal, USB will be subject to additional capital requirements, which will prevent buybacks in the near term. However, we do anticipate a modest dividend increase this December but, in the meantime, USB trades at less than 8x trailing earnings with a 5.8% dividend yield.""Story continuesBankU.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

Instead, she opts to drive a two-hour round-trip to a branch of Walmart-owned U.S. warehouse chain Sam's Club, where she spends at least 2,000 yuan ($276.39) each time stocking up on goods ranging from Japan's Ippudo instant noodles to cheesecakes.While long a phenomenon in the United States, Chinese shoppers are just starting to fall in love with membership club warehouses such as Sam's Club and Costco, spurring their expansion and the emergence of local rivals.There are now 11 of the chains in China, seven of which launched in the past three years, including outlets from local supermarket chains Yonghui Superstores and Alibaba's Freshippo.Sales at warehouse clubs in China more than doubled to $3.7 billion last year from $1.8 billion four years earlier, Euromonitor data shows.But the membership stores account for only 0.3% of sales in the grocery purchase sector in China, well below the 11% rate in the U.S., according to the data firm, indicating there is still a lot of room for growth.Warehouse clubs grew in popularity in China during the pandemic when the fear of lockdowns drove people to keep a ready stock of groceries at home. While COVID-19 curbs have lifted, interest has persisted as shoppers seek better value deals amid a slowing Chinese economy.The membership stores are also gaining ground amid a sales decline in China's hypermarket sector, which struggled with a shift towards online purchases during the pandemic. Walmart has shut many of its eponymous smaller format stores, as has Suning.com-backed Carrefour China and JD.com-backed Yonghui.The club warehouse format ""is the only bright spot,"" said Derek Deng, who leads Bain &amp; Company's consumer products practice in greater China.Story continuesIn the first quarter of 2023, the number of buyers at such stores grew 30.3% from a year earlier, while purchasing frequency was up 12.8%, according to data from Bain and Kantar Worldpanel.SAM'S MOMENTThe current market leader is Sam's Club, which opened in 1996 and expanded slowly in the first 25 years, with 44 stores to date across 25 Chinese cities and 4 million families as members as of December 2022.""Sam's Club are doing well. They appeal to a higher demographic within China,"" Walmart International CEO Judith McKenna said during an investor briefing in April.Six of its stores opened last year and it will have 48 by the end of this year, seizing the moment to grow as Chinese social media users post lists of their favourite Sam's Club products such as Chobani yoghurt and Bouchard dark chocolate and long queues form at its new store openings.Its chief foreign rival Costco only has four stores in mainland China, with plans to increase to six by year-end, according to local media. Costco did not respond immediately to a request for comment.To stay ahead, Sam's Club is focused on providing curated and unique products to members, a Walmart spokesperson said, while it also offers online delivery in as little as 30 minutes to keep up with local rivals.Sam's Club also has partnered with well-known brands like Beijing Da Dong Roast Duck, an upscale restaurant that supplies a packaged ready-made Peking duck product that costs about $22.FRESHIPPO IN FOCUSSam's Club's local rivals have largely copied its store concept, analysts say. Annual fees for a standard membership at the Walmart offshoot and others such as Sun Art Retail Group's M Club and Fubi, backed by Beijing Yaodi Agriculture, range from 258 yuan to 365 yuan.Local warehouse chains have differentiated themselves so far by targeting smaller, less affluent cities. M Club opened its first outlet in Yangzhou and Beijing Hualian Supermarket set up a membership shop in Lanzhou. But their product offering tends to be less curated, with most simply packaging their existing range as bulk buys.""Every player needs to find unique value propositions to attract consumers, besides just adding membership on top of a traditional hypermarket retail model,"" Bain's Deng said.The standout rival to Sam's Club is Alibaba's popular supermarket chain Freshippo, which began opening membership-style Freshippo X stores in 2020 and has nine outlets, six of which are in Shanghai, according to local media.Freshippo, which targets China's younger, digitally savvy urbanites, has been widening its range of imported and exclusive products, from well-known Japanese chocolates to seasonal specialty fruits from different Chinese provinces.The chain was the only rival Walmart's China CEO Christina Zhu mentioned in February when delivering a speech internally about the competitive landscape Sam's Club faced in China, according to two people familiar with the meeting who were not authorised to speak with media.But Sam's Club was ultimately confident it is currently miles ahead, one of the people said.""She did not mean it as a real competitor,"" the person added. ""No one is close to Sam's. She means if there is anyone that potentially can be a rival then it is (Freshippo) because the grocery supermarket is very innovative with their food offerings too.""Walmart declined to comment on the internal meeting.($1 = 7.2361 Chinese yuan renminbi)(Reporting by Sophie Yu in Beijing and Brenda Goh in Shanghai; Editing by Jamie Freed)]"

Walmart has shut many of its eponymous smaller format stores, as has Suning.com-backed Carrefour China and JD.com-backed Yonghui.Story continuesThe club warehouse format ""is the only bright spot,"" said Derek Deng, who leads Bain &amp; Company's consumer products practice in greater China.In the first quarter of 2023, the number of buyers at such stores grew 30.3% from a year earlier, while purchasing frequency was up 12.8%, according to data from Bain and Kantar Worldpanel.SAM'S MOMENTThe current market leader is Sam's Club, which opened in 1996 and expanded slowly in the first 25 years, with 44 stores to date across 25 Chinese cities and 4 million families as members as of December 2022.""Sam's Club are doing well. They appeal to a higher demographic within China,"" Walmart International CEO Judith McKenna said during an investor briefing in April.Six of its stores opened last year and it will have 48 by the end of this year, seizing the moment to grow as Chinese social media users post lists of their favourite Sam's Club products such as Chobani yoghurt and Bouchard dark chocolate and long queues form at its new store openings.Its chief foreign rival Costco only has four stores in mainland China, with plans to increase to six by year-end, according to local media. Costco did not respond immediately to a request for comment.To stay ahead, Sam's Club is focused on providing curated and unique products to members, a Walmart spokesperson said, while it also offers online delivery in as little as 30 minutes to keep up with local rivals.Sam's Club also has partnered with well-known brands like Beijing Da Dong Roast Duck, an upscale restaurant that supplies a packaged ready-made Peking duck product that costs about $22.FRESHIPPO IN FOCUSSam's Club's local rivals have largely copied its store concept, analysts say. Annual fees for a standard membership at the Walmart offshoot and others such as Sun Art Retail Group's M Club and Fubi, backed by Beijing Yaodi Agriculture, range from 258 yuan to 365 yuan.Local warehouse chains have differentiated themselves so far by targeting smaller, less affluent cities. M Club opened its first outlet in Yangzhou and Beijing Hualian Supermarket set up a membership shop in Lanzhou. But their product offering tends to be less curated, with most simply packaging their existing range as bulk buys.""Every player needs to find unique value propositions to attract consumers, besides just adding membership on top of a traditional hypermarket retail model,"" Bain's Deng said.The standout rival to Sam's Club is Alibaba's popular supermarket chain Freshippo, which began opening membership-style Freshippo X stores in 2020 and has nine outlets, six of which are in Shanghai, according to local media.Freshippo, which targets China's younger, digitally savvy urbanites, has been widening its range of imported and exclusive products, from well-known Japanese chocolates to seasonal specialty fruits from different Chinese provinces.The chain was the only rival Walmart's China CEO Christina Zhu mentioned in February when delivering a speech internally about the competitive landscape Sam's Club faced in China, according to two people familiar with the meeting who were not authorised to speak with media.But Sam's Club was ultimately confident it is currently miles ahead, one of the people said.""She did not mean it as a real competitor,"" the person added. ""No one is close to Sam's. She means if there is anyone that potentially can be a rival then it is (Freshippo) because the grocery supermarket is very innovative with their food offerings too.""Walmart declined to comment on the internal meeting.

Its regular membership costs $98 annually.Perks for Walmart+ membership include free grocery deliveries, free shipping for online orders, gas discounts and access to Paramount+ streaming services.More than 41 million people in the U.S. receive SNAP benefits, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.Walmart launched its subscription service in 2020, and has been adding more perks as a way to compete with Amazon Prime, which was unveiled in 2005. Amazon's annual membership now costs $139 per year, and it also has been adding benefits. The online retailer began offering discounts to those on government assistance in 2017.Walmart also said it is the first retailer to accept SNAP benefits online and in its stores in all 50 states with the recent addition to Alaska. Big box stores have been accepting SNAP benefits but not in all states.Walmart's move comes as low-income shoppers are feeling more financially squeezed after a pandemic-era boost in SNAP benefits expired this year. Adding to the pressure is stubbornly high inflation on food and other necessities.During the pandemic, all SNAP recipients had their benefits increased though an Emergency Allotment program. The duration of those extra payments was originally connected directly to the duration of the public health emergency, but that was changed in December 2022 and the final pandemic-boosted SNAP payments went out at the end of February._____Follow Anne D’Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio]"

(Operator Instructions)I'll now turn this over to John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan.Story continuesJohn Quinlan DoyleGood morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results reported earlier today. I'm John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. Joining me on the call is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses: Martin South of Marsh; Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations.Marsh McLennan's second quarter results were excellent. We performed well across our businesses and geographies, extended the best run of quarterly underlying revenue growth in over 2 decades and generated double-digit growth in adjusted EPS. Top line momentum continued with 11% underlying revenue growth on top of 10% growth in the second quarter of last year.Adjusted operating income grew 17% versus a year ago. Our adjusted operating margin expanded 100 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2022 and adjusted EPS grew 16%. We also raised our quarterly dividend by 20% to $0.71 and completed $300 million of share repurchases during the quarter.I'm pleased with our performance, especially when viewed in the context of the current macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. While the U.S. and other major economies have been resilient, there remains significant uncertainty given persistent inflation, continued central bank tightening and geopolitical instability. However, we continue to perform well.As we have discussed in the past, there are factors that are supportive of our growth. We also have a track record of resilience and believe we are well positioned to perform across economic cycles. We manage our business to grow revenues faster than expenses in both good and challenging periods.We made meaningful investments in market-facing talent and improving sales operations and client engagement, which are contributing to our growth, and we continue to deliberately shift our business mix to faster-growth areas. So while the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment remains volatile, we see opportunity to deliver greater value to clients through our leadership and capabilities in risk, strategy and people.A good example is Marsh McLennan's work to aid Ukraine's economy. Our 4 businesses together are mobilizing our unique expertise to support their future recovery and reconstruction efforts. In June, I attended the Ukrainian Recovery Conference hosted by U.K. Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak. We have the honor of hosting a delegation of Ukrainian and British officials at our London offices, where we announced proposals to help with Ukraine's recovery.Some estimates suggest over $1 trillion may be required for this effort, yet investment capital will not be forthcoming until investors can protect themselves from more risk. To this end, we proposed to Ukraine and the G7 the creation of a war risk insurance pool that would ensure commercial insurance is available for reconstruction projects.We also announced that we will partner with the Ukrainian government and insurers to create a data platform for the assessment of war risks. This project draws on Marsh McLennan's expertise and leverages data and information provided by the Ukrainians. By enabling effective and targeted risk modeling, it represents a critical first step for the industry to offer commercial insurance and unlock capital.Our colleagues at Oliver Wyman also partnered with the Ukrainian government to develop a post-war transformation strategy. This would reposition Ukraine's economy in a way that leverages national strengths to move beyond resilience to opportunity. At Marsh McLennan, we consider it a privilege to support these endeavors.Now I'd like to take a moment to provide an update on the strategic initiatives we discussed last quarter. As a reminder, in the first quarter, we appointed new leaders for Marsh McLennan International and U.S. and Canada as well as region and country leaders. These leaders are driving client impact through enhanced collaboration while at the same time maintaining the individual value propositions of the businesses.We are bringing our collective capabilities where there is opportunity to provide greater value. This allows us to harness the benefits of our scale, data, insights and expertise to meet our clients' challenges and realize possibilities. This approach is already yielding benefits and improving the client and colleague experience.At the same time, we are also finding new ways to operate, reduce complexity and organize for impact. The actions we are taking aim to realign our workforce and skill sets with evolving needs, rationalize technology and reduce our real estate footprint. As we said last quarter, we expect roughly $300 million of total savings by 2024 with total cost to achieve these savings of $375 million to $400 million. Our go-to-market collaboration and restructuring actions are an opportunity to drive higher growth, enhance the colleague value proposition and be more efficient and connected.Turning to insurance and reinsurance market conditions. Primary insurance rate increases continued with the Marsh Global Insurance Market Index up 3% overall versus 4% in the first quarter. Property rates increased 10%, the same as last quarter. Casualty pricing was up in the low single-digit range. Workers' compensation was down low single digits, and financial and professional liability insurance rates were down high single digits. Cyber insurance pricing stabilized after several years of increases.In reinsurance, challenging market conditions persisted at midyear renewals. Reinsurers were disciplined and rate increases remain significant, although the market showed more interest in deploying capacity than at January 1 given the firm pricing and improved terms.Global property cat reinsurance, risk-adjusted rates increased about 30% on average with loss impacted clients seeing higher pricing. The impact of rate increases on ceded premiums was mitigated by higher retentions.On the casualty side, pricing pressure continued across most lines driven by prior year loss development and concerns about social and economic inflation. We continue to help clients manage through these dynamic market conditions.Now let me turn to our second quarter financial performance. We generated adjusted EPS of $2.20, which is up 16% from a year ago. On an underlying basis, revenue grew 11%. Underlying revenue grew 13% in RIS and 8% in Consulting. Marsh was up 10%; Guy Carpenter 11%; Mercer 6%; and Oliver Wyman grew 11%. Overall, the second quarter saw adjusted operating income growth of 17% and our adjusted operating margin expanded 100 basis points year-over-year.For the 6 months, consolidated revenue grew 10% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income grew 15% and our adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points. Adjusted EPS was $4.74, up 13% from a year ago.Turning to our outlook. We are well positioned for a strong year in 2023. In terms of revenue outlook, given our momentum, we expect full year underlying revenue growth to be high single digits. This reflects a continuation of current trends, but as we noted, the macro outlook remains uncertain and can turn out to be different than our assumptions.As for the bottom line outlook, we continue to expect margin expansion for the full year and strong growth in adjusted EPS. Overall, I'm proud of our second quarter performance, which demonstrates our continued execution on strategic initiatives and momentum across our business despite an uncertain macro environment.I'm grateful to our colleagues for their focus and determination and the value they deliver to our clients, shareholders and communities. With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.Mark Christopher McGivneyThank you, John, and good morning. Our second quarter results were outstanding with continued momentum in underlying growth, mid-teens adjusted EPS growth and solid margin expansion. Our consolidated revenue increased 9% to $5.9 billion with underlying growth of 11%. Operating income was $1.5 billion and adjusted operating income was also $1.5 billion, up 17%.Our adjusted operating margin increased 100 basis points to 27.7%, a good result given the headwinds from the talent investments we made in 2022, the timing of our annual raises and a continued rebound in expenses such as T&amp;E that we mentioned last quarter.GAAP EPS was $2.07 and adjusted EPS was $2.20, up 16% over last year. For the first 6 months of 2023, underlying revenue growth was 10%. Our adjusted operating income grew 15% to $3.3 billion. Our adjusted operating margin increased 130 basis points and our adjusted EPS increased 13% to $4.74.Looking at Risk &amp; Insurance Services. Second quarter revenue was $3.7 billion, up 12% compared with a year ago or 13% on an underlying basis. This result marks the ninth consecutive quarter of 8% or higher underlying growth in RIS and continues the best stretch of growth in nearly 2 decades.Operating income increased 20% to $1.2 billion. Adjusted operating income increased 18% to $1.2 billion, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 140 basis points to 34.2%.For the first 6 months of the year, revenue in RIS was $7.6 billion with underlying growth of 12%. Adjusted operating income increased 17% to $2.6 billion and the margin increased 170 basis points to 36.4%.At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $3 billion, up 9% from a year ago or 10% on an underlying basis. This comes on top of 9% growth in the second quarter of last year. Growth in the second quarter reflected strong new business and excellent retention.In U.S. and Canada, underlying growth was 9% for the quarter. In International, underlying growth was 10% and comes on top of 9% in the second quarter of 2022. Latin America was up 17%, EMEA was up 11% and Asia Pacific grew 6%.For the first 6 months of the year, Marsh's revenue was $5.8 billion with underlying growth of 9%. U.S. and Canada grew 8% and International was up 10%. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $576 million in the quarter, up 10% or 11% on an underlying basis, driven by strong growth across all regions in Global Specialty. For the first 6 months of the year, Guy Carpenter generated $1.6 billion of revenue and 10% underlying growth.In the Consulting segment, second quarter revenue was $2.2 billion, up 4% from a year ago or 8% on an underlying basis. Consulting operating income was $388 million. Adjusted operating income increased 9% to $403 million. The adjusted operating margin was 19.2% compared to 19.3% in the second quarter of last year.For the first 6 months of 2023, Consulting revenue was $4.2 billion, representing underlying growth of 6% and adjusted operating income increased 5% to $809 million.Mercer's revenue was $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 6% on an underlying basis, representing the ninth consecutive quarter of 5% or higher underlying growth in Mercer. Wealth grew 3% driven by continued strength in defined benefits. Investment management also delivered modest growth.Our assets under management were $393 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 11% sequentially and 14% compared to the second quarter of last year. Growth was driven by a modest rebound in capital markets, positive net flows and our transaction with Westpac. Health underlying growth was 10% and reflected strength in all segments and regions.Career revenue increased 6% on top of 17% growth in the second quarter of last year. We continue to see demand for rewards, talent strategy and workforce transformation advice and solutions. For the first 6 months of the year, revenue at Mercer was $2.7 billion with 7% underlying growth.Oliver Wyman's revenue in the quarter was $798 million, an increase of 11% on an underlying basis and reflected continued strength in the Middle East and Europe and a rebound in the Americas. For the first 6 months of the year, revenue at Oliver Wyman was $1.5 billion, an increase of 6% on an underlying basis.Foreign exchange was a $0.02 headwind in the second quarter. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be a $0.01 headwind in the third quarter and a $0.01 benefit in the fourth quarter.We reported $65 million of total restructuring costs in the quarter, approximately $50 million of which relates to the program we announced in the fourth quarter. These charges include costs related to severance, lease exits and streamlining our technology environment. We continue to expect total charges under this program to be $375 million to $400 million. The [date even] incurred approximately $300 million of charges and currently expect to incur most of the remaining costs in 2023. We still expect to achieve total savings of roughly $300 million by 2024 and now expect to realize approximately $200 million in 2023.Our other net benefit credit was $60 million in the quarter. For the full year 2023, we expect our other net benefit credit will be about $240 million. Investment income was $3 million in the second quarter on a GAAP basis and $2 million on an adjusted basis. Interest expense in the second quarter was $146 million, up from $114 million in the second quarter of 2022. This reflects an increase in long-term debt and higher interest rates on short-term borrowings, which we use for efficient working capital management.Based on our current forecast, we expect approximately $142 million of interest expense in the third quarter and approximately $567 million for the full year. Our effective adjusted tax rate in the second quarter was 24.2% compared with 23.7% in the second quarter of last year. Our tax rate in both periods benefited from favorable discrete items. The largest discrete item this quarter was the accounting for share-based compensation. Excluding discrete items, our effective adjusted tax rate was approximately 25.5%.When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate between 25% and 26% for 2023.Turning to capital management and our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with total debt of $12.6 billion. Our next scheduled debt maturity is October 2023, when $250 million of senior notes mature. We continue to expect to deploy approximately $4 billion of capital in 2023 across dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. The ultimate level of share repurchase will depend on how the M&amp;A pipeline develops.Last week, we raised our quarterly dividend by 20%, marking our 14th consecutive year of dividend growth. This increase, the largest in 25 years, reflects our strong earnings growth over the past couple of years, confidence in our outlook.Our cash position at the end of the second quarter was $1.2 billion. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $1 billion and included $295 million for dividends, $421 million for acquisitions and $300 million for share repurchases. For the first 6 months, uses of cash totaled $1.9 billion and included $591 million for dividends, $701 million for acquisitions and $600 million for share repurchases.Given our strong results in the first half, we now expect high single-digit underlying revenue growth for the full year. We continue to expect margin expansion for the full year and strong growth in adjusted EPS. This guidance is based on our outlook today, but as John mentioned, there continues to be uncertainty in the environment looking forward. So outcomes could be different than our current assumptions. Overall, our excellent start leaves us well positioned for another great year in 2023. And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to John.John Quinlan DoyleThank you, Mark. Operator, we're ready to begin Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.Elyse Beth GreenspanMy first question, you guys updated your organic growth guidance for the full year to high single digits. You guys started off the year pretty strong at 10% organic growth through the first 6 months. So trying to get a sense, as you think about the back half, what businesses might you expect to see some kind of moderation in right to get the high single digits for the full year? And then embedded within that guide, what are you assuming for fiduciary investment income in the back half of the year?John Quinlan DoyleElyse, thanks for the question. Yes, we're -- as I said, I'm quite pleased with the growth year-to-date. And the macro environment, although volatile, remains supportive of good strong growth, inflation, pricing, tight labor markets, our tailwinds. But as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, we've been shifting our mix of business to better growth markets. We've been investing in talent, sales operations, client engagement.We've sold some non-core businesses and recently announced the sale of a non-core business. So we've been working very hard at the growth profile of the company. And our outlook remains quite positive. So we upped our guidance to high single digits. It's again a terrific start to the year. I feel like we're well positioned. I think our team is executing very well in the marketplace. And in spite of the volatile macro environment, I think we'll have a good second half of growth as well.We're not going to give specific guidance on fiduciary income, but you saw what it looked like in the second quarter, obviously, meaningful growth. And we expect that to likely continue in the second half.Elyse Beth GreenspanAnd then my second question is on margin. You guys had pointed, right, that the Q2 would see low improvement than the other quarters of the year. Does that still stand? And would you expect margin improvement to pick up in the Q3 and the Q4? And with the higher expense savings, now $200 million this year, do the higher savings in '23, do those all come in the back half? Or was that spread throughout the year?John Quinlan DoyleYes. I'll ask Mark to talk about the restructuring program. But I was very pleased with the margin improvement in the quarter and year-to-date, 100 bps in the second quarter, 130 bps year-to-date. And just a reminder for everyone, margin is an outcome for us. It's not the primary objective, but we do expect to grow revenue more than expense over time. And we're constantly trying to balance with delivering today and investing for the future.I think we're getting that balance right. Our growth in both top line and earnings shows that. We did guide to less improvement in the second quarter. Mark talked about in his prepared remarks some of the drivers behind that. But again, I'm quite pleased with where we are. And we expect solid margin expansion again for the 16th year.And Mark, maybe you can talk about the restructuring program.Mark Christopher McGivneyElyse, you see that we did take up the outlook for this year to $200 million but left the overall at $300 million. It just reflects the fact that we're executing well and we've just gotten added a little bit quicker. And as we said last quarter, it wouldn't be a bad assumption to just assume the savings comes in ratably across the year. And I would say the same thing. It's just that we've gotten at the savings a little bit quicker. So I would just assume a ratable spreading over the course of the year as opposed to all the increase coming in the back half.John Quinlan DoyleAnd we do have a bit of better second half comps from the expense -- on the expense line. So thank you, Elyse.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Jim Bhullar with JPMorgan.Jamminder Singh BhullarFirst, just a question on revenues in the RIS business. You've grown at a pretty fast rate the last several quarters and I think generally better than some of your larger peers and part of that might have been just the benefit from the hiring activity that you've done over the past couple of years. Is the tailwind from that fully reflected in your results? And has it fully ramped up? Or is there sort of more to go there?John Quinlan DoyleYes. Thanks, Jimmy. As I said, quite pleased with our growth. To pick up one of your words, just a benefit from some hiring. As I noted, we've been working quite hard at shifting the mix of business, bringing in talent, improving our sales operations, including investing in client engagement. We made terrific inorganic investments as well. And so it's much more than some of the lateral hiring that's in the market.Having said that, we are quite pleased with the hiring we did and we've gotten good returns from those investments. And as I pointed out in the past, not just -- we've not just been pleased with the financial outcome. Culturally, we are very thoughtful about who we brought into the organization. And they're not only helping us grow, but they're making us better as well. So we're quite pleased with those investments.Jamminder Singh BhullarAnd then just you mentioned -- sorry, go ahead.John Quinlan DoyleNo, I'm sorry. Do you have a follow-up?Jamminder Singh BhullarYes. I was just going to say, you mentioned macro and geopolitical a bunch of times. And geopolitical, obviously, is understandable. Macro from the outside end, it seems like most of the factors are tailwinds more than they're headwinds. The equity market is strong, inflation is high, GDP growth has held in. So maybe you could just elaborate a little bit on what is it on the macro side that you see as a negative.And specifically on inflation, if it stays elevated, is that a -- obviously, it's a positive on your growth, but is it a positive on your earnings as well overall? Or is the benefit offset by just higher expenses in your own business?John Quinlan DoyleYes. It's a good question. I was trying to thread the needle a bit, right? I mean, again, the economy has been quite resilient but inflation remains persistent. You're obviously beginning to see it come down here in the United States, but not at the level that the Central Bank seems to be targeting. With their mission to reduce inflation, that's going to have an impact on not just the market here but in other markets.And so I think there is still a meaningful risk of recession. And in fact, where we do have exposure in other parts of the world, we have economies in recession currently. So -- but I think -- you had it right. I think nominal GDP is a better indicator of demand for us rather than real GDP. And inflation overall, we do think is beneficial to the company. We're not again immune to some of the challenges that we confront from an inflationary environment in our expenses, but overall, it's a bit of a benefit.And I would say, while equity markets, you pointed out equity markets have improved year-over-year, we've had some headwinds in our investment business from a growth perspective, although we're pleased with what's an improving growth profile year-to-date in Mercer investments.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets.Michael David ZaremskiFirst question, maybe I'll try to ask the Jimmy's question differently. So in the Risk segment specifically, organic growth much stronger than consensus expectations, which is great. Any way you can offer any thoughts on whether a material portion of that kind of excess growth was market share taking versus just the entire maybe overall market conditions for the entire industry were stronger than maybe some expected?John Quinlan DoyleIt's a mix of impacts, of course. So it's difficult to say with real precision, Mike. But you -- again, you've started to see inflation come down here in the United States. You saw -- and in many markets, you're seeing GDP growth slow. P&amp;C pricing moderated a bit in the quarter as well. Tight labor markets, though, remain a positive factor.And overall, at least compared to the 2010 to 2020 decade, it's certainly -- we have more tailwinds than headwinds. But again, we've been working quite aggressively to shift our mix and to improve the growth profile of the company and not just be a passive index, candidly, on GDP or for that matter, P&amp;C pricing. So again, we're pleased.I forgot to mention when Jimmy asked the question too, we -- I talked about the economy a bit, but the geopolitical environment remains a risk as well, right? So again, just trying to thread the needle between what's been obviously a terrific first half of the year and what we think is a terrific outlook for revenue growth in the second half, but there's macro risk as well.Michael David ZaremskiOkay. That's helpful. My follow-up is on, if you look at cash flow from operations net of our CapEx, if I'm doing the math right, it looks like it's growing at a pretty big clip. Do you expect free cash flow at this point to grow faster than earnings? And any comments, if that's the case, your cash flow conversion will take a step up this year?John Quinlan DoyleIt can be a bit lumpier than earnings growth, as we pointed out in the past and have demonstrated in the past. But maybe I'll ask Mark to talk about the outlook for free cash flow growth.Mark Christopher McGivneyYes. Thanks, Mike. I -- we've -- as I consistently say, we really try not to emphasize focusing too much on free cash flow growth in any quarter or even a year. It can be really volatile. Yes, as you point out in the second quarter, free cash flow was up quite nicely but there is -- you have to be careful, especially early in the year for us because it's a bit of a low-base issue. Our cash flows tend to be lower early in the year, as you know, than later in the year.But look, we've had a terrific run over a long period of time of double-digit free cash flow growth that has tracked pretty closely to our run of double-digit earnings growth over the last decade. And as we've talked about, we're confident in our outlook for continued strong earnings growth and what we would expect that our free cash flow growth in the future would track that as well.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Robert Cox with Goldman Sachs.Robert CoxJust thinking about the Marsh business and I realize growth has been strong both domestically and internationally. But if you look at those -- domestically and internationally, if you look at those 2 areas over the next, say, the next year or the next 5 years, which are you most excited about?John Quinlan DoyleWell, we're not going to give revenue guidance past what we've given today past this year. But as I said, we're performing well. We're well positioned. I think we have the best talent in the market. And I do believe we are capturing share. But maybe I'll ask Martin to talk a little bit about the growth so far this year and what you see for the rest of the year, Martin.Martin C. SouthThanks, John. As you said, we had a great strong organic growth of 10% in the second quarter, which is on top of 9%, which we posted in the second quarter of '22 and better the full year growth of 8%. As you said, great balance. International was 10%; Latin America is 17%; EMEA 11%; APAC 6%; U.S. and Canada 9%.I'd say the growth has been -- it's a really nice balance across all the geographies. Specialties growth was strong; credit specialties, construction, aviation, energy and power, strong; our advisory business, part of the risk advisory of the future, very strong double-digit growth; (inaudible) was strong; renewal growth was strong. Look, it's just a nice mix of business across the board, both new business and renewal.John Quinlan DoyleYes. Thanks, Martin. We're -- again, the consistency of growth has been just outstanding in addition to the total. Do you have a follow-up, Rob?Robert CoxYes. And so maybe switching to Oliver Wyman. Growth came in well above the levels you guys had guided from last quarter. And there's been a number of positive economic data points as of late. Do you see the pipeline reflecting that? And is it looking like growth in the back half?John Quinlan DoyleYes. We're, thanks, Rob, very pleased with the growth at Oliver Wyman. I'll ask Nick to talk a bit more about it in detail. Nick?Nicholas Mark StuderYes. Thank you, Robert. We still see a relatively wide range of possible future outcomes. When we gave guidance at the end of the first quarter, that was based on what we saw in our sales pipeline, which was ticking up nicely but not aggressively.In the second quarter, we saw quite strong growth in sales. It's, I would say, a reflection on places where Oliver Wyman is being selected to support our clients' really transformative moment, led by our public sector practice, led by our banking practice, transportation and services and our telco teams.And then also some of our other businesses, our economic research, consultancy, NERA and our brand consulting business, Lippincott showing strong growth and our digital practice showing strong growth. So I wouldn't say yet but it's correlated with economic uptick. Clients need to use us for their performance transformation as well as for their growth strategy. But sales in the second quarter have been better than we had expected. And in the near term, I'm relatively optimistic. In the longer term, the economic outcomes are still fairly widely ranged.OperatorNext question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.David Kenneth MotemadenJust had another question on the increased outlook to high single digit for the year, just sort of high-level question. Was that improved outlook more a function of the results you've achieved to date? Or has your outlook improved at all going forward?John Quinlan DoyleThanks, David, for the question. It's really a function of both, right? We've had, again, a terrific start to the year, very, very pleased with the growth and again, not just growth in parts of the business, just broad-based good execution and a lot of hard work by the team and really a reflection of the value that we're creating for clients. And so we remain positive with that outlook. And again, geopolitical environment particularly but also the macroeconomic outlook are -- there's volatility there. So we want to be mindful of that, but we feel very good about the second half.David Kenneth MotemadenGot it. And maybe just a question on Mercer Career. So I saw that decelerated a little bit, the growth decelerated. And the compare wasn't that much harder than the first quarter. So I'm just wondering, is there anything that you're seeing there on the pipeline front? Or just anything that would indicate that any clouds on the horizon?John Quinlan DoyleYes. Thanks, David. We love what we're doing at Mercer Career. So let me ask Martine to talk about our results year-to-date.Martine FerlandYes. Thanks, David, for the question. And you touched on it. The quarter growth this quarter was on top of challenging 17% comparable for the second quarter of last year. Our quarter at 6% in Q2 now has also been impacted by the delay of start of certain projects.But I would say that the fundamentals for the business remain very strong. We have 9% growth year-to-date. The demand for service continues. Our clients still grapple with labor shortages, wage inflation, dealing with new ways of working, tech in the workplace. We discussed generative AI with the clients.So you're right, it's also a business that has the largest component of discretionary from clients for us at Mercer, and we are always watching the macroeconomics. But I would say at this point, our sales, our pipeline, client sentiment, very strong. So it continues to give us good visibility into strength for the third quarter and beyond. So I'm confident that the rest of the year will be good for career.John Quinlan DoyleThanks, Martine. Thanks, David.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Mike Ward with Citi.Michael Augustus WardYou called out Global Specialty and Guy Carpenter. Just wondering if you can discuss some of those trends and maybe the runway and how significant those impacts are.John Quinlan DoyleSure. Thanks, Mike, for the question. Maybe I'll ask Dean. We're quite pleased with our execution in what's been a very, very challenging reinsurance market in the first half of this year. But Dean, maybe you can talk about the growth at GC.Dean M. KlisuraSure. Thanks, John. Look, we're very pleased with our 11% underlying growth in the quarter, 10% for the first half of the year. As you call out, we've seen strong growth across all of our regions, in particular internationally. And Global Specialties, Global Specialties placed deeply in the retrocession capital market based in London and globally, and there's been some capital challenges.Despite that, we've seen some capital inflow into the marketplace. But despite market conditions, our Global Specialty team continues to grow and perform impressively. New business across Guy Carpenter continues to accelerate. Some of that's from all the talent that we hired. We're winning in the marketplace. We're seeing very strong demand in this marketplace for our analytics platform, which we think is the best in the marketplace.Demand for our advice and solutions remains strong. I mean our clients are really experiencing and seeing a flight to quality works and a challenging market environment where capital is still constrained, where reinsurers are driving really challenging terms and conditions, you want to be with the best.I think also, Guy Carpenter securities is differentiating in the marketplace. We did over 20 cap bond deals in the first half of the year with some of that new ILS capital coming into the marketplace. We've done ILS structuring for key clients. And so I think there's just kind of real momentum in the business kind of globally. And of course, the market continues to be a tailwind. There's not enough new capital in the marketplace to change the trajectory of the pricing environment.John Quinlan DoyleThank you, Dean. Martin, maybe you can talk a little bit about the growth in specialties.Martin C. SouthYes. Thank you, John. As I mentioned earlier, where we've seen really good growth in the specialty area has been in the credit specialties, maybe not surprising given what's happening in the environment. Construction has been very strong internationally. Aviation and energy and power, as those go through a transition there and aviation has bounced back. So feeling very good about that, I'll also take it with the advisory business as well, where we -- the 2 businesses hanging together.We're advising clients increasingly on how to manage their loss costs, how to drive growth during the energy transition and so forth. So all of those specialty areas, we're seeing really strong growth and momentum. And that's how we go to market and it's how we differentiate ourselves through that lens.John Quinlan DoyleYes. In a world where the cost of risk is continuing to escalate, our efforts to -- on risk consulting are really important to our clients and driving a lot of value, Mike. I also want to point out what's obviously been a -- particularly on the reinsurance side of late. But after several years of pricing increases, of course, at Marsh as well, it's a difficult market.We take our role as a market maker quite seriously and in the quarter, announced a couple of different things that I would point out: a multiline facility in London that we call Fast Track for our clients at Marsh. And then we also created a reciprocal inside of our MGA operations at Victor as well, trying to bring new solutions to what is a difficult market for clients. Do you have a follow-up, Mike?Michael Augustus WardYes. That was super helpful. Maybe last quarter, you spoke a little bit about developing countercyclical product in Oliver Wyman. Just wondering if you can share some examples on that.John Quinlan DoyleYes. Nick, do you want to talk about some of the capabilities we've been building inside of Oliver Wyman?Nicholas Mark StuderYes. I mean there are various of our sectors, which are perhaps less exposed to the cycles. So last year, you saw we acquired the excellent Avascent business, which is in aerospace and defense specialist, as an example. So some of our sectors, we've been trying to position ourselves carefully through the cycle.And then on the capabilities side, we do a very large amount of work now in performance transformation. And that's not solely a downturn-oriented solution, but it's needed when clients are going through either margin squeeze on the top line or the bottom line.And then a couple of years ago, we started to build a restructuring practice. It's still very nascent, but we've seen very strong growth in that area as well. So that's just a few different examples.I think the final point I'd make is that really from the pandemic onwards, we've seen a reduction in the correlation between our different industries. Some have been in downturn for quite a long time, sort of working through their own so many crisis, which sometimes requires advisory support and then some are quite procyclical.But I'd note that our private equity, private capital practice, which obviously slowed considerably over the last 3 or 4 quarters has started to pick up and we're seeing activity both pre- and post-deal. So that's a sort of a bit of a picture across the business.John Quinlan DoyleThank you, Nick. Thank you, Mike, for the questions.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.Weston Clay BloomerThis is Weston Bloomer on for Brian. My first question is a follow-up on Oliver Wyman. Obviously, strong growth there and you highlighted a few subsectors that saw the growth. I'm curious, within financial services and banking, was any of that growth driven by the banking turmoil that we saw earlier in the year or more one-off opportunities? I guess I'm going with that, too, is that something that you think could play out in the back half of this year or 2024 just given the turmoil earlier in the year?John Quinlan DoyleThanks, Weston. Good question. Nick, maybe you could talk a little bit about -- you mentioned banking being a strength to date, but maybe you could talk about the outlook.Nicholas Mark StuderYes. I mean there are different puts and takes in our growth numbers. But perhaps 35% to 40% of our growth was driven by our banking practice. As you know, that is really a preeminent business for us. And at the beginning of that crisis, we felt that was just adding to uncertainty, may lead to some pauses in decisions, which may slow down the pipeline.In the second quarter, we did see some work coming through from it. It's hard to separate out exactly how much is driven by crisis response versus banks preparing to get ahead of capabilities that they now know they need given the very different interest rate environment.There are a lot of the core essentials of the banking system. Our muscles that haven't had to be used in the very low rate environment we've had for a very, very long time. And so there is work on liability management, interest rate risk management, deposit management, the value of the branch network, not to mention tooling ourselves up for the new TAC and AI capabilities that might be helpful. But yes, we have seen that be a driver of some business already and we continue to expect that over the coming quarters.John Quinlan DoyleThanks, Nick. Weston, yes, go ahead.Weston Clay BloomerYou'd highlight that 35% to 40% of the growth was driven within financial services. Have you given a -- rule of thumb, I'd always assume that financial services was the largest subsector within OI. I just want to confirm that's the case or if you've given a breakout there.Nicholas Mark StuderWe don't get to break out. I mean it's one of our strongest practices. It's also one of the largest sectors in management consulting globally but it's -- yes, it's one of our strength areas.Weston Clay BloomerGot it. And then just one more within Guy Carpenter. Can you talk about the dynamic versus treaty versus FAC placements and the kind of the growth outlook that you're seeing there? Are there more opportunities within FAC given just changes in buying or buyer behavior?John Quinlan DoyleThanks, Weston. We've seen good growth, in fact, over the course of the last couple of years, both ceded and client-driven, in fact, Oliver Wyman and Guy Carpenter and Marsh work quite closely together to capture that opportunity and to make sure we're bringing all the available capital all over the world to our clients to help again navigate what's been a very, very difficult marketplace. So the growth has been quite strong in both FAC and in treaty as well. Thank you, Weston.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler.Jon Paul NewsomeI didn't think I heard much of anything about the M&amp;A environment. I think we're all sort of waiting for things to change there versus the -- because of the interest rate environment changes that any updated thoughts on M&amp;A and how you see the environment there for yourself?John Quinlan DoyleYes. Sure, Paul. We remain quite active in the market and have a solid pipeline. We're -- of course, we continue to look for businesses with solid growth fundamentals that are well led and terrific talent and not only will they make us better, but hopefully, we think we can make them better as well.I'd say the pipeline is pretty broad from both an RIS and consulting perspective. We, of course, did a big deal in Mercer investments on the 1st of April. So we're excited about that in Australia and we were just in Australia as a team, so excited about the acquisition there and what it means to our investments.The market, obviously, the number of deals is -- was down. Some buyers, primarily financial buyers, are sitting it out at the moment, but strategic players are still quite active. And what I would say is demand is strong for higher-quality businesses that are out there. And so while, obviously, the cost of capital has increased quite a bit, prized assets are still trading at a premium.So -- but again, we're excited about what's possible there. And we've worked very hard and have built a very strong reputation as a buyer in the market. And that creates a lot of opportunity for us. Do you have a follow-up, Paul.Jon Paul NewsomeYes. As a follow-up, could you talk about the divestitures that you've made and how important or maybe not important, they are to the margin improvements over the last quarter or last year? I know they're small in size, but...John Quinlan DoyleYes. Yes. No, thanks. Sorry to jump in on you there. They are relatively modest in size, but we are being thoughtful about the portfolio in that respect. And for the most part, they've happened at Mercer. Again, we recently announced the divestiture of what really is an admin business primarily or really entirely an admin business, and so not core, lower-growth, capital-intensive operations. And candidly, they're better owners of assets like that than us, others that can bring greater scale and technology and solutions.So we don't expect to do a lot of it, but where we see the opportunity and it makes us better and stronger and enables us to invest in our core, we'll take steps to do that. Thank you, Paul.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Jing Li with KBW.Jing LiJust a question on the Asia Pacific business. Can you add some color on it, since I see that is the rate of the sum for this quarter? So do you expect it to continue for the coming quarters?John Quinlan DoyleSure, Jing. Maybe I'll ask Martin to talk about it, but we're very excited about the possibility for growth in Asia and in the Pacific, not just at Marsh but across our businesses. As I mentioned, as a leadership team, we're recently in Australia and we see lots of possibilities. But Martin, maybe you can talk a little bit about the quarter and your outlook.Martin C. SouthLook, I think the important thing, when we look at International, we like to look at growth over longer periods of time. With regard to APAC, 6% underlying growth in the quarter, it's 8% year-to-date. We think that's much more indicative of what the growth would be like over a longer period of time.Likewise, we probably have slightly elevated growth in Latin America. We'd expect that to normalize over a period of time as well. So I just think it's something that we're not worried about. We have a great business in Asia Pac and feel very confident about the future.John Quinlan DoyleLots of opportunities. It's one of the parts of the world where there's a meaningful protection gap. So Jing, do you have a follow-up?Jing LiYes. So for this quarter, 6%, I guess? So you mean -- guys means that it's kind of like a one-time thing? So you continue to be a double-digit kind of going forward?John Quinlan DoyleSure. Yes, we're not going to give specific guidance on Asia Pacific underlying revenue growth. But we do think it's an area -- a region that we're very well positioned for strong growth going forward. So as Martin mentioned, we're well positioned in that market. We've got terrific distribution throughout most major countries throughout the region and we're excited about. It's one of the ways in which JLT made us quite stronger. So thank you, Jing.OperatorI'm showing no questions at the moment. (Operator Instructions).John Quinlan DoyleOperator, I think we can wrap up if there are no more questions.OperatorWe do have a question, a follow-up. Our follow-up question comes from Robert Cox with Goldman Sachs.Robert CoxJust one follow-up on the M&amp;A, SPAC and capital markets activity. Can you give us a sense of whether that continued maybe just directionally if that was more or less of a headwind in this quarter versus the first quarter?John Quinlan DoyleSure. Maybe I'll ask Martine to unpack our growth at Mercer investments a bit. Martine?Martine FerlandYes, absolutely. I mean we -- our OCIO business is grown really rapidly over the last few years. But as you know, it's been impacted by capital markets over the last many quarters. Although it does benefit from net AUM inflows, some of that volatility does drive demand for the OCIO service.What we've seen in Q2 is still a small drag due to year-over-year capital market. But based on the value that we see at the end of the quarter, it bodes well for the rest of the year. Small accretive growth from capital markets for Q3 as far as we can see from levels today. So this is a good business for us. It's a diversified portfolio. The volatility in the equity market has come down.On the bond market, it's still a little bit elevated. But all of that has contributed to a lot of need on the client side for advice regarding the volatility, the funding of their pension plans, et cetera. It's been good for us and our clients have been finding new ways to deal with the environment.John Quinlan DoyleThank you, Martine, and thanks, Rob, for the follow-up. I want to thank you all for joining us on the call this morning. In closing, I want to thank our over 85,000 colleagues for their hard work and dedication. I also want to thank our clients for their continued support. So thank you all very much and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Operator, thank you.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's program. You may now disconnect.]"

This compares to earnings of $1.89 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3.77%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this global professional services firm providing strategy, risk and people solutions would post earnings of $2.45 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.53, delivering a surprise of 3.27%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Marsh &amp; McLennan , which belongs to the Zacks Insurance - Brokerage industry, posted revenues of $5.88 billion for the quarter ended June 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.48%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $5.38 billion.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Marsh &amp; McLennan: favorable.

31,4bbed297-2b61-3799-99fd-dafdee0d0177,EQR,2023-07-21,What Awaits Mid-America Apartment (MAA) This Earnings Season?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/awaits-mid-america-apartment-maa-144700595.html,1689864420,STORY,"['MAA', 'EQR']","[Mid-America Apartment Communities MAA — commonly known as MAA — is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that focuses on owning, operating and acquiring apartment communities throughout the southeastern, southwestern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. MAA is slated to report second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 26 after market close.The Germantown, TN-based residential REIT delivered a surprise of 1.33% in terms of FFO per share in the last reported quarter. Its quarterly results were driven by an increase in the average effective rent per unit for the same-store portfolio.MAA has a decent surprise history. Over the trailing four quarters, MAA surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on all occasions, the average being 2.22%. This is depicted in the chart below:Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.US Residential Real Estate Market in Q2Despite cooling rent growth, apartment demand is showing signs of a solid rebound, with net absorption in the second quarter of 2023 nearing surging new supply levels. This stabilizes occupancy rates after a steep decline in 2022.Per RealPage data, in the second quarter, net demand registered at 83,449 units, and this marked a five-quarter high. While this is still below the record numbers seen during the 2021 boom, it indicates a normalization of apartment demand. What is interesting is that this demand rebound coincides with a 50-year high in apartment construction starting to convert into peak completions, with more than 107,000 units completed in the second quarter of this year itself.However, despite the supply surge, this solid demand is aiding in the mitigation of vacancy spikes in most markets, with U.S. apartment occupancy coming at 94.7% as of June, marking only a 0.1 percentage point decline since January. It marks a notable improvement compared to the occupancy fall of 1.2 percentage points in the first half of 2022 and then an additional 1.4 percentage points in the second half of the year.However, rent growth remains below normal in 2023, with year-over-year effective asking rent growth at just 1.5%. This is due to apartment operators prioritizing occupancy rates over rents, leading to more options for renters and putting downward pressure on rent growth. Same-store effective asking rents increased only 0.46% between May and June 2023.Story continuesMAA's Portfolio and StrategyAmid these, MAA’s diversified Sunbelt portfolio is well-poised to benefit from the favorable fundamentals of this market. The pandemic accelerated employment shifts and a population inflow into the company’s markets as renters seek more business-friendly, lower-taxed and low-density cities. These favorable longer-term secular dynamic trends are increasing the desirability of its markets.Additionally, MAA has been investing in its existing properties to attract new tenants and retain current ones. The company has been upgrading its amenities and technology to meet the evolving needs of renters. These improvements are likely to result in higher occupancy rates and rental income for MAA.Particularly, MAA continues to implement its three internal investment programs — interior redevelopment, property repositioning projects and Smart Home installations. The programs are expected to have helped the company capture the upside potential in rent growth, generate accretive returns and boost earnings from its existing asset base.However, the struggle to lure renters will persist as supply volumes are expected to remain elevated in some markets. This is likely to affect the company’s power to raise the rent or increase occupancy.Projections for Q2 2023We expect same-store net operating income to increase 5.7% year over year in the second quarter. Meanwhile, we project average physical occupancy of 95.8%, slightly higher than the prior quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $534.16 million. This suggests a 7.9% rise from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.MAA projected second-quarter 2023 core funds from operations (FFO) per share in the band of $2.18-$2.34, with $2.26 being the midpoint.Before the second-quarter earnings release, the company’s activities were not adequate to gain analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly FFO per share has remained unchanged at $2.27 in the past month. However, this suggests year-over-year growth of 12.4%.Here Is What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict a surprise in terms of FFO per share for MAA this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an FFO beat, which is not the case here.MAA currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of -0.66%.

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company to watch right now is International Game Technology (IGT). IGT is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 22.96, while its industry has an average P/E of 44.13. Over the past 52 weeks, IGT's Forward P/E has been as high as 22.96 and as low as 10.76, with a median of 15.98.Investors should also recognize that IGT has a P/B ratio of 3.54. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 10.24. IGT's P/B has been as high as 3.54 and as low as 1.55, with a median of 2.50, over the past year.Investors could also keep in mind MGM Resorts International (MGM), an Gaming stock with a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and Value grade of A.MGM Resorts International is currently trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 23.41 while its PEG ratio sits at 8.41. Both of the company's metrics compare favorably to its industry's average P/E of 44.13 and average PEG ratio of 5.44.Story continuesMGM's price-to-earnings ratio has been as high as 270.61 and as low as 18.74, with a median of 70.02, while its PEG ratio has been as high as 14.32 and as low as 1.48, with a median of 7.86, all within the past year.Additionally, MGM Resorts International has a P/B ratio of 3.48 while its industry's price-to-book ratio sits at 10.24. For MGM, this valuation metric has been as high as 3.48, as low as 1.73, with a median of 2.78 over the past year.These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that International Game Technology and MGM Resorts International are likely being undervalued right now.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on GIII Apparel GIII, Carnival CCL, and MGM Resorts International MGM.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:The time to strongly consider buying Airbnb stock again is upon us. Higher travel demand continues to boost the online vacation rental company with Airbnb stock landing a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and the Bull of the Day.Many travel-related companies are seeing their stocks move higher this earnings season with Delta Air Lines' second-quarter results leading the way so far. Delta was able to showcase robust quarterly growth on its way to beating top and bottom-line expectations. The same scenario could be in the cards for Airbnb, whose stock recently touched a new 52-week high of $147.67 a share on Wednesday and has now soared +70% this year.Strong Quarterly Growth  Higher highs could be around the corner for Airbnb stock leading up to its second-quarter report on Tuesday, August 1. Notably, Airbnb had a very strong first quarter that was highlighted by revenue growing 20% year over year to $1.81 billion with net income at $117 million, the company’s first profitable Q1 on a GAAP basis.Before non-recurring items and to the delight of investors, Airbnb’s Q1 earnings soared to $0.18 per share compared to an adjusted EPS loss of -$0.03 in the prior-year quarter. This also blasted Q1 earnings expectations of $0.10 per share by 80% with ABNB shares continuing to move higher as the company’s outlook has strengthened.It’s noteworthy that Airbnb has beaten earnings expectations for eight consecutive quarters with strong quarterly growth expected to continue. To that point, second-quarter sales are expected at $2.41 billion, up 14% from a year ago. Even better, Q2 earnings are projected to climb 39% to $0.78 per share compared to EPS of $0.56 in Q2 2022.Story continuesGrowth &amp; OutlookAirbnb’s road to profitability has been exceptional since the company went public in 2020 and posted an adjusted loss of -$15.53 a share that year. At the moment Airbnb stock has an “A” Zacks Style Scores grade for Growth in addition to its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Intriguingly, Airbnb’s annual earnings are now forecasted to climb 26% in fiscal 2023 at $3.53 per share with 2022 EPS at $2.70. Plus, fiscal 2024 earnings are anticipated to jump another 16% to $4.10 per share.On the top line, total sales are projected to rise 13% in FY23 and jump another 13% in FY24 to $10.75 billion. Fiscal 2024 sales projections would represent a very stellar 126% growth over the last five years with 2020 sales at $3.37 billion.Bottom LineSimply put, Airbnb’s growth trajectory is too impressive to overlook at the moment. Now appears to be an ideal time to buy Airbnb stock as we progress through the summer months and peak travel season. It would be no surprise if ABNB shares keep soaring with Q2 earnings approaching and strong quarterly growth expected to reconfirm the company’s attractive outlook.Bear of the Day:One stock investors may want to be cautious of at the moment isFlower Foods, which has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and lands the Bear of the Day.There is a cautionary tale building for companies that produce or market higher-quality foods as margins are starting to drop on lower demand. Despite broader inflation beginning to ease, the inflationary environment is still challenging for these retailers and consumers continue to scale back on premium or specialty food consumption.This leaves more downside risk ahead for Flower Foods stock as the company is a provider of high-quality baked items with brands that include Nature’s Own, Dave’s Killer Bread, and Tastykake.United Natural Foods WarningInvestors may want to take heed of United Natural Foods' warning and its stocks' steep decline over the last few months.United Natural Foods' stock has dropped -22% since June after the company stated its profitability was being impacted by a greater-than-expected decline in gross margins. This was attributed to a challenging operating and macroeconomic backdrop which contributed to lower inflationary benefits primarily related to reduced procurement gains, as well as higher shrinkage.As a leading distributor of natural organic and specialty food products, United Natural Foods' earnings estimates have largely declined over the last quarter.Flower Foods has also warned of inflationary pressures with CEO Ryals McMullian stating this led to a slow start to the year and lower-than-expected branded retail sales due to softer category demand.Flower Foods' earnings are now expected to be down -5% this year but rebound and rise 7% in fiscal 2024 at $1.28 per share. However, earnings estimate revisions have also trended down for Flower Foods which could be a sign of more short-term pain ahead.Performance WarningFlower Foods stock hasn’t seen quite the decline as United Natural Foods stock this year but the downward trend in earnings estimate revisions is still worrisome considering the broader struggles for higher-quality food retailers.It may not be wise to overlook Flower Foods stocks’ -14% drop this year with United Natural Foods stock dropping -48% which serves as a further warning as to where these stocks could be headed if their earnings pictures continue to weaken.Bottom LineFor now, investors may want to stay on the sidelines in regards to investing in Flower Foods stock. The case for selling the stock has gained steam with the notion that shares of FLO may keep falling when looking at United Natural Foods' troubling performance this year.Additional content:3 Stocks to Gain as Consumers are Opening Up Their WalletsSales at U.S. retailers increased for the third successive month in June. Per the Commerce Department, spending at retail outlets rose 0.2% last month from May, way better than March and February’s negative readings.Retail sales, excluding sales of cars and sales at gas stations, inched up 0.3% in June from May. Overall retail sales rose 1.5% year over year in June.Retail sales were broad-based, with car dealers, furniture and electric stores, and clothing stores, to name a few, witnessing gains in June. In reality, retail sales inched forward last month as Americans opened up their wallets despite higher interest rates and concerns about an impending economic slump.Consumers’ willingness to spend improved largely due to a healthy labor market, a rise in wages, and savings that they had amassed during the coronavirus pandemic. Price pressures have also eased at the moment, which bolstered consumer outlays.Nonfarm payroll jobs have been added to the economy at a steady clip for quite some time now. Now, job additions in June may have been less than in May, but it’s still more than analysts’ estimate. The jobless rate, in the meantime, continues to hover below the 4%-mark, while average hourly earnings improved last month.In June, the annual rate of inflation declined to its lowest level in more than two years. Prices of indispensable goods and services dropped for the 12th month in a row in June. In this day and age, price pressures have more than halved from the 40-year high it hit last year (read more: 5 Solid Stocks to Gain on Signs of Inflation Cooling Down).What’s more, consumers are pretty confident about their welfare and are financially secure. For July, the preliminary reading of the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index came in at 72.6, way more than June’s reading of 64.4. The sentiment index has now touched its highest level since September 2021.Consumers’ views on the present economic situation and future expectations also improved, a tell-tale sign that they are poised to spend further soon. Now, with consumer spending remaining resilient and household outlays set to improve, consumer discretionary stocks stand to gain. Needless to say, consumer spending plays a pivotal role in determining their revenues.Stocks to GainWe have, thus, selected three consumer discretionary stocks such as GIII Apparel Group, Carnival, and MGM Resorts International that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Such stocks also boast a VGM Score of A or B.

The move was backed by solid volume with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This compares to the stock's 14.9% gain over the past four weeks.Improvement in premium per customer, continued shift in the mix of underlying products toward higher value policies and instalment fees and a robust capital position continue to drive LMND.Higher net added customers as well as expansion of geographic footprint and product offerings are likely to boost gross written premium. In-force premium is likely to have been aided by an increase in customer base as well as an improvement in premium per customer.Commission and Other Income is expected to increase on the back of growth on premium placed with third-party insurance companies and higher installment fees billed.Lemonade boasts a solid capital position. Its existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet working capital needs and capital expenditure over at least the next 12 months.This company is expected to post quarterly loss of $1.02 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +7.3%. Revenues are expected to be $97.64 million, up 95.3% from the year-ago quarter.While earnings and revenue growth expectations are important in evaluating the potential strength in a stock, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For Lemonade, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. And a stock's price usually doesn't keep moving higher in the absence of any trend in earnings estimate revisions.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude ended $1.42, or 1.9%, higher at $77.07 a barrel, its highest since April 25. WTI gained nearly 2% in the week.""The oil market is starting to slowly price in a looming supply crunch,"" Price Futures Group analyst Phil Flynn said.""Global supplies are starting to tighten and that could accelerate dramatically in the coming weeks. Increased war risk could also impact prices,"" Flynn said.Russia hit Ukrainian food export facilities for a fourth day in a row on Friday and practised seizing ships in the Black Sea, in an escalation of tensions in the region since Moscow's withdrawal this week from a U.N.-brokered safe sea corridor agreement.A shutdown of the grain corridor could hit supplies of ethanol and biofuels that are blended with oil products at a time that global grain markets are already tightening, which would lead to refiners using more crude oil, Flynn said.The seizure of ships could also add risks to oil and other goods exports in the region, he added. The Kremlin on Friday said Ukraine's ""unpredictable"" actions pose a danger to civilian shipping in the Black Sea, and the situation around Russian exports requires analysis.In the U.S., crude inventories fell last week, amid a jump in crude exports and higher refinery utilisation, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday. Earlier on Monday, the EIA had forecast that U.S. shale oil and gas production was likely to decline in August for the first time this year, adding to concerns of supply tightness.Meanwhile, U.S. energy firms this week reduced the number of oil rigs by seven, their biggest cut since early June, energy services firm Baker Hughes said. At 530, the U.S. oil rig count, an early indicator of future output, is at its lowest since March 2022.Story continuesUAE Energy Minister Suhail al-Mazrouei told Reuters that current actions by OPEC+ to support the oil market were sufficient for now and the group was ""only a phone call away"" if any further steps were needed.Chinese authorities unveiled plans to help boost sales of automobiles and electronics, a move welcomed by investors hoping that it would reinvigorate the country's sluggish economy.Next week, preliminary purchasing manager surveys from S&amp;P Global will be key for investors trying to understand changing global demand, Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Asset Management, said.(Reporting by Shariq Khan in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Natalie Grover in London, Arathy Somasekhar in Houston and Andrew Hayley in Beijing; Editing by Marguerita Choy and David Holmes)]"
40,3e02d3e0-3e30-3b16-9e09-907e34b87ce1,O,2023-07-21,New Revenue Sharing Scheme Could Lead To Iraqi Oil Renaissance,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/revenue-sharing-scheme-could-lead-000000011.html,1689897600,STORY,['CL=F'],"[Iraq has been looking to bring foreign oil company money and expertise into the fold, and it looks like it may have finally found a way to make doing business in Iraq attractive enough.Iraq’s economy depends on oil, which accounts for 99% of Iraq’s exports and 42% of its GDP, according to the most recent World Bank estimates. This heavy reliance on oil revenues has somewhat diminished Iraq’s concern with the carbon intensity of its oil operations, although now, with Western oil companies feeling the pressure to remain in good climate standing, climate concerns have gained some importance, even in major oil-producing countries such as Iraq.One of the biggest concerns in Iraq is that it captures only about half of the associated gas produced when pumping oil, meaning it flares a substantial amount of gas into the atmosphere.But the other concern is the contract terms, which some foreign oil companies have deemed unfavorable. Up until now, the terms have revolved around a fixed price for oil per barrel after reimbursing costs. This doesn’t allow oil companies to benefit when oil prices jump. And if costs rise, as they have over the last couple of years, they lose even more.Related: New UK Offshore Wind Projects Threatened By Soaring Costs Iraq’s wars, domestic conflicts, and political upheavals have added to climate concerns and unfavorable contract terms to push Iraq down the list for attractive oil projects.But Baby, I’m Worth ItNevertheless, Iraq—including the territory governed by the Kurdistan Regional Government—holds a whopping 145 billion barrels in proved reserves. It is the fifth-largest proved crude oil reserves in the world.This has been enough to entice at least Chinese companies—including CNOOC—to go hog wild in Iraq’s energy sector, not facing as much climate scrutiny as their Western counterparts. In fact, Chinese contractors have singlehandedly secured 59% of all energy projects from 2018 through the end of 2022. Japan contractors took second place, undeterred by the traditional terms.Story continuesBut other foreign companies have shown a greater reluctance to take part in tapping Iraq’s plentiful reserves, with Western companies, including U.S.-based Exxon pulling back even on existing projects—until now.Never mind the crises Iraq has faced, the uncertainties that could mean going forward. Forget the carbon-intensive projects that flare half of the gas that comes out of the ground. All that was needed, apparently, was a change in the financial aspect of the projects.Earlier this month, TotalEnergies signed a massive $27 billion oil deal with Iraq after the country offered terms that were much more palatable given the rest of the drawbacks. We’re talking about revenue sharing and an accommodation to capture more of the gas that is flared.For TotalEnergies, the deal was hard fought, with negotiations beginning years ago. Ultimately, Iraq had to go back to the drawing board several times to reach into its own pockets and dish out even more favorable terms. Iraq eventually settled on hanging onto just 30% of the project, with TotalEnergies grabbing 45% (and QatarEnergy getting a 25% stake). Part of the proposal includes a provision to construct installations that will recover associated gas that is currently being flared on three oilfields. The deal will allow TotalEnergies to take part of the revenues from the Ratawi oilfield and use it to help finance three more projects.The revenue-sharing scheme will see 25% of the revenue from each barrel going to Iraq as a royalty, and 75% back to stakeholders.From gas capturing to revenue sharing, the terms are a marked improvement and could woo other foreign oil companies to Iraq, which has grand plans to expand its oil output and disentangle itself from its reliance on Iranian gas.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:WTI Drops Despite Crude Inventory DrawChina Snaps Up Record-High Volumes Of Russian Crude In The First Half Of 2023Carbon Prices Set To Fall As Europe Speeds Up Energy TransitionRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

The same case applied to the Russian market before Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, with Trafigura moving ~850,000 barrels of Russian crude per day at its peak. But the oil hegemony has now been severely disrupted, with Bloomberg reporting that six little-known companies based in Dubai and Hong Kong now dominate Russian oil trade with the traditional leaders no longer in the picture.According to Bloomberg, Russian customs data shows that Nord Axis Ltd, Tejarinaft FZCO,QR Trading DMCC, Concept Oil Services Ltd, Bellatrix Energy Ltd and Coral Energy DMCC together handled about 1.4 million barrels a day of Russian crude oil. That’s more oil than what the commodity giants typically handled before the war in Ukraine, and enough to meet the entire needs of countries such as the UK and Italy.Interestingly, it’s Nord Axis, a company that was incorporated just a year ago in Hong Kong, that emerged as the biggest buyer, moving 521,000 barrels of Russian crude per day. Nord Axis was virtually unknown in the oil market until it bought Trafigura’s stake in Rosneft’s flagship oil project Vostok Oil in July. Dubai-based Tejarinaft FZCO was the second largest buyer after it purchased 244,000 barrels a day from Rosneft  while Dubai-based QR Trading DMCC was the third-largest buyer, moving 199,000 barrels a day from Surgutneftegas PJSC. Other top buyers were Hong Kong’s Concept Oil Services Ltd (152,000 b/d), Hong Kong-based Bellatrix Energy Ltd (151,000 b/d) and Dubai’s Coral Energy DMCC (121,000 b/d).Source: BloombergStory continuesIt’s not clear how these traders were able to finance the large flows of Russian oil, with Bloomberg estimating it was worth more $2 billion over the month of December.Even more perplexing is the fact that Nord Axis, QR Trading DMCC and Bellatrix Energy Ltd were unknown entities before the west abandoned the Russian energy markets. Bloomberg has established that Bellatrix received loan facilities from Russian banks including Rosneft-owned Russian Regional Development Bank and Russian Agricultural Bank, though calls or emails to these traders, their banks and Russian oil producers have gone unanswered.“Knowing who the big names are is an important step in understanding how oil markets are responding to the price cap and wider sanctions,” Steve Cicala, co-director of the Project on the Economic Analysis of Regulation at the National Bureau of Economic Research, has told Bloomberg.Meanwhile, other experts have decried the opacity of Russian oil markets, “We’re coming to this with a lot of humility and we’re just asking that everyone else can adopt the same level of uncertainty. These are really opaque markets, the data’s not great on it. Let’s just acknowledge that from the outset when we’re making conclusions,” U.S. Assistant Treasury Secretary Ben Harris has told Bloomberg.Russian Oil Flows Holding Up, But Not ForeverLast year, against all odds, Russia managed to grow its oil output despite being hit with tough sanctions, a plethora of oilfield service companies exiting the country as well as the refusal by western countries to buy its crude for the most part.Indeed, Energy Intelligence reports that in 2022, Russia’s crude and condensate production increased 2%, with oil production clocking in at 10.73 million b/d, above Russia's ministry for economic development forecast of 10.33 million b/d.Russia managed to pull off this feat mainly by offering huge discounts to buyers like China and India, with Bloomberg's oil strategist Julian Lee reporting that the two were receiving discounts of $33.28 per barrel, or about 40% to international Brent crude prices oil at the time.But Moscow cannot continue defying the odds indefinitely. BP Plc (NYSE: BP) has predicted that the country’s output is likely to take a big hit over the long-term, with production declining 25%-42% by 2035. BP says that Russia's oil output could decrease from 12 million barrels per day in 2019 to 7-9 million bpd in 2035 thanks to the curtailment of new promising projects, limited access to foreign technologies as well as a high rate of reduction in existing operating assets.In contrast, BP says that OPEC will become even more dominant as the years roll on, with the cartel’s share in global production increasing to 45%-65% by 2050 from just over 30% currently. Bad news for the bulls: BP remains bearish about the long-term prospects for oil, saying demand for oil is likely to plateau over the next 10 years and then decline to 70-80 million bpd by 2050.That said, Russia might still be able to avoid a sharp decline in production because many of the assets of oil companies that exited the country were abandoned or sold to local management teams who retained critical expertise.By Alex Kimani for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:U.S. Shale Challenges OPEC With Record Production In 2023Carbon Prices Set To Fall As Europe Speeds Up Energy TransitionU.S. and Qatar At The Forefront Of Global LNG Supply GrowthRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

43,e5a90e51-885e-3692-94ec-e258a2d7714c,O,2023-07-21,"Oil rises after whipsaw week on China stimulus, tighter supply",Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-rises-whipsaw-week-china-212341263.html,1689888221,STORY,"['SCO', 'DX', 'DX-PC', 'UCO', 'HG=F', 'CL=F']","[Investing.com -- Oil prices rose on Friday after wild swings through the week as markets weighed tightening supplies and uncertainty over demand, with focus now shifting squarely towards a Federal Reserve meeting next week.Crude prices were set to end higher for the week as new stimulus measures from China ramped up hopes of improving fuel demand in the world's largest oil importer. Oil prices also remained close to 10-week highs hit earlier in the month, as the prospect of tighter global supplies appeared to have provided markets with a floor.But caution over an upcoming Fed meeting still stymied any major gains in oil markets, especially as the dollar rebounded amid positioning for the meeting. The greenback had this week risen sharply from a 15-month low hit earlier in July.Brent oil futures rose 0.9% to $80.36 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 0.9% to $76.36 a barrel by 22:16 ET (02:16 GMT).China stimulus, tightening supplies in focusOil prices took some support from bets that China - the world’s largest crude importer - will roll out more stimulus measures to buoy a slowing economic recovery.The country unveiled new measures on Friday aimed at promoting local spending, particularly in the automobile and consumer discretionary sector. Beijing has vowed to shore up local consumption in order to sustain an economic rebound this year.Data released earlier this week showed that Chinese economic growth slowed sharply in the second quarter, drawing vows of more fiscal support from government officials.The country also imported near-record amounts of crude through the first half of 2023, with refinery demand remaining strong. Sluggish Chinese fuel consumption, on the other hand, has been a source of anxiety for oil markets.On the supply side, lower production in Saudi Arabia and Russia pointed to tighter oil markets in the second half of 2023, which analysts said is likely to keep oil prices supported.Story continuesFed meeting awaited, markets watch for potential pauseWhile the Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points when it concludes a two-day meeting on Wednesday, markets are watching for any signals that the central bank plans to end its rate-hike cycle and keep rates at 5.5% for the rest of the year.The prospect of a Fed pause, following weaker-than-expected U.S. inflation, had triggered sharp gains in oil prices earlier in July, as the dollar retreated. Any dovish signals from the central bank could spark more gains in crude markets.But with U.S. rates likely to remain higher for longer, markets were also concerned that global economic conditions will worsen in the second half of 2023, potentially hurting oil demand.Related ArticlesOil rises after whipsaw week on China stimulus, tighter supplyOil ticks up as markets assess falling inventories, potential Chinese stimulusGold prices rise amid Fed pause bets, copper gains on China stimulus]"

The previous rate of 12.5% paid by oil and gas companies for federal drilling rights had remained unchanged for a century. The federal rate was significantly lower than what many states and private landowners charge for drilling leases on state or private lands.The new rule does not go so far as to prohibit new oil and gas leasing on public lands, as many environmental groups have urged and as President Joe Biden promised during the 2020 campaign. But officials said the proposal would lead to a more responsible leasing process that provides a better return to U.S. taxpayers.The plan codifies provisions in the climate law, known as the Inflation Reduction Act, as well as the 2021 infrastructure law and recommendations from an Interior report on oil and gas leasing issued in November 2021.The new rule “provides a fair return to taxpayers, adequately accounts for environmental harms and discourages speculation by oil and gas companies,'' said Laura Daniel-Davis, principal deputy assistant Interior secretary for land and minerals management.Interior ""is committed to creating a more transparent, inclusive and just approach to leasing and permitting that serves the public interest while protecting natural and cultural resources on our public lands,″ she added.The new royalty rate set by the climate law is expected to remain in place until August 2032, after which it can be increased. The higher rate would increase costs for oil and gas companies by an estimated $1.8 billion in that period, according to the Interior Department.Story continuesThe rule also would increase the minimum leasing bond paid by energy companies to $150,000, up from the previous $10,000 established in 1960. The higher bonding requirement is intended to ensure that companies meet their obligations to clean up drilling sites after they are done or cap wells that are abandoned.The previous level was far too low to force companies to act and did not cover potential costs to reclaim a well, officials said. As a result, taxpayers frequently end up covering cleanup costs for abandoned or depleted wells if an operator refuses to do so or declares bankruptcy. Hundreds of thousands of “orphaned” oil and gas wells and abandoned coal and hardrock mines pose serious safety hazards, while causing ongoing environmental damage.The Interior Department has made available more than $1 billion in the past two years from the infrastructure law to clean up orphaned oil and gas wells on public lands. The new rule aims to prevent that burden from falling on taxpayers in the future.Bureau of Land Management Director Tracy Stone-Manning, whose agency issued the new rule, said the proposal “aims to ensure fairness to the taxpayer and balanced, responsible development as we continue to transition to a clean energy economy. It includes common-sense and needed fiscal revisions to BLM’s program, many directed by Congress.”The BLM, an Interior Department agency, oversees more than 245 million acres of public lands, primarily in the West.Environmental groups hailed the rule change as overdue and said the Biden administration recognized that business as usual by the oil and gas industry is incompatible with increased risks from climate change — a crisis the oil industry played a large role in creating.“These changes were badly needed — to put it mildly — and will help make onshore leasing more fair to taxpayers and hold industry accountable for its harms,'' said Josh Axelrod of the Natural Resources Defense Council.But he and other advocates said Biden should keep his promise to end new drilling on public lands. “In addition to making polluters pay with these fiscal reforms, it’s time for the Biden administration to align our federal fossil fuel program with America’s transition to a clean energy economy,'' said Mattea Mrkusic of Evergreen Action, another environmental group.The oil industry said the rule change would discourage oil and gas production in the United States.“Responsible development of federal lands is critical for meeting the growing demand for affordable, reliable energy while reducing (greenhouse gas) emissions,'' said Holly Hopkins, vice president of the American Petroleum Institute, an industry lobbying group.“Amidst a global energy crisis, this action from the Department of the Interior is yet another attempt to add even more barriers to future energy production,'' she said.The proposal issued Thursday follows an Interior report on federal oil and gas leasing issued in November 2021. Biden ordered the report soon after taking office in January 2021 as he directed a pause in federal oil and gas lease sales, citing worries about climate change.The moratorium drew sharp criticism from congressional Republicans and the oil industry, even as many environmentalists and Democrats urged Biden to make the leasing pause permanent.The moratorium was overturned by the courts, and oil and gas lease sales have resumed, including some mandated by the climate law in a compromise with Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia.A separate Biden administration proposal would put conservation on equal footing with industry on public lands. A BLM plan would allow conservationists and others to lease federally owned land to restore it, much the same way oil companies buy leases to drill and ranchers pay to graze cattle.Environmentalists say the plan would benefit wildlife, outdoor recreation and conservation, but critics, including Republican lawmakers and the agriculture industry, say it could exclude mining, energy development and agriculture.The rules on oil and gas and public lands use are both expected to become final next year.]"

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230720855450/en/Graphic: Morgan StanleyAmid signs of cooling inflation, investor optimism ticks up. Over half (54%) believe that inflation will reach normal levels by the end of the year, up 4 percentage points quarter over quarter. 54% think the Fed will navigate a ""soft landing"", up 7 percentage points from Q2, and more think that the economy is healthy enough for the Fed to enact additional rate hikes this quarter—up 3 percentage points to 48%.Bullishness prevails. Over half (55%) of investors are bullish on the quarter—up 3 percentage points from Q2. And more believe that the market will end in the green this quarter with 58% predicting a rise, 10 percentage points higher than last quarter.But inflation remains the top concern. Over half (52%) said high inflation is a top concern when it comes to their portfolio, followed by a recession (31%), and market volatility (26%).And views on elevated volatility remain high. 91% of investors believe that volatility will increase or stay the same this quarter, up 2 percentage points since last quarter.""Despite a recent market rise, investor uncertainties abound,"" said Mike Loewengart, Head of Model Portfolio Construction for Morgan Stanley Portfolio Solutions. ""We’re beginning to witness a slow shift happening in the investing landscape as we narrow in on the potential end to the Fed’s rate hike campaign. But inflation is still very much a part of the conversation and should factor into long-term investing decisions. That said, for those who were enticed to move into cash over the last year or two, consider the purchasing power risks. Investors are missing out on capital appreciation if they’re sitting on the sidelines, and most cannot time the market. Bottom line, maintaining a diversified portfolio across asset classes and investments provides the fundamental framework for a long-term investing strategy and can help weather all market conditions.""Story continuesThe survey explored investor views on sector opportunities for the third quarter of 2023:IT – With artificial intelligence centerstage, technology moved into the top position for investing opportunities this quarter, with over half (51%) eyeing the sector—up 9 percentage points from Q2.Energy – Investors may be hunting for bargains in this recently depressed sector, with 43% showing interest.Health care – As investors brace for a potential economic slowdown, interest in health care remains high (34%) as investors typically view this area of the market as a defensive play.About the SurveyThis wave of the survey was conducted from July 5 to July 20 of 2023 among an online US sample of 909 self-directed investors, investors who fully delegate investment account management to financial professionals, and investors who utilize both.

SNA reported second-quarter 2023 results, wherein both earnings and revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, sales and earnings advanced year over year. Results have benefited from continued positive business momentum and contributions from its Value Creation plan.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have gained 13.7% in the past three months compared with the industry's 7.5% growth.Q2 HighlightsSnap-on’s earnings of $4.89 per share in second-quarter 2023 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.53. The figure also improved by 14.5% from earnings of $4.27 reported in the prior-year quarter.Net sales grew 4.8% year over year to $1,191.3 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,184 million. The increase can be attributed to organic sales growth of 5.6%, which can be compared with our estimate of 7.6% growth. This was somewhat offset by an $8.3 million negative impact of foreign currency translations.The gross profit of $603.7 million improved by 9.1% year over year, while the gross margin expanded by 200 basis points (bps) year over year to 50.7% in the reported quarter. We had expected a gross margin of 50% and a gross margin expansion of 130 bps for the quarter under discussion.The company’s operating earnings before financial services totaled $277 million, up 12.3% year over year. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings before financial services expanded 160 bps to 23.3% in the second quarter. Financial Services' operating earnings were $66.9 million in the quarter, up 2.5% year over year.Consolidated operating earnings (including financial services) were $343.9 million, up 10.3% year over year. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings expanded 130 bps year over year to 26.8%.Snap-On Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseSnap-On Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseSnap-On Incorporated price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Snap-On Incorporated QuoteSegmental DetailsSales in Commercial &amp; Industrial Group grew 1.4% from the prior-year quarter to $364.2 million on organic sales growth of 3%. This was partly offset by a negative currency impact of $5.6 million. Organic growth was aided by an increase in activity with customers in critical industries, partially offset by lower power tool volumes. In the quarter, we had expected sales of $368.7 million from the segment.The Tools Group segment’s sales rose 0.5% year over year to $523.1 million, driven by organic sales growth of 1.1%, partially offset by a $3.2-million negative impact of foreign currency. Robust sales in international operations and the U.S. franchise operations aided organic sales.Sales in Repair Systems &amp; Information Group advanced 8.4% year over year to $452 million, with organic sales growth of 8.5%. Sales gains were somewhat offset by a $0.3-million negative impact of foreign currency. Strong sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers and a rise in sales of under-car equipment contributed to segment organic sales growth. Increased activities with OEM dealerships have also aided the segment’s results. Our estimate for sales from this segment was $439.6 million in the quarter.The Financial Services business’ revenues rose 8.1% year over year to $93.4 million in the quarter. Our estimate for sales from this segment was $87.8 million in the quarter.Story continuesFinancialsAs of Jul 1, 2023, Snap-on’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $871.3 million, with long-term debt of $1,184.2 million and shareholders’ equity (before non-controlling interest) of $4,757.1 million. It incurred $25.8 million in capital expenditures in the quarter under review.Looking AheadManagement expects continued progress by leveraging capabilities in the automotive repair arena as well as expanding its customer base in automotive repair and across geographies, including critical industries. As a result, capital expenditure for 2023 is projected to be $100 million. The company anticipates an effective tax rate of 23-24% for 2023.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked companies are G-III Apparel Group, Ltd.

(NASDAQ:ALGN)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-align-technology-inc-nasdaq-101240306.html,1689934360,STORY,['ALGN'],"[Align Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALGN) saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Align Technology’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Align Technology Is Align Technology Still Cheap?The stock is currently trading at US$331 on the share market, which means it is overvalued by 38% compared to my intrinsic value of $239.58. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Given that Align Technology’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of Align Technology look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Align Technology's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in ALGN’s positive outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe ALGN should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ALGN for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for ALGN, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

56,7c826d0c-80fb-3d7d-9b37-c235a18ced35,ALGN,2023-07-21,West Pharmaceutical Services (WST) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/west-pharmaceutical-services-wst-expected-140203440.html,1689861723,STORY,"['WST', 'ALGN']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when West Pharmaceutical Services (WST) reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 27, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis medical device company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.96 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -20.7%.Revenues are expected to be $754.96 million, down 2.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.11% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for West Pharmaceutical?For West Pharmaceutical, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.42%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #1.So, this combination indicates that West Pharmaceutical will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that West Pharmaceutical would post earnings of $1.67 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.98, delivering a surprise of +18.56%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.West Pharmaceutical appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Medical - Dental Supplies industry, Align Technology (ALGN), is soon expected to post earnings of $2.02 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +1%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $987.69 million, up 1.9% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Align Technology has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. However, an equal Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Align Technology will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The two companies recently set a new Oct. 18 deadline to close the deal, giving them more time to satisfy regulators.“The recent decision in the US and approvals in 40 countries all validate that the deal is good for competition, players, and the future of gaming,” a spokesperson for Activision Blizzard said Wednesday in an email to Yahoo Finance.“We’re confident in our next steps and that our deal will quickly close.”Activision Blizzard is the largest game publisher in North America. In addition to the hit “Call of Duty” franchise, the company also offers “World of Warcraft,” “Diablo,” and “Overwatch.” The firm also owns mobile game publisher King, the company behind “Candy Crush.”Adding those franchises to Microsoft’s existing titles, including “Halo” and “Forza,” would catapult Microsoft past Nintendo (NTDOY) to make the company the second-largest home console maker by revenue behind Sony (SONY).It would also put Microsoft behind Tencent and Sony as the third-largest gaming company by global revenue.FTC commissioners withdrew the agency's litigation in a document filed Thursday, pausing all proceedings before the agency's administrative law judge. The case was set for trial beginning Aug. 2.With the administrative case now withdrawn, Microsoft and Activision have no legal barrier in the US to closing their deal. However, the FTC could still ask Microsoft for additional concessions in exchange for an agreement not to sue in federal court.Microsoft and Activision had pressed the FTC to drop the case in a joint motion filed Tuesday, after the regulator's legal campaign was significantly weakened by a US appellate court.Story continuesThat appellate court had denied the agency's request to pause the merger, technically clearing the way for the companies to close in the US. The FTC appealed that ruling.Microsoft has spent roughly 10 months negotiating with domestic and overseas antitrust regulators to calm fears that the tie-up would threaten competition in various gaming markets.The company was originally set to finalize its purchase of the ""Call of Duty"" maker on July 18, but the regulatory actions in the UK and US slowed the ability to get the deal done.Microsoft moved one step closer to completing the acquisition of the company that makes ""Call of Duty."" (AP Photo/Peter Morgan) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Under the terms of a revised agreement, a prior $3 billion breakup fee increases to $3.5 billion if Microsoft fails to close the purchase by Aug. 29, and $4.5 billion if it can't get it done by Sept. 15.The last hurdle is now in the UK. After initially blocking the merger over concerns that Microsoft would gain too much market dominance in cloud gaming, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) agreed to reopen negotiations with the tech giant. A London court then paused Microsoft’s appeal of the regulator’s initial decision.One recent concession to regulatory concerns was that Microsoft promised to make Activision’s widely popular “Call of Duty” franchise available for 10 years to rival gaming console maker Sony, in addition to earlier agreements with Nvidia and Nintendo.Those earlier agreements to make the game available to Nintendo and Nvidia weren't enough to persuade UK regulators that Microsoft's concessions were sufficient. The regulator expressed worries that the merger would nonetheless give Microsoft too much dominance in cloud gaming.The FTC for its part said the acquisition could harm consumers not only in cloud gaming, but also gaming subscription services and gaming consoles.Alexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A handful of well-known big cap stocks have sunk to new lows. Several are even at decade lows. Many long-term investors have been caught in the sell-off and are unsure about what to do.As Zacks Kevin Cook always says about investing decisions: have a plan. Investors who have a plan, and execute it, will feel better about their choices and will regain a sense of control.But many investors get paralyzed as a sell-off picks up steam, especially if they have owned the stock for years.  Should you buy more shares, hold it and do nothing or sell it?5 Stocks Trading at Multi-Year Lows1.      Verizon Communications, Inc. VZVerizon is a favorite of income investors because of its large dividend, which is currently yielding 7.7%.But shares of Verizon have been sliding for the last 2 years. It’s down nearly 40% during that time and has sunk 13% year-to-date. Recently, there have been concerns about reporting that there may be lead-covered cables which may need to be replaced nationwide. Verizon is cheap, with a forward P/E of 6.7. But it hit a multi-decade low this week.Story continuesIs this a buying opportunity in Verizon?2.      AT&amp;T Inc. TAT&amp;T, like Verizon, is a favorite of income investors because it is paying a dividend yielding 7.7%.But, just like Verizon, shares of AT&amp;T have hit multi-decade lows this week on the uncertainty about the alleged lead-covered cables. Shares of AT&amp;T have sunk 20.5% year-to-date but are down 31% over the last 2 years. Over the last 10 years, it hasn’t been any better. AT&amp;T is down 46.5% while the NASDAQ was up 371% and the S&amp;P 500 rose 217%.AT&amp;T is dirt cheap with a forward P/E of just 5.6. Should new investors be taking a chance on AT&amp;T?3.      3M Company MMM3M has paid a dividend for 100 years and has raised it 64 years in a row. It’s a dividend aristocrat. But shares of 3M hit new 10-year lows in May 2023 as the company announced it was entering into a class resolution about forever chemicals in the water for $10.3 billion, payable over 13 years.Shares of 3M are still down 13.7% year-to-date. Over the last 10 years, they’re up just 9.3% while the S&amp;P 500 has gained 217%. But 3M is now paying a dividend of 5.9% and it’s cheap, with a forward P/E of 11.7.Is the worst news already priced into 3M?4.      The Walt Disney Co. DISDisney has been a favorite investment for decades by parents wanting to buy stocks for their kids. But shares of Disney recently hit 9-year lows last seen in June 2014. Disney shares are up 58% over the last 10 years through July 17, 2023, but the S&amp;P 500 is up 217% in that time.Disney isn’t cheap, despite the stock sell-off.

A handful of well-known big cap stocks have sunk to new lows. Several are even at decade lows. Many long-term investors have been caught in the sell-off and are unsure about what to do.As Zacks Kevin Cook always says about investing decisions: have a plan. Investors who have a plan, and execute it, will feel better about their choices and will regain a sense of control.But many investors get paralyzed as a sell-off picks up steam, especially if they have owned the stock for years.  Should you buy more shares, hold it and do nothing or sell it?5 Stocks Trading at Multi-Year Lows 1.      Verizon Communications, Inc. (VZ)Verizon is a favorite of income investors because of its large dividend, which is currently yielding 7.7%.But shares of Verizon have been sliding for the last 2 years. It’s down nearly 40% during that time and has sunk 13% year-to-date. Recently, there have been concerns about reporting that there may be lead-covered cables which may need to be replaced nationwide. Verizon is cheap, with a forward P/E of 6.7. But it hit a multi-decade low this week.Is this a buying opportunity in Verizon?2.      AT&amp;T Inc. (T)AT&amp;T, like Verizon, is a favorite of income investors because it is paying a dividend yielding 7.7%.But, just like Verizon, shares of AT&amp;T have hit multi-decade lows this week on the uncertainty about the alleged lead-covered cables. Shares of AT&amp;T have sunk 20.5% year-to-date but are down 31% over the last 2 years. Over the last 10 years, it hasn’t been any better. AT&amp;T is down 46.5% while the NASDAQ was up 371% and the S&amp;P 500 rose 217%.Story continuesAT&amp;T is dirt cheap with a forward P/E of just 5.6. Should new investors be taking a chance on AT&amp;T?3.      3M Company (MMM)3M has paid a dividend for 100 years and has raised it 64 years in a row. It’s a dividend aristocrat. But shares of 3M hit new 10-year lows in May 2023 as the company announced it was entering into a class resolution about forever chemicals in the water for $10.3 billion, payable over 13 years.Shares of 3M are still down 13.7% year-to-date. Over the last 10 years, they’re up just 9.3% while the S&amp;P 500 has gained 217%. But 3M is now paying a dividend of 5.9% and it’s cheap, with a forward P/E of 11.7.Is the worst news already priced into 3M?4.      The Walt Disney Company (DIS)Disney has been a favorite investment for decades by parents wanting to buy stocks for their kids. But shares of Disney recently hit 9-year lows last seen in June 2014. Disney shares are up 58% over the last 10 years through July 17, 2023, but the S&amp;P 500 is up 217% in that time.Disney isn’t cheap, despite the stock sell-off.

We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Sysco Is Sysco Fairly Valued?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.26bUS$2.44bUS$2.87bUS$3.05bUS$3.23bUS$3.37bUS$3.49bUS$3.61bUS$3.71bUS$3.81bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 4.34%Est @ 3.67%Est @ 3.20%Est @ 2.87%Est @ 2.64% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$2.1kUS$2.1kUS$2.3kUS$2.3kUS$2.3kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.0kUS$1.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$22bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.8b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.1%) = US$81bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$81b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$41bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$63b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$75.4, the company appears quite undervalued at a 39% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Sysco as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.812. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for SyscoStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Consumer Retailing market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

71,c3151611-3e69-38c3-8e6e-ad094731289d,XEL,2023-07-21,Xcel Energy (XEL) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xcel-energy-xel-reports-next-140236571.html,1689861756,STORY,['XEL'],"[Xcel Energy (XEL) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 27, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis utility is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.61 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +1.7%.Revenues are expected to be $3.45 billion, up 0.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Xcel?For Xcel, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -25.74%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Xcel will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Xcel would post earnings of $0.74 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.76, delivering a surprise of +2.70%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Xcel doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company is likely to report top and bottom-line declines when it reports the second-quarter 2023 results.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.59 per share, which suggests a decline of 26.1% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. However, the consensus mark has moved up by a penny in the past seven days. For second-quarter 2023 revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $24.9 billion, suggesting an 8.7% decline from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 22.2%. Its earnings outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 23.4%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.Archer Daniels Midland Company Price and EPS Surprise Archer Daniels Midland Company Price and EPS SurpriseArcher Daniels Midland Company price-eps-surprise | Archer Daniels Midland Company QuoteKey Factors to NoteArcher Daniels has been exposed to headwinds, including higher performance-related compensation, project-related costs and shifting costs from business segments into the centralized centers of excellence in the supply chain and operations. These are likely to have led to a continued rise in SG&amp;A expenses in the to-be-reported quarter. As a percentage of sales, we expect SG&amp;A expenses to increase 30 basis points to 3.3% in the second quarter.The company has also been reeling under the global impacts of inflation. It expects corporate costs for 2023 to be $1.5 billion, driven primarily by inflation and higher interest expenses. This is likely to get reflected in the company’s second-quarter cost performance, impacting margins.Our model predicts the cost of products sold, as a percentage of sales, to expand 100 bps year over year to 93.3% in the second quarter. Lower sales and higher cost of products sold rate are likely to result in a soft gross margin in the quarter. We estimate the gross margin to contract 100 bps to 6.7% in the to-be-reported quarter. On a dollar basis, gross profit is expected to decline 24.2% year over year in the second quarter.The overall Nutrition segment’s results in second-quarter 2023 are expected to be impacted by continued declines in Animal Nutrition performance because of weaker margins in amino acids. The decline is, however, likely to have been partially offset by Human Nutrition delivering almost flat year-over-year results on strong Flavors and SI growth.Nevertheless, Archer Daniels has been gaining from solid demand, improved productivity, product innovations and persistent growth. On its last reported quarter’s earnings call, management revealed its expectations of strong demand for vegetable oil and ethanol, driven largely by robust demand for biodiesel and renewable diesel.ADM expects resilient food demand to drive higher volumes and margins in starches, sweeteners and wheat milling. It expects positive contributions from productivity and innovation initiatives across the company, driving value throughout 2023. Gains from these efforts are also likely to have contributed to the company’s second-quarter performance.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Archer Daniels this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Archer Daniels currently has an Earnings ESP of -0.23% and a Zacks Rank #3.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat.Molson Coors TAP has an Earnings ESP of +20.90% and sports a Zacks Rank #1 at present. The company is expected to report top and bottom-line growth when it reports second-quarter 2023 results.

The company is expected to report bottom-line growth when it reports second-quarter 2023 results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BYND’s quarterly loss has narrowed by 2 cents in the past 30 days to 81 cents per share. The consensus mark suggests a narrower loss from the $1.53 reported in the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate Beyond Meat’s quarterly revenues is pegged at $111.3 million, which indicates a decline of 24.3% from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter. BYND reported a positive bottom-line surprise of 8.9% in the last reported quarter.

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.68%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.47%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 3.19%.Heading into today, shares of the maker of software used to test and develop chips had gained 7.27% over the past month, outpacing the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 3.15% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 3.58% in that time.Synopsys will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be August 16, 2023. The company is expected to report EPS of $2.73, up 30% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $1.48 billion, up 18.76% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $10.82 per share and revenue of $5.81 billion, which would represent changes of +21.57% and +14.36%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Synopsys. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently.

Carriers and a federal audit say the Federal Aviation Administration must boost air traffic control staffing.Buttigieg has opened numerous investigations and imposed fines for carrier misbehavior. President Joe Biden has often criticized airlines, saying in February ""airlines can’t treat your child like a piece of baggage.""While Buttigieg works with airlines when possible, he added: ""We're going to beat 'em up when we think that's important to get passengers a better deal.""Buttigieg said he is ""in the middle of what I intend to be the biggest expansion of passenger rights in years.

Raymond James Managing Director Savi Syth reviews the outlook for airline stocks as they face travel demand tailwinds and headwinds in the form of pricing pressures and operational issues.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: We're watching shares of airlines, American and United, on the heels of earnings. Both airlines beating the expectations from the street and also raising their guidance. But the stock's today moving in opposite directions. American Airlines under pressure, off just about 6.5%, as Wall Street had even higher expectations going into the quarter.Joining us now for more, Savi Syth, Raymond James Managing Director. Savi, it's great to speak with you. So that modest outlook from American, that's one of the big reasons why we're seeing that stock under pressure today. Was American Airlines, was that report almost a reality check here for the industry on the heels of the extremely strong results that we got from United and Delta last week?SAVI SYTH: Yeah. I think for American, the issue is, I mean, it was a really good outlook and guide. The revenue-- the top line outlook for the 3Q '23 was a little softer than what we were expecting and what the Street was expecting. And so I think that is just adding to fears of pent-up demand going away or a recession around the corner. And so it's not giving people confidence in the domestic market. And they're talking up the good guys at United and Delta to the strength in international. So I think that's what's weighing on American and the shares in part today.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And it's an interesting story, too. If you look over long-term share price action, because despite the demand that we've seen, the positive data, if you take a look at a five-year of United, Delta, and American, they're all significantly down. American is actually down more than 50%. So what do you think it will take to get investors back on board to the levels that they once were at?Story continuesSAVI SYTH: Yeah. I think partly, you know, with United and American, the one thing we have to keep in mind is there was some share dilution there. But beyond that, I think, what is important is confidence of the sustainability of the current earnings projections. And again, if there's a fear that you're heading into a recession, I think people aren't just willing to give the same multiples as they did before.And so I think we just need to show that, you know, there isn't this kind of demand or a cliff that's going to happen with especially the domestic consumer. And I think as you gain more confidence in that, I think you'll start to see the shares improving as well, because from a profitability of 2023 guide, I think they're already showing good resumption of profitability.SEANA SMITH: Savi, how much pricing power do airlines still have? Because, yes, we have seen airfares cool a bit on a year-over-year basis. But still, air travel, air tickets are much higher than they were pre-pandemic.SAVI SYTH: Look, I think, one, I think a lot of things are more expensive versus pre-pandemic. And so I think that's what you're seeing on the airline fare side, too. Even the jet fuel, it's not as high as it was last year. Last we went double, 2019. Now, you're about 20% above 2019. But you're still at prices that are above 2019.So I think part of this is just the inflation that you've seen globally. And the other part of it is you did have a lot of fleets that were retired. You had Boeing and Airbus that are having difficulty delivering new aircraft. And so there is a real supply shortfall relative to demand that has come back very strong and, you know, back to kind of trend line level. So for that reason, I think there is pricing power here. And then you have a lot of costs that are going up that will, I think, keep those fares relatively high, which is what you're seeing today.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And speaking of some of those costs, on the earnings call this morning, American did say it was committed to matching United when it comes to those pilot wages. How do you see those negotiations going? And what could that mean from a margin perspective?SAVI SYTH: Yeah. The American pilots are already getting about a 21 pay increase with this new contract. It's really making up for the fact that, you know, during-- you're supposed to have a contracts, you know, early 2020 and the pandemic got in the way. So you're making up for a few years of not getting pay increases.If they do match United, it's another 1% to 2%. So relative to what you are matching today, I don't think it's a significantly higher increase. So I think their 2023 guide isn't going to be significantly impacted by anything that they're matching with the United contract.SEANA SMITH: Savi, one of the themes that we've heard from a number of airlines this quarter and also we started to hear about it last quarter was the pent-up demand for international travel. And international really being a standout, especially in this quarter's results. Do you see that accelerating into 2024?SAVI SYTH: I think what you're seeing this year, you know, if you remember internationally the testing requirements really only came off in the June time frame. And so what you're seeing this year is last year, a lot of people were still taking domestic or near International trips, because that's where they could go easily and conveniently. And so this year, you're finally starting to see both on the leisure and business side more of those trips being taken internationally.So-- so it is a little bit pent-up, in that you're catching up for some of that. But it's also kind of diverse, you know. You're getting some of the trips that was in the domestic market shifting to international. And I think you'll see-- you know, so we start to really kind of lap that maybe late this year, because, even though kind of the things were lifted, I think you really only started to see international comeback in a big way and kind of that late-- late 2022 time frame. So I think we still have another quarter or a couple of quarters of good international momentum.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And on that international side, we're seeing extreme heat in Europe right now. Summer is usually a time where everyone wants to flock to Europe. So do you think those temperatures and what's happening overseas, could that potentially impact any earnings heading into next season?SAVI SYTH: Yeah. I mean, it's definitely-- there are a lot of things going against operating a good airline. You know, the heat being one of them. There is air traffic control issues everywhere. And in Europe, you do have a lot of industrial action as well. And so I think airlines are taking that in stride and making the adjustments, because they do want to run a good operation, because that's the worst thing that can happen from a demand perspective is if passengers don't appreciate or don't have a good experience, they're not going to continue flying.So you are seeing them, you know, tactically and strategically responding to some of these challenges. And it's not something that-- some of this will get better. ATC staffing should improve as time goes on. But some of it like weather, it's something that's here to stay. And that they'll have to continue to adapt.ALEXANDRA CANAL: I'm trying to plan a trip to Europe in the fall. So hopefully, things are good then. But Savi Syth from Raymond James, thanks so much for joining us today.]"

(LUV) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 27.Southwest Airlines has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the preceding four quarters, the average miss being 290.55%. However, the company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the remaining two quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings has been revised 8% upward over the past 90 days.Let’s see how things have shaped up for Southwest Airlines this earnings season.Q2 ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for LUV’s second-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $6.99 billion, indicating 3.87% year-over-year growth. The top line is likely to have been aided by a solid recovery in domestic and leisure air-travel demand and an improvement in passenger revenues.On the flip side, escalating fuel prices represent a concern. For second-quarter 2023, economic fuel costs per gallon are now expected to be $2.55 (prior view: $2.45 - $2.55). Our estimate is too pegged at $2.55.Apart from an increase in fuel costs, a rise in labor and airport costs is also likely to have dented bottom-line growth, resulting in a spike in operating expenses. Due to an increase in labor and airport costs, as well as lower productivity levels, LUV expects CASM, excluding fuel, oil and profit-sharing expenses and special items, to increase 5-8% in the second quarter of 2023 from the comparable period in 2022. Our estimate indicates an increase of 7.3% from second-quarter 2022 actuals.What Our Model SaysOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Southwest Airlines this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

83,c0542479-f50d-3e95-91ea-7226e5825845,LUV,2023-07-21,Southwest Airlines (LUV) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q2 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/southwest-airlines-luv-expected-beat-140229810.html,1689861749,STORY,"['LUV', 'HA']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Southwest Airlines (LUV) reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 27. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis airline is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.08 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -16.9%.Revenues are expected to be $6.99 billion, up 3.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.36% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Southwest?For Southwest, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.58%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Southwest will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Southwest would post a loss of $0.21 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.27, delivering a surprise of -28.57%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Southwest appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry, Hawaiian Holdings (HA), is soon expected to post loss of $0.55 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +38.9%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $705.02 million, up 1.9% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Hawaiian Holdings has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.73%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Hawaiian Holdings will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the top line was pegged at $8,690 million.

LHX is slated to report second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 26, after market close.   L3Harris has a four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 0.37%, on average. The strong revenue performance across most of its business segments is likely to have contributed to its overall second-quarter revenues. However, increased interest expenses might have dented the bottom line.Integrated Mission Systems to Post Dismal PerformanceLower classified and service revenues from maritime business are expected to have hurt Integrated Mission Systems (IMS) segment’s revenues in the second quarter of 2023, thereby outweighing higher sales volumes anticipated from Electro Optical and Commercial Aviation businesses.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for IMS’ second-quarter revenues is pegged at $1,630.3 million, indicating a decline of 2.6% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.L3Harris Technologies Inc Price and EPS SurpriseL3Harris Technologies Inc Price and EPS SurpriseL3Harris Technologies Inc price-eps-surprise | L3Harris Technologies Inc QuoteOther Units to Boost RevenuesHigher revenues from Space Systems and an increase in production from Mission Avionics business are likely to have added impetus to this unit’s revenues in the second quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Space and Airborne Systems’ revenues is pegged at $1,585.4 million, indicating an improvement of 5.8% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Higher revenues from Broadband Communications, principally driven by the TDL acquisition, as well as higher volume from Tactical Communications are expected to have boosted Communication Systems’ top-line performance.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this unit’s revenues is pinned at $1,129.1 million, implying growth of 13.7% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.Second-Quarter EstimatesWith the Space and Airborne Systems and the Communication Systems accounting for almost 76% of LHX’s total revenues, solid top-line performance from these segments might have outweighed the sales decline of the IMS unit. This, in turn, is likely to have boosted the company’s overall revenues in the quarter to be reported.Solid sales growth expectation must have benefited the company’s bottom line. However, inflation-induced higher input costs and inflated interest expenses caused by increased interest rates might have had an adverse impact on LHX’s bottom line.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for LHX’s second-quarter sales is pegged at $4.34 billion, indicating growth of 4.9% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The consensus estimate for second-quarter earnings is pinned at $2.91 per share, implying a year-over-year decrease of 9.9%.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for L3Harris Technologies this time around.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: The TJX Companies, Inc. TJX, Simon Property Group, Inc. SPG, MSCI Inc. MSCI, MPLX LP MPLX and Sun Life Financial Inc. SLF.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:Q2 Earnings Season Scorecard and Analyst Reports for TJX Companies, MSCI &amp; OthersThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. In today's Research Daily, we have provided the real-time scorecard on the ongoing Q2 earnings season in addition to featuring updated research reports on 16 major stocks, including The TJX Companies, Inc., Simon Property Group, Inc. and MSCI Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Q2 Earnings Season Scorecard (As of July 20th, 2023)Including all of this morning's releases, we now have Q2 results from 77 S&amp;P 500 members or 15.4% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these 77 index members are up +3.6% from the same period last year on +8.4% higher revenues, with 77.9% beating EPS estimates and 63.6% beating revenue estimates.The +3.6% year-over-year earnings growth is higher than any other period since the last quarter of 2021 for this group of 77 index members. The +8.4% revenue growth compares to +9.3% in 2023 Q1, +7.8% in 2022 Q4, +9.8% each in 2022 Q3 and Q2 and +10.2% in 2022 Q1.The 77.9% EPS beats percentage is the same as was achieved by this group of companies in the preceding period, but higher than the last three quarters of 2022 and about in-line with the 20-quarter average 77.7%.This would typically not be worth highlighting, but we think it can be interpreted to mean underlying earnings strength since Q2 estimates hadn't fallen as much as had been the case with other recent quarters.Story continuesUnlike the EPS beats percentage, the Q2 revenue beats percentage is tracking below what we have become too used to seeing in other recent periods for this group of 77 index members.Looking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actuals for this group of 77 index members with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total S&amp;P 500 earnings are expected to decline -8.9% from the same period last year on -0.5% lower revenues.Featured Analyst ReportsTJX Companies shares have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry over the past year (+36.6% vs. +4.3%). The company’s off-price business model, strategic store locations, impressive brands and fashion products and supply-chain management have been working well.The TJX Companies is benefiting from its solid store and e-commerce growth efforts. The company’s Marmaxx segment is doing particularly well, wherein comp store sales increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, backed by improved customer traffic. The company expects the pretax profit margin to increase in fiscal 2024 and also anticipates overall comp store sales growth.However, the HomeGoods (U.S.) division has been seeing soft sales. Also, TJX has been grappling with increased wage and supply-chain costs. Management expects these costs to be deterrents in fiscal 2024.Shares of Simon Property have outperformed the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry over the past year (+26.3% vs. +13.1%). The company is well-poised to benefit from its portfolio of premium assets located in some of the key markets globally. Healthy retail demand has aided leasing activity and occupancy levels.In June, Simon partnered with Razer to open five RazerStore shops at its properties as the brand continues its experiential retail expansion in 2023. This retail REIT’s efforts to support omnichannel retailing and focus on mixed-use developments are encouraging. Its strategic buyouts, redevelopment efforts and solid liquidity position bode well.However, higher e-commerce adoption and limited consumers’ willingness to spend amid persistent macroeconomic uncertainty and high interest rates are concerning. While total revenues are expected to improve 2.1% year over year for 2023, funds from operations (FFO) are projected to decline slightly.(You can read the full research report on Simon Property here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of MSCI have outperformed the Zacks Business - Software Services industry over the past year (+14.7% vs. +4.9%). The company’s prospects are benefiting from solid growth in recurring subscriptions. It is gaining strong demand for custom and factor index modules, recurring revenue business models, and the growing adoption of its ESG and Climate solutions in the investment process.MSCI’s expanding portfolio of real asset solutions is noteworthy. Acquisitions have enhanced MSCI’s ability to provide climate-risk assessment and assist investors with climate-risk disclosure requirements. MSCI’s new portfolio footprinting tool has extended climate analysis to municipal bonds and securitized products.Moreover, strong traction from client segments like wealth management, banks and hedge funds is positive.

In today's Research Daily, we have provided the real-time scorecard on the ongoing Q2 earnings season in addition to featuring updated research reports on 16 major stocks, including The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX), Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG) and MSCI Inc. (MSCI). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Q2 Earnings Season Scorecard (As of July 20th, 2023)Including all of this morning's releases, we now have Q2 results from 77 S&amp;P 500 members or 15.4% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these 77 index members are up +3.6% from the same period last year on +8.4% higher revenues, with 77.9% beating EPS estimates and 63.6% beating revenue estimates. The +3.6% year-over-year earnings growth is higher than any other period since the last quarter of 2021 for this group of 77 index members. The +8.4% revenue growth compares to +9.3% in 2023 Q1, +7.8% in 2022 Q4, +9.8% each 2022 Q3 and Q2 and +10.2% in 2022 Q1. The 77.9% EPS beats percentage is the same as was achieved by this group of companies in the preceding period, but higher than the last three quarters of 2022 and about in-line with the 20-quarter average 77.7%. This would typically not be worth highlighting, but we think it can be interpreted to mean underlying earnings strength since Q2 estimates hadn't fallen as much as had been the case with other recent quarters. Unlike the EPS beats percentage, the Q2 revenue beats percentage is tracking below what we have become to used to seeing in other recent periods for this group of 77 index members. Looking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actuals for this group of 77 index members with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total S&amp;P 500 earnings are expected to decline -8.9% from the same period last year on -0.5% lower revenues.

This move outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.68%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.47%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 3.19%.Heading into today, shares of the hospital operator had lost 0.09% over the past month, outpacing the Medical sector's loss of 0.57% and lagging the S&amp;P 500's gain of 3.58% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from HCA Healthcare as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be July 27, 2023. The company is expected to report EPS of $4.28, up 1.66% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $15.58 billion, up 5.14% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $18.10 per share and revenue of $63.41 billion, which would represent changes of +7.16% and +5.27%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for HCA Healthcare. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.03% higher within the past month. HCA Healthcare is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Investors should also note HCA Healthcare's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 15.84. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 15.34.Story continuesMeanwhile, HCA's PEG ratio is currently 1.8. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. Medical - Hospital stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 1.89 based on yesterday's closing prices.The Medical - Hospital industry is part of the Medical sector.

97,b21b00a3-3d10-3e1c-9ea5-9864d95f0800,HCA,2023-07-21,HCA Healthcare (HCA) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hca-healthcare-hca-reports-next-140239427.html,1689861759,STORY,['HCA'],"[The market expects HCA Healthcare (HCA) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 27, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis hospital operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.28 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +1.7%.Revenues are expected to be $15.58 billion, up 5.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for HCA?For HCA, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.34%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #1.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that HCA will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that HCA would post earnings of $3.99 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.93, delivering a surprise of +23.56%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.HCA doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While overall global industrial demand was lackluster, several of our technology-advantaged businesses and leading brands once again delivered strong growth. In particular, the aerospace, automotive original equipment manufacturer (OEM), automotive refinish coatings and PPG Comex businesses all achieved record sales during the quarter.We made excellent progress in restoring operating margins toward our prior historical profile, as we sharply improved year-over-year segment margins by 330 basis points. Additionally, we demonstrated one of our long-standing legacies of strong cash generation with record operating cash flow for the first half of the year, and we are targeting further working capital improvements in the second half of the year, specifically in raw materials inventory.Looking ahead, we anticipate that the global macroeconomic environment will remain generally consistent with the second quarter including continued tepid global industrial production, along with some incremental slowing in U.S. architectural residential repaint due to significantly lower existing home sales. Given the strength and momentum we have experienced year to date in several of our businesses, such as aerospace coatings and automotive OEM coatings, we expect our diverse portfolio mix to provide us with continued resiliency. On a regional basis, we anticipate modest sequential demand improvement in China and aggregate European demand to stabilize, albeit at current lower absolute levels. In addition, our supply chain and raw material availability has returned to pre-pandemic levels, and in some instances there is excess supply.Story continuesAs I mentioned at my CEO investor briefing in May, we remain highly focused on our enterprise growth strategy and partnering with our customers to deliver superior service and products with a focus on enhancing their productivity and sustainability. As a result, we expect to achieve more customer success in subsequent quarters. Lastly, PPG will mark its 140th anniversary in August, a strong testament to the dedication of PPG team members around the world who support our heritage of delivering value to our customers every day.Second Quarter 2023 Reportable Segment Financial ResultsPerformance Coatings segment$ in millions2Q 20232Q 2022Y-O-Y changeNet sales$3,041$2,929+4%Segment income$537$446+20%Segment income %17.7%15.2%Sales volumes-3%Selling prices+6%Foreign currency translation+1%Performance Coatings net sales increased led by higher selling prices in all businesses and favorable foreign currency translation that more than offset lower sales volumes.Demand for PPG’s technology-advantaged aerospace products remained robust across all product categories as the business delivered record sales aided by low-teen percentage sales volume growth year over year. PPG Comex delivered another record quarter and continues to benefit from a growing Mexican economy and its well-established brand. Organic sales in the U.S. architectural coatings business were solid in the professional paint channel, especially for non-residential activity, but offset by continuing soft do-it-yourself demand. As expected, demand for architectural coatings in Europe remained at lower levels with sales volumes down about 10% on a year-over-year basis due to reduced remodeling activity and weak regional consumer confidence. Automotive refinish coatings organic sales increased by a mid-single-digit percentage led by higher global selling prices and sales volume growth in the U.S. where demand approached pre-pandemic levels. Organic sales in the protective and marine coatings business improved by a high single-digit percentage, with solid contributions from higher selling prices and sales volumes compared to the second quarter of 2022.Segment income increased by 20% versus the prior year primarily due to higher selling prices and moderating input costs, which more than offset the impact of lower sales volumes. Segment operating margins improved by approximately 250 basis points year over year.Industrial Coatings segment$ in millions2Q 20232Q 2022Y-O-Y changeNet sales$1,831$1,762+4%Segment income$250$156+60%Segment income %13.6%8.9%Sales volumes-1%Selling prices+5%Foreign currency translation-1%Acquisitions and divestitures+1%Industrial Coatings net sales increased primarily driven by higher selling prices across all businesses, partially offset by lower sales volumes.Automotive OEM coatings organic sales were higher by a mid-teen-percentage with solid growth in all major regions from increases in both sales volumes and selling prices. While global industry growth rates have improved in the first half of 2023, they remain well below pre-pandemic levels. Industrial coatings organic sales declined a mid-single-digit percentage as solid selling price realization was more than offset by lower sales volumes due to soft global industrial production. Packaging coatings organic sales were lower by a mid-single-digit percentage as higher selling prices were more than offset by lower sales volumes due to soft demand in each major region and most product categories.Segment income was higher than the prior year by $94 million, or 60%, primarily due to higher selling prices and moderating raw material costs. Segment margins improved by 470 basis points compared to the second quarter 2022.Additional Financial InformationAt quarter end, the company had cash and short-term investments totaling nearly $1.3 billion. Net debt was $5.6 billion, which is about $500 million lower compared to the prior-year second quarter.Inventories decreased on a sequential basis but remain above targeted and historic levels.Corporate expenses were $85 million in the second quarter, which was $30 million higher than the prior year, primarily due to stock-based compensation associated with total shareholder return and other performance-based incentive compensation, along with previously noted non-cash pension expense.Acquisition-related synergies and business restructuring programs delivered about $15 million of incremental cost savings in the quarter.OutlookThe company is raising its adjusted EPS guidance for full-year 2023. The following projections take into consideration current global economic activity, soft global industrial production, continued economic uncertainty associated with the impacts of geopolitical issues in Europe and higher interest rates in most developed countries:Outlook3Q 2023FY 2023Total organic salesup low single digit % YOYAdjusted EPS$1.85 – $1.95 per share$7.28 - $7.48 per shareThe effective tax rate for third quarter 2023 is expected to be between 23% and 24%, higher than third quarter 2022 primarily due to nonrecurring discrete tax items in the prior year. This higher effective tax rate is expected to have an unfavorable year-over-year impact on adjusted third quarter 2023 EPS of approximately $0.07 to $0.09.The quarterly and full year adjusted EPS figures exclude amortization expense, previously approved and communicated business restructuring, a non-cash pension settlement charge, transaction-related costs and the benefit from an insurance recovery in the first quarter 2023. Additional information related to 2023 financial projections may be found in the detailed commentary and associated presentation slides related to the second quarter financial information which are posted on the company’s investor relations website.The term organic sales as used in this press release is defined as net sales excluding the impact of currency, acquisitions, divestitures and the wind down of Russia operations.PPG: WE PROTECT AND BEAUTIFY THE WORLD®At PPG (NYSE:PPG), we work every day to develop and deliver the paints, coatings and specialty materials that our customers have trusted for 140 years.

These matters within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, involve risks and uncertainties that may affect PPG’s operations, as discussed in the company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Sections 13(a), 13(c) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Accordingly, many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained herein. Such factors include statements related to the expected effects on our business of COVID-19, global economic conditions, geopolitical issues in Europe, the amount of future share repurchases, increasing price and product competition by our competitors, fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials, energy, labor and logistics, the ability to achieve selling price increases, the ability to recover margins, customer inventory levels, PPG inventory levels, the ability to maintain favorable supplier relationships and arrangements, the timing of realization of anticipated cost savings from restructuring and other initiatives, the ability to identify additional cost savings opportunities, the timing and expected benefits of potential future and completed acquisitions, difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving expected synergies therefrom, economic and political conditions in international markets, the ability to penetrate existing, developing and emerging foreign and domestic markets, foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in such rates, fluctuations in tax rates, the impact of future legislation, the impact of environmental regulations, unexpected business disruptions, the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation, including asbestos litigation, and governmental investigations. However, it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, while the list of factors presented here and in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements. Consequences of material differences in results compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, lower sales or earnings, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on PPG’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.All information in this release speaks only as of July 20, 2023, and any distribution of this release after that date is not intended and will not be construed as updating or confirming such information. PPG undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, except as otherwise required by applicable law.Regulation G ReconciliationPPG believes investors’ understanding of the company’s performance is enhanced by the disclosure of net income, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations and PPG’s effective tax rate adjusted for certain items. PPG’s management considers this information useful in providing insight into the company’s ongoing performance because it excludes the impact of items that cannot reasonably be expected to recur on a quarterly basis or that are not attributable to our primary operations. Net income, earnings per diluted share from continuing operations and the effective tax rate adjusted for these items are not recognized financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""U.S. GAAP"") and should not be considered a substitute for net income, earnings per diluted share, the effective tax rate or other financial measures as computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per diluted share and the adjusted effective tax rate may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as reported by other companies. PPG is not able to provide a reconciliation of third quarter and full-year 2023 expected adjusted earnings per diluted share to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure without unreasonable effort because certain items that impact such measure are uncertain or cannot be reasonably predicted at this time.Regulation G Reconciliation - Net Income and Earnings per Diluted Share($ in millions, except per-share amounts)Second Quarter2023Second Quarter2022$EPS(a)$EPS(a)Reported net income from continuing operations$490$2.06$443$1.86Acquisition-related amortization expense300.13320.13Business restructuring-related costs, net(b)110.0560.03Transaction-related costs(c)30.0190.04Impairment and other related (income)/charges, net(d)——(60)(0.25)Adjusted net income from continuing operations, excluding certain items$534$2.25$430$1.81Second Quarter2023Second Quarter2022Income Before Income TaxesIncome Tax ExpenseEffective Tax RateIncome Before Income TaxesIncome Tax ExpenseEffective Tax RateEffective tax rate, continuing operations$646$14923.1%$566$11820.8%Acquisition-related amortization expense401024.6%421024.6%Business restructuring-related costs, net(b)14324.0%8225.7%Transaction-related costs(c)7224.3%6(3)(50.0)%Impairment and other related (income)/charges, net(d)———%(60)——%Adjusted effective tax rate, continuing operations, excluding certain items$707$16423.2%$562$12722.6%(a)Earnings per diluted share is calculated based on unrounded numbers.

The program has the potential to reach more than 150,000 students, according to The BMJ, citing Mattel.The program aims to teach social skills like empathy, problem-solving, compromising, and conflict resolution, according to a February article in an industry publication.One teacher at Lord Blyton Primary School in English county Tyne and Wear—one site where the program is used—told BMJ that the materials were welcome “given the current lack of funding in schools.”“We are in a relatively socially deprived area, and many of our children don’t get the opportunity to engage in speaking and listening activities about subjects such as these,” she told the publication.The school's website features a blog entry on the program that shows materials Mattel sent, including multiple dolls in wheelchairs, and dolls with a variety of skin tones and hair textures.But experts warn of possible negative side effects of the program, like gender stereotyping, and say that company-funded research used to justify the ""Barbie School of Friendship"" over-sells it to educators and parents alike.“Commercial entities like Mattel are not experts in children’s health or education,” Mark Pettricrew, public health evaluation professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told BMJ. He called the program “alarming.”“The Mattel materials are heavily branded—why should children be exposed to this type of stealth marketing?”Story continuesResearch promoting the program, funded by Mattel and completed at Cardiff University in Wales, found higher brain activity in children who played with Barbie and other Mattel dolls than those who played games on tablets or computers.But that benefit only occurred when children were playing alone, Franziska Krob, a psychologist at Dresden University of Technology in Germany, told the publication—and it disappeared when adults entered the mix.While the program may be based on the research, the curriculum itself is not, Sarah Gerson, a senior lecturer at Cardiff University and a senior author on both Mattel-sponsored studies, told BMJ. She said that there was “moral ambiguity” about the program.“It’s a tricky one, for sure,” she told the publication.In response to program criticism, a Mattel spokesperson reportedly sent the publication anonymous testimonials from teachers praising student engagement the program created, as well as the diversity of body types, skin tones, and disabilities represented by the dolls.The underfunding of education means schools must look to commercial companies to supplement lesson planning. The company may expand the program to other markets, the spokesperson added.Fortune reached out to the company for a response, and had not received a response as of press time.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com]"

North America revenue also grew sequentially benefiting from our agility across the most resilient basins and market segments, although the rig count in the area declined. As the upcycle continues to unfold, we are excited about the opportunities for our business, with international- and offshore-led growth fueling strong pretax segment operating margin expansion and cash flows as highlighted in this quarter’s results. We are very well positioned in these markets, as international represents nearly 80% of our global revenue, and offshore constitutes approximately half of that. Both sequentially and year on year, we saw broad international revenue growth that resulted in margins expanding across all Divisions and geographical areas.Story continues""Our focus on the quality of our revenue continues to drive margins, and during the second quarter, we received numerous multiyear contract awards. This is bolstering our outlook for long-term growth that will outlast near-term commodity price volatility, and it is reinforcing our belief in the breadth, resilience, and durability of the upcycle.""Compared to the same period a year ago, international revenue grew 21%, outpacing North America which increased 14%. Year on year, revenue grew 20% and pretax segment operating margin expanded 240 basis points (bps), representing the tenth straight quarter that we have increased our pretax segment operating margin year on year. This was driven by the international markets, where we posted our highest year-on-year incremental margin in the last three years, demonstrating the earnings power of our operations in these markets.""Middle East &amp; Asia and Offshore Drove Strong Sequential Performance""Sequentially, our revenue grew 5%—more than $350 million—driven largely by the Middle East &amp; Asia area which increased 10%, or $249 million. This increase was propelled by strong double-digit growth in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Egypt, India, and China. Similarly, our offshore businesses in the US Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, Angola, Namibia, and the Caspian Sea posted double-digit growth sequentially.""Overall, our second-quarter pretax segment operating margin expanded 154 bps sequentially. Margin expansion was driven by operating leverage, increased technology adoption, and pricing that stemmed from contracts being adjusted for inflation and tight service capacity in key markets.""Second-quarter cash flow from operations vastly improved to $1.61 billion—$1.28 billion higher sequentially—and free cash flow was $986 million. Contributing to this very strong cash flow performance were higher earnings, robust receivable collections, improved inventory turnover, and continued capex discipline. We expect free cash flow generation in the second half of the year to be visibly higher than the first half, firmly positioning us to outperform last year’s free cash flow.""I am very proud of the exceptional results delivered by the SLB team.""Confidence in the Long-Term Outlook""We continue to see positive upstream investment momentum in the international and offshore markets. These markets are being driven by resilient long-cycle offshore developments, production capacity expansions, the return of global exploration and appraisal, and the recognition of gas as a critical fuel source for energy security and the energy transition.""This is resulting in a significant baseload of activity as you can see from the number of contract awards in our quarterly highlights. The nature of these awards displays the duration and magnitude of this upcycle, both on land and offshore. We remain proud to be the partner of choice for our customers.""As international spending builds further momentum in the second half of 2023 and North America moderates as anticipated, this cycle continues to align closely with SLB’s strengths, affirming our confidence in our full-year financial ambitions.""This is a compelling environment for our industry, and SLB is a disciplined and efficient company that is moving in sync with our customers and our shareholders. We believe we are well positioned to execute our returns-focused strategy and commitment to shareholder returns.""Other EventsDuring the quarter, SLB repurchased approximately 4.5 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $47.33 per share for a total purchase price of $213 million.Also during the quarter, SLB issued $500 million of 4.500% Senior Notes due 2028 and $500 million of 4.850% Senior Notes due 2033.On July 20, 2023, SLB’s Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share of outstanding common stock, payable on October 12, 2023, to stockholders of record on September 6, 2023.Second-Quarter Revenue by Geographical Area(Stated in millions)Three Months EndedChangeJun. 30,2023Mar. 31,2023Jun. 30,2022SequentialYear-on-yearNorth America$1,746$1,698$1,5373%14%Latin America1,6241,6171,329-22%Europe &amp; Africa*2,0311,9741,6913%20%Middle East &amp; Asia2,6422,3942,16810%22%Eliminations &amp; other565348n/mn/m$8,099$7,736$6,7735%20%  International$6,297$5,985$5,1885%21%North America$1,746$1,698$1,5373%14%  *Includes Russia and the Caspian regionn/m = not meaningfulInternationalRevenue in Latin America of $1.62 billion was essentially flat sequentially as higher drilling activity offshore Brazil, increased stimulation activity in Argentina, higher sales of midstream production systems offshore Guyana, and increased Asset Performance Solutions (APS) revenue in Ecuador were offset by lower revenue in Mexico. Year on year, revenue grew 22% led by higher drilling activity in Mexico and Brazil, increased sales of production systems in Guyana, and increased intervention and stimulation activity in Argentina.Europe &amp; Africa revenue of $2.03 billion grew 3% sequentially due to higher offshore activity in Angola and Namibia, increased drilling in Scandinavia, and higher sales of subsea production systems in the Caspian Sea. These increases were partially offset by the non-repeat of last quarter’s significant midstream production systems project milestones. Year on year, revenue grew 20% resulting from increased exploration, drilling, and production activity offshore Africa and higher drilling in Scandinavia and Europe.Revenue in the Middle East &amp; Asia of $2.64 billion increased 10% sequentially driven by double-digit revenue growth in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, China, and India. This was a result of higher drilling, intervention, stimulation, and evaluation activity, both on land and offshore. Year on year, revenue grew 22% with double-digit growth across Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Egypt, Oman, Iraq, India, East Asia, and Australia.North AmericaNorth America revenue of $1.75 billion grew 3% sequentially–despite the decrease in rig count–benefiting from our agility across the most resilient land basins and market segments. In addition, our strong offshore position in the US Gulf of Mexico contributed to our revenue growth as activity increased sequentially. US land revenue grew sequentially, outperforming the rig count decline, while offshore experienced double-digit growth, boosted by increased sales of completions and subsea production systems as well as higher drilling and evaluation activity. In contrast, Canada land revenue decreased due to the spring breakup. Year on year, North America revenue grew 14% due to strong land and offshore drilling and higher sales of production systems, although this was partially offset by lower APS project revenue in Canada due to lower commodity prices.Second-Quarter Results by DivisionDigital &amp; Integration(Stated in millions)Three Months EndedChangeJun. 30,2023Mar. 31,2023Jun. 30,2022SequentialYear-on-yearRevenueInternational$712$642$62711%14%North America234251327-7%-29%Other111n/mn/m$947$894$9556%-1% Pretax operating income$322$265$37922%-15%Pretax operating margin34.0%29.6%39.7%438 bps-572 bps n/m = not meaningfulDigital &amp; Integration revenue of $947 million increased 6% sequentially due to strong growth in digital sales internationally.

Notable highlights include the following:In Mexico, through its reference agreement process, our main customer in Mexico awarded SLB contracts with a total value of approximately $1 billion over the next two years for land and shallow-water exploration and development. SLB will provide drilling technology and completion solutions to execute both conventional and highly complex wells, including high-pressure and high-temperature work.In Saudi Arabia, SLB received a contract award from Saudi Aramco for directional drilling services for the world’s largest oil and gas fields. On both land and offshore, SLB will deliver directional drilling and digital drilling solutions and logging-while-drilling services. These proven technologies will provide technical solutions for drilling challenging wells.In Qatar, Qatargas awarded SLB a five-year exclusive contract with an optional five-year extension for the provision of unitized Cameron wellhead and tree systems. The equipment will be installed in 50 offshore and five onshore wells in the North Field South project and will incorporate MRD™ recessed-bore metal-to-metal seals and CANH™ rough casing metal-to-metal seals. The onshore portion of the project includes CO2 injection and wastewater wells. The first delivery of the equipment is expected in the third quarter of 2023.In Brazil, Petrobras awarded a contract to OneSubsea™ to supply critical subsea equipment to assist in the development of the Búzios pre-salt field in the country’s prolific Santos Basin. It was the sixth consecutive contract covering the supply of subsea trees signed between the two parties. SLB will supply 15 subsea trees and electrohydraulic distribution units to serve the Búzios-11 project, set to enter production in 2027 via the P-83 floating production, storage, and offloading vessel. The contract work scope also includes installation, commissioning, and associated maintenance services.Offshore Egypt, bp and its joint venture partner Wintershall Dea have awarded Subsea Integration Alliance an engineering, procurement, construction, and installation (EPCI) contract for the Raven infill project. The project represents the alliance’s second early-integration contract with bp. The contract scope is for a two-well tieback in the West Nile Delta development in water depths of approximately 800 meters. The subsea production systems (SPS) scope will be delivered by OneSubsea and includes project execution comprising subsea controls, connectors, wet parking structures, instrumentation and control installation and commissioning support, and life-of-field support. The subsea umbilicals, risers, and flowlines (SURF) scope will be delivered by Subsea7 and includes the engineering, procurement, transport, and installation of approximately 6 kilometers of flexible pipes, umbilicals, and associated subsea structures.In the UK North Sea, bp awarded OneSubsea a contract for the supply of subsea dual-bore trees, as part of its ongoing infill drilling program in the Schiehallion/Loyal fields west of Shetland.In Turkey, Turkish Petroleum awarded SLB an EPCI contract for Phase 2 of the Sakarya field development, offshore Turkey in the Black Sea. The contract for the two-phase subsea development is awarded to a consortium including SLB, Subsea7, and Saipem. The integrated project scope will be delivered by Subsea Integration Alliance and covers SPS and SURF. OneSubsea will deliver the EPCI of the SPS, which includes subsea tree systems, manifold structures, topsides and distribution controls, tie-in connectors, and valves.Technology and PerformanceNotable technology introductions and deployment in the quarter include the following:In Mauritania, the XR-Perf™ expanded-range wireline perforating system restored production in a deepwater well operated by bp by enabling the perforation of more than 300 meters in eight runs without incident or nonproductive time. The operation saved bp more than 100 hours of rig time compared with traditional wireline methods, resulting in significant cost savings and a reduced carbon footprint. This was the first deployment of the XR-Perf system for bp in Africa.In Libya, SLB executed the first treatments utilizing the OneSTEP EF™ efficient, low-risk sandstone stimulation solution for Waha Oil Company to improve the well influx from a fractured reservoir, mitigate the increasing water production in the field, and reduce the risk of damage from precipitation. A high-rate matrix stimulation was performed on two wells using the OneSTEP EF solution and the OilMAX™ matrix acidizing diverter. The OilMAX fluid, composed of a new-generation viscous relative permeability modifier, was used to increase zonal coverage and reduce the water production after treatment. Kinetix Matrix™ matrix stimulation design software was used to model the fluid placement for the stimulation job. The successful treatment revived wells that had been shut-in for up to 20 years and increased the total production rate by 140% while reducing water cut to 0.4%. The novel fluid system improved well influx helping Waha Oil Company achieve its production goals.Offshore Malaysia, the integrated solution of Gyrodata Quest™ gyro-while-drilling (GWD) system together with PowerDrive X6™ rotary steerable system delivered the longest extended-reach-drilling well in the country, the first integrated deployment since SLB’s acquisition of Gyrodata Incorporated. High-accuracy real-time definitive gyroscopic surveys and precise steering maximized reservoir exposure and recovery potential. The Quest GWD system’s extended battery life allowed for 322 hours of surveying in the 12 1/4-inch section and 294 hours in the 8 1/2-inch section with no battery trip required. The Quest GWD system also saved rig time compared to a conventional GWD tool by reducing the survey time by 75%.DIGITALSLB is deploying digital technology at scale, enabling customers to track and access their data, leverage insights to elevate their performance, and embrace new AI-enabled autonomous operations. Notable highlights include the following:In Brazil, SLB was awarded a five-year contract by Petrobras for an enterprise-wide deployment of its Delfi™ digital platform. The contract scope facilitates Petrobras’ digital transformation from exploration, development, and production operations, including moving subsurface workflows to the cloud to significantly accelerate decision making.

Management believes that Net Debt provides useful information regarding the level of SLB’s indebtedness by reflecting cash and investments that could be used to repay debt. Net Debt is a non-GAAP financial measure that should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, total debt.(2)See section entitled ""Charges &amp; Credits"" for details.(3)Includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets, exploration data costs, and APS investments.(4)""Free cash flow"" represents cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, APS investments, and exploration data costs capitalized. Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity measure for the company and that it is useful to investors and management as a measure of SLB’s ability to generate cash. Once business needs and obligations are met, this cash can be used to reinvest in the company for future growth or to return to shareholders through dividend payments or share repurchases. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, cash flow from operations.Charges &amp; CreditsIn addition to financial results determined in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this second-quarter 2023 earnings release also includes non-GAAP financial measures (as defined under the SEC’s Regulation G). In addition to the non-GAAP financial measures discussed under ""Liquidity"", SLB net income, excluding charges &amp; credits, as well as measures derived from it (including diluted EPS, excluding charges &amp; credits; effective tax rate, excluding charges &amp; credits; adjusted EBITDA; and adjusted EBITDA margin) are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that the exclusion of charges &amp; credits from these financial measures enables it to evaluate more effectively SLB’s operations period over period and to identify operating trends that could otherwise be masked by the excluded items. These measures are also used by management as performance measures in determining certain incentive compensation.

122,69ee41f5-6779-35d2-b7b8-d8c813e35488,AIG,2023-07-21,Why American International Group (AIG) is a Great Dividend Stock Right Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-american-international-group-aig-154504068.html,1689867904,STORY,['AIG'],"[Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.American International Group in FocusBased in New York, American International Group (AIG) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of -6.51%. The insurer is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.36 per share, with a dividend yield of 2.44%. This compares to the Insurance - Multi line industry's yield of 2.3% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.61%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.44 is up 12.5% from last year. Over the last 5 years, American International Group has increased its dividend 1 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 0.68%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. American International Group's current payout ratio is 26%. This means it paid out 26% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.AIG is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $6.41 per share, with earnings expected to increase 40.88% from the year ago period.Story continuesBottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.For instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, AIG is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 2.51 points, or less than 0.1%, to 35,227.69, its 10th gain in a row. The Nasdaq composite slipped 30.50, or 0.2%, to 14,032.81 a day after tumbling to its worst loss in more than four months.Roper Technologies rallied 3.7% for one of the larger gains in the S&amp;P 500 after it reported better profit and revenue for the spring than analysts expected. The company, which looks to dominate niche tech markets, also raised its financial forecasts for the full year.The earnings reporting season is gaining momentum, and a majority of companies are reporting better results than expected. They're doing so by a bit less than usual, though, according to FactSet.On the losing side of Wall Street was American Express, which fell 3.9%. It reported stronger profit for the spring than expected, but its revenue fell short of forecasts.Comerica swung from an initial gain to a loss of 4.1% after reporting stronger profit and revenue for the spring than analysts expected. The regional bank also reported a decline in average customer deposits, though it said the levels stabilized in the second half of the quarter. Deposits have been under heavy scrutiny since several banks failed in March after customers suddenly yanked out their cash.The stock market has generally been on a tear this year as the economy has defied predictions for a recession. It's so far powered through much higher interest rates meant to bring down inflation, and the hope is that it may outlast the Federal Reserve's rate-hike campaign.The Fed is widely expected to raise its federal funds rate on Wednesday to its highest level since 2001. But the hope is that will be the final increase of the cycle because inflation has been cooling since last summer. The federal funds rate started last year at virtually zero.Story continuesTo be sure, the 18.1% jump for the S&amp;P 500 this year also has critics saying the rally has come too far, too fast. The risk of recession remains because inflation and interest rates remain high.When Fed Chair Jerome Powell speaks on Wednesday after the central bank's decision on rates, economists at Deutsche Bank say he “is likely to emphasize that further evidence is needed to have confidence inflation will be tamed.”Besides the Fed meeting, next week will also feature earnings reports from three of the “Magnificent Seven” companies behind the majority of the S&amp;P 500's gains this year. Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Microsoft will report their earnings, and expectations are high after they all soared more than 35% so far this year.Another one of the seven, Tesla, slumped sharply on Thursday despite reporting stronger profit and revenue than expected on fears about upcoming growth. It helped drag the S&amp;P 500 to a loss and the Nasdaq composite to a drop of 2.1%.The top stocks have become so big and their movements have become so influential over the market that Nasdaq is rebalancing its Nasdaq 100 index before trading begins Monday, to lessen the impact some stocks have on the overall index.The seven stocks, which also include Amazon, Apple and Nvidia, are collectively trading with stock prices that are 44 times higher than their earnings per share over the last 12 months, according to Savita Subramanian, equity strategist at Bank of America.That's an expensive level compared with history, but the other stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are trading at a more reasonable-looking 17 times earnings. The stock market's gains have broadened out a bit recently, and Subramanian said in a BofA Global Research report that she expects that to continue.In the bond market, Treasury yields were mixed.The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 3.83% from 3.86% late Thursday. It helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans.The two-year Treasury yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, ticked up to 4.85% from 4.84%.In markets abroad, stocks were mixed across Europe and Asia.Taiwan's Taiex fell 0.8% after TSMC, the world's biggest manufacturer of computer chips, said it expects its sales to fall 10% this year as demand wanes.

Never be left in the dust again.TeslaTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) late Wednesday reported earnings of $0.91 per share - surpassing the $0.79 Wall Street consensus - on better-than-expected revenue of $24.93, and margins were also less bad than feared.Still, shares sank 9.7% in Thursday trading.Excluding regulatory credits, gross margins - which have been closely watched following recent price cuts on Tesla's electric vehicles - fell 6.8% to 18.2% in Q2 from the prior year, better than analysts' estimates of 16.9%.The price cuts helped the EV giant boost its installed base and rake in new customers, with vehicle deliveries surging 86% to 466,140 EVs in Q2, marking a record quarter for the company.Wedbush called the move a ""smart strategy,"" saying after the report that the price cuts ""have been in a homerun success in China, Europe, and the US… In a nutshell, we view Tesla where Apple was in the 2008/2009 period as Cupertino was just starting to monetize its services and golden ecosystem with the Street not seeing the broader golden vision at the time.""Needham and Company reiterated its Hold rating due to valuation, adding that it leans ""more bullish when thinking about TSLA's positioning vs legacy [original equipment manufacturer] peers.""Goldman Sachs said the report was ""solid"" but that headwinds remain, reiterating its Neutral rating on the stock. Bofa also reiterated Neutral given risks from price cuts, increasing competition, and near-term macro considerations - while also noting the positive factors of cost reduction and ""its ability to remain agile.""Wells Fargo, meanwhile, said Tesla delivered ""a low quality"" EPS beat ""driven mostly by other income.""Story continuesNetflixNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) dropped 8.4% on Thursday, following mixed Q2 earnings: While EPS of $3.29 came in better than the consensus of $2.84, revenue of $8.19 billion missed the consensus estimate of $8.27B.The company added 5.9 million paid net subscribers in Q2 as it successfully rolled out paid sharing to more than 100 countries, representing over 80% of its total revenue. Buyside expectations were around 4M net subscriber additions.Evercore ISI lifted the price target to $550 after ""a mother of a quarter"" and removed its Tactical Underperform rating on the stock. The firm blamed the move lower in shares on expectations correction, and not a fundamental correction, and ""would encourage investors to buy NFLX shares on this (small) pullback.""BofA, meanwhile, bumped the price target by $35 to $525 per share on Buy-rated NFLX shares. The analysts said the results were ""healthy,"" adding:Within the Media ecosystem, we believe NFLX’s depth/breadth of content positions them well to withstand the production reductions.IBMInternational Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) shares rose more than 2% after better-than-expected Q2 earnings of $2.18 a share on below-par sales of $15.58B.IBM said it continues to expect full-year 2023 constant currency revenue growth of 3% to 5%. At current foreign exchange rates, currency is expected to be neutral to revenue growth.UBS reiterated a Sell rating and a $110 per share price target on IBM stock, as the analysts believe the reiterated guidance bears a risk: They say they expect revenue to come in at the low end of the full-year 2023 ""implied"" guidance.BofA, however, kept its Buy rating on the stock and raised the price target by $8 to $160 per share, saying, ""We believe the turnaround at IBM ([revenue] growth and [free cash flow] improvement) will continue. The company has a defensive portfolio, attractive dividend yield and an underappreciated AI portfolio.""Goldman SachsGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on Wednesday said earnings per share plunged 60% to $3.08 in Q2, missing estimates, on lower revenue of $10.89B that squeaked past consensus.Still, shares ticked up by 1% in Wednesday trading.The results were attributed to one-off charges related to the banking giant's home improvement lending group GreenSky and losses on its consumer and real estate loan portfolios. Company top brass had already previously warned that this would be a challenging quarter.Investment banking fees also dropped by 20% to $1.43B, which trading revenue from fixed income, currency, and commodities slipped by more than a fourth.Like some of its banking rivals, Goldman's investment and trading business has suffered from a slowdown in dealmaking followed by a string of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes that have put pressure on the U.S. economy.Yasin Ebrahim, Liz Moyer, Senad Karaahmetovic, and Davit Kirakosyan contributed to this report.__Related Articles4 big earnings hits: Tesla beats but shares sink; Netflix takes a slideAnalysis-Novatek set to oust Gazprom as Russia's top gas supplier to EuropeEuropean Union agrees post-Brexit rules for hedge funds]"

But amid a falling stock price, how else could streamers like Netflix start to feel the pain from the writers and actors' strikes? Moody's Investors Service SVP Neil Begley gives his outlook on the ways streaming services could suffer more in the long term than traditional media counterparts.Video TranscriptTED SARANDOS: So you should know that nobody here, nobody within the AMPTP, and I'm sure nobody at SAG, or nobody at the WGA took any of this lightly. But we've got a lot of work to do. There are a handful of complicated issues. We're super committed to getting to an agreement as soon as possible. One that's equitable. And one that enables the industry and everybody in it to move forward into the future.ALEXANDRA CANAL: That was Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos, highlighting the streaming giant's commitment to reaching an agreement on new labor deals. Shares of the company under pressure, closing down more than 8% today after guidance for next quarter came in below analyst estimates. But according to our next guest, Netflix is one of the least at-risk companies in the wake of the strikes.Joining us now is Neil Begley, Moody's Investors Service Senior Vice President. And Neil, you know, we did see Netflix boost its free cash flow guidance, saying it now expects $5 billion instead of the prior $3.5 billion, citing the strike specifically. You also credited Netflix's wide range of content, their international exposure. But at what point does this strike start to hurt Netflix from a term perspective and even ad revenue perspective?NEIL BEGLEY: Well, Netflix is no different from any of the other players in the streaming business or frankly, in the linear business. So for all of them, they've stockpiled content. And when that content runs out, that's when it starts to hurt. They'll smooth out their distribution of the new content for as long as possible. They've stockpiled a lot of new original shows. And they've got lots of library content. But once subscribers start to notice that the originals are not to be found, they'll start-- they'll start acting with their feet.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: Neil, you've been covering this industry for quite some time. From your perspective, the demands that the actors and the writers are making versus what we're hearing from the studios, do you think it's likely that this is going to be a lengthy holdout?NEIL BEGLEY: I think so. I think it's basically a perfect storm, because you've got a period of time when you've got the linear business in decline and putting pressure on a lot of the traditional media companies. At the same time, they're launching streaming platforms that have experienced nothing but losses now for the most part for, you know, two, three, four years. A lot of them are starting to see the light with regard to potentially breakeven. Some have passed the point of the worst of it, where they're had peak losses. And some are just at that point right now.So that means these companies are under a lot of stress. And at the same time, on the labor side, these people who are essentially fighting for their lives essentially, their livelihoods, have experienced a time of transition as well. And a lot of the way they get paid is based upon the old guard, where a lot of product is then sold to third parties. And when it's sold to third parties, you can measure the value. When you're putting it on your own platform, it's harder to measure that value and get paid.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And you said that the DGA contract, which was ratified and signed, coupled with potential new WGA and side contracts, that will cost media firms $450 million to $600 million more per year. How do you see those extra costs impacting these companies and their credit ratings?NEIL BEGLEY: So that's on a static assessment of what they produce. If they decide to produce less, obviously, they'll spend less. They also will look to cut costs in other ways, whether they essentially reduce post-production, whether they reduce special effects. They have fewer stars in their programming. Or frankly, they try to pass along those costs to whoever they sell that content to or to consumers.SEANA SMITH: Neil, who's hit the hardest? So Netflix is best positioned, although, obviously, not in a great position, given everything that's going on. Who's going to feel it the-- I guess, fastest? And how big of a hit are they going to take?NEIL BEGLEY: Well, everybody's going to-- everybody's going to feel it if this is a long strike. However, in the interim, there's actually more money to be made by many of the media companies, because they're spending less on production for a while. Just like we saw initially in COVID. And frankly, with Netflix as well, they generated free cash flow before anyone thought they would, because they weren't producing any new content.However, once that content evaporates, the cinemas, for example, I mean, they rely on new content only. They have to put people in seats. They have to sell popcorn. And when the new content evaporates. And there's a lull in the new original films coming out, they're going to feel it the Worst, Not only because of that, but because their models are not very well diversified and also because their balance sheets are weak.SEANA SMITH: When would we see that low?NEIL BEGLEY: I would think that would be sometime in 2024. I believe most of the films that are in the can for a while with the plan that this strike could last throughout the rest of the year are fine.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah. Because I was going to ask about that, because movies tend to have a way longer lead time than, say, some of the cable shows that are on. Some of those more diversified linear networks, like Comcast, for example, right?NEIL BEGLEY: Yep. So Comcast is very diversified. So if you've got a very diversified business, they make a lot of money in broadband, for example, that generates essentially 70% of their revenues. They're not as reliant upon their media businesses as many other companies are.]"

Breaking Down the Fed’s ViewsThe shares tumbled 8.4% to $437.42 in New York Thursday, the most since Dec. 15. The stock had risen 62% this year through Wednesday on optimism surrounding the company’s new initiatives.While Netflix grew its subscriber base by 8% in the second water, sales rose just 2.7% to $8.19 billion, coming in slightly below analysts’ projections. That was due in part to foreign exchange rates and to price cuts in some markets. Netflix also generated less revenue per customer in the most recent quarter. The company expects sales of $8.52 billion in the third quarter, compared with the $8.67 billion average of Wall Street estimates.The results were fine “but not enough to move the stock higher given the move in past three months,” LightShed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield said after the results were announced.Netflix executives called for patience on a call with Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich. It will take several quarters to realize the financial benefits of paid sharing, co-Chief Executive Officer Greg Peters said Wednesday.“While we’ve made steady progress this year, we have more work to do to reaccelerate our growth,” the company wrote in a letter to shareholders.The shortfall overshadowed a solid quarter by most other metrics. Netflix added 5.89 million customers in the second period, more than doubling Wall Street estimates, and finished the quarter with 238.4 million members.Story continuesThe results marked the company’s best second quarter since the depths of the pandemic three years ago and far surpassed Wall Street forecasts of 2.07 million new subscribers. Management expects similar growth this period.The company credited much of the boom to its crackdown on password sharing. In May, the streaming leader started charging people in more than 100 countries to continue sharing their passwords, a key part of its plan to accelerate growth after a sluggish 2022. Viewers using someone else’s subscription can now either pay to keep sharing or set up their own account.The plan has been controversial with users, and analysts were divided about how it would impact growth. Netflix lost customers in the first half of 2022, prompting a steep drop in the shares and leading to a selloff in other media stocks.While the company initially warned it would see an uptick in cancellations at the start of the crackdown, new sign-ups are already exceeding cancellations. Netflix said that sales will accelerate in the months ahead, with third-quarter growth projected at 7.5%.Earlier Wednesday, Netflix also eliminated the lowest-priced ad-free plan, pushing consumers toward a lower-priced, ad-backed service or a costlier commercial-free plan.While analysts have raised concerns about losses from streaming at many of Netflix’s competitors, including Walt Disney Co. and Warner Bros. Discovery Inc., Netflix is delivering higher profit. Second-quarter earnings of $3.29 a share beat the $2.85 a share average analyst estimate, according to a Bloomberg survey.Netflix raised its 2023 forecast for free cash flow to $5 billion, from at least $3.5 billion previously, as a result of a strike by writers and actors, which has shuttered production and cut spending. However, free cash flow will take a hit next year when productions get back up and running. Co-CEO Ted Sarandos declined to address how the strike would impact the company’s output of new programming.--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.(Updates with closing stock price.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Stainless-Steel Boom Is Tearing a South African Mining Region ApartNo Testing, No Inspections: Contaminated Eyedrops Blinded and Killed AmericansWeightWatchers Is Gambling Everything on Obesity DrugsThis Supposed Mafia Manifesto Doesn’t Stand Up to a Google SearchAmazon’s Injury-Plagued Warehouse Operation Goes on Trial©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

(NYSE:TJX) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for TJX Companies Is TJX Companies Fairly Valued?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.50bUS$3.83bUS$4.36bUS$4.36bUS$5.38bUS$5.80bUS$6.16bUS$6.47bUS$6.73bUS$6.97bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x7Analyst x5Analyst x3Analyst x3Est @ 7.91%Est @ 6.17%Est @ 4.95%Est @ 4.10%Est @ 3.50% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.4% US$3.2kUS$3.3kUS$3.4kUS$3.2kUS$3.6kUS$3.6kUS$3.5kUS$3.4kUS$3.3kUS$3.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$34bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$7.0b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.4%– 2.1%) = US$113bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$113b÷ ( 1 + 8.4%)10= US$51bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$84b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$85.4, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at TJX Companies as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.056. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for TJX CompaniesStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Specialty Retail market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

In today's Research Daily, we have provided the real-time scorecard on the ongoing Q2 earnings season in addition to featuring updated research reports on 16 major stocks, including The TJX Companies, Inc., Simon Property Group, Inc. and MSCI Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Q2 Earnings Season Scorecard (As of July 20th, 2023)Including all of this morning's releases, we now have Q2 results from 77 S&amp;P 500 members or 15.4% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these 77 index members are up +3.6% from the same period last year on +8.4% higher revenues, with 77.9% beating EPS estimates and 63.6% beating revenue estimates.The +3.6% year-over-year earnings growth is higher than any other period since the last quarter of 2021 for this group of 77 index members. The +8.4% revenue growth compares to +9.3% in 2023 Q1, +7.8% in 2022 Q4, +9.8% each in 2022 Q3 and Q2 and +10.2% in 2022 Q1.The 77.9% EPS beats percentage is the same as was achieved by this group of companies in the preceding period, but higher than the last three quarters of 2022 and about in-line with the 20-quarter average 77.7%.This would typically not be worth highlighting, but we think it can be interpreted to mean underlying earnings strength since Q2 estimates hadn't fallen as much as had been the case with other recent quarters.Story continuesUnlike the EPS beats percentage, the Q2 revenue beats percentage is tracking below what we have become too used to seeing in other recent periods for this group of 77 index members.Looking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actuals for this group of 77 index members with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total S&amp;P 500 earnings are expected to decline -8.9% from the same period last year on -0.5% lower revenues.Featured Analyst ReportsTJX Companies shares have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry over the past year (+36.6% vs. +4.3%). The company’s off-price business model, strategic store locations, impressive brands and fashion products and supply-chain management have been working well.The TJX Companies is benefiting from its solid store and e-commerce growth efforts. The company’s Marmaxx segment is doing particularly well, wherein comp store sales increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, backed by improved customer traffic. The company expects the pretax profit margin to increase in fiscal 2024 and also anticipates overall comp store sales growth.However, the HomeGoods (U.S.) division has been seeing soft sales.

This retail REIT’s efforts to support omnichannel retailing and focus on mixed-use developments are encouraging. Its strategic buyouts, redevelopment efforts and solid liquidity position bode well.However, higher e-commerce adoption and limited consumers’ willingness to spend amid persistent macroeconomic uncertainty and high interest rates are concerning.

134,253cecb1-50be-371f-8822-46a795020706,TJX,2023-07-21,"Q2 Earnings Season Scorecard and Analyst Reports for TJX Companies, MSCI & Others",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/q2-earnings-season-scorecard-analyst-170100197.html,1689872460,STORY,"['TJX', 'SPG', 'MSCI', '^GSPC', 'SLF']","[Thursday, July 20, 2023The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. In today's Research Daily, we have provided the real-time scorecard on the ongoing Q2 earnings season in addition to featuring updated research reports on 16 major stocks, including The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX), Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG) and MSCI Inc. (MSCI). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Q2 Earnings Season Scorecard (As of July 20th, 2023)Including all of this morning's releases, we now have Q2 results from 77 S&amp;P 500 members or 15.4% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these 77 index members are up +3.6% from the same period last year on +8.4% higher revenues, with 77.9% beating EPS estimates and 63.6% beating revenue estimates. The +3.6% year-over-year earnings growth is higher than any other period since the last quarter of 2021 for this group of 77 index members. The +8.4% revenue growth compares to +9.3% in 2023 Q1, +7.8% in 2022 Q4, +9.8% each 2022 Q3 and Q2 and +10.2% in 2022 Q1. The 77.9% EPS beats percentage is the same as was achieved by this group of companies in the preceding period, but higher than the last three quarters of 2022 and about in-line with the 20-quarter average 77.7%. This would typically not be worth highlighting, but we think it can be interpreted to mean underlying earnings strength since Q2 estimates hadn't fallen as much as had been the case with other recent quarters. Unlike the EPS beats percentage, the Q2 revenue beats percentage is tracking below what we have become to used to seeing in other recent periods for this group of 77 index members. Looking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actuals for this group of 77 index members with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total S&amp;P 500 earnings are expected to decline -8.9% from the same period last year on -0.5% lower revenues.

Its strategic buyouts, redevelopment efforts and solid liquidity position bode well.However, higher e-commerce adoption and limited consumers’ willingness to spend amid persistent macroeconomic uncertainty and high interest rates are concerning.

135,faf75ba6-2f47-3981-b28f-c463d0acbc73,TJX,2023-07-21,4 Retail Discount Stocks Thriving Amid Industry Challenges,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-retail-discount-stocks-thriving-151200970.html,1689865920,STORY,"['ROST', 'COST', 'TGT', 'TJX', '^GSPC']","[Consumer spending activity, which is one of the pivotal factors driving the economy, has somewhat slowed down. Underlying inflationary pressure, a slowing labor market, a higher interest rate environment and reductions in pandemic savings have collectively dampened demand. Of late, players in the Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry have been encountering these headwinds.That said, industry participants have been focusing on deepening engagements with consumers, adding more compelling products and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. Inventory management, supply-chain enhancement, cost-structure realignment and investments to accelerate digitization have been working in favor of companies like Costco Wholesale Corporation COST, The TJX Companies, Inc. TJX, Target Corporation TGT and Ross Stores, Inc. ROST.About the IndustryThe Retail – Discount Stores industry comprises companies that offer apparel, accessories, footwear, beauty products, personal and baby care products, cleaning products, pet supplies, and food and beverage products at lower prices than traditional retail outlets. The industry participants also provide home textiles, home furnishings, housewares, art and craft supplies, toys and seasonal decor products. These companies sell their products through stores, digital channels, or both. Some industry players operate membership shopping warehouse clubs, offering branded and private-label products in a range of merchandise categories. Most discount stores are gradually emerging as one-stop shopping destinations. The profitability of players depends on a prudent pricing model, a well-organized supply chain and an effective merchandising strategy.4 Key Industry Trends to WatchSoft Demand May Hit Revenues: The industry’s prospects are correlated with the purchasing power of consumers. Consumer spending, a key catalyst for the economy, has recently shown signs of slowing down. Several factors have come into play, including underlying inflationary pressure, a slowing labor market, a higher interest rate environment and reductions in pandemic savings. We note that U.S. retail sales experienced a slight uptick in June 2023, falling short of analysts’ expectations. Retail sales showed 0.2% growth, marking a deceleration from the 0.5% growth recorded in May. Additionally, there are indications that the Federal Reserve is likely to resume raising interest rates this month, following a period of unchanged rates in June.Story continuesPressure on Margins to Linger: Companies in the industry are vying for a bigger share on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. Further, the increasing dominance of e-commerce players has made the retail-discount space highly competitive. This has compelled many players to strengthen their digital ecosystem and boost shipping and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors drive sales, they entail high costs. Apart from these, higher marketing, advertising and other store-related expenses might compress margins. Of late, the industry participants have been dealing with product cost inflation. Nonetheless, companies have been focusing on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges. These include streamlining operational structures, optimizing supply networks and adopting effective pricing policies.Consumers Seek Better Bargains: The strategy to sell products at discounted prices has helped industry players draw customers in low-to-middle-income groups who have been seeking both value and convenience, particularly in the face of rising prices. Industry participants have been focusing on creating innovative and compelling products and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities to attract price-sensitive consumers.Digitization Is the Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns, industry participants have been evolving to play dual in-store and online roles. Initiatives, such as building omnichannel, coming up with loyalty and marketing programs, enhancing the supply chain and providing faster delivery options, be it doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at the store, are worth mentioning. Simultaneously, companies are investing in renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers’ product preferences and growing inclination toward online shopping, retailers have been replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry is housed within the broader Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #235, which places it in the bottom 6% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates drab near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Since the beginning of January 2023, the industry’s earnings estimate has declined 10.5%.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry vs. Broader MarketThe Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry has underperformed the broader Retail – Wholesale sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.Stocks in this industry have collectively increased 3%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector has risen 6.8% and the S&amp;P 500 has rallied 14.1% in the said time frame.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is commonly used for valuing retail stocks, the industry is currently trading at 25.13 compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 20.14 and the sector’s 23.62.Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 29.98X and as low as 18.04X, with the median being at 23.59X, as the chart below shows.Price-to-Earnings Ratio (Past 5 Years)4 Retail Discount Store Stocks to Keep a Close Eye OnCostco: The discount retailer’s growth strategies, better price management and decent membership trends have been contributing to its performance. Cumulatively, these factors have been aiding this Issaquah, WA-based company in registering decent sales numbers. The company's distinctive membership business model and pricing power set it apart from traditional players. We believe a favorable product mix, steady store traffic, pricing strength and strong liquidity should benefit Costco.Costco has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 1.8%, on average. It has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 8.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current financial-year revenues and EPS suggests growth of 6.7% and 9.6%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figure.

137,6ef53360-21c6-351b-9e62-4d27e4280d2d,AMGN,2023-07-21,Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 77% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amgen-inc-nasdaq-amgn-largely-120054203.html,1689940854,STORY,['AMGN'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Amgen implies that they have significant influence over the company's share priceThe top 25 shareholders own 49% of the company Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a businessIf you want to know who really controls Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 77% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Amgen, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Amgen ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Amgen?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Amgen. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Amgen's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Amgen. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.1% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 9.1% and 5.5% of the stock.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of AmgenThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that Amgen Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$202m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 22% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Jakusconek; Senior Gold Research Analyst; Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research DivisionPresentationOperatorGood morning, and welcome to Newmont's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded.I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.Thomas Ronald PalmerThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Newmont's second quarter earnings call. Today, I'm joined by my executive leadership team, including our Chief Operating Officer, Rob Atkinson, and we'll all be available to answer your questions at the end of the call. I'd also like to introduce our recently appointed Chief Financial Officer, Karyn Ovelmen. Karyn is a highly experienced financial professional who has held both CFO roles and Board seats in the resource and energy sectors. She brings a breadth of global experience, and we are very pleased that she has joined the Newmont team.Before I begin, please note our cautionary statement and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website.Guided by a clear consistent strategy, our focus is on running a safe and sustainable mining business to generate long-term value. Our business is underpinned by a strong balance sheet and a global portfolio with the size and scale to make decisions that deliver on our strategy.And while I'm not happy with our ultimate financial results for the second quarter, I am very comfortable with the prudent decisions that we made during the quarter to safeguard our workforce, protect long-term value and position Newmont to deliver strong performance in the second half of this year and beyond.During the second quarter, Newmont produced 1.2 million ounces of gold and 256,000 gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc, generating nearly $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA and more than $650 million in cash from our continuing operations.There were 4 important decisions that we made during the second quarter. First, we decided to suspend operations at Peñasquito to focus on finding an appropriate and sustainable resolution to the current dispute with the union representing our workforce in Mexico. This dispute is associated with a profit-sharing agreement that we made with the union leadership only 12 months ago. And in May, we paid our employees their profit-sharing bonus for the 2022 year, calculated in strict accordance with this agreement. The union leadership are now demanding more than double the agreed amount and have taken strike action through the withdrawal of labor.At Newmont, Peñasquito sits within a strong, balanced global portfolio of operations, a portfolio that is supported by the industry's strongest balance sheet. During this important time for Peñasquito, we will remain firm in our resolve and continue to make decisions that protect the long-term value of the operation and benefit our employees, our contracting partners, our host communities, our customers and all of our stakeholders. We strongly encourage the union leadership up to and including Senator Napoleon Gomez to cease this strike action and return their members to work.The second decision we made during the quarter was associated with protecting our workforce at Éléonore from the unprecedented wildfires being experienced this summer in Canada, evacuating the mine and placing the operation on care and maintenance.Third, at Cerro Negro, we made the decision to pause mining for 2 weeks and complete important safety inspections to ensure that we had the appropriate control environment in place at this remote underground mine and to protect the health and safety of our mining teams working there.And finally, at Akyem, we made the decision to process lower-grade stockpiles that were originally planned for the fourth quarter in order to optimize the mine plan, ensuring that we are in a position to safely extract the maximum amount of ore as we complete the current layback in the gen pit over the next few months.As planned, higher gold production is expected in the second half of the year, and will be driven by higher grades and tons mined from both Subika Underground and open pit at Ahafo. Higher grades and tons mined at Cerro Negro as the first wave of our district expansion comes online in the third quarter. Higher tons mined and processed at Tanami, where we will mine the highest grade for the year in the fourth quarter. Higher grade run-of-mine ore processed in the Akyem as we return and complete the current layback. And when combined with the higher production that we expect from our 2 non-managed joint ventures, Nevada Gold Mines and Pueblo Viejo, we remain on track to deliver on our full year guidance.We ended the quarter with $6.2 billion in total liquidity and maintained an investment-grade balance sheet, preserving financial flexibility as we continue through a period of meaningful reinvestment and return a stable dividend to our shareholders. Consistent with our 2023 dividend payout range, we declared a second quarter dividend of $0.40 per share, demonstrating both our ongoing commitment to shareholder returns and our confidence in the long-term strength of our business.We remain on track to close on our acquisition of Newcrest in the fourth quarter and are leveraging the lessons we learned from the successful integration of Goldcorp 4 years ago as we build out our integration plans.We have also commenced the portfolio optimization work associated with this transaction, backing the important decision in June to defer the Yanacocha Sulfides project. This is the first step in delivering significant value through portfolio optimization, and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to resequence project capital and rationalize the portfolio of the combined company over the next couple of years.At Newmont, we recognize that a strong, safety and sustainability culture is not only an indicator of a reliable well-run business. It is fundamental to delivering on our commitments to employees, contracted partners, host communities and all of our stakeholders. As we position ourselves to safely integrate Newcrest and enter this next chapter in Newmont's 102-year history, we made an important decision in the second quarter to further strengthen our commitment to responsible gold leadership and increase our focus on safety and sustainability.In June, we promoted Suzy Retallack for the role of Chief Safety and Sustainability Officer, reporting directly to me. Suzy is an industry leader with more than 20 years of experience in driving value-based decisions. Over the last 5 years, as our Senior Vice President, Health, Safety and Security, Suzy has been instrumental in leading the delivery of a step change in Newmont's safety performance. In particular, in the area of fatality risk management. Suzy will apply the lessons we have learned from our significant improvement in health, safety and security to further improve our performance in the areas of environment and social responsibility. In this new role, Suzy will also support me and my leadership team in the work we need to do as a company and as an industry to create workplaces that are free from harassment, assault, bullying and discrimination.I'll now turn it over to Rob and then to Karyn to take us through each of our operations and projects, along with a review of our quarterly financial highlights. Over to you, Rob.Story continuesRobert D. AtkinsonThank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Turning to the next slide, let's begin in Australia. Boddington delivered another strong performance in the second quarter, increasing both gold and copper production from sustained grades and improved mill throughput. As part of our multi-decade life of asset strategy for Boddington, we have increased our autonomous haulage fleet with 5 additional trucks as we increased the planned waste movement in both the North and the South pits. This investment into the next layback at Boddington will support stable gold and copper production for many years to come. We remain clearly on target to hit our 2023 production guidance, and we are well positioned to deliver more than 1 million gold equivalent ounces from this cornerstone asset.Moving to Tanami, the site has recovered extremely well following the record wet weather and extensive flooding experienced in the Northern Territory during the first quarter. We doubled our quarterly gold production in the second quarter and remain firmly on track to land within our full year guidance ranges and will mine the year's highest grades in the fourth quarter.In addition, we continue to progress the second expansion at Tanami with nearly 50% of the concrete lining of our 1.5 kilometer deep shaft installed. The lining and the furnishing of the shaft continue to be on the critical path as our project team works to deliver significant ounce and cost improvements to our Tier 1 operation in Tanami.Moving up to Africa. In June, I visited both the Ahafo South and Akyem as well as our Ahafo North project in Ghana. At Akyem, I spent time with the team as we work through the decision Tom covered earlier to prioritize safety, optimize the mine plan and maximize the ore extracted as we close out the current layback in the coming months.As a consequence of this work, we expect grades to improve by 35% during the third quarter, positioning the site to deliver significantly higher production in the second half of the year and land within our 2023 guidance ranges.At Ahafo South, we delivered higher production as we access the third mining level and additional draw points in the Subika Underground ahead of plan. Fined with access to higher grades from the open pit, the Ahafo mill will process higher grade from both underground and surface in the second half. Ahafo is also on track to commission a replacement conveyor in the third quarter, and it remains on target to hit guidance for the year.And finally, it was great to see firsthand the progress we are making on the Ahafo North project. The highway relocation in bulk airports continue to progress very well. And with the new mining fleet in place, the project team is preparing to commence pre-stripping in the second half of the year.Moving across to North America. As Tom described, Canada has been impacted by unprecedented wildfires, with Quebec, particularly impacted during the second quarter. And in the second week of June, as the fire front approach the property, we made the swift and proactive decision to evacuate our workforce and place Éléonore on care and maintenance to protect our employees and contractors. During this time, our first priority was and will always be the safety and well-being of our workforce and local communities. We're now safely ramping up production activities as the forest fire threat continues to abate. And we will continue to monitor the situation in Quebec very closely as we work with the provincial government agencies to assess fire progress and air quality on a daily basis.Moving to Porcupine. We delivered another steady performance in the second quarter and remain well positioned to deliver improved production in the second half of the year driven by higher grades from the Hollinger pit in Q3 and from Borden Underground in Q4. We continue to progress the Pamour project and are preparing for a full funds investment decision later this year. We will complete commissioning of a new water treatment plant in the coming weeks, which will accelerate dewatering of the Pamour pit and allow us to commence pre-stripping during the fourth quarter with first ore expected in 2024.At Musselwhite, we delivered consistent gold production as we progress planned development activities that will increase stope availability in the second half of the year, including access to another double lift stope. As a consequence, we expect tonnes mined to increase by more than 30% and grades to increase by around 15%, supporting a strong third and fourth quarter.And finally, Cripple Creek &amp; Victor delivered solid results due to higher grade and strong recoveries from our heap leach facilities.And now moving down to South America. Yanacocha delivered a strong second quarter as we begin to realize the benefits from applying our injection leaching technology. At Merian, we continued the planned stripping of the next layback in the Merian pit and the site is on track to deliver 40% higher grade from the Maraba pit in the third quarter, putting Merian on target to hit full year guidance.Moving to Cerro Negro. In the third quarter, tons mined is expected to increase nearly 30% as the underground ramps up to full productivity following the safety pause that Tom referred to, and grade is expected to increase by 50% as we begin to access the higher-grade stopes from San Marcos, the first of 6 new deposits associated with the exciting underground district expansion at Cerro Negro. San Marcos will continue to ramp up throughout the year and is expected to reach commercial production in late 2023.Finally, as Tom discussed, we made the decision to suspend operations at Peñasquito on June 7 as we focus on finding a resolution to the dispute with the union leadership. We have and will continue to abide by the fair and equitable agreement that is currently in place and that was importantly, fully agreed to only a year ago with the union. We will continue to communicate directly with our employees and engage with the union leaders and government officials to find a fair, appropriate and sustainable resolution to this very disappointing dispute. You can expect that we will provide a fulsome update to the market once an agreement has been reached, and we look forward to returning our focus to safe and sustainable mining at Peñasquito.And now I'll wrap up on the next slide with our 2 non-managed joint ventures. Our share in Nevada Gold Mines and interest in Pueblo Viejo contributed 338,000 ounces of attributable gold production in the second quarter, and we look forward to both joint ventures delivering on their expected strong second half.And with that, I'll pass it over to Karyn to cover our financial results.Karyn OvelmenThank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. I'm happy to be joining the call today and look forward to presenting our second quarter financial results and answering any questions you might have.Before I get started, I wanted to talk briefly about what brought me to Newmont. When I was doing my due diligence on Newmont, I was excited to learn about the company's clear and consistent strategy, leading approach to safety and sustainability, its global diverse portfolio of assets and deep project pipeline to position Newmont for long-term success.Joining in May, I've had the pleasure to meet Newmont's senior leaders and the Board and spend time with my very talented finance team. And I can say that the strength of our people and capabilities have already far surpassed my initial expectations.Over the coming months, my team and I will be focused on building upon the strong foundation that we have today, partnering with the business to improve our overall financial performance and driving our disciplined capital allocation strategy, with a balance sheet that can support our strategic initiatives throughout the commodity cycle.Turning to the next slide. Let's get started with a look at the financial highlights. In the second quarter, Newmont delivered $2.7 billion in revenue at a realized gold price of $1,965 per ounce, adjusted EBITDA of $910 million. Cash from operations of $656 million, which includes over $100 million of unfavorable working capital changes. Included in working capital changes were nearly $250 million in tax payments in the second quarter, partially offset by a draw on receivables. We would expect to draw on receivables to reverse in future quarters. The tax payments to decrease in the third and fourth quarter as they have in previous years.In total, we generated $40 million of free cash flow for the quarter, which is net of more than $600 million of capital spend as we continue to progress our most profitable near-term projects and position the portfolio for growth, both in ounces and merchants in future years. We maintained a strong cash position with $3.2 billion and an attractive leverage ratio of 0.7x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. We also maintained solid margins in the second quarter, driven by higher realized gold prices and steady direct costs.Second quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $155 million or $0.19 per diluted share. Adjustments included $0.05 related to unrealized mark-to-market losses on equity investments, $0.03 related to transaction costs associated with our pending acquisition of Newcrest and $0.06 related to tax adjustments and other items.Taking these into account, we reported second quarter adjusted net income of $0.33 per diluted share. And it is also important to note that this number has not been adjusted for the $46 million in operating costs and depreciation at Peñasquito since the strike commenced and at Éléonore, while the site was proactively shut down due to the wildfires.As Tom and Rob noted, Newmont remains well positioned to deliver a strong performance in the second half of the year and achieve our full year guidance. Second quarter, we declared a dividend of $0.40 per share or $1.60 per share on an annualized basis, consistent with the last 2 quarters and calibrated within our 2023 dividend payout range of $1.40 to $1.80 per share. We have now maintained a dividend yield above 3% for 11 consecutive quarters, and this continues to be the highest dividend per share in the gold sector.With that, I'll turn it over to Tom for an update on the time line from today through to the close of our acquisition of Newcrest.Thomas Ronald PalmerThanks, Karyn. Over the last 2 months since we announced the binding agreement to acquire Newcrest, my team and I have engaged with many of our important stakeholders, including employees, shareholders, local communities and government leaders. These conversations were aimed at listening to and answering questions whilst also ensuring that the benefits of the transaction and Newmont's strategic rationale were well understood.Over the next couple of months, we will continue to progress the various regulatory approvals ahead of closing the transaction, primarily in Australia and Papua New Guinea. And I'm pleased to advise we've already received clearance from the Canadian government.Earlier this month, I visited Papua New Guinea for the second time, meeting with various government officials including Prime Minister James Marape, Deputy Prime Minister John Russo and Mining Minister Sir Ano Pala. As we continue this engagement, we remain excited for the opportunity to operate Lihir, and develop the world-class Waihi gold boom project.We are diligently working towards launching a scheme booklet and filing a proxy statement this quarter with shareholder votes expected in October. We then expect to close the transaction in November and begin the important work to safely integrate the Newcrest teams and operations into our portfolio. Then be in a position to provide 2024 guidance for the combined company in February of next year, along with our fourth quarter and 2023 results.With that, I'll thank you for your time today and turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And the first question today goes to Greg Barnes of TD Securities.Greg BarnesTom, I just wanted to ask about inflationary pressures and how you see them evolving into the second half of '23 and '24 ex any volume improvements you're going to get, which obviously will help on a gold per ounce basis.Thomas Ronald PalmerYes. Thanks, Greg. What we're seeing in our direct cost is largely consistent with what we expected as we guided this year, and I just step through that in a little bit more detail. About half our cost base is labor, about 50% is labor made up pretty evenly between employees and contractors. Employees largely stable and expect that to remain largely stable through the rest of this year and into next. Certainly seeing some settling down in Australia, Canada, United States.Contracted services also have stabilized. So still at a higher cost that we saw with the inflation coming through last year but largely stabilized, maybe a little bit of easing into the second half of this year, but certainly seeing the volatility come out of that, and that's at 50%, that's a pretty important driver.30% materials and consumables. So it's the various reagents, particularly cyanide, explosive, steel for grinding media and the like. We're seeing those largely consistent with what we expected. Natural gas prices have come off, which is then flowing through to the prices that we're seeing for both cyanide and explosives. So a little bit of relief tailwinds with those consumables and would expect that to flow through the second half of this year. We'll see supply of natural gas may be tighten a bit, which may put a bit more tension on those prices, but certainly expecting to see that stable or a little bit of an improvement and still pretty much holding its own as we look at the grinding [median to] remove around the place.And then the next big category is fuel and energy, 15%, and that's driven by diesel. And we've certainly seen some relief in oil prices relative to what we've assumed. And we would expect to see that carry on through the second half of this year, but a volatile commodity and one that we'll continue to be conservative as we think about our assumptions for that. So a few tailwinds, Greg, some stability and consistent with what we expected for 2023.Greg BarnesGreat. That's very helpful, Tom. And just a follow-on. In the presentation, you talked about the guidance you're going to provide in February. I'm just wondering how detailed do you expect to be in February around Newcrest and your expectations for how that's going to fold into the company in '24?Thomas Ronald PalmerWe're certainly working towards being in a position where we can give you a view of 2024 for the combined portfolio, which would include our view of the 5 Newcrest assets being folded into our operations. So if things continue to go to plan in terms of regulatory approvals, shareholder votes and close, integration planning busily being done. We'll receive the keys to the car so to speak in early November, I would hope, and that gives us time to work through those mine plans, apply the Newmont lens on those mine plans and the assumptions we make for some of the key input assumptions and certainly working towards being in a position to provide the 2024 guidance for the combined portfolio in the February time frame.Greg BarnesAnd what about the 3- to 5-year guidance beyond that, will that wait?Thomas Ronald PalmerWe will monitor that. And see how those numbers come together. We'll certainly be looking in the 2024 time frame to provide as much information as we think appropriate, certainly for 2024 in that February time frame and then -- and look for a logical time for a Capital Markets Day to share some more information on the combined portfolio and maybe even look to try and include some sort of site visit with that. So that's still work in progress, Greg. But certainly, 2024 is in our side for that February timeframe.Operator(Operator Instructions) And our next question goes to Anita Soni of CIBC Markets.Anita SoniMy first question with regards to the transaction, could you tell me, did the independent adviser or the independent expert for Newcrest reach that conclusion yet?Thomas Ronald PalmerAnita, thank you for dialing in. I think that might be a little vacation period for you. So good to hear your voice, and hopefully, you can get off this call and back to some better years of time.They're still working through that process. So that's their working -- it's in train working through, but not finished yet. So it's -- but it's on schedule in terms of when we need that information in order to be able to proceed for the time line we had in the deck.Anita SoniOkay. And then the second question, and then I'll go back into the queue. I'm just trying to get some of the grades that Rob quickly went through in terms of -- so let's start with Musselwhite. I think they said 30% improvement in tons mined and then grades by 40%. Is that a Q3 or Q4? If I do that in Q3, I get well above your guide.Thomas Ronald PalmerWe're certainly starting to see a step-up in grade in both Q3 and Q4, pretty consistent across Q3 and Q4 for Musselwhite, Anita. We're opening up with a nice double lift stope coming on, which is going to give us both some improvement in grade and volume. And then we've got some stopes and some high-grade material also coming on as a result of the work in the first half. So pretty consistent grade, Rob, through the second half and certainly seeing a step-up in volume coming out. That will ramp up over the third and fourth quarter. So the highest volume through the mill in the fourth quarter rate pretty consistent.Anita SoniOkay. And then just in terms of -- I think at Ahafo where you were talking -- or maybe it was Akyem, 35% uptick in grades in Q3. Is that correct?Thomas Ronald PalmerThat's right, Anita. So in Akyem, we stepped out into stockpiles, got the -- I mean, if those of you who know Akyem, it's a long narrow pit and so is where as we're getting the last of the ore from the bottom of the pit and the current layback and wanting to bring down the next layback, we want to make sure that we maximize that also. We stepped out of the pit, made sure catch benches and the like rolling good shape. And swung into the stock -- the stockpiles we would have been in, in the fourth quarter. And now we're back in that ore. And so we basically got right of mine high-grade ore from the bottom of the pit coming through. You'll see most of that through the -- now you see a good portion of that through the build through the third and fourth quarter now. It's the highest grades in the fourth quarter, building up through the third.Anita SoniOkay. And then lastly, at Cerro Negro. I just want to make sure I heard you correctly. So 30% increase in tons mined and 50% increase in grade. But I don't think Rob said which quarter it was. Is that -- does that start in Q3? Or is it Q4 weighted?Thomas Ronald PalmerWe see the step-up in grade at Cerro Negro pretty consistent through the third and fourth quarter at Cerro Negro. And then you'll actually see -- you see quite a step-up in tons mined as we've got more ability to access ore particularly as we start to extract ore from San Marcos for the first time. So pretty consistent second half across Q3 and Q4 in terms of material coming through the mill and the grades looking pretty consistent through those 2 quarters.Anita, probably one other on Ahafo. We've got the -- we've got the stars really lining up in terms of the real sweet spot in the Subika open pit as well as now having the third level of Subika underground open more than 20 draw points open. So we've got both the combination of high grades and tons coming out of open pit and underground at Ahafo. So it's another important one to be thinking about as you think about second half of the year. But that's certainly fourth quarter weighted as that comes through building through the third or the fourth quarter is a strong one at Ahafo with the stars lining up in both open pit and underground with mine sequences.OperatorThe next question goes to Mike Parkin of National Bank.Michael ParkinCan you just give a bit more color in terms of the background on pausing at Cerro Negro in mining? And does it have with what you've kind of investigated and decided on a go-forward basis? Does it have any material impact on the cost structure of that asset going forward?Thomas Ronald PalmerMike, certainly, absolutely no impact on cost structure going forward. It was from time to time, certainly, my experience and Rob's experience you'll get an event, and we had a significant potential event in the underground mine and involved a loader that we weren't happy that we had the control environment in to be managing as the standard that we'd expect around -- basically, it was a piece of equipment involved in an incident. It's a remote mine.As you know, Cerro Negro is in a very remote part of Argentina and Patagonia. And we wanted to ensure that the standards that we expect, we're clear across the 4 crews that were there and that we went through the underground mine and did the appropriate inspections to make sure that equipment and conditions underground were well understood. You're obviously working underground in a remote location. So it's briefly important that we can be satisfied that the expectations are well understood and the conditions underground are well understood.We're also entering into a second half, which is a step-up in both grade and tons. So we're moving into a period of time where we're going to be asking the team to step up and be working more fronts. So we took the time to ensure that conditions were clear and expectations were set. There's nothing in terms of additional cost base. It's more about just ensuring that the leaders at all levels and their mining teams are understanding the standards that we expect and that we can confidently move forward with mining what will be a strong second half at Cerro Negro.Michael ParkinOkay. Great. So pretty much to sum up, it's more kind of ensuring operational best practices of Newmont being executed at that site.Thomas Ronald PalmerThat's right, Mike. We will do that from time to time, in my experience there are times when you must always maintain a chronic needs with safety, and there will be events that come from time to time and part of maintaining solid safety performance is recognizing when you may need to just pause and ensure everyone's got their mind on the game, understand what's expected and then move forward with confidence. And so that's something we do from time to time. Certainly, Cerro Negro we cited that this needed a couple of weeks down.I'd expect as we do our integration planning for Newcrest and think about 5 new operations coming into our portfolio, think about the work we might do through November and December. That's certainly one of the debates we're having in terms of how do we ensure that the standards that we expect at Newmont are there in place in Day 1 of those new crystal operations. So it's something that certainly both Rob and I have done in our careers from time to time when we see a need to reset expectations.Michael ParkinOkay. Excellent. And just one question on Peñasquito. With respect to the stream, is there any minimum delivery of silver that you're tied to? Or are you fully free to shut down and not deliver silver when you're not producing?Thomas Ronald PalmerThat's correct. That's my understanding, Mike, we'll get the team to just run that to ground. And it's different from that, we'll let you know, but that's our understanding.OperatorThe next question goes to Tanya Jakusconek of Scotiabank.Tanya M. JakusconekI wanted to ask about Peñasquito, just to get some clarification just from so many news articles that keep coming out. I'm just trying to understand with the union being on June 8, I just want to make sure that I understood some of the articles that came out. Has the union gone to paying the workers? Because my understanding was the workers aren't being paid being on strike, that the union has gone in to pay the workers. Do we know if that's a correct statement from some of the papers I was reading?Thomas Ronald PalmerTanya, that's correct. The members, the union members who are on strike are not being paid by the union that they're members of. And as part of our position at the negotiating table, we're not paying back pay.Tanya M. JakusconekOkay. So the union is not paying and you're not paying. So they haven't been paid since June 8.Thomas Ronald PalmerThat's right. So workforce of some 2,000 people aren't being paid. You've got a much bigger contractor workforce that aren't being paid. You've got an extended community. There's some 28,000 people that rely upon those wages to see some benefits. They're not being paid. We're the biggest taxpayer in the state of Zacatecas. They're not getting taxes. And our contributions are close to $2 billion a year to the Mexican government through both taxes and royalties are not currently being paid. So our message to the union leadership is we have a fair and equitable agreement. We paid in accordance with that, and we strongly encourage them to get their members back to work so that we can start paying wages again.Tanya M. JakusconekOkay. Yes, it's just there was an article, Tom, that's saying that the union leader -- the union was taking money from their coffers and paying the workers. I just wanted to clarify that.And just how should we think about the cost of the -- on a monthly basis, being on care and maintenance as we go into July, how should I think, number one, what sort of cost should I be thinking about you incurring on care and maintenance? And number two, would that be coming through the operating costs? Or would you take that out and put it under other?Thomas Ronald PalmerYes. So we -- you'll see -- and I'll get Daniel to catch up with you after the call, but we've got something in our earnings release. If you think about those costs through the month of June, at Peñasquito, we incurred $23 million of operating costs, another $15 million in depreciation due to the suspension of operations. So it's down for most of June. That's...Tanya M. JakusconekIs it out of operating costs into other items?Thomas Ronald PalmerNo, we don't plan to do that, Tanya. So what you described is how best to model it.Tanya M. JakusconekOkay. And then if I could just go back to Anita's question on just the second half performance with some of the mines that I think Cerro Negro would be evenly distributed Ahafo and Mussel are going to get higher Q4. Is there any other operation that going to have a higher Q4 because when I look at the numbers, you're looking at a production profile of Q4 being significantly stronger than Q3. Is that how I should think about it?Thomas Ronald PalmerThat's right, Tanya. We're building towards a strong fourth quarter. You've got -- you'll have across some of the parts of the world in which we operate, you tend to get a bit more wet weather in the third quarter. So you typically see us have those drier locations that really bring it home in the fourth quarter. Pueblo Viejo ramping up with 40% of Pueblo Viejo. That's an important part of H2, Nevada Gold Mines guiding to a strong second half. That's an important part of our H2. Tanami, we have got pretty consistent tons through the mill in the second half, but we move into our highest grade stopes in the fourth quarter. So that's an important story. And I think we probably covered the -- most of the Merian certainly got a stronger second pretty consistent across Q3 and Q4. So I think we've covered the sort of the key drivers of H1 versus H2 and where the higher fourth quarter would come from.Tanya M. JakusconekOkay. No, I appreciate that. It's just when you look at the production profile, excluding Peñasquito depending on what happens there, it is looking at the fourth quarter is the one that is going to carry quite a bit of weight for your -- in order to get your guidance.Thomas Ronald PalmerThat's right, Tanya.Tanya M. JakusconekIf I could just do one final question. Sorry?Thomas Ronald PalmerGo ahead, Tanya.Tanya M. JakusconekOkay. Sorry, I cut you to say something else. Just another follow-up on Greg's questions on the inflationary release that you are seeing. I just wanted to confirm because some companies are not seeing exactly the same thing. Would be also fair to say that you are seeing cyanide pricing coming down relative to what you have. And I just kind of wonder in your agreement to restock your inventories on these lower level prices that are out there. Some contracts for some come up in 3 months, 6 months. I'm just wondering how -- when we are expecting you to renegotiate at these lower levels, so we can see when those would go through your cost structure.Thomas Ronald PalmerSo Tanya, we -- our supply chain strategy, particularly with our key commodities is to have strategic contracts that are long term based upon the size of our portfolio, and we built into those rise in full calculations. So we pretty much then become a price taker but at a competitive price. And then we -- and then we'll have flowed through the -- as you see prices go up and down, we have some relief in terms of the volatility about price increases or price decreases. And then with the inventories we have at sites, and it takes a little while for that to flow through.So we are -- on the back of natural gas prices coming off, we are seeing ammonia prices down, caustic soda prices are also down and where we are seeing improvement in both cyanide cost and explosive costs. So that is flowing through and it's linked to click back to that key commodity price, and it's flowing through our contracts. It will wash through our inventories, and we just continue to, through those contracts, take the prices as we have agreed in those contracts, and that then takes normally a month or 2 or 3 to flow through our inventories.Tanya M. JakusconekOkay. And so those you could see them coming in, in Q3 and into Q4?Thomas Ronald PalmerYes, yes, we'll see some of that benefit in Q3 and Q4, absolutely.OperatorThe next question goes to Brian MacArthur of Raymond James.Brian MacArthurCan I just follow up on Peñasquito. Tanya covered the ongoing cost, but where is the concentrate situation? Is there concentrate in transit that's off-site that's provisionally priced and you're going to have some sales in Q3 if nothing happens or I was looking at your sales versus your production, and I know it varies quarter-by-quarter and lead versus zinc. Where are we on that? Is there actually a cash inflow to you from concentrator? Is it all stuck at side? Or where is that situation at the moment?Thomas Ronald PalmerBrian, so there's nothing left to put and all the sales being recognized in the second quarter. So there's nothing in the supply chain from the mine site to the smelters that hasn't been sold and recognized. And then we have a small amount of concentrate stockpile on site but not much. Sites been put into care and maintenance in very good neck and everything is safe and secure onsite. So the expectation that common sense prevails and we've got a workforce back at work. We can ramp up very quickly with a lot of experience in being able to ramp up from the pandemic days. So we know how to get that big mine back up and running and producing concentrate very quickly. So it's pretty clean in terms of where we sit with the concentrates.OperatorWe have a follow-up question from Anita Soni of CIBC Markets.Anita SoniSo a few more questions in terms of the details. At Tanami, could you just go over what you're looking for in terms of grades and tons in the Q4, Q3?Thomas Ronald PalmerNo problems, Tanya. The Q3...Anita SoniAnita.Thomas Ronald PalmerSorry. Sorry. That lives in the flow. Anita, yes. Daniel was writing me notes, Tanya, if you're still listening, my apologies, and I needed my apologies. Obviously, I need a holiday, sorry. The high grades are in the fourth quarter. You'll actually see a little bit of a step up in the third quarter from what we are able to see in the second -- and then we get into some nice high-grade stopes in the fourth quarter. So pretty consistent through the mill and a step-up in the third and fourth quarter as they're free and clear of some of the disruption from the weather in the first half. So you see a step-up in volumes through the mill but the real grades flow in the fourth quarter. Nothing outrageous. Certainly well within the grades that we've seen historically.Anita SoniOkay. And then in terms of the project, I was noticing the spend at the different projects. And Tanami looks -- I mean I don't really -- we don't really have sort of like the -- or maybe I've lost track of the amount of time that it's going to take to build out these projects, we are in the process like a percentage just from a time standpoint. But Ahafo North, it seems like the spend is not -- it's got the same start-up at Tanami expansion and I only see about 30% of the spend and where Tanami's about has to spend. So could you just give us a little color on the time frame and the cadence of spending at both Tanami and Ahafo North?Thomas Ronald PalmerSure. I'll start off Anita and Rob might want to build on this. But Ahafo North has really been a first half or a quarter of just getting the work fronts opened up. So a lot of clearing of land, bringing equipment in. And so gearing up with positioning ourselves to really get stuck into doing the pre-strip work and then the civil works will then start constructing the process plant and other infrastructure. So it's in a process of gearing up and then be able to accelerate up in terms of an open pit mine with a processing plant. Tanami, where is probably -- we're in that serious process of stepping through the shaft, doing those -- doing the concrete line and then bringing in the various facilities that get attached to that concrete wall. So that's in now starting to get a pretty steady state for that critical path item.The other thing that's largely the surface work in terms of most infrastructure is largely done. So clearly, there's a whole bunch of winding equipment to install at the appropriate time on surface and not completely done. But at Tanami, we've got the underground excavation, it's all done, but you're really in that process now mobilizing those construction crews underground to start building out the conveyors and the crushers and all the supporting infrastructure for that.So gearing up to get that work front really going ahead. So quite different projects in terms of infrastructure underground, shaft lining and then building an open pit mine and the associated infrastructure.Rob, anything you add on that?Robert D. AtkinsonAnita, I would just emphasize what Tom said, a number of fronts that we're actively working on at Tanami is far larger than Ahafo North. So every part of that project is getting worked on. And as Tom said, Ahafo North and seeing it just a month or so ago, the civil works is progressing very, very well. And in the coming months, that's when we will see significant spend, whether it be the contractors coming in. It's the steel getting erected. It's the hiring of cranes, it's the digging of tranches, et cetera, it's the construction of the tailings dams.So as the next few months passes, the number of fronts that we start working on at Ahafo North significantly increases. And as such, we'll see that increase in spend as well.Anita SoniAnd then in terms of that work, how much has been sort of like, I guess, committed or how much of that work in the next -- in the back half of this year and early next year, do you have a visibility on the cost level?Robert D. AtkinsonIn terms of, Anita...Anita SoniI guess I'm just trying to understand that if you haven't -- what I was trying to understand is if you haven't really started getting into the guts of it, how certain are you that the CapEx guidance range is still good?Robert D. AtkinsonThe key thing, which I'd certainly see, Anita, is that on the procurement side of things that we have basically secured just about all the supplies for both the projects. And I think that protects us enormously. The engineering that we've also done on both projects is at a significant level as well. So we've got a large degree of confidence.The biggest thing is always is with shaft building. We progressed down there. And at the moment, we're aligning that very well. We've got patches of overbreak, which we'll deal with. But at the moment, because of the engineering, the procurement, we're still very much on track.OperatorThis concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Palmer for closing remarks.Thomas Ronald PalmerThanks, operator. Just a quick one for Mike Parkin's question. Just confirm there's no minimum payment on the silver stream, Mike, if you're still listing on the call.Thank you all for making the time for the call this quarter, and please enjoy the rest of your day, and thank you for your time. Thanks, everyone.OperatorThank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.]"

The strong revenue performance across most of its business segments is likely to have accelerated its overall second-quarter top line. However, the bottom line is likely to have been impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations and supply-chain disruptions.Aerospace Unit to Elevate Total RevenuesIncreased global air travel demand boosting higher aircraft services, particularly in the realm of maintenance and fixed-based operator services, is likely to have contributed to the Aerospace business unit’s sales performance.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Aerospace segment’s revenues in the second quarter is pegged at $2,083.2 million. This indicates an 11.6% improvement from revenues reported in the year-ago quarter.Marine Systems Likely to be WeakThe Marine Systems unit’s revenues are likely to have been positively influenced by the increased volume from the Columbia-class submarine program, the Arleigh Burke-class (DDG-51) destroyer program and the T-AO program in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. However, the supply-chain constraints of the Virginia program are likely to dent this segment’s second-quarter results.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Marine segment’s revenues in the second quarter is pegged at $2,573.6 million. This suggests a 2.9% decline from revenues reported in the year-ago quarter.Combat Systems Sales May RiseIncreased revenues from the Mobile Protected Firepower ramp-up, Stryker SHORAD and new international vehicle programs for Poland and Australia are likely to have added impetus to Combat Systems’ second-quarter revenues. The strong demand for munitions and international combat vehicles must have kept order numbers elevated, thereby boosting the backlog for this segment in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Combat Systems segment’s revenues in the second quarter is pegged at $1,689.7 million. This indicates a 1.4% increase from revenues reported in the year-ago quarter.Technologies Unit’s Revenues Likely to ImproveStrong order activity in IT services and higher hardware volumes are likely to have contributed to the Technologies unit’s revenues in the second quarter of 2023.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Technologies segment’s revenues in the second quarter is pegged at $3,103.1 million. This calls for 3.3% growth from revenues reported in the year-ago quarter.Backlog Shows StrengthA strong backlog indicates positive prospects for a company. In this context, our model suggests a growth rate of 4.1% for GD’s backlog in the second quarter of 2023, indicating high demand for General Dynamics’ products and services.Other Factors to NoteThe growth in sales across the majority of the company’s segments makes us optimistic about the overall top line in the second quarter. However, this may have been offset by foreign exchange rate fluctuations and supply-chain disruptions, thus negatively impacting the bottom line of General Dynamics in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Q2 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter revenues is pegged at $9.41 billion, suggesting 2.4% growth from the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.59 per share, indicating a decline of 5.8% from the prior-year reported figure.General Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseGeneral Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseGeneral Dynamics Corporation price-eps-surprise | General Dynamics Corporation QuoteWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for General Dynamics this time.

Bernie Sanders is sounding the alarm.In an op-ed titled ""This year is set to be the hottest in history. Congress must act now"" for The Guardian, Sanders pointed out that the past eight years have been the warmest ever documented.And the world has to grapple with more than just summer heat.""Climate change is ravaging the planet,"" he wrote. ""We are now seeing floods, droughts, extreme weather disturbances and wildfires causing unprecedented damage.""Sanders explained that the imminent consequences of climate change include accelerated Arctic ice cap melting, rising sea levels and heightened flooding. The changes will increase droughts, disrupt food production and intensify storm damage. Economic downturns and mass migration because of water shortages are expected as well.""Instead of denying this obvious reality, instead of doing the bidding of oil and coal companies, instead of fomenting a new cold war with China, members of Congress must develop an unprecedented sense of urgency about this global crisis,"" he said.While Sanders made a compelling call to action, some corporations have already risen to the challenge. Here's a look at three green stocks that are actively tackling the issue.Check out:Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes and you only need $100.This real estate fund isn’t only providing incredible returns to its investors, but also helping its tenants build wealth. See why this ‘people first' strategy could disrupt the rental market.Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 28% of America's greenhouse gas emissions in 2021 came from the transportation sector — and particularly from burning fossil fuels for cars, trucks, ships, trains and planes.The EPA estimates that a typical passenger vehicle emits approximately 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year.Story continuesTesla is helping resolve the issue by producing electric vehicles (EVs), which have no tailpipe emissions.The company is making an impact. In the second quarter of 2023, it delivered 466,140 vehicles, representing an 83% increase year over year.Tesla has been one of the more volatile names in the stock market. Shares fell 65% in 2022 but are up 170% in 2023.First Solar Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR)Solar energy can play a significant role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. One reason is that it produces no emissions during the power generation process. And according to the United Nations, life-cycle assessments of solar power ""clearly demonstrate that it has a smaller carbon footprint from ‘cradle-to-grave' than fossil fuels.""First Solar's solutions help humans harness the power of the sun. The company produces solar panels, including those used in utility-scale solar power plants.The business brought in $548 million in net sales in the first quarter of 2023. For the full year, net sales are projected to be between $3.4 billion and $3.6 billion.The stock market had a choppy ride over the past year, but First Solar investors probably aren't complaining. Over the past 12 months, shares have surged more than 180%.NextEra Energy Partners LP (NYSE:NEP)NextEra Energy Partners was created by energy company NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) to own, manage and acquire clean energy projects that generate steady cash flows.Today, NextEra Energy Partners' portfolio holds interests in wind, solar and energy storage projects in the U.S., along with natural gas infrastructure assets in Texas and Pennsylvania.Because natural gas is not considered a renewable energy source, NextEra Energy Partners is not a renewables pure-play. But it recently announced plans to become one.""To lead this transition, we are launching a process to sell our natural gas pipeline assets, and we are suspending incentive distribution rights fees to NextEra Energy through 2026,"" John Ketchum, chairman and CEO of NextEra Energy Partners, said in a press release.The partnership also stands out for its cash payout to investors.NextEra Energy Partners currently pays quarterly distributions of 84.25 cents per share, giving the stock an annual yield of 5.7%. Management expects to grow the distribution per unit by 12% to 15% per year through at least 2026, although they mentioned that given the current capital market environment, the growth rate will probably be ""at or near the bottom end of this range.""NextEra Energy Partners stock is down about 16% in 2023. If you like oversized dividends but aren't a fan of the volatility associated with publicly traded companies, you might want to look into reliable income plays outside the stock market — such as investing in rental properties with as little as $100 while staying completely hands-off.Read next:This Former Google Engineer Built A Platform That Lets You Buy Shares Of Single-Family Rentals With The Click Of A ButtonElon Musk Is Bullish On Austin.

NEE is scheduled to release its second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 25 before market open. The utility delivered an earnings surprise of 12% in the last reported quarter.Let’s discuss the factors that are likely to get reflected in the upcoming quarterly results.Factors to NoteNextEra Energy’s second-quarter results are likely to reflect the benefits of an improvement in Florida’s economic conditions. Florida Power &amp; Light Company (FPL) is expected to be a major contributor to total revenues in the second quarter, like in previous quarters. The expected increase in the FPL customer base in the second quarter is likely to have a positive impact on NEE’s performance.Contributions from new investments in FPL and NextEra Energy Resources are likely going to contribute to second-quarter results. The cost management efforts are also likely to have boosted results in the quarter to be reported.NextEra Energy Resources is anticipated to have another strong quarter of renewables. The closure of acquisitions in first-quarter and the addition of more renewable assets are going to boost overall operations.ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings and revenues is pegged at 80 cents per share and $6.7 billion, respectively. Revenue estimates indicate year-over-year growth of 29.2%, while earnings estimates reflect a year-over-year decline of 1.2%.What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for NextEra Energy this time around. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to surpass estimates. That is the case here, as elaborated below.NextEra Energy, Inc.

149,9250000e-bad5-3f92-a44a-8617f2e5709f,NEE,2023-07-21,CMS Energy (CMS) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cms-energy-cms-earnings-expected-140223189.html,1689861743,STORY,"['CMS', 'NEE']","[CMS Energy (CMS) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 27, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis energy company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.70 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +32.1%.Revenues are expected to be $2.05 billion, up 6.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.26% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for CMS Energy?For CMS Energy, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.85%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that CMS Energy will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that CMS Energy would post earnings of $0.66 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.70, delivering a surprise of +6.06%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.CMS Energy appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsNextEra Energy (NEE), another stock in the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.80 for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -1.2%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $6.7 billion, up 29.2% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for NextEra has been revised 2.6% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 2.08%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), suggests that NextEra will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.

This might have also bolstered its second-quarter earnings.Q2 ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for NextEra Energy Partners’ earnings is pegged at 72 cents per unit, implying a year-over-year decrease of 72.4%.The consensus mark for revenues is pinned at $392.92 million, indicating an 8.6% increase year over year.Our Zacks model predicts renewable energy sales to contribute 85.1% to the company’s total revenues compared with 83.4% in the year-ago quarter.Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for NextEra Energy Partners this time around.

152,2e495fb3-5fe7-3b60-b183-318e24c4bd38,BK,2023-07-21,Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) Is Paying Out A Larger Dividend Than Last Year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bank-york-mellon-nyse-bk-100158317.html,1689933718,STORY,['BK'],"[The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's (NYSE:BK) periodic dividend will be increasing on the 10th of August to $0.42, with investors receiving 14% more than last year's $0.37. This will take the annual payment to 3.2% of the stock price, which is above what most companies in the industry pay. See our latest analysis for Bank of New York Mellon Bank of New York Mellon's Earnings Will Easily Cover The DistributionsIf the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much.Having distributed dividends for at least 10 years, Bank of New York Mellon has a long history of paying out a part of its earnings to shareholders. Taking data from its last earnings report, calculating for the company's payout ratio shows 43%, which means that Bank of New York Mellon would be able to pay its last dividend without pressure on the balance sheet.The next 3 years are set to see EPS grow by 68.1%. Analysts estimate the future payout ratio will be 33% over the same time period, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendBank of New York Mellon Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.52 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $1.48. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 11% a year over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.Dividend Growth May Be Hard To AchieveInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. However, initial appearances might be deceiving. It's not great to see that Bank of New York Mellon's earnings per share has fallen at approximately 3.2% per year over the past five years. If the company is making less over time, it naturally follows that it will also have to pay out less in dividends. Earnings are predicted to grow over the next year, but we would remain cautious until a track record of earnings growth is established.Story continuesOur Thoughts On Bank of New York Mellon's DividendOverall, this is a reasonable dividend, and it being raised is an added bonus. While the payments look sustainable for now, earnings have been shrinking so the dividend could come under pressure in the future. Taking all of this into consideration, the dividend looks viable moving forward, but investors should be mindful that the company has pushed the boundaries of sustainability in the past and may do so again.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Without at least some growth in earnings per share over time, the dividend will eventually come under pressure either from competition or inflation. Businesses can change though, and we think it would make sense to see what analysts are forecasting for the company. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

""There's a nomadic element to this with households moving from one bank to another. That's less loyalty than the banks would like.""At a macro level, the microchip shortage from 2020 through 2022 tilted the supply and demand balance in the direction of sellers. Leasing took a particularly hard hit as the incentives that had driven low monthly payments largely evaporated - there was no need for distressed merchandise tactics, as dealers marked up rare sheet metal as they saw fit. As a result, consumer loyalties overall plummeted, as whichever dealers had inventory on site saw gains, prior brand preferences be damned. This carried over into the lending world as well.""There was no need for any discounting,"" Libby said. ""The dynamics of the market completely changed.""At the end of 2019, four of the top-ten captives - BMW Financial Services, Mercedes-Benz Financial, GM Financial, and World Omni Financial (Southeast Toyota Distributors' main lender) - successfully retained more than half their customers returning to market. But three years later, those numbers had dropped dramatically, with only GM Financial managing to keep even half of its customers, according to analysis from S&amp;P Global Mobility AutoCreditInsight and TransUnion.Story continuesEven the captive that topped the 2019 chart — BMW Financial Services — managed to retain just 45.0% of returning customers, when new-vehicle lease and loan numbers were combined, according to S&amp;P Global Mobility AutoCreditInsight and TransUnion. Following GM Financial were Southeast Toyota Finance, then BMW Financial and Ford Motor Credit.Ten Captives with Highest Financial Institution LoyaltyLender Name2019 Loyaty Rate2022 Loyalty RateTESLA LEASING35.9 %54.0 %GM FINANCIAL55.9 %51.6 %SOUTHEAST TOYOTA FINANCE54.7 %48.7 %BMW FINANCIAL SERVICES59.6 %45.0 %FORD MOTOR CREDIT COMPANY49.3 %45.0 %TOYOTA FINANCIAL SERVICES51.2 %44.4 %LINCOLN AUTOMOTIVE FINANCIAL40.4 %44.4 %AMERICAN HONDA FINANCE CORP57.6 %43.5 %NISSAN MOTOR ACCEPTANCE CORP50.3 %43.5 %HYUNDAI FINANCIAL SERVICES49.7 %42.4 %Time periods: 2019 and 2022 calendar yearsData sorted based on 2022 CY resultsSource: S&amp;P Global Mobility – AutoCreditInsight with TransUnion®Although Tesla Leasing had a 54% loyalty to technically lead the pack, in 2022 its return-to-market volume vastly trailed that of more-established captives. (S&amp;P Global Mobility's methodology for loyalty to the financial institution measures households that returned to market and whether they returned to the same lending institution.)Meanwhile, Mercedes-Benz Financial, which was second to BMW Financial in the calendar 2019 loyalty scores at 57.5%, dropped out of the top 10 in calendar 2022 at 39.4%.When asked for an explanation for their decline, a Mercedes-Benz Financial spokesperson said, ""Leasing has decreased since the pandemic throughout the premium auto segment. Increases in lease customers' equity in their vehicles led to a large number of lease buyouts in 2022, and increased interest rates led to a high number of cash purchases. Both factors contributed to lower lease levels than in previous years. On the financing side, higher interest rates have also led to increased competition from traditional lenders, in particular credit unions and regional banks.""While all the major captives saw loyalty levels drop between calendar 2019 and 2022, some non-captives achieved gains - albeit with a far smaller return-to-market basis.Some of the big gainers were Navy FCU and USAA Federal Savings Bank. But the largest of the Top 10 non-captive lenders, JPMorgan Chase, saw its 2019 loyalty rate fall from 37.9% to 26.1% in calendar 2022. The leader in loyalty, the SchoolsFirst FCU representing California teachers, is a smaller player - which could have seen its dramatic swing having little to do with macro conditions.Ten Non-Captives with Highest Financial Institution Loyalty*Lender NameLoyalty Rate 2019Loyalty Rate 2022SCHOOLSFIRST FCU40.5 %55.8 %NAVY FCU30.5 %41.9 %SUNCOAST CREDIT UNION30.6 %34.0 %STATE ECU30.0 %33.8 %USAA FEDERAL SAVINGS BANK30.1 %32.6 %AMERICA FIRST CU26.5 %30.7 %JPMORGAN CHASE37.9 %26.1 %CREDIT UNION LEASING14.8 %25.7 %SPACE COAST CU20.1 %24.9 %MID FLORIDA CU19.5 %20.5 %*Based on top 35 Lenders, which represents 70% of CY 2022 total RTM count (7,525 lenders in total)Time periods: 2022 and 2019 calendar yearsData sorted based on 2022 CY resultsSource: S&amp;P Global Mobility – AutoCreditInsight with TransUnion®""Captive finance companies command the leasing market because they are able to more accurately forecast residual values,"" Libby said. Pre-pandemic, the captives were able to artificially inflate residuals, making leasing a more attractive option for discount-conscious consumers, particularly among luxury brands. But as inventories shrank, that advantage faded.Indeed, the rate of leasing dropped sharply downward - from 30% penetration in 2019 to just 18% in 2022, as more customers resorted to borrowing or paying cash for new vehicles, according to S&amp;P Global Mobility AutoCreditInsight data with TransUnion.""The whole leasing business cratered because there were no longer any incentives,"" Libby said. ""Basically, the dealers have had a huge amount of leverage because of the imbalance between supply and demand. That affected the lease-loans ratio to a huge extent.""While leasing penetration skidded, loyalty to finance institutions on the leasing side declined from 56.9% in 2019 to 52.6% in 2022, according to S&amp;P Global Mobility AutoCreditInsight data. Loyalty on the loan side dropped from 22.9% to 21.9%. One caveat, Libby noted: ""When a lease customer switches to a loan, that decreases loyalty since lessees in general are more loyal than owners.""There were bright spots on the lease loyalty side in 2022. Both GM Financial and Ford Motor Credit Co. stood out, retaining 69.5% and 67.8% of returning lease customers respectively.But as leasing slipped, the loan market grew hypercompetitive, Libby said: ""Only one out of every five customers who return with a loan will go back to the same financial institution. That points out how incredibly competitive the loan market is. The independent banks are doing whatever it takes to get the business.""World Omni Financial Corp. was best at retaining its loan customers with 44.0% loyalty in 2022, while the Navy FCU and Toyota Financial Services were the only other two institutions that kept better than one-in-three loan customers loyal.Finance institutions are fully aware of the comparative lack of loyalty on the loan side. Said Libby: ""It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. Because they realize the customer is so likely to switch, they'll be exceptionally aggressive to get the business.""As pandemic disruptions have diminished, there are signs the market is shifting back toward some semblance of balance. Leasing penetration has crept back up to 20% for the first four months of 2023, but it's still a far cry from where it was before the bottom dropped out of the market.About S&amp;P Global Mobility At S&amp;P Global Mobility, we provide invaluable insights derived from unmatched automotive data, enabling our customers to anticipate change and make decisions with conviction.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 27. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis independent ratings and analytics provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.11 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +10.7%.Revenues are expected to be $3.06 billion, up 2.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.21% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for S&amp;P Global?For S&amp;P Global, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.58%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that S&amp;P Global will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that S&amp;P Global would post earnings of $2.92 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.15, delivering a surprise of +7.88%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.S&amp;P Global appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Business - Information Services industry, TransUnion (TRU), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.83 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -15.3%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $958.01 million, up 1% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for TransUnion has been revised 0.2% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.03%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that TransUnion will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.53%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that MasterCard will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that MasterCard would post earnings of $2.71 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.80, delivering a surprise of +3.32%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.MasterCard doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

160,ca8db6d1-f8f3-37f4-94e5-1c4f3128edd8,QCOM,2023-07-21,QUALCOMM Insiders Sold US$1.9m Of Shares Suggesting Hesitancy,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qualcomm-insiders-sold-us-1-110040820.html,1689937240,STORY,['QCOM'],"[Over the past year, many QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for QUALCOMM QUALCOMM Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Chief Technology Officer of Qualcomm Technologies, James Thompson, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.3m worth of shares at a price of US$132 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$121. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.QUALCOMM insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insider Ownership Of QUALCOMMMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. QUALCOMM insiders own 0.1% of the company, currently worth about US$162m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About QUALCOMM Insiders?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the QUALCOMM insiders selling. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for QUALCOMM (of which 1 is significant!) you should know about.But note: QUALCOMM may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the global economic dynamics and trends for the future, and head over directly to the 10 Largest Economies in the World Ranked by PPP.Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the market value of all goods and services produced in a country within a given time frame. In our previous article, 50 Largest Economies in the World in 2023, we ranked the largest economies based on their nominal GDP, a metric that accounts for current market value of a country’s output. On the other hand, GDP based on purchasing power parity, or PPP, measures the value of goods and services produced in a country with respect to another country’s currency – usually the US Dollar. The GDP based on PPP metric is widely used to gauge differences of economic productivity that exist between countries.While the United States is the largest economy in the world in terms of nominal GDP, it is China which takes the number spot when ranked in terms of PPP. The United Nations has projected the world economy to grow by 2.3% in 2023. The United States economy is expected to grow 1.1% this year, in contrast to China’s GDP which is projected to expand by over 5%. Hopes of Europe’s economic recovery from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic remain dim amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. European economies, on average, are forecasted to grow by a mere 0.9% this year.Economic experts have dubbed the 21st century as Asia’s century. According to forecasts made by the PricewaterhouseCoopers International Limited (PwC), the global GDP will grow 130% between 2016 and 2050. China alone will hold one-fifth of the share of the world’s GDP in terms of PPP by 2050, while India is tipped to surpass the United States to rank 2nd. You can read more about how the global economic order will shape up in the coming decades in our article, 20 Largest Economies in the World by 2050.Story continuesThe McKinsey Global Institute highlighted in a report the impact that corporations have on the world economy. The findings state that about 72% of GDP in OECD member nations was contributed by the business sector. A major chunk of this percentage came from corporations that have more than $1 billion in annual revenue. Publicly listed companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) have played a significant role in enabling the status of the United States as a global economic power.Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s revenue of $394 billion in 2022 was higher than the GDP of many countries in the world. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is one of the largest defense companies in the world that provides sophisticated technological weapons to militaries around the globe, which helps inject money into the national economy. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s profits in the first quarter of 2023 ($18.3 billion, or $2.45 per share) are already 9% higher than the same period last year.Since the last few years, a number of large western corporations have begun shifting their operations to Asia due to cheap labor and to tap into the large Asian markets. 95% of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s high-end products such as the iPhone, iPad, and Macbook are made in China. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) too has established data centers in several Asian countries – one of them in Indonesia, which the company expects will increase its revenues by $6 billion.Asian corporations themselves contribute heavily to the global economy – at an average of $19 trillion each year. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) are some of the prominent Asian companies to have made a mark on the global stage.Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is one of the world’s largest e-commerce companies, holding a major share in China’s retail and wholesale markets. The group had a revenue exceeding $30 billion in the first quarter of 2023. On the other hand, Japanese car manufacturer Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) contributes 11.5% share of the world’s annual automobile output. In the global foundry industry, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) accounts for nearly 60% of all production. Let's now head over to the list of the biggest economies in purchasing power parity.MethodologyWe have used GDP based on PPP for countries to rank the 50 largest economies in the world.

PHM is scheduled to report second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 25, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings per share (EPS) and revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 32% and 9.4%, respectively. Adjusted EPS and revenues increased 28.4% and 13.5% on a year-over-year basis, respectively.Notably, PHM surpassed earnings estimates in 23 of the trailing 26 quarters.Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings has increased to $2.45 from $2.41 per share over the past 60 days. The estimated figure indicates a 10.3% decrease from the year-ago earnings of $2.73 per share. Also, the consensus mark for revenues is $3.96 million, suggesting 0.8% year-over-year growth.PulteGroup, Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePulteGroup, Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePulteGroup, Inc. price-eps-surprise | PulteGroup, Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteLow-existing homes for sale have been driving demand for new homes in the market. Although this tailwind is likely to have helped the company to post sequentially higher revenues in the quarter, rising mortgage rates will impact the year-over-year comparison.Overall, the uncertain economic scenario, material cost inflation and higher wages are making the U.S. housing market less affordable. The company’s earnings and revenues are expected to have reflected the above-mentioned headwinds.Nonetheless, PulteGroup’s execution of initiatives to boost profitability, with a focus on entry-level homes, prudent land investment strategy and affordable product offerings, are expected to have offset the negatives to some extent.PulteGroup expects home deliveries to be within 7,000-7,400 homes compared with 7,177 homes delivered a year ago. Our model predicts deliveries to decline 2.1% year over year to 7,026 units.PHM expects a higher average selling price or ASP for the quarter in the range of $525,000-$535,000 compared with the year-ago level of $531,000. Our model predicts the ASP of homes delivered to inch up 0.7% year over year to $534,600.We expect the Homebuilding revenues to decrease 0.2% to $3.79 billion from $3.8 billion a year ago due to lower deliveries.From the margin perspective, input cost inflation and high costs associated with labor and transportation are expected to have weighed on margins to some extent. That said, higher pricing and prudent cost-saving efforts might have partly mitigated the risks.The company expects homebuilding gross margins to contract in the range of 27.5%-28% for second-quarter 2023 from 30.9% reported in the year-ago period. Although construction costs remain elevated otherwise, the gross margin of the quarter is likely to have reflected the benefits of lower lumber costs that are flowing through PHM’s operations. Our model predicts homebuilding gross margins to be 27.6% for the quarter, down from the year-ago period.The company anticipates SG&amp;A (as a percentage of home sales revenues) to be in the range of 9-9.5% versus 9.2% in the prior-year quarter. Our model predicts homebuilding SG&amp;A expenses to be 9.5% for the quarter, up from the year-ago level.Meanwhile, we expect the company’s new orders to increase 9.4% year over year to 7,019 units in the quarter.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for PulteGroup for the quarter to be reported. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

172,1a7503ef-e740-3298-842f-9ea7542d77c4,BAX,2023-07-21,Earnings Preview: Baxter International (BAX) Q2 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-baxter-international-bax-140207136.html,1689861727,STORY,['BAX'],"[Baxter International (BAX) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 27. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis drug and medical device maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.59 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -32.2%.Revenues are expected to be $3.79 billion, up 1.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Baxter?For Baxter, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -15.83%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Baxter will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Baxter would post earnings of $0.48 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.59, delivering a surprise of +22.92%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Baxter doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

I am now pleased to turn the call over to Joaquin.Story continuesJoaquin DuatoThank you, Jess, and good morning, everyone. This was a strong quarter for Johnson &amp; Johnson with market-leading performance, important advances across our innovative Pharmaceutical and MedTech pipelines and a successful initial public offering of Kenvue. We delivered solid sales and earnings growth for the second quarter of 2023, reporting operational sales of 7.5% and adjusted operational EPS growth of 9.7%. These strong results contributed to our confidence in raising our expectations for this year. You may have seen this morning the announcement that we intend to split up Kenvue shares through an exchange offer as the next step in the separation of Kenvue. Joe will provide additional information later in the call. We're excited about entering a new era for Johnson &amp; Johnson, one built around science, innovation and technology and strategically focused on Pharmaceutical and MedTech while maintaining our position as the world's largest, most diversified health care products company with 25 platforms over $1 billion in annual sales. And on today's call, I would like to share recent highlights and achievements from across the business that have contributed to our year-to-date results as well as upcoming catalysts that give me great confidence in our near- and long-term future performance. Starting with MedTech. For the second quarter of 2023, we generated 14.7% operational and 9.9% adjusted operational growth, which excludes the impact of the Abiomed acquisition. On a pro forma basis, using sales publicly reported by Abiomed prior to our acquisition, MedTech grew 10.2%. These strong results continue to show that our efforts to improve the growth of the MedTech business are working. Q2 highlights in electrophysiology include the publication of clinical data supporting the safety and effectiveness of QDOT, our newest ablation catheter for atrial fibrillation. In fact, this study demonstrated a clinical success rate of 86% as well as achieving shorter procedure and fluoroscopy times than ablation with conventional catheters. I'm also happy to share that this month, we completed enrollment in the third clinical study evaluating our pulsed field ablation solutions. The SmartfIRE study evaluates our dual-energy catheter, which enables physicians to instantly switch energy source, whether radio frequency or pulsed field, based on patient needs. The Abiomed integration continues to deliver against planned milestones and is on track across all areas and regions with no disruption to commercial activities or pipeline progression. Second quarter sales of $331 million, compared to Abiomed's publicly reported sales in the same period last year as a standalone company, reflects approximately 20% growth. We also continue to see strong enrollment in the ongoing pivotal clinical trials, which aim to expand the use of our products into new patient populations. We anticipate that heart recovery will become a significant multiyear growth platform for Johnson &amp; Johnson. In Orthopaedics, the VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution is poised for further acceleration, having recently received CE and CA Mark international approvals. In Surgery, we are pleased with our progression on Ottava, our next-generation soft tissue surgical robotic system. And we look forward to providing an investor update later in the year. In Vision, we recently launched products, such as ACUVUE OASYS MAX and TECNIS Eyhance. And we are performing very well across both contact lenses and surgical vision. Now turning to Pharmaceuticals. In the second quarter of the year, we delivered above-market operational growth of 6.2%, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine. Of note, our multiple myeloma portfolio has grown more than 30% year-on-year, which includes the acceleration of our newly launched products, CARVYKTI and TECVAYLI. These new launches, along with SPRAVATO, are performing very well and are expected to be important contributors to achieving our 2025 sales target. We also achieved important regulatory and operational milestones, including multiple readouts from our pipeline. A few things I'm particularly excited by include, first, the receipt of fast-track designation from the U.S. FDA for all 3 prospective indications for milvexian, our Factor XI oral anticoagulant in partnership with Bristol-Myers Squibb, which has the potential to treat a broader set of patients, such as those who currently have limited therapeutic options due to bleeding risk. Second, recent submission of a supplemental BLA for CARVYKTI to the FDA and European Commission, supported by data from the CARTITUDE-4 study, seeking approval for a new earlier indication in treating relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Third, the presentation of initial TAR-200 data from the SunRISe-1 study in bladder cancer at the American Urological Association Meeting. And finally, we announced positive top line results from the Phase III PAPILLON study evaluating RYBREVANT in combination with chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer with exon 20 insertion mutations. This is the first of several ongoing pivotal Phase III studies to read out for RYBREVANT-based regimens in EGFR-mutated lung cancer. In addition, I want to highlight the Phase II study data that we presented earlier this month at the World Congress of Dermatology for JNJ-2113, our novel oral IL-23 receptor antagonist peptide in psoriasis. The finding suggests that JNJ-2113 has broad potential across the spectrum of IL-23-mediated diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease. We are already advancing into Phase III in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and initiating a Phase IIb in ulcerative colitis. And we will continue to assess additional opportunities. We are very excited about the potential of this asset and believe it represents a $1 billion-plus commercial opportunity. We also continue to defend the intellectual property associated with our medicines, including STELARA. In fact, we have reached settlements regarding our STELARA IP with both Amgen and Alvotech. We expect Amgen to launch in the U.S. on January 1, 2025, and Alvotech to launch in the U.S. on February 21, 2025. In all, our Pharmaceutical business delivered very strong results. Our pipeline is progressing well, and we continue to be confident in meeting our 2025 target of $57 billion. We are excited to enter the back half of the year from a position of strength, and we have high expectations as we evolve to a 2-sector Johnson &amp; Johnson with a higher growth profile. I am now pleased to turn the call over to Jess to review our financial results in more detail. Jess?Jessica MooreThanks, Joaquin. As a reminder, on May 8, 2023, Kenvue Inc. closed its initial public offering. Johnson &amp; Johnson continues to own 89.6% of total outstanding shares of Kenvue's common stock and remains the majority shareholder. Therefore, the following financial results continue to include the Consumer Health business, with the 10.4% of Consumer Health net earnings no longer attributed to Johnson &amp; Johnson being adjusted for in other income and expense from the date of the IPO through the end of the quarter. Starting with Q2 2023 sales results. Worldwide sales were $25.5 billion for the second quarter of 2023, an increase of 6.3% versus the second quarter of 2022. Operational sales growth, which excludes the effect of translational currency, increased 7.5% as currency had a negative impact of 1.2 points. In the U.S., sales increased 10.2%. In regions outside the U.S., our reported growth was 2.2%. Operational sales growth outside the U.S. was 4.7% with currency negatively impacting our reported OUS results by 2.5 points. Operational sales in Europe were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 vaccine and loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 6.2% worldwide, 8% in the U.S. and 4.4% outside the U.S. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $5.1 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $1.96 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.80 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $7.4 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.80, representing increases of 6.5% and 8.1%, respectively, compared to the second quarter of 2022. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 9.7%. I will now comment on business segment sales performance highlights. Unless otherwise stated, percentages quoted represent the operational sales change in comparison to the second quarter of 2022 and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. Beginning with the Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales of $13.7 billion increased 3.1% with growth of 9.2% in the U.S. and a decline of 4% outside the U.S. Operational sales growth increased 3.8% as currency had a negative impact of 0.7 points. Excluding COVID-19 vaccine sales, worldwide operational sales growth was 6.2% with growth of 9.9% in the U.S. and growth of 1.5% outside the U.S. Sales outside the U.S., excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, were negatively impacted by approximately 500 basis points due to the loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA in Europe. Pharmaceutical growth was driven by our key brands and continued uptake in our recently launched products, with 9 assets delivering double-digit growth. We continue to drive strong sales growth for both DARZALEX and ERLEADA, with increases of 23.4% and 26.9%, respectively. STELARA grew 8%, driven by market growth and IBD share gains in the U.S., partially offset by unfavorable patient mix and increased rebates. TREMFYA grew 18.9%, driven by market growth and share gains in the U.S., partially offset by unfavorable patient mix. Growth of 16.5% in pulmonary hypertension was driven by favorable patient mix, share gains in the U.S. and market growth. Turning to newly launched products. We continue to make progress on our launch of CARVYKTI and continue to expand access and reimbursement for SPRAVATO. We are also encouraged by the early success of our launch of TECVAYLI, sales of which are included in other oncology. Total Pharmaceutical sales growth was partially offset by the loss of exclusivity in REMICADE and ZYTIGA, along with a decrease in IMBRUVICA sales due to competitive pressures. IMBRUVICA maintains its market leadership position worldwide. I will now turn your attention to the MedTech segment. Worldwide MedTech sales of $7.8 billion increased 12.9% with growth of 14.6% in the U.S. and 11.3% outside of the U.S. Operational sales growth increased 14.7% as currency had a negative impact of 1.8 points. Abiomed contributed 4.8% to operational growth. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide adjusted operational sales growth was 9.9%. Sales in the second quarter accelerated sequentially from Q1 for all MedTech businesses, driven by global procedure growth, recovery in China, continued uptake of recently launched products and commercial execution. Partially offsetting growth in the quarter was the impact of volume-based procurement in China as well as supply constraints. The Interventional Solutions franchise delivered operational growth of 56.9%, which includes $331 million related to Abiomed. Electrophysiology is a major contributor to the growth with a double-digit increase of 25.9%. This reflects strong growth in all regions, including Europe, driven by our comprehensive portfolio, including the most recently launched QDOT RS Catheter. Orthopaedics operational growth of 5.7% reflects strong procedure recovery, success of recently launched products, such as the INHANCE shoulder portfolio as well as global expansion of our digital solutions, such as VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution. Growth was partially offset by the impact of volume-based procurement in China and continued supply challenges primarily in hips. Operational growth of 8.4% in Surgery was driven primarily by procedure recovery and strength of our biosurgery and wound closure portfolios. Growth was partially offset by the impacts of volume-based procurement in China and supply challenges. Global growth of 6.9% in Vision was driven by price actions in contact lenses and other as well as strength of new products, including ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products and contact lenses; and TECNIS Eyhance, our monofocal intraocular lens in surgical vision. Growth of contact lenses was partially offset by strategic portfolio choices and supply challenges, although these continue to improve. Moving to the Consumer Health segment. Worldwide Consumer Health sales of $4 billion increased 5.4% with growth of 6% in the U.S. and 5% outside the U.S. Operational sales growth increased 7.7% as currency had a negative impact of 2.3 points. Sales in the second quarter accelerated sequentially from Q1 for all Consumer Health franchises primarily driven by strategic price increases and growth in OTC globally due to strong pain performance and cold, cough and flu season. Excluding the impact of strategic portfolio decisions and sales of personal care products in Russia, volume across all consumer franchises was relatively flat on strong price actions. For more detailed information, please visit investors.kenvue.com. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the second quarter of 2023, I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold leveraged by 80 basis points, primarily driven by favorable patient mix and lower COVID-19 vaccine supply network-related costs in the Pharmaceutical business, partially offset by commodity inflation in the Consumer and MedTech businesses. Selling, marketing and administrative margins deleveraged 20 basis points, driven by incremental costs to support the standalone Consumer Health business, partially offset by proactive management of costs. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, investing 15% of sales this quarter. The $3.8 billion invested was a 3.4% increase versus the prior year. The other income and expense line was income of $60 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared to an expense of $273 million in the second quarter of 2022. This was primarily driven by favorable litigation settlements, lower litigation expense and lower unrealized losses on securities; partially offset by higher COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing exit-related costs; and as previously mentioned, the 10.4% of Consumer Health earnings that are no longer attributable to Johnson &amp; Johnson, which resulted in a $37 million reduction in consolidated earnings. Regarding taxes in the quarter. Our effective tax rate was 23.9% versus 17.6% in the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by 2023 tax costs incurred as part of the planned separation of the Consumer Health business due to the internal reorganization of certain international subsidiaries. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 16.6% versus 15.4% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming second quarter 10-Q filing for additional details on specific tax matters. Lastly, I'll direct your attention to the boxed section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the second quarter of 2023, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales increased from 34% to 34.6%, primarily driven by favorable product and patient mix, partially offset by unfavorable segment mix and commodity inflation. Pharmaceutical margins improved from 42% to 42.7%, primarily driven by favorable patient mix; sales, marketing and administrative expense leverage and R&amp;D portfolio prioritization; partially offset by higher milestone payments. MedTech margins improved from 26.5% to 28.6%, driven by favorable intellectual property-related litigation settlements and cost management initiatives, partially offset by commodity inflation. Finally, Consumer Health margins declined from 25.9% to 23.5% due to incremental cost to support the standalone Consumer Health business, foreign exchange impacts and commodity inflation, partially offset by supply chain efficiencies. It is important to highlight that the adjusted income before tax for the Consumer Health business as reported by Johnson &amp; Johnson differs from the financial results reported by Kenvue Inc. this morning. The difference is primarily driven by incremental costs required to run Kenvue as an independent company. Additional differences also exist on an after-tax basis due to the application of different tax rates. This concludes the sales and earnings portion of the Johnson &amp; Johnson second quarter results. I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Joe Wolk. Joe?Joseph J. WolkThank you, Jessica, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. As previously shared, we reported particularly strong results across all segments for the second quarter and the first half of 2023. During the second quarter, adjusted operational sales growth by Pharmaceuticals, excluding COVID-19 revenue, accelerated 6.2% over the first quarter of 2023. Similarly, on a sequential basis, MedTech operational sales increased 4.5% over an already strong first quarter. During the first half of the year, we executed against our long-term business strategy and achieved key clinical and regulatory milestones. These advancements provide a strong foundation for long-term growth and are a testament to the hard work and dedication of our talented colleagues around the world. We also made considerable progress toward the separation of Kenvue. On May 8, as partial consideration for the transfer of the Consumer Health business, Kenvue paid $13.2 billion to Johnson &amp; Johnson from the net proceeds of the initial public offering and debt financing transactions in connection with the separation. Today, we were pleased to announce an update on our next step toward the separation of Kenvue. Subject to market conditions, our intention is to split off Kenvue shares through an exchange offer as our next step in the separation. As part of the proposed exchange offer, Johnson &amp; Johnson shareholders will have the choice to exchange all, some or none of their shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson common stock for shares of Kenvue common stock subject to the terms of an offer. We believe a split-off is the most advantageous form of separation for Johnson &amp; Johnson, Kenvue and our shareholders. Specifically, an exchange offer provides Johnson &amp; Johnson the potential opportunity to acquire a large number of outstanding shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson common stock at one time in a tax-free manner for U.S. federal income tax purposes without reducing overall cash or future financial flexibility. Further, following the completion of the exchange offer, Kenvue would most likely have a shareholder base that would have made the election to own its shares. The exact timing of our decision to launch an exchange offer will, as stated earlier, depend on market conditions. But the launch of the tender could occur as early as the coming days. Offer terms for the exchange, inclusive of applicable discounts, as well as the duration of the exchange tender period, would be set upon launch. We understand that you may have questions on this process. At this point, there are no additional details about the contemplated split-off to share, but we are committed to providing timely updates as appropriate. Let's now turn to cash and capital allocation. We ended the second quarter with approximately $29 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $46 billion of debt for a net debt position of $17 billion, inclusive of approximately $7 billion of Kenvue net debt. Free cash flow through the second quarter was approximately $5.4 billion compared to $8.1 billion in the prior year. The second quarter reflects elevated tax payments of approximately $2 billion related to TCJA and past audit-related matters. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged, with continued investment in our business being the highest priority to drive new and better solutions for patients, followed by dividends increasing on an annual basis, adding strategic opportunities for inorganic growth and share repurchases when attractive. Our R&amp;D investment in the first half of 2023 was $7.4 billion or approximately 15% of sales. This includes external investments, such as our recently announced partnership with Cellular Biomedicine Group on 2 next-generation CAR-Ts for the treatment of B-cell malignancies, further broadening our cell therapy portfolio. In April, we announced our 61st consecutive year of dividend increases. And in combination with the completion of our $5 billion share repurchase program authorized by the Board in September of 2022 and completed earlier this year, we returned $8.5 billion to shareholders in the first half of 2023. Let's discuss our outlook for the balance of 2023. Before I get into the specifics of guidance, in light of the potential Kenvue split-off transaction, I will remind you that our updated full year guidance today continues to include results from the Consumer Health business, given Johnson &amp; Johnson remains the majority shareholder of Kenvue. I suspect you already know this, but it would not be accurate to subtract any guidance provided separately by Kenvue from total Johnson &amp; Johnson guidance and assume that the resulting total reflects guidance for the new Johnson &amp; Johnson. When Johnson &amp; Johnson is no longer the majority shareholder of Kenvue, we will provide timely updated new Johnson &amp; Johnson guidance that will reflect, among other things, the removal of Consumer Health's current contribution to Johnson &amp; Johnson's performance as well as any updates to Johnson &amp; Johnson's outstanding share count. So with that context, moving on to our full year guidance. Based on the strong results delivered in the quarter, like we did in April, we are again raising full year operational sales and EPS guidance despite some strategic items not accretive to EPS as detailed on this schedule. Specifically, the lost income related to the approximate 10% noncontrolling interest in Kenvue and the acquired in-process research and development costs related to our investment in Cellular Biomedicine Group. We now expect operational sales growth for the full year 2023 to be in the range of 7% to 8% or up $1.4 billion in the range of $99.3 billion to $100.3 billion on a constant currency basis, and adjusted operational sales growth in the range of 6% to 7%. As you know, we don't speculate on future currency movements. Last quarter, we noted that we utilized the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar at $1.10. The euro spot rate as of mid-last week remains at $1.10. However, the U.S. dollar has strengthened versus other select currencies, such as the won and the yen. As such, we now estimate a negative impact of foreign currency translation of approximately 500 basis points, resulting in estimated reported sales growth between 6.5% to 7.5% compared to 2022 with a midpoint of $99.3 billion. Regarding other lines on the P&amp;L. We now anticipate a slight improvement to our adjusted pretax operating margin driven by expense management. We have reduced our other income estimate to be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion, primarily related to the company's 10.4% noncontrolling interest in Kenvue. Regarding interest income and expense. We now anticipate a reduction of net interest expense to the range of $150 million to $250 million due to interest income on the net proceeds linked to the Kenvue separation. And finally, based on current tax law, we are maintaining our effective tax rate estimate in the range of 15.5% to 16.5%. These changes result in us increasing our adjusted operational earnings per share guidance by $0.10 per share to a range of $10.60 to $10.70 or $10.65 at the midpoint on a constant currency basis, constant currency growth of 5% at the midpoint. While not predicting the impact of currency movements, assuming recent exchange rates I previously referenced, our reported adjusted earnings per share for the year assumes no additional foreign exchange impact. As such, our reported adjusted earnings per share for the year increases by $0.10 per share to a range of $10.70 to $10.80 or $10.75 at the midpoint, reflecting growth of 6% at the midpoint. While we do not provide guidance by segment or on a quarterly basis, let me offer some qualitative considerations to support your modeling. In MedTech, we continue to anticipate stable procedure volumes and health care staffing levels in the back half of the year with normal seasonality. We expect continued competitive performance attributable to commercial execution, recently launched products and improvement in supply. Headwinds from volume-based procurement in China as well as potential impacts from international sanctions in Russia are expected to be higher in the second half than the first half of the year. In Pharmaceuticals, we continue to expect to deliver our 12th consecutive year of above-market growth in 2023, driven by key assets and continued uptick of our newly launched products. We expect continued strong growth in the back half of the year slightly higher than the first half. When modeling Consumer Health growth rates in 2023, it's important to take into consideration prior year comparisons with lapping price increases in the back half of the year. Given the strong momentum in our Pharmaceutical business and the upcoming clinical milestones mentioned earlier, we remain very confident in our ability to meet our 2025 Pharmaceutical sales target of $57 billion. Looking ahead, we have many important catalysts for the remainder of the year that can drive meaningful near- and long-term value. Beyond the separation, in the near term, we are continuing to drive performance in MedTech, with better commercial execution and recently launched innovative products being a significant factor in driving the continued higher growth trajectory across the MedTech business. Many of the solutions mentioned are early in their commercialization, which means there is still significant opportunity ahead. For example, in electrophysiology, we are excited to begin the commercialization of the QDOT microcatheter in the U.S. during the second half of this year. In Orthopaedics, the VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution recently received regulatory approvals in Europe, and we plan to launch it in key European countries by the end of this year. And in Vision, we are seeing the benefits of our recently launched innovations, such as ACUVUE OASYS MAX 1-Day multifocal, which is driving Johnson &amp; Johnson's market share growth in the large and growing presbyopia market. We look forward to continued growth from this and other recent Vision launches. Related to our Pharmaceutical business. We are excited about upcoming advancements in our pipeline with a number of important regulatory and clinical milestones for our key future assets, including on the regulatory front, there is expected approval of talquetamab in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Clinically, we expect Phase III data for TREMFYA for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the results of the MARIPOSA study of RYBREVANT plus lazertinib in frontline non-small cell lung cancer with the opportunity to potentially present that data at an upcoming major medical meeting, Phase I data for TAR-210 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and Phase II data for nipocalimab in rheumatoid arthritis. A couple of other items to highlight. In case you missed them, we recently published our Health for Humanity Report, our U.S. Pharmaceutical Pricing Transparency Report and our U.S. Patent Table, all of which can be found on our website. Also a reminder that we will be hosting an enterprise business review featuring both Pharmaceutical and MedTech at the New York Stock Exchange on December 5. I'll conclude my prepared remarks by reiterating that we have had a strong first half of the year both financially and operationally, and we expect to continue to build upon that momentum in the second half of this year. With that, I will now turn the call over to Erik Haas.Erik HaasThank you, Joe. On Tuesday, July 18 in the case of Valdez v Johnson &amp; Johnson, a jury in Alameda County, California ruled in favor of the plaintiff on his talc product liability claims. We intend to pursue an appeal based on the erroneous rulings by the trial judge that prevented us from sharing with the jury critical facts that demonstrate that plaintiff's exceedingly rare form of mesothelioma was not caused by baby powder. Without the benefit of that evidence, the jury rendered a verdict that is irreconcilable with the decades of independent scientific evaluations confirming Johnson's Baby Powder is safe, does not contain asbestos and does not cause cancer. The research, clinical evidence in over 40 years of studies by independent medical experts around the world continue to support the safety of our cosmetic talc. The verdict award will not be paid while the bankruptcy proceeding continues, and this decision has absolutely no impact on that process, which has the support of lawyers representing the majority of claimants. We remain focused on all claimants having the opportunity to vote and decide for themselves on our plan to compensate them in a timely and efficient manner. Looking ahead with respect to the bankruptcy refiling by LTL. The bankruptcy judge is expected to rule by August 2 on the motion to dismiss hearing that took place in the last week of June. In addition, a hearing on the motion for LTL's proposed reorganization plan and voting procedures process and the path forward is scheduled for August 22. As we previously stated, Johnson &amp; Johnson stands by its position that its talcum products are safe, as confirmed decades of numerous independent scientific tests and studies. I would now like to hand the call back over to Jess.Jessica MooreThanks, Erik. This concludes the prepared remarks section of our call. I will now turn the discussion over to the Q&amp;A portion of the call. Kevin, can you please provide instructions for those wishing to ask a question?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.Lawrence H. BiegelsenCongratulations on another strong quarter here. For Erik, if Judge Kaplan dismisses the bankruptcy proposal, what's the backup settlement in mind that would proceed outside of bankruptcy that could ring-fence the cost? And Joe or Joaquin, in MedTech, how are you thinking about the sustainability of the first half strength where you grew 8% organic? Do you still expect the MedTech market to grow 5% to 7% this year? With J&amp;J in that range, it seems conservative.Erik HaasLarry, it's Erik. Thanks for the question. If Judge Kaplan dismisses the bankruptcy, we will be back in the tort system. And in that scenario, we intend to fight the claims aggressively. And indeed, based upon the indicated decades of scientific support for the safety of our talc products, the fact that our talc products do not contain asbestos and the fact that our talc products do not cause cancer, we feel very confident in our ability to continue to prevail in the vast majority of claims as we have done in the past in the tort system.Joaquin DuatoThank you, Larry, and thank you for complimenting us on the results on the first quarter and also on the MedTech ones. When it comes to the MedTech results, the growth in the first half of the year was north of 8%. So this is a continuation of the sustained improvement in our performance that we have had in the last couple of years in which we have grown at or above our competitive composite. When we think about the dynamics that are driving our growth, which are multiple, one is the recovery in the overall market procedures, which is helping; our improved commercial execution; and very especially, the cadence and flow of new product launches that we are having in the market, we see our trajectory in MedTech in the first half of the year continuing second half of the year. So we expect a similar trajectory for MedTech in the second half of the year.Joseph J. WolkYes, Larry, maybe I might just add to Joaquin's comments. The only thing that is limiting the growth, I would say in the back half of the year, is China volume-based pricing as well as some international sanctions in Russia. But those are already incorporated into our outlook for the balance of 2023. So we feel we have those well in hand. If there's a little bit of abatement on either of those fronts, it portends well for the future.OperatorNext question is coming from Vamil Divan from Guggenheim Securities.Vamil Kishore DivanSo maybe just one on the guidance commentary. So I appreciate what you said around the Kenvue and Cellular Biomedicine dynamics. But I'm curious about STELARA. Because you have the 2 settlements now, I don't think there's any chance for having a biosimilar enter this year. And I think before, you had expected that. So I'm curious what your expectations are now in terms of biosimilar entry before Amgen. And how does that impact sort of your guidance expectation for this year? And if you want to comment on sort of next year or sort of how it might impact 2025 with the $57 billion there. And then one also, the other one if I could, just on MARIPOSA. We've been getting a lot of questions just sort of what's changed there. I know before, the study is supposed to end next year. We obviously heard about the interim on your last earnings call. But then in the last few weeks, it sounds like there's a chance we'll get the data sooner this year than you may have [well] present it. So kind of what's changed from April to now to give you a sense that the data may come a little bit earlier and give you a chance to present it this year?Joseph J. WolkThanks for the questions, Vamil. I'll start with STELARA and then see if Erik can add anything from a legal perspective, and then we'll hand it over to Joaquin for your question on the MARIPOSA study. With respect to STELARA, this year, there won't be a significant impact. As you can imagine, most of that business was contracted for the full year about this time last year. So there really wasn't any material impact. And our current assumption, based on some of the agreements you read about, similar to what we've said previously, is that we wouldn't expect anything before January 1, 2025. I don't know, Erik, from a legal perspective, anything to add?Erik HaasYes. Thanks, Joe. From a litigation perspective, I could say that no other biosimilar is better positioned in our view than Amgen or Alvotech would be. So we would not anticipate any other biosimilar having the opportunity or ability to enter the market before those 2.Joaquin DuatoThank you. And with respect to MARIPOSA, nothing has changed. We -- this is an event-driven study with a final analysis expected, as we said, by the end of 2023 with a potential to be presented at a major medical meeting in 2023. We remain excited about the potential of RYBREVANT in combination with lazertinib to become a new standard of care in first-line nonsmall cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations. And we are looking forward to be able to present these results in due time in a medical meeting potentially this year.OperatorYour next question today is coming from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank.Joanne Karen WuenschI'm trying to think about 2 things as I look forward to -- given the strength in the first half of the year in MedTech, does this create, in your opinion, a new base from which we grow from? Or are we going to be writing about difficult comps next year? And second of all, with Kenvue's split-off by within days or by the end of this year, I anticipate, how do we think about different investments in the MedTech and Pharmaceutical franchises, either through pure R&amp;D internally or externally?Joaquin DuatoSo as I commented in the earlier question, we are pleased with the strength of our MedTech business in the first half of the year with 8% growth. We -- this is driven by market growth, which we believe it's also slightly elevated this year due to the clearing of the COVID-19 backlog; and at the same time, as I commented, to our improved commercial execution and the introduction of new products. Of note, of our 12 $1 billion platforms in MedTech, all of them have grown during the first half of the year. And we are being quite successful in introducing some important new products in all segments of our business. For example, if I start with electrophysiology, that grew north of 25% in the quarter. We have introduced a new mapping catheter, OCTARAY; and also a new treatment catheter, QDOT. Which as you know, Joanne, we presented results about QDOT, so we increased efficacy and procedure efficiency, too. If we move into Vision, we are in the middle of the launch of ACUVUE OASYS MAX, which is doing well; and also the launch of our TECNIS Eyhance, the first monofocal intraocular lens, which is progressing also very well. Moving into Orthopaedics. The good news is that we have received CE Mark and CA Mark for our Robotic-Assisted System, VELYS. And we continue to have an enhanced portfolio of knees and hips with our cementless knees, the medial stabilized, and in the area of hips with Hip Navigation and the recent addition of CUPTIMIZE. And we see our market position there also progressing. And moving forward, we will continue to see good evolution also in Orthopaedics. Finally, in Surgery, we continue to enhance our endocutter and our energy portfolio with the launch of ENSEAL jaw, curved; and also with the launch of ECHELON 3000 in the stapler side. So overall, good reception of our new products. That portend well for a continuation of growth, as I said before, in the second half of the year. And we look forward also to the different readouts of our PFA pipeline, which as we have announced, we have completed the enrollment of our dual-energy catheter, which is going to be offering the physicians the comfort of a catheter that fits the most widely used with the option of having both radio frequency and PFA to adapt to every patient anatomy. And then on the robotic side, we will provide you more updates on our progress on Ottava, our soft tissue robotics system, before the end of the year, as we committed. And we have also good news on our MONARCH system that has already started with the first patient treated in removal of kidney stone. So overall, good progress during the year. Clearly, our MedTech business is doing well, delivering competitive growth. And we have good news in innovation as the year moves forward.Joseph J. WolkAnd Joanne, with respect to your second question and completing the Consumer Health separation. Our capital allocation priorities aren't changing. So we're going to continue to invest organically in our own pipeline. You saw that we pretty much have kept our percent to sales, which is -- leads across industries as a top 10 investor in R&amp;D on an annual basis. We prioritize that. We realize that, that is underpinning our future success, as we have demonstrated. The dividends and the share repurchases that we've done this year has already returned a significant amount back to shareholders. And then we'll always be on the hunt for real good strategic opportunities that fit with either the clinical or science expertise we have or commercial capabilities that we can offer that drive more value out of a potential asset in our hands than where it currently resides. So we are looking feverishly as we always do across both MedTech and Pharm.OperatorYour next question is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.Christopher Thomas SchottJust the first one is, would love just some additional views on the $57 billion pharma target by 2025. It seems like between the pipeline progress we've seen this year and the STELARA settlements, you've had some clear positive updates over the past few months. And I'm just wondering, just level of confidence in that target, and has that increased as we've gone through this year? And then my second question was just for Erik on talc. Is there any update in terms of the number of plaintiffs where you have an agreement on the settlement terms relative to where we stood with the comments in April? And just where you stand right now relative to that 75% threshold you ultimately need.Joaquin DuatoThank you, Chris. And let me start with your first question. We have always been confident on the fact that we will reach our $57 billion target by 2025, as we announced back in 2021. And certainly, what we are seeing now increases and reinforces and enhances our confidence. On one hand, you're seeing the progression of our Pharmaceutical portfolio and our existing products with excellent results in DARZALEX, TREMFYA and ERLEADA, also in our pulmonary hypertension franchise and in our long-acting injectable anti-psychotic franchise, which are key products in this period. We are very pleased with the trajectory of our new product launches, including CARVYKTI, TECVAYLI and SPRAVATO. If I focus on CARVYKTI, you see a clear improvement quarter-over-quarter in CARVYKTI, which reflects improvements in supply. In TECVAYLI, you see also a clear improvement. Of note, when we look at the TECVAYLI launch, align data with DARZALEX in the addressable patient population, TECVAYLI, it's having a faster introduction. And finally, SPRAVATO, which is doing well. And now we see SPRAVATO as a $1 billion-plus product, and you're seeing the results this quarter also reaching close to $170 million. If we look at our pipeline and the products of the pipeline that are going to impact in this period, we are expecting the PDUFA date of talquetamab, our GPRC5D CD3 bispecific antibody, which is going to give another option in the treatment of multiple myeloma. And we continue to progress and execute well in some of the key products in our pipeline. I commented on RYBREVANT and the combination of lazertinib, as you know. We received fast track destination for the 3 key indications of milvexian, our Factor XI oral anticoagulant that we are working in collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb. We presented very positive data about TAR-200 in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer in meeting in the American Urological Association. And we also -- when it comes to CARVYKTI, we were very pleased to show the data on CARTITUDE-4. We are filing the BLA now, both in Europe and in the U.S. And we are expecting to show you some data on nipocalimab in rheumatoid arthritis. We also have already presented in hemolytic disease of the fetus, of the newborn.So in every angle of the products that we highlighted as the core products of our pipeline, we are executing well. Plus we recently presented in the World Congress of Dermatology our data in our oral IL-23 receptor antagonist peptide, which show great efficacy in psoriasis. And we have announced plans to continue developing into psoriasis and also a Phase II study in ulcerative colitis. So overall, when I look at the picture for 2025, we have increased confidence based on our portfolio, in our new product launches and how we are executing on our pipeline. But now I would like to look even beyond 2025 if you allow me, Chris, because 2025 is very close. It's only 3 years from now. So what I think is what you are seeing with this renewal of our portfolio is a very strong position for Johnson &amp; Johnson in Pharmaceuticals beyond 2025. And that's something that we need to highlight, and I think it's important for everybody to recognize. This is going to put us in a great position beyond 2025.Erik HaasTurning to the question with respect to the number of claimants. Good and important question. The most recent update comes from the hearing on the motions to dismiss that finished on June 30. And I would refer you to the post-trial findings of fact and conclusions in law that were filed last night that really detailed the evidentiary record that was elicited during the hearing. Based upon that testimony that was elicited and the evidence that went in, we are now looking at approximately 60,000 claimants in support or lawyers who represent 60,000 claimants in support of the plan, and lawyers who represent about 40,000 claimants in opposition. So the numbers right now show that the vast majority of claimants support the proposed plan. Based upon the testimony during that hearing from the lawyers that support those claimants, we are confident that, that support will not waver. And we do anticipate that additional support will be coming forward.OperatorOur next question is coming from Trung Huynh from Credit Suisse.Trung Chuong HuynhJust 2, if I may. So just on -- thanks for your thoughts on the talc outcome. Should we just expect any more similar suits like the one in Alameda in the near future? And then secondly, do you know -- just a clarification on MARIPOSA, if another interim passed for MARIPOSA?Joaquin DuatoSo let me start with the MARIPOSA. No. I mean, we are -- as we communicated, we are moving into a final analysis by the end of the year, potentially presenting the data at the end of the year.Erik HaasAnd with respect to the talc suits, we don't anticipate additional individual actions to go up for it outside the bankruptcy. Judge Kaplan lifted the stay only with respect to that one particular case, the [Validus] case. Indeed, subsequent to that, he denied a request from the same counsel to lift the stay on another case. So currently, I would not anticipate any other case to go forward in advance of a ruling on the motion to dismiss.OperatorNext question is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley.Terence C. FlynnCongrats on the quarter. I had 2. I was wondering, Joaquin, we've talked a lot about the myeloma market evolution over the last decade or so. J&amp;J has been a leader there. This is a $20 billion market. You obviously have a number of different options now for patients, including TECVAYLI most recently and talquetamab with upcoming PDUFA date. So I guess my question is just, top down, what prevents you from capturing a majority share of that $20 billion market? And then, Joe, a question for you on margins post-Kenvue. Any early idea you can give us in terms of how that structure could evolve post the full separation?Joaquin DuatoYes. So thank you for the question. And the answer is nothing prevents us from doing that. As a matter of fact, our aspiration in myeloma is that, with the portfolio that we have today with DARZALEX, TECVAYLI, talquetamab and CARVYKTI, we would be in a position to have 3 out of every 4 patients starting in Janssen containing regimen by the end of this decade. So that's our aspiration in myeloma. Our aspiration is that there is a Janssen regimen for every line of therapy and a Janssen treatment for every patient irrespective of their characteristics. And that's the way we are planning our development. Certainly, DARZALEX being a backbone of therapy, first line, and also in combination with multiple agents; and then sequencing into CARVYKTI and talquetamab and TECVAYLI, which we are studying in combination with DARZALEX and also in combination among each other and sequencing among them. So ultimately, our goal when it comes to multiple myeloma is to be able to sequence our medicines, combine them in a way that we are changing the treatment paradigm from treating to progression to treating to cure. And that is a big, big, big plus in our portfolio. And as I have commented often, multiple myeloma is the core of our Pharmaceutical franchise and the #1 growth driver that is going to be for 2025 and beyond. There's more factors that give us optimism about the business potential of this area, is that as we combine and as we seek those treatments, the treatment duration itself is going to be significantly increased. So we overall foresee great patient and growth opportunity as we look to combine all these modalities, as I said, in order to be able to convert multiple myeloma into a chronic disease.Joseph J. WolkAnd Terence, thanks for the question regarding margins. And specifically, I think you're getting at the heart of the potential deleverage that could occur with the separation once Kenvue is on its own entirely. You may recall a couple of quarters ago on one of these calls, we said that there was potentially $500 million to $750 million of deleverage in SG&amp;A. We embarked on an initiative -- and I guess the benchmarks would suggest companies usually take about 2 to 3 years to get those costs out of their system. Last summer, we really embarked on a project to eliminate those costs in a much faster cadence. And I would say of that $500 million to $750 million, there's a small fraction that may remain, and we're still working to eliminate that. So you should expect, as you're modeling, no deleveraging or very, very little deleveraging from the Kenvue separation.OperatorYour next question today is coming from Danielle Antalffy from UBS.Danielle Joy AntalffyJust a follow up on some of the capital allocation commentary. Joe, I appreciate what you're saying that things haven't changed. But I'm just curious, now that you guys have integrated Abiomed, you're seeing some success there, how your appetite -- for specifically within medical devices and MedTech, how your appetite for potentially larger deals may have changed? And are there any specific areas you would call out within cardiology now that you do have Abiomed, or just with -- throughout medical devices, as areas of interest or where you feel underscaled and you might benefit from building out there?Joseph J. WolkYes. And I know you directed the question to me, and I'll answer with one word. I would say our appetite is pretty voracious at this point. But I'll leave it to Joaquin with respect to the size of the deals. I don't think -- it unequivocally doesn't change, whether it's big or small, it has to be a really good strategic fit utilizing the expertise and capabilities that we have and has to provide financial value. Joaquin, maybe you want to comment on any specific areas that are of interest.Joaquin DuatoYes. Thank you, Danielle. And before I go there, let me say that the Abiomed integration is progressing really well. The growth of Abiomed, it's been 20% on the quarter. and we continue to move forward with the enrollment in the key PMA studies, PROTECT and STEMI DTU, as well as the Impella ECP. So everything is moving well according to plan in the Abiomed integration. And we are increasingly convinced that this is going to be a key component of our MedTech strategy in becoming a leader in heart recovery. So when it comes to M&amp;A, look, we continue to look for opportunities. And our #1 criteria in looking for opportunities is the medical innovation, how they improve patient care, how do we see the science behind the product? So we are agnostic in that sense to MedTech and Pharmaceuticals. It's all about identifying areas that are going to have a significant impact in patient care. When it comes to MedTech, certainly, as we have commented, we are continuing to look forward for opportunities to grow into areas that are close to where we are today. Vision, Cardiovascular obviously, Surgery too, and also opportunities in certain high-growth segments of Orthopaedics. And we normally will continue to look for these opportunities, trying to have a good return on capital as well as things that are close to our existing expertise. When it comes to pharma, our history in tuck-ins, in license and collaboration has been very successful. As a matter of fact, external innovation represents about 50% of our pipeline. And while we will continue to look for opportunities like we have done now with Cellular Biomedicines and the agreement that we have too in CAR-T, we are not averse to other transactions of larger size. Evidently, both in MedTech and in pharma, we are very disciplined with our capital allocation. And all our transactions will have to clear certain financial milestones for us to be able to move on. But M&amp;A and also licensing acquisition collaborations remains a key factor in our growth moving forward.Jessica MooreWe have time for one more question.OperatorOur final question today is coming from Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald.Louise Alesandra ChenCongratulations on the quarter. So I wanted to ask you where your latest thoughts on IRA are and the potential impact to the drug industry and also to J&amp;J. And second question was just on CARVYKTI. Just curious how you expect to enter into earlier lines of treatment and then more widely into the community.Joaquin DuatoYes. So let me start with the IRA. Obviously, we remain very concerned about the government price-setting environment that the IRA creates, which we believe creates a significant disincentive to innovation without addressing the core problem, which is patient access. So it is a significant concern for us. And that's one of the reasons, as Erik commented earlier, that we have filed a lawsuit versus the IRA. So that's important for us. Then when it comes to the actual business impact, I think it's still early to be able to calculate it, given the fact that many of the rules and procedures are still in flux. So it would be too much to be able to try to anticipate that. In our case, when we look at Johnson &amp; Johnson, relatively speaking towards the industry, based on our diversification between MedTech and pharma and also the diversification of our pharma portfolio, we feel that we are well positioned competitively to continue to grow well beyond the second half of this decade. So we remain concerned. But at the same time, we think we are prepared to be able to manage successfully any situation coming from that relative to other industry players. The second question was about CARVYKTI. As I commented earlier, we are working to improve CARVYKTI supply, which is very important. You've seen that improvement in our sales in the second quarter. We are working in different ways. One is we are increasing capacity. We have internalized the production of lentivirus now. And also, we are in the process of increasing the number of slots internally. And also, we have reached agreements with other companies like Novartis to continue to increase capacity. So we are going to be in the trajectory of increasing capacity gradually in order to be able to eventually meet demand that exists in CARVYKTI. As far as reaching to other patient populations, the CARVYKTI 4, it's already been filed. And it's moving CARVYKTI into earlier lines of therapy, and we are also working in first line with CARVYKTI 5 and CARVYKTI -- excuse me, with CARTITUDE-5 and CARTITUDE-6. So we are clearly intending to move CARVYKTI through CARTITUDE-4, CARTITUDE-5 and CARTITUDE-6 into earlier lines of therapy.

Tesla shares slide following an earnings miss and a disappointing earnings call with CEO Elon Musk. Netflix's stock falls on a revenue miss despite huge gains in subscriber growth figures. Yahoo Finance Live anchors Seana Smith and Alexandra Canal break down the earnings data on several top stocks.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: All right. Let's talk about some of the individual names. First up. We got to take a look at Johnson &amp; Johnson, closing the day in the green, up just about 6%. The company reporting earnings here that beat the Street's expectations. They also raised their guidance. Johnson &amp; Johnson saying that it now expects adjusted earnings for the full 2023 fiscal year, $10.75 per share. That was up from its previous estimate of $10.65 a share.Certainly, something, Alie, the Street was very excited about when you talk about a beat on both the top and bottom line, raising the forecast. Kanter was out with a note saying that there's a lot of strength in their business segments that remains. And they believe it's underappreciated when it comes to the price.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah. Polar opposite of what we saw with Netflix, Tesla, American Airlines. They disappointed on guidance. J&amp;J, they boosted guidance. And that is being rewarded on Wall Street right now. We're also seeing some increased demand for surgeries, especially among those older adults that push that off during COVID. But overall, Johnson &amp; Johnson's really looked at it as a bellwether in the health care sector.And I think health care is having a moment right now. I mean, we're talking about pickleball at one point, leading to more procedures done, as more people are getting involved in pickleball. We had the first over-the-counter FDA approval for birth control drug. There's just a lot happening right now. And it seems like health care is just very strong. And Johnson &amp; Johnson's results certainly proves that.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly. The stock is still down year-to-date but now off just about 4%. Not everyone on the Street was at least as encouraged or somewhat I should-- maybe the better way to put it, still have some questions just about what the business is going to look like here in the near term.JP Morgan's reaction, they have a neutral rating on the stock. They're still worried about that talc overhang. They're hoping to get a little bit more clarity regarding that impact here throughout the current quarter, the third quarter, but again, taking a look at the Street's reaction, at least for now. We talked about the fact that companies are under pressure to beat and raise their guidance. And at least in the case of Johnson &amp; Johnson, it seems to have satisfied investors for now.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah. We'll see what the back half of the year holds for that, especially with those lawsuits overhanging. Moving on to Tesla. Shares closing way down there more than 9% following second quarter results that were a mixed bag for investors. And the earnings call wasn't much better. Among the things investors were disappointed to hear from the EV maker were slow down in production in the third quarter due to factory upgrades and the lack of specifics given about the start of Cybertruck production.It's crazy to me that the Cybertruck is what investors care about, because, personally, I just think this is a bit of a side show for Netflix. I think the larger story here is the margin disappointment, also the pricing war that we have going on, Netflix guiding that they'll probably have to continue to cut prices as we see more EVs come to market. And that's not just something that's happening in the US. It's also happening overseas in China.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. It's happening overseas in China. This is really a global price war when it comes to EVs. These companies like Tesla trying to increase adoption. Tesla, there were some questions just about the demand picture, how significantly that was deteriorating given the macro environment. So the fact that Elon Musk left the door open to further price cuts, that's one of the big reasons why we're seeing such a massive drop in the stock today.And like you said, Allie, this has already-- this has been pressuring margins now. This is the second quarter that this has happened. So certainly something that investors, analysts are keeping a very close eye on. When it comes to what's going to be really move the needle here for Tesla going forward, a lot of the excitement in the stock was surrounding its relation here with AI and how much of this is really an AI play versus an EV play and the demand.Lots of questions about that. And whether or not the massive run up that we've seen since the start of the year of a gain of over 113%, whether or not that's justified. And at least for today, following these results, analysts are still a bit cautious about Tesla's current valuation, saying that it could be a bumpy couple of months because of some of these concerns.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. It's an overheated stock, clearly. I mean, Elon Musk, he's one of those CEOs that just gets a rise out of most people. I mean, this quote, he said, ""The Cybertruck demand is so far off the hook, you can't even see the hook."" That is such an Elon Musk quote right there. We're going to be diving deeper into the Cybertruck story a little later on in the show with our auto reporter Pras Subramanian, because there's a lot to talk about when we think about Elon Musk and the future of this Cybertruck. I mean, look--SEANA SMITH: You talk about your Elon Musk impression, that was pretty good.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Thank you. I've been working on it, you know, practicing in the mirror.SEANA SMITH: I know. You got to debut it. And this is the perfect time. All right. Let's also talk about Netflix, the stock there. I know you are very closely watching here. Closing the day, off just about 8.5%. The streamer fell short of expectations when it comes to its forecast. That, of course, was a big reason why we saw shares under pressure.There was also a lot of talk about the password crackdown, what that would do to subscriber numbers. On that side of things for Netflix, that was a very impressive report here. It was nearly triple what the Street was expecting in terms of new additions. Whether or not that momentum can continue, I think that's also a question--ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah. That's a big question. And if you think about where we were last year, Netflix lost a million subscribers. So now, we're seeing 6 million added, which is definitely a positive for Netflix heading into the back half of the year. On the earnings call, they did stress that those certain revenue initiatives, like the crackdown on password sharing, like the ad-supported tier, that's going to take time to see the full impact. And it's going to play out in a few quarters to come.I read a note from Wells Fargo analyst Steve Cahall earlier this morning. And he said patience is a virtue, especially when it comes to those long-term Netflix investors. So you have to be patient. And you have to wait things out in order to really see the benefits of some of these initiatives.But we also saw profitability metrics like operating margins, free cash flow come in above those estimates. So compared to a lot of media out there that's a lot of turmoil right now in the industry, they're doing pretty well.SEANA SMITH: And also, we haven't even brought up the issue of the Hollywood strike right now on the writers side, on the actor's side. Many analysts out there saying that Netflix is best positioned among its peers, given the fact that it has a very deep shelf when it comes to content, also its international exposure. But you've got to ask the question, I know it's something that you've been looking into, too, how long this strike drags on? At what point are we going to see a material impact on Netflix?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah. Netflix, specifically, talked about these strikes, was the first question on the earnings calls co-CEO Ted Sarandos. He said, we want a deal. We want to get this done. No one expected this to happen and to last for as long as it's happened. And I think the longer it goes on, the more pressure it's going to put on Netflix and all of these media companies to make a deal.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. Certainly, Netflix one of the worst performers in the S&amp;P today.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of obesity in the U.S., the least obese state in America, the socioeconomic factors of obesity, new weight-loss drugs, innovations in the insulin industry, and the financial cost of obesity, and go directly to 5 Most Obese States in America in 2023. Obesity in the U.S.:Obesity is a common, chronic disease among many U.S. adults and children. With America’s obesity rate of 38.2%, it is ranked among the Most Obese Countries in the World. Also, obesity is also one of the 15 biggest issues in America.The National Institute of Health has suggested that if the current trends of obesity continue, the obesity rate in America in 2050 could be as high as 100%. Least Obese State in America:With an adult obesity rate of 25%, Hawaii is the least obese state in 2023. The Aloha State has now beaten Colorado, where 25.1% of the adult population is classified as obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Socioeconomic Factors of Obesity:Obesity is negatively proportional to income level, with increased rates of obesity noted in low income populations. Individuals with limited financial means often live in food deserts and gravitate towards convenient stores and food sources that are highly processed, low in nutrient density, and high in caloric content with a long shelf life. The cost associated with fresh produce at these locations can be up to four times the cost of fresh produce purchased from grocery stores. New Weight-Loss Drugs:Positive trial data showing that the obesity drug by Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) actually helps save and extend lives, and not just lose weight, could propel the Danish company’s stock even higher. Demand for Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO)’s weight-loss treatment Wegovy is soaring in the U.S., leading the company to upgrade its operating profit growth expectations to between 28% and 34%, up from a February guidance of between 13% and 19%. Story continuesSimilarly, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is also in the middle of phase three clinical trials of its weight-loss oral drug, Orforglipron, meaning it’s likely to hit the market later. Still, analysts are confident in the competitive edge of Orforglipron in the long-run, especially after Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) unveiled its phase two clinical trial results in June, which showcased the drug’s strong efficacy profile. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is one of the Biggest Diet/Weight Loss Companies in the World. Barclays estimates that the burgeoning weight-loss drug industry could be worth as much as $200 billion within the next decade, with most of the benefit accrued to early leaders, like Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) and Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY).Innovations in the Insulin Industry:Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), one of the global leaders in medical technology, announced in April the FDA approval of its MiniMed™ 780G system, the world’s first insulin pump with meal detection technology. The system provides insulin to help account for when users occasionally forget to bolus, or underestimate the amount of carbs in their meal. This sent the stock prices of Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) soaring from a six-month low of $76.72 on March 10th, to a six-month high of $91.38 on April 27th, an increase of 19.1%. In November 2022, Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) also launched the world’s first and only infusion set for insulin pumps that doubled wear time up to 7 days, leading to annual cost saving of insulin of up to 25%. If you’re interested in investing in the healthcare industry, please check out the Healthcare Stocks Billionaires are Loading Up On. The Financial Cost of Obesity:According to a study at George Washington University, the medical costs of adult obesity in the U.S. range from $147 billion to nearly $210 billion per year. Meanwhile, lost productivity due to obesity-related conditions is estimated to cost between $3.38 billion to 6.38 billion annually.Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health estimate that if obesity trends continue, the obesity related medical costs could rise by $43 billion to $66 billion each year by 2030. With that said, here are the Most Obese States in America in 2023. 20 Most Obese States in America in 2023Image by Tania Dimas from PixabayMethodology:To collect data  for this article, we have referred to the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion of the CDC, looking for States with the Highest Rates of Obesity in the U.S. Obesity is defined by the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control as having a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher. The states have been ranked according to the percentage of adults, aged 18 years and older, who have obesity. When two states had the same percentage of obese adults, we ranked them by the percentage of their total population with diabetes.  20. New MexicoPercentage of Adults with Obesity: 34.6%Obesity rates in New Mexican adults have dramatically increased over the last 10 years and many New Mexicans are struggling with serious health effects related to excess weight. To address this public health issue, the New Mexico Department of Health has implemented multiple strategies to increase awareness, including providing educational materials on healthy diet and physical activities to help adults manage chronic conditions. 19. TennesseePercentage of Adults with Obesity: 35%Tennessee is one of the most obese states in America and a cause of this could also be its Southern fried food. The University of Tennessee received a funding of $585,212 in 2022 from the CDC for its High Obesity Program, to promote healthy eating and active living in counties that have more than 40% prevalence of adult obesity. 18. North DakotaPercentage of Adults with Obesity: 35.2%North Dakota’s obesity rate has increased by 7.3% since 2010, 14.8% since 2000, and 23.1% since 1990, thus indicating a dangerous trend. A recent study conducted by the County Health Rankings has revealed that every one of North Dakota’s 53 counties had become more obese over the last 10 years. 17. NebraskaPercentage of Adults with Obesity: 35.9%The Nebraska Center for Prevention of Obesity Diseases has been conducting research to seek innovative approaches to combat the threat of obesity. The center has so far received grants and donations of over $100 million to continue researching ways to make food healthier for people. 16. KansasPercentage of Adults with Obesity: 36%Aside from the high rate of obesity, about 11% of the adult population in Kansas has also been diagnosed with diabetes. The effects of obesity in Kansas are worse in rural communities because of a lack of resources. 15. North CarolinaPercentage of Adults with Obesity: 36%The fatty Southern food and lack of physical activity are the two major causes of the high obesity rate in North Carolina. The state received funding of over $1.7 million in 2022 from the CDC, to help combat obesity through its various programs. 14. TexasPercentage of Adults with Obesity: 36.1%Over 2.4 million people in the Lone Star State have low income and low access to healthy food sources, leading to high obesity rates. The McAllen-Edinburg-Mission metro area in Texas is the  most obese city in America, and also ranks among the most obese cities in the world.   13. South CarolinaPercentage of Adults with Obesity: 36.1%The economic cost of obesity in South Carolina is estimated to be $8.5 billion and growing. The South Carolina Department of Health devised the Obesity Action Plan to help combat this scourge in the Palmetto State. 12. IndianaPercentage of Adults with Obesity: 36.3%With over one-third of its adult population being obese, Indiana ranks among the states with the highest rates of obesity in 2023. The Health and Hospital Corporation of Marion County received a funding of $618,000 in 2022 from the CDC, to help reduce obesity in the state of Indiana. 11. IowaPercentage of Adults with Obesity: 36.4%The Iowa Institute of Public Health Research and Policy has partnered with Healthy LifeStars to help implement its program in the state. Healthy LifeStars is a national NGO dedicated to ending childhood obesity through education, awareness, and changing habits to influence future generations of healthy children. 10. MissouriPercentage of Adults with Obesity: 37.3%Missouri has several obesity prevention initiatives, however, the effectiveness of these programs to reduce obesity remains undetermined. The obesity rates in the state continue to grow, with associated costs projected to be $13 billion by 2030. Missouri ranks among the top 10 most obese states in America in 2023. 9. OhioPercentage of Adults with Obesity: 37.8%The Black and Hispanic communities have the highest rates of obesity in Ohio, with 43.5% and 42.5% of the respective adult populations suffering from the condition. 8. South DakotaPercentage of Adults with Obesity: 38.4%The South Dakota State University received a funding of $440,000 from the CDC for its High Obesity Program, which helps promote healthy eating and active living in its most obese counties. 7. LouisianaPercentage of Adults with Obesity: 38.6%The Louisiana Obesity and Diabetes Collaborative is a group of dedicated individuals working to improve health outcomes related to obesity and diabetes through increasing awareness, health literacy, and connecting patients to programs and services. 6. ArkansasPercentage of Adults with Obesity: 38.7%Less than half of the state’s adult population eats a fruit or a vegetable daily, and only 41% get 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week, making Arkansas one of the most obese states in the U.S. in 2023. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Most Obese States in America in 2023.Suggested Articles:25 Least Obese Countries in the World20 Most Obese Developed Countries in the World15 Largest Weight Loss Companies Disclaimer: None. 20 Most Obese States in America in 2023 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

(Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded.I would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Hinson, Vice President of Corporate Finance and Treasurer. Please go ahead.Kris HinsonThank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we discuss our second quarter 2023 results. I'm Kris Hinson, and I recently joined Crown Castle as the Vice President of Corporate Finance and Treasurer.

Tables reconciling these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information package in the Investors section of the company's website at crowncastle.com.With that, let me turn the call over to Jay.Story continuesJay A. BrownThanks, Kris, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Before I begin, I'd like to welcome Kris. We're very excited to have him here on the Crown Castle team.Turning to our earnings release, I wanted to provide some context for the wireless industry environment that led us to reduce our outlook for 2023, and Dan is going to speak to the specifics of the changes. Across each U.S. wireless generation, the deployment of new spectrum followed by cell site densification has increased network capacity and enabled exponential mobile data demand growth. For us, this has played out with an initial surge in tower activity to build out the latest generation network followed by a consistent level of activity over a long period of time to support our customers.As a part of the most recent upgrade to 5G, the U.S. wireless carriers spent more than $100 billion to acquire spectrum from 2020 to 2022. Our customers moved quickly to deploy their newly-acquired spectrum, driving record tower level activity and dividend per share growth of almost 11% per year over that same period. I believe this initial surge in tower activity has ended. In the second quarter, we saw tower activity levels slow significantly. As a result, we are decreasing our 2023 outlook primarily as a result of lower tower services margins. Importantly, our tower organic revenue growth outlook remains at 5% despite the lower level of activity. The resilience of our tower revenues is the result of our decision to pursue holistic long-term agreements with each of our major customers. In each of these agreements, our strategy has been to maximize the economic value, while simultaneously providing visibility and stability in our long-term cash flows. To illustrate this point, Slide 4 shows our organic tower revenue growth since 2013. Over this period, we've consistently worked with our customers to provide them with enhanced flexibility to move quickly in deploying their networks, while increasing our level of contracted activity. Due to our focus on reducing risk and generating resilient organic growth, we have contracted 75% of our expected annual tower organic growth of 5% through 2027, while also delivering record tower growth in 2021 and '22 during the initial phases of 5G rollout.In addition to the benefits we've captured from our long-term customer agreements, we've complemented our portfolio of towers with fiber and small cells, making us uniquely positioned to capitalize on the long-term growth in data demand regardless of how carriers deploy spectrum and densify their networks. Our current backlog of 60,000 small cells provides the line of sight to doubling our on-air nodes over the next several years, which we expect will drive double-digit small cell revenue growth beginning in 2024.To provide additional visibility on how our fiber solutions and small cell businesses are progressing, we have updated our analysis across the 5 markets we have previously highlighted since 2021 as highlighted on Slide 10. We continue to generate solid returns from the benefits of colocating additional customers on our existing fiber assets, offsetting the churn related to the legacy Sprint rationalization. Phoenix, which was not impacted by Sprint churn, is a good illustration of what we can achieve with our fiber strategy as we add nodes to existing fiber. There, we have seen our yield expand from 9% a year ago to over 11% today as we roughly doubled our nodes on air from 1,400 to 2,800 nodes. Los Angeles and Philadelphia also illustrate the benefit of our shared infrastructure model. Here, with the combination of small cells and enterprise fiber, we see yields of 8% to 9% with the potential to grow yields as we have done in Phoenix and Orlando as we add small cells.Overall, I'm encouraged by these results, particularly as we accelerate small cell deployments with 60,000 nodes in our backlog, the majority of which are colocation nodes, we have line of sight to attractive incremental returns and double-digit small cell revenue growth. Zooming back out to the consolidated level, we're consistently looking to deliver the highest risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. Our strategy has delivered growth and driven improvements on both the risk and the return side of the equation.Several years ago, it became clear to us that small cells will become an important component of the wireless carrier network densification required to support data growth. We saw an acceleration in small cells towards the back half of the 4G era as the vast majority of the 60,000 nodes we have on air today are 4G nodes that were deployed because towers alone could not support the continued rise in mobile traffic.Now as we've passed the initial 5G surge in tower activity, we are seeing our customers accelerate the selection and identification of new small cell locations to densify portions of their networks that have experienced the most traffic. The results of our early move into establishing a leading portfolio is reflected in our double-digit small cell organic revenue growth in 2024 and provides a platform for continued growth throughout the 5G era. With our diversified asset base, we have positioned ourselves to benefit from carrier activity on towers and small cells.Additionally, we have reduced our risk by increasing the resiliency of our business through our long-term customer agreements and improving the strength of our balance sheet. As a result of these actions, despite a significant reduction in tower activity in the back half of 2023, we continue to expect 5% organic tower revenue growth, 10,000 small cell node deployments and 3% fiber solutions growth by the end of this year. This resilient underlying growth across our business underpins our expectation of returning to our long-term annual dividend per share growth target of 7% to 8% beyond 2025.And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dan.Daniel K. SchlangerThanks, Jay, and good morning, everyone. I wanted to take a moment to frame the changes to our 2023 outlook before getting into the specifics of our results. Over the last quarter, both tower industry specific and macroeconomic factors have negatively impacted our business. On the industry specific side, the end of the initial surge in activity related to the early stage of the 5G investment cycle has resulted in a decline in tower activity of more than 50%, causing us to reduce our outlook for services gross margin by $90 million. At the same time, interest rates continued to rise as a result of the macroeconomic conditions in the U.S., resulting in $15 million of additional interest expense. Combined, these headwinds have reduced our outlook by $105 million. While this is a sizable change, our strategy to pursue the highest risk-adjusted return that Jay just discussed has limited the impact. Of course, we're not standing still in the face of these forces. We are focusing on managing our business and cost structure to match the lower activity levels removing significant cash costs. So the net impact to our AFFO is only $40 million. We are encouraged that our focus on the resiliency of our cash flows and managing costs allows us to withstand this reduction in tower activity with minimal impact to our bottom line.Turning to second quarter results on Page 5 of the earnings materials. Growth in site rental revenue is highlighted by nearly 6% tower organic growth. On a consolidated basis, we generated 12% organic growth or 4% when adjusted for the impact of the Sprint cancellations. We also had outsized growth of 14% in AFFO and 10% in adjusted EBITDA, in part due to the Sprint cancellation.As expected, most of the impact of the Sprint cancellations occurred in the second quarter, including a net contribution to site rental billings of $100 million. Because the Sprint cancellations have a number of moving parts in our second quarter and full year results, we've inserted a slide into the appendix of our earnings materials detailing their impact in 2023 and our expectation for those cancellations through 2025.Turning to our full year outlook on Page 6. Our outlook for site rental revenues remains unchanged. The decrease to adjusted EBITDA and AFFO is primarily driven by a lower contribution from services, partially offset by lower expenses, leading to a $50 million decrease to adjusted EBITDA and a $40 million decrease to AFFO.On Page 7, tower organic growth remains at 5% for the year despite a slight reduction in tower core leasing, which is partially offset by a slight reduction in tower churn. Additionally, we lowered our Sprint cancellation-related small cell nonrenewals by $5 million due to timing, leaving our consolidated organic growth unchanged at approximately 7%.Turning to Page 8. As I previously mentioned, the lower contribution from services totals $90 million, and our outlook for interest expense has increased $15 million. More than offsetting the increased interest expense is $10 million of higher expected interest income and $15 million of lower sustaining capital expenditures. Our discretionary CapEx outlook remain unchanged with gross CapEx of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion or approximately $1 billion net of expected prepaid rent. Our balance sheet is well positioned to continue to support investments that we believe will contribute to long-term growth.Consistent with our strategy to limit risk in our business, we've taken steps to minimize our exposure to floating rate debt, including twice issuing fixed rate bonds this year totaling $2.4 billion at a weighted average rate of 5%. We exited the second quarter with 4.6x net debt to adjusted EBITDA, more than $6 billion of available liquidity and only 7% of our total debt maturing through 2024.Since achieving an investment-grade rating in 2025, we have taken various steps to derisk our balance sheet, including increasing our weighted average maturity from 5 years to 8 years, decreasing our floating debt exposure from 32% to 9% and reducing the amount of our secured debt, which provides access to that market in the future if it is attractive.To wrap up, we believe we are very well positioned to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns going forward. The strategy we have pursued over the last decade has positioned us to benefit from the carrier's network augmentation and densification regardless of whether that activity is focused on towers or small cells.Additionally, we have structured our customer agreements to generate organic growth that are resilient through deployment cycles. At the same time, we have limited the risk in our business by focusing on the U.S. and maintaining a solid balance sheet that allows for continued investment and future growth. As a result, we believe we are positioned to return to our long-term annual dividend per share growth target of 7% to 8% beyond 2025 as we get past the remaining large Sprint cancellations.And with that, Kate, I'd like to open the call to questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) The first question is from David Barden of Bank of America.Alexander John WatersIt's Alex Waters, on for Dave. Maybe just first off here, just hoping we could get a little bit more clarity on the structure of the MLAs and the line of sight you have within a year. Just curious on like the certain characteristics that are in the agreements that would allow the shift in 2023. And then secondly, just on the new leasing guide for the fiber segment, I just wanted to walk through kind of the line of sight you have there for the remainder of the year, just given that there's a pretty good ramp here in the second half.Jay A. BrownYou bet. Thanks for the question. On your first question around the MLAs, this has been something that we've done over a long period of time. We did it during the 4G cycle and have continued to do it as we've entered into the 5G cycle. There's benefits to us because it gives us line of sight and visibility into the cash flows and the contracted growth that Dan and I both spoke about. There's also a benefit to our customers of those MLAs. They are better able to predict the cost of network deployment, and it eases the amount of interaction on a site-by-site basis between our companies.So there's value there. I think the economic value is clear from the comments that we laid out this morning. And then there's also the operating benefits of those MLAs. And I think they benefit both parties. As to the specifics of those contracts, we don't disclose customer-by-customer agreements or the specifics. So I'll stop with just sort of a high-level view of why we do it and the benefits to both of us.On your second question around new leasing in the fiber business, this is the way we expected the year to play out. Obviously, we had a difficult year-over-year comp in the first quarter, and then we expected a rebound in the second quarter, which we saw. And we expect the second half of the year to be better than the first half of the year. And by the time we exit 2023, we think we'll be back at that 3% growth on a year-over-year basis as we go into 2024. And what we're seeing in the market in terms of activity, backlog, the conversations we're having with customers, et cetera, would suggest that's the pace that we're on.OperatorThe next question is from Greg Williams of TD Cowen.Gregory Bradford WilliamsYou're clearly noting a slowdown in the second quarter tower activity. Just curious, in your conversations with carriers, when do you anticipate that activity to maybe inflect up again? How prolonged do you think this slowdown is, given there's a lot of spectrum still on the sidelines? Second question is just on your network services, which also came in like naturally. Is the $124 million that you posted in the second quarter sort of a good cadence? Or is there further declines from here?Jay A. BrownSure. On your first question around the slowdown in activity, I think history serves really helpful lessons, both in terms of what we've seen in 4G as well as what we saw in 2G and 3G. On Page 4 of the presentation, you can see historically, basically through the period of time with 4G, we had that initial surge of activity where our leasing results were kind of around 4% -- 5%. And then it did drop off a bit. But that initial surge didn't mean the end of activity or the end of growth. We saw really good, consistent growth throughout that entire 4G cycle of deploying the network.So I don't know, if, when we'll see a pickup in activity. But our view of the business is that we will see consistent growth over a long period of time. And obviously, we have the contracted benefit of that. But I believe those contracts as much as they represent stability and resilience in our cash flow stream, what they also represent is a view by our customers who have needed continued investment that they will do around towers and particularly our towers over a long period of time. So as I look out, I think we're through the initial surge of 5G, and we've benefited well from that. And then as we get into the -- as we get past this initial surge and into activity beyond this, I think we're going to continue to see good, consistent growth as the demand for towers continues to drive over a long period of time. On the services business, that business is -- as you can go back and look at our results over a long period of time, that's just going to track with whatever the activity is on tower site. So as we see a move downward in terms of activity, and you'll see that reflected in the outlook that we gave for the second half of the year for services, the future periods of time and the activity that we see around towers will drive what that services outcome is.So over a long period of time, I'm not -- I can't really give you guidance as to how to think about your model. But it's going to track, we would expect, largely in line with the activity, tower leasing activity that we see in the business.Daniel K. SchlangerAnd then just to put that into 2023 context, Greg, because we saw the slowdown in activity happen in the second quarter, we would expect the second half of the year to be less on the services side than the first half of the year because of the activity levels and what Jay was saying. So the $124 million that you're talking about of services revenue in Q2 will likely come down over the course of the year. But that's what's reflected in our outlook and why we brought down our service gross margin outlook by $90 million. So that's all baked into that outlook.OperatorThe next question is from Ric Prentiss of Raymond James.Hello, Ric, is your line muted?Richard Hamilton PrentissYes, sorry about that. Can you hear me?Jay A. BrownWe can.Richard Hamilton PrentissI want to follow along the lines, on the services business first. Obviously, a big change from the prior guidance, a $90 million change on services business. Was it really related to one carrier more so than the whole group? Just trying to gauge what really caused a pretty big change on the services business, although it's a low multiple business in our opinion.Jay A. BrownWe saw the activity change across multiple carriers during the quarter.Richard Hamilton PrentissOkay. And the margins, I assume, it's moving from kind of planning to deployments sort of the cost side probably reflects some further pressure maybe on the services business as well?Jay A. BrownYes. I think if you go back and look at our historical results, there's obviously a portion of costs that are fixed in that business, but there's also a lot of marginal cost in that business that we have been able to move up and down commensurate with that activity. Dan spoke to that briefly in his comments.And we expect to be able to do the same here where we'll adjust the cost structure and manage the cost structure appropriately for the level of activity and some movements in the margin as the types of services that we perform change from -- whether it's preconstruction or construction work that we're doing for customers. So there's some movement in those margins.But we would expect most of the costs associated to come back down and margins to stay in and around what you've seen historically. But I would not try to put a point in time on a particular quarter. I would look at it more broadly over kind of what you've seen us do over multi years, and it's likely to look like that in the future.Richard Hamilton PrentissYes. Okay. Last one for me. Might be a little bit wonky on the supplement. There's a chart in there that talks about consolidated annualized rental cash payments at time of renewal. And it shows a big chunk for T-Mobile coming up in 2025. It shows a very large chunk for AT&amp;T here in 2023. Is that suggesting that there's an AT&amp;T renewal coming up this year? And then also on the all other line, I just want to make sure I understand how that plays out over time because that remains to be a pretty high number every year out there. Just trying to think of how I should be thinking about that?Jay A. BrownSo these contracts have -- and depending on which carrier we're looking at, we'll have various in essence expiry dates before they enter into their already contracted option date. Typically, our MLA agreements will have multiyear, multi-term option periods. And those options are usually for 5 to 10 years beyond the term that they're in currently.And we've already contracted what the percentage of growth in those future periods is as well. And so as they come up for their natural renewal, those leases are generally extended onto their next term. So we would expect that portion of the supplement to constantly be changing as leases come up for renewal, roll into their next period, and then we're into that next term. That's the normal way that the business operates. And we're not seeing anything that would suggest that would change. So from a modeling standpoint, as you think about our business, we've talked about churn rates on the tower side outside of the Sprint rationalization in kind of that 1% to 2% range, we would expect that to continue. As for the all other, that relates to customers other than the specifically named customers. And we haven't seen any change in that business and would expect we'll continue to see normalized renewals. And those time periods of remaining term will just move around as we are in various stages of the terms.Daniel K. SchlangerI'll just add a couple of things there, Ric. One, you pointed out the one on T-Mobile as being a big number in 2025. That is the already predisclosed Sprint cancellation that's going to happen on the tower side. But that chart is for all of our businesses together. So a lot of the all other is outside of the wireless as well.Richard Hamilton PrentissOutside of wireless. Can you give us some examples of who the bigger -- so that would include the fiber-type stuff, I guess.Daniel K. SchlangerRight. It's the fiber -- so we have fiber -- obviously, we have fiber contracts that roll off over time. That's part of what we already disclosed. As Jay pointed out, there's no difference in fiber churn overall. We still think that's in the high single-digits range, which has been our experience for a long time. But there are always going to be contracts that roll off. It doesn't mean that the revenue goes away. We recontract a lot of those businesses, too. Generally speaking, the average term of the fiber business is in the neighborhood of 5 years. And you would always see a pretty consistent level of nonrenewals in any given year.Richard Hamilton PrentissRight, right. And the big number for AT&amp;T in '23 is just when its expiry date for the normal course, and that moves into option period would be the way to interpret that.Jay A. BrownYes. And that's a very normal thing to happen for the customers over time. So we've seen that over a lot of years. And what you're seeing in the disclosure, whether it's their initial period and some of those leases, frankly, are not even their initial period. They're already into their option terms, and then they're renewing. We would expect those options will renew into a new term, a new option period, and then the term of that will then be reflected in that supplement.OperatorThe next question is from Batya Levi of UBS.Batya LeviJust a follow-up on that payment schedule, that renewal. Is the decline that we're seeing in the second half related to a payment that's pushed out to '26? Or can you generally talk about what drove the increase in '26 this time around versus the last schedule? And also, just again to follow up on the macro lease guidance taken down by slightly $10 million in the second half. Again, if you could -- if you don't mind, can we go over that, what drove that? And maybe what gives you the confidence that it would stay around 5% level going into next year?Daniel K. SchlangerYes. Batya, I had a little bit of a hard time following your first question. I'm really sorry, but could you restate that so I can try to answer the question you're getting to?Batya LeviSure. So the schedule that you provide in terms of payments at renewal, it looks like the second half or the remainder for '23 has come down versus the prior schedule. And when you look at the renewal at time of renewal for '26, there's an add back. So there is -- is that related to potentially one payment that was expected to be received this year that's pushed out 3 years out? Or what would drive that increase in '26?Daniel K. SchlangerYes. I think what I would point you to is there was nothing specific that moved from '23 to '26. This is just the normal course of our business, where we have lots of contracts that have lots of provisions in them, and they move around. And when we're talking about numbers of this size on the business, it's just -- this is the normal course of how our contracts flow through that schedule. I think the important part that I would point to are -- obviously, I pointed to some earlier that T-Mobile in 2025, but also just as Ric had just pointed out, the all others is in line with what our fiber business typically does. What we would say from a nonrenewal perspective is that what we see our customer activity being supports our view that in the tower business, we generally see 1% to 2% churn, in the small cell business generally 1% to 2% churn and in the fiber business in the high single digits. And nothing has changed from that perspective. So as we think about the long-term health of the business, this cash payment at time of renewal chart can move around just based on what the underlying contracts say. But for a long period of time, I would just continue to bake in that 1% to 2% for towers and small cells and the 9% to 10% for fiber.Batya LeviOkay. Maybe if I could just ask it more directly. Was there any change in the MLA that you have with DISH?Jay A. BrownWe're not going to speak to specific customers or specific contracts that we would do with customers. The question broadly around MLAs though, we've not changed terms of our MLA. So what you're seeing in that schedule is just, as Dan said, it's just the normal activity of leases coming up to their natural end. And that could be a small cell lease, it could be a tower lease, it could be a fiber lease and then pushing that out to its now new term. And so the numbers in those schedules are moving. The passage of time, obviously, to your question about '23, is also impactful because we're just a quarter further into the year. So some leases came up for their renewal during the second quarter and would have adjusted out of the '23 column and into some future columns. So it's going to constantly move.OperatorThe next question is from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.Simon William FlanneryIf I could just come back to the guidance change and the 50% reduction in activity. Verizon and T-Mobile had laid out early in the year and even before that, that they were going to be kind of winding down their 5G build with a front-end loaded CapEx and activity in 2023. Is this over and above that? Because presumably, you are well aware of their plans from that. So is there something else that is going on that's causing this pullback? And perhaps you could just revisit what percent of your sites have been upgraded to 5G at this point.Jay A. BrownSure, Simon. It's difficult to reconcile because we don't speak to individual customers, which we're going to continue to not do. It's difficult to reconcile to the public comments of individual carriers, what we're seeing. What I would tell you is the -- we expected there to be an initial surge in 5G, which at some point would come back down, and we would get to the point as we have in the past and past cycles, where we see good growth over a long period of time. And I think what our results reflect is that we're at that point where we've moved from that beyond that initial surge of activity and into a period of time, which we think will continue for a long period of time of good growth that we can count on. And our customer agreements, I think, reflects that as well. So the customers are going to continue to spend. Inside of -- specifically inside of the year, obviously, we've lowered our expectation for services. So the back half of 2023, we did see a change relative to what we previously expected. The first half of 2023 came in exactly where we thought it was going to. And we saw the change in activity during the quarter. And that's what affected our second half of the year, the activity that we'll see in the -- we believe we'll see in the third and the fourth quarter.Simon William FlanneryRight. And the tower count, 5G?Daniel K. SchlangerIt hasn't moved much, Simon. It's not going to move in the course of a quarter. And I don't think we're going to update that quarter-to-quarter. That was try to give people a sense for where we were overall in terms of the 5G deployment and -- but it really hasn't moved that much from last quarter...Simon William FlanneryGreat. And then just one quick follow-up on the dividend. I think in the past, you said that there'd be minimal dividend growth in the next 2 years. And is there any change to that with this new guidance?Jay A. BrownWe're going to be on our normal course of giving guidance for the next year in October. And when we give that guidance for next year, we'll also update where we are with the dividend as we have done in past years. So I think you'll see us continue to follow that same historical pattern.OperatorThe next question is from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs.Brett Joseph FeldmanI was hoping we could gain a little more insight into how you're thinking about building the funnel of small cell nodes going forward. So we've moved through this surge period with the carriers, which was very focused on getting mid-band to a decent chunk of their existing sites. I think one of the questions we get is until we've reached the point where carriers have deployed mid-band across all their sites and maybe even expanded the densification of that on macros a bit more, what would be the basis for going in and starting to do more on the small cell side? So maybe if you could just give us some insights into like what those conversations are like, what's driving it? How you think about what could create more of an uplift around 5G small cell leasing? That would be great.Jay A. BrownThe driver for small cells is the constraint on the network that happens from a capacity standpoint. And as we see activity from consumers increase and where those concentrations of that increase occur, there is a need to increase network capacity. Initially, whenever there's a new generation of network deployed, they touch the macro sites as they've done over multiple cycles in the history of the company. And they have done that with 5G. So they've gone out and covered a significant portion of the country, provided capacity and coverage through that initial overbuild. And that's a very efficient and effective way to deploy spectrum. The places where they supplement with small cells are places where that capacity that's been created by overlaying 5G on towers has been consumed quickly. So underlying all of the conversations that we're having around network capacity and densification is the consumer demand and data growth from that consumer demand. And that traffic increase at the consumer level has continued to grow exponentially during this period of time. And so the pain points of that significant growth by the consumer and consumption of data usage is the places that drive the need for small cells.And as I think about what we've seen at kind of the market level, you can see that reflected in those -- in our results as we've colocated nodes across fiber that we built for other carriers at previous periods of time. And then over time, as data growth increases, carriers come back to those same locations because of the density of the population. They need to densify the network in those same areas, and so they come back and lay additional small cells across that fiber asset that we own. And I think you'll continue to see that play out.So if we're in a period of time, specifically to your question about spectrum bands, if we're in a period of time where the carriers have new spectrum or they haven't deployed spectrum in a particular market, our expectation would be that the first place that they'll go and deploy that spectrum would be across the macro sites that they're already on. And then as that spectrum band starts to begin to be used, then the pain points will be created around network capacity, and they'll solve that problem by using small cells in those areas of densification where the growth in data traffic drives the need for additional capacity.And I think that's what we're seeing. That's consistent with our conversations, the contractual arrangements that we have with the customers and the activity that we expect, both in terms of the growth we're talking about for 2023 and then moving to double-digit revenue growth in 2024 for small cells.Brett Joseph FeldmanGot it. And just a quick follow-up. It may be too soon for you to have any insight here, but are you seeing any evidence that the continued growth of fixed wireless is in any way shaping how or where carriers are deploying additional density in their networks?Jay A. BrownI think it is having some impact. And we talked about this a little bit on our last quarter call. Fixed wireless is a good example of a 5G use case. It's driven nice margins for our carrier customers. It is -- so it's good to see the revenue growth there and the returns from -- associated from the adoption of that product mix. And I think we believe we will see other uses for 5G beyond fixed wireless, but it does illustrate the pain points and the using up of capacity. And we've certainly seen areas in the country where fixed wireless has been deployed that -- I don't want to say which is first between the chicken and the egg, but the point is those are places where there have been increases in activity on the 5G networks. And they correlate with locations that we've also seen increases in small cell nodes and investment along those lines.OperatorThe next question is from Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research.Michael Ian RollinsJust a few follow-ups if I could. First, as you think about maybe the reasoning for the slower activity beyond just getting through the initial 5G surge, are you hearing from your customers that the mid-band spectrum they're deploying is getting better propagation so they just didn't need as much as maybe they initially thought in this first round of 5G capacity deployment? And I have a couple of others that I could ask afterwards if I could, please.Jay A. BrownSure. I'll take the first one, and then you can ask your others. They're not always specific with us as to the reasoning. But I probably wouldn't go quite as far as you did in terms of trying to get to causation there. I think it's the natural thing that we have expected would happen. We saw it happen with 4G. And we expected this day to come where they had overlaid a significant portion of their network and touched the sites, and then the surge would pass. So I think we're just at the stage where we've moved from that initial surge, and now we're at a point where we would expect to see continued growth over a very long period of time.So it feels like we've seen this movie before, and we're just moving to the next chapter of deploying a wireless network. And we're excited about continuing to deliver for the customers and what's going to be needed over a long period of time. And we look at the underlying driver of the need for the carriers to continue to do that. The consumer demand for wireless data is healthy and growing. And so it portends that, that investment will continue to come.Michael Ian RollinsAnd then second, you've held on to a larger services business than some of your peers. And does the recent variability of performance or as we're getting into these next phases of the 5G cycle, does this lead you to reconsider whether the services business is strategically important to Crown or whether there's opportunities to maximize value in someone else's hands?Jay A. BrownMike, I think in any business that we're in or any activity that we're in, that's always a question that we consider. What is the value of the business? What are the returns associated with that business? And is it going to ultimately drive shareholder returns, which, in our way of thinking is, is it helpful to us being able to grow the dividend over a long period of time. So we're asking those kinds of questions across the entire business. Obviously, the services business has been profitable for us and has been very profitable for us during the initial surge. We would not expect to see quite that level of profitability come out of the services division at lower levels of activity. And so we'll just have to evaluate as we do with everything in our business, what do we believe the forward look is on the activity and then make a good business decision around what makes sense from the products and services that we offer.Michael Ian RollinsAnd then just lastly, on the cost side, so you announced cost cuts for the second half of the year. Does that provide a follow-on benefit into the first half of 2024? And can you just unpack some of the sources of cost savings that the company has been able to identify?Jay A. BrownYes. We spoke to some of this earlier, Mike, on the question around services and it relates directly to that. There's a significant portion of variable costs in the services business. So as the revenues decline associated with that, we're going to see costs come out associated with that, which has a pretty meaningful impact to where we expect costs in the business to go for the balance of the year.We also made mention of SG&amp;A. We'll adjust there as we have done in the past through periods of time when the activity rises and falls. And so I don't know that there's anything in particular that I would point to, but just making good business decisions as we adjust for the level of activity that we see in the business and then being thoughtful about how we're able to continue to deliver for customers based on the activity that we're seeing in the business.Michael Ian RollinsAnd sorry, does this -- sorry, if I missed this. So this extrapolate into the first half of '24 as an expense benefit as well?Jay A. BrownThe cost structure in '24 will reflect whatever activity level we expect, and we'll update our guidance for '24 when we get to October. So there are components, obviously, of things that we do this year that roll over. But the cost structure in '24, I can't really answer that question without answering a revenue question. And we'll take the extra 3 months and give you guidance in October on what we think '24 cost structure is going to look like.OperatorThe next question is from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan.Philip A. CusickJust following up on a couple of things you talked about. Looking at history, carriers would move to densification after deployment, and you've talked about that in small cells. What do you see in towers? Is there any sign of that?Jay A. BrownSure. They're using towers to densify, and there will continue to be lease-up associated with that. So some portion of the contracted revenue growth that we were speaking to relates to sites that they're not on today that they'll be adding equipment to, and then portions of it are amendments to existing sites where they'll add more equipment to sites they're already on.Philip A. CusickAnd are you seeing any acceleration in that discussion?Jay A. BrownWell, I think broadly, what I would say, as we've mentioned, the surge of activity initially is -- we're coming off of those levels, but we're seeing good growth over a long period of time that we expect would continue. From this point forward, given where we are in the cycle, certainly, there will be densification to the extent that they can solve network capacity constraints with macro sites. That's the most efficient and effective way to deploy capital to create additional capacity in the network if there is a macro site that can solve the problem. So some portion of the growth that we'll see will be the investment of the capital around macro sites. And then if there is no macro site that can solve the challenge of the densification, then we would expect to see that activity come towards small cells. So we've seen in -- conversations are consistent with that. Our contractual arrangements are consistent with that. And I think we'll see that play out over the next several years.Philip A. CusickOkay. And then second, without an acceleration in the business, it looks like your '25 leverage is going to be more like mid-5x than the low where we are now. How should we think about your comfort with that and agencies as we get closer to it?Daniel K. SchlangerYes. As we talked about, our target leverage that we think is appropriate for the business at this point is around 5x. We've also said that it's going to fluctuate up and down. You saw this quarter is at 4.6. A lot of that has to do with the Sprint cancellations, but it has been below 5 for the last several quarters. There will be times where we invest in front of getting revenue and cash flows, where our debt to EBITDA will go up because we have the capital out before we get the cash flow. But over time, we would expect that to reverse. And therefore, the organic growth in our business would result in a lower leverage ratio going forward.So those fluctuations are natural. I think specifically, where would we get uncomfortable and say, okay, that's too high, I'm not exactly sure what that would be. But I think it really depends -- a lot like what Jay was talking about a second ago, it really depends on what the forward look of what that growth looks like. And if we're at 5.5x and we see a lot of EBITDA coming in the next year, and we can bring it down really quickly, I think we would be fine. I think the agencies would be fine with that. We've had that in the past.But if we think there's going to be continued investment and we needed to go fund that investment, we would even -- it's not our preference, but even if that requires equity because the returns in the investments that we're making we believe exceed our cost of capital, inclusive of any equity cost of that capital. And as long as that's the case, our job is to try to invest in projects that generate returns over and above our cost of capital. And as long as we believe we're doing that, we would. But hard to speak to exactly what happens in 2025 without understanding what the next several years are going to look like and how quickly that leverage would move up or down from there.OperatorThe next question is from Matthew Niknam of Deutsche Bank.Matthew NiknamI'm just curious if maybe you can speak to how some of the services activity progressed over the course of the quarter? Because it seems to be maybe more of a precipitous drop off in June. But if you can comment on that. And then as we think about the follow-on effect, I'm just wondering, I know there was a $10 million reduction for core new leasing on the tower side this year. Presumably, there may be more of a spillover effect into '24. And so I'm not necessarily asking for the guide, we'll wait 3 months for that. But I am just curious in the sense that are you comfortable with that 5% number each year between now and '27 ex Sprint churn? Or could that fluctuate and the 5% is more of like a multiyear average to consider?Jay A. BrownOn your first question around services decline, we did see a change over the course of the quarter. I mean, probably a level of precision that may not be broadly helpful, but as we got towards the second half of the quarter, towards the end of the quarter, we did see a greater decline than the period at the beginning of the second quarter. On your question around $10 million of leasing decline, any revenues that we signed this year have rollover into next year in the same way if we lower our expectation for leasing in this calendar year, then those revenues won't exist in the following year. So certainly, there's a follow-on effect to this.It's one of the great things about the business. It's why it's so predictable because we know the leases that we have in the business, and we know what the contracted escalations are going to be. And then as we've contracted forward the revenue growth, we can look at what those revenues are going to be and have a good sense of what they're going to be in future periods.So are we -- by our guidance of saying 5%, are we trying to put a precision on every 12-month period of time or every quarter going forward? No, that's not our intention to do that. We're trying to take a multiyear view and then look at what we think the growth is going to be over that multiyear period of time more from a CAGR standpoint of 5%. And I think history, which is as we laid out on Slide 4, I think it's helpful to see in and around a number, it moving a little up, a little down over that period of time. So wouldn't predict it with precision, but would expect that we can deliver over a period of time about 5% organic tower revenue growth on an annualized basis.OperatorNext question is from Brendan Lynch of Barclays.Brendan James LynchI just wanted to dig in a little bit more on the MLAs from a high level. Can you just remind us what creates the volatility quarter-to-quarter in the tower core leasing activity? Is it simply timing of demand above and beyond the contracted minimum step-up? Or is it related to leasing outside the MLAs or anything else?Jay A. BrownSure. It's those things that you mentioned. So there is some variability in the contract of when they'll actually go on air. So we have a committed amount. Sometimes those commitments are done earlier than the contractual amount, which will have some effect there. And then there are portions of the business that are not contracted. If you think about our forward growth, 75% is contracted, there's another 25% that is uncontracted at the moment and will have variability to it. So it's both of those factors across the entire population of our customers working themselves out in any given quarter or year.Brendan James LynchGreat. That's helpful. And then another one on the reduction in sustaining CapEx guidance by $25 million. It's going to be at the lowest level in 5 years. I'm wondering if that CapEx is just being deferred until next year? Or there is another reason for the change?Jay A. BrownNo, I don't think it's just deferred CapEx into next year. As we're continuing to operate the business well, we're always looking for opportunities to run it more efficiently and effectively. And so our operating teams have done a really nice job of maintaining our assets and looking for ways to be thoughtful about sustaining capital expenditures. And so you're highlighting something they've done a nice job at in the business.Daniel K. SchlangerI just wanted to clarify one thing there, Brendan. The reduction in sustaining capital is $15 million, not $25 million.OperatorThe next question is from Brandon Nispel of KeyBanc Capital Markets.Brandon Lee NispelGreat. I think 2 for Dan and sticking on the tower leasing thing. The new guide, $130 million in leasing is a 20% decline from last year. We're still coming off the surge in activity. What's that core leasing number look like in a normal environment? And then can -- Dan, can you split between us the second half from a leasing standpoint, the $60 million guide, how we should think about that 3Q and 4Q and whether or not the exit rate should inform how we think about 2024?Jay A. BrownI'll take the first question, and Dan can take the second one. Brandon, I don't know that we're going to give you much clarity -- much more clarity than we've already done around what we think the future leasing is going to look like. We think in a normal go-forward period of time, over a multiyear period, we're going to see about 5% tower organic revenue growth. And it's likely to move a little above, a little below that in certain periods. But I think generally, that's what our expectation would be. And that's what's driving our longer term if we think about value creation. When we talk about being able to get back to a point where we're growing the dividend 7% to 8% once we're beyond the Sprint site rationalization process that we're in the middle of. Once we're past that point, returning to being able to grow the dividend at 7% to 8% over a long period of time, underlying that is our assumption around top line growth. And we think that's going to be in and around 5% for a long period of time. So in particular as to what it's going to be in certain periods, we'll continue to do as we've done in the past. And when we get to October, we'll give you a view for 2024 what that lease-up will be.And I would expect we'll continue to try to give you some view of what our longer-term forecast will be for revenue growth. At the moment, that's about 5% as we think our best guess of what a normal leasing environment is going to look like.Daniel K. SchlangerYes. And Brandon, on your second question on the $60 million remaining to the tower leasing guide for the rest of the year, obviously, there were some questions in the first quarter why tower leasing for the first quarter was a little low. And then we came in with the second quarter, and it was directly in line with what our previous guide had been because if you add the 2 together, you got the $70 million of new leasing that's right halfway to the $140 million is in our previous guide.As we look forward, that $60 million, we would say what we said last time, which is it's probably very even. There's not a lot of fluctuation to it. But that doesn't mean that each quarter is going to be exactly 30 because there are fluctuations like Jay just spoke about. So I would assume it's going to be evenly split between the next 2 quarters. And it may move around here and there, but it won't be a significant change from the third quarter to fourth quarter.Jay A. BrownKate, maybe we can take one more question.OperatorThe next question is from David Guarino of Green Street Advisors.David Anthony GuarinoA question on your expectation for the 5% organic macro tower growth through '27. So on the remaining 25% of activity that you still need to secure, the assumptions you guys have in your model assume that comes just through densification or is there a new spectrum being made available? And then I have one more follow-up, please.Jay A. BrownSure. It's a combination of spectrum. When you say new spectrum, the way I would think about that is spectrum that's in the hands of carriers today that has not been deployed. Based on the spectrum that could be deployed over the next several -- or could be auctioned off in the next several years, I think inside of the time frame that we're talking about predicted growth, we're not assuming that there's an FCC auction followed by then a build-out of that spectrum.There is spectrum in the hands of carriers that has not been built out yet, and some portion of our future leasing is related to that spectrum that's in the hands of carriers and has not been built out yet. And also, as you referenced, there's also the expectation that spectrum that has been built out, they'll continue to densify that. So there's a component of both of those elements, but not an expectation that additional spectrum will be auctioned and then deployed in the next several years.David Anthony GuarinoOkay. That's helpful. And then the last one, just wanted to ask about the recent report that came out highlighting some of your tenants, the potential sizable cleanup costs they might have on some of their legacy telecom networks. And I know nothing has materialized on that yet, but I just wanted to know, did you consider any potential financial burden on your tenants when you reiterated that 5% guidance through '27?Jay A. BrownWe have not seen any behavior change from our carrier customers, and so I'll let them speak to what the impact to their business will be of those recent news reports. But obviously, they're very healthy and have a long history of being able to navigate through various cycles. And the wireless business and the demand from the consumer, we think, is going to continue unabated. And so we would expect to see continued investment as they improve their network and improve the margins in their business over a long period of time from improving their network associated with that growth in demand.Thanks, everyone, for joining the call this morning. We look forward to catching you up in October as we give our guidance for 2024 if we don't see you before then. Thanks for joining.OperatorThank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.]"

Investors scrutinize year-over-year changes in earnings — or funds from operations for REITs — and revenue. But stocks can experience significant fluctuations depending on whether they beat or fall short of analyst estimates. And companies that lower forward guidance from previous forecasts can get crushed.Take a look at some of the initial second-quarter operating results from various REITs and how Wall Street has been reacting to them.Equity LifeStyle Properties Inc. (NYSE:ELS) is a residential REIT that owns and operates manufactured home communities, RV resorts and campgrounds. It owns 450 investment properties throughout North America, including 225 RV resorts, 202 mobile home communities and 23 marinas.After the bell on July 17, Equity LifeStyle Properties announced its second-quarter operating results. Funds from operations (FFO) of $0.66 was in line with analyst estimates but 2 cents higher than FFO of $0.64 in the second quarter of 2022. Revenue of $370 million missed estimates for $376.33 million but was 1.29% above revenue of $365.31 million in the second quarter of 2022.Equity LifeStyle Properties also released full-year 2023 guidance on FFO with a range of $2.80 to $2.90 per share. The average analyst's estimate was $2.85.The day after the release, Equity LifeStyle shares were down about $2 but have bounced back nicely over the past few days.Equity LifeStyle Properties’ most recent dividend payout was $0.45 per share, putting the REIT’s dividend yield at 2.5%.Check out:This REIT just teamed up with the company that built Elon Musk's tiny house to develop affordable housing communities. Here's how you can be among the first to buy shares.Story continuesPrologis Inc. (NYSE:PLD) is a San Francisco-based industrial REIT founded in 1983. Prologis has long been a stalwart in the ownership and management of approximately 1.2 billion square feet in 5,500 industrial logistics properties throughout the U.S. and 18 other countries.Its occupancy rate at the end of May was 97.5%.On July 18, Prologis announced its second-quarter operating results. FFO of $1.83 was $0.16 better than estimates and up 64.86% from FFO of $1.11 in the second quarter of 2022. Revenue of $1.65 billion missed the estimate of $1.69 billion but was 50.73% higher than revenue of $110 billion in the second quarter of 2022. Prologis also increased its 2023 full-year guidance from $5.42-$5.50 to $5.56-$5.60.Despite the year-over-year improvements, Wall Street was not happy with the revenue miss and took the stock down about 6% in the first two days following the report. Prior to the earnings announcement, Prologis had run up from $117 to just under $130, so it wasn't that surprising to see a ""buy on the rumor, sell on the news"" reaction, despite some fairly good FFO and revenue numbers.Prologis’ most recent dividend was $0.87 per share, putting its yield at 2.83%.SL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE:SLG) is a New York City-based office REIT and the largest office building landlord in New York. As of June 30, SL Green Realty held interests in 60 buildings, totaling 33.1 million square feet. Many income-oriented investors like owning SL Green Realty for its monthly paying dividend.After the closing bell on July 19, SL Green Realty reported second-quarter operating results. FFO of $1.43 was down 23.53% from FFO of $1.87 in the second quarter of 2022 but beat the estimates by $0.09. Rental revenue of $165.65 million was better than rental revenue of $136.5 million in the second quarter of 2022. Total revenue of $221.07 million was above estimates for $205.97 million.After running up over 5% the day before earnings were announced, SL Green Realty was down 8% the morning after its results were announced.SL Green Realty currently has a 9.04% dividend yield. Its most recent dividend payment was $0.27 per share.Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI) is a Houston-based specialized REIT focused on owning, operating and long-term leasing of cell towers. Crown Castle owns more than 40,000 cell towers and 85,000 route miles of fiber and has 120,000 small cells in its portfolio.Crown Castle works with businesses and governments to design and build solutions that meet connectivity needs like wireless coverage and custom fiber optic networks. It has a market cap of $50.84 billion, making it one of the largest REITs in the U.S.On July 19, Crown Castle reported its second-quarter operating results after the closing bell. FFO of $2.05 was up from $1.80 in the second quarter of 2022 and $0.04 better than analyst estimates. Revenue of $1.87 billion was ahead of estimates for $1.86 billion and was 7.67% higher than revenue of $1.73 billion in the second quarter of 2022.Crown Castle's full-year 2023 guidance on adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) was a midpoint of $7.54, below its previous guidance of $7.63. Crown Castle also cut its outlook for adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) by $50 million.Wall Street focused on the lower guidance numbers and sent Crown Castle down almost 6% in premarket trading.Crown Castle has a dividend yield of 5.52% with its most recent payout being $1.57 per share.Based on the preliminary results, it appears that any REIT that falls short of revenue estimates or provides weaker guidance is likely to experience a decline in share price, regardless of whether FFO exceeds expectations or compares favorably to its second-quarter 2022 figures.Weekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it's too late.

CCI reported second-quarter 2023 adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) per share of $2.05, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.99. The reported figure climbed 13.9% from the year-ago quarter’s tally of $1.80.  Net revenues of $1.87 billion, too, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.86 billion and increased 7.6% year over year.Results reflect better-than-anticipated revenues aided by robust site-rental revenue growth. However, the company lowered its outlook for 2023, citing that it expects a decline in tower activity for the remainder of the year due to reduced network spending by wireless carriers.Per Jay Brown, chief executive officer of the company, “Expected growth in our core business in 2023 remains robust, including 5% tower organic growth, 10,000 small cell node deployments and returning to 3% fiber solutions growth by the end of the year. Longer term, as our customers spend to meet the significant increase in mobile data demand in the U.S, we have visibility to continued growth in our core business.”Quarter in DetailDuring the second quarter, CCI’s site-rental revenues came in at $1.73 billion, up 10.3% year over year. The organic contribution of $155 million to the site rental revenues reflected 11.9% growth. When adjusted for the impact of Sprint cancellations, organic contribution to site rental revenues represented 4.2% growth. Our estimate for site-rental revenues was pegged at $1.68 billion.On the other hand, services and other revenues fell 16.8% year over year to $139 million. We estimated the same to be $180.5 million.CCI’s quarterly operating expenses increased 5.2% year over year to $1.20 billion. The operating income climbed 12.5% to $667 million. The quarterly adjusted EBITDA of $1.19 billion rose 10.2% year over year.Crown Castle reported capital expenditures of $379 million in the quarter. This comprised discretionary capital expenditures of $361 million and sustaining capital expenditures of $18 million. Discretionary capital expenditures primarily attributable to Fiber were around $298 million, and that to Towers was roughly $57 million.Story continuesBalance SheetCrown Castle exited second-quarter 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $276 million, up from $187 million reported as of Mar 31, 2023.Moreover, debt and other long-term obligations aggregated $21.6 billion as of Jun 30, 2023, increasing marginally sequentially.2023 Guidance RevisedCrown Castle, anticipating lower tower activity for the remainder of 2023 due to a reduction in network spending by wireless carriers, decreased its AFFO per share guidance in the range of $7.50-$7.58 from its prior estimation of $7.58-$7.68. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $7.64.The company maintained its expectations for site rental revenues between $6.488 billion and $6.533 billion. It stated that the long-term leasing agreements with its customers are likely to have little impact on its site rental revenues.Adjusted EBITDA is now projected in the band of $4.399-$4.444 billion, revised from $4.449-$4.494 billion estimated earlier.Crown Castle currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The lawsuits citing the Eighth Amendment focus on the idea that the drug pricing would prompt excessive tax or excessive fines.

Though a favorable trend was observed in the study’s other primary endpoint of overall survival (“OS”), the data is yet to mature to determine whether the same has been achieved or not. Until this is determined, management will continue to follow-up on patients in the KEYNOTE-A18 study. There were no new safety signals reported in the study and the safety profile of Keytruda was in line with observations in its previously-conducted studies.Merck plans to present the results at a future medical meeting and also submit the same to regulatory authorities for label expansion in cervical cancer indication.Keytruda is currently approved in the United States for two indications in cervical cancer — as a single agent as well as a combination therapy with Keytruda — to treat certain cervical cancer patients whose tumors express PD-L1.Merck’s shares have lost 4.5% year to date compared with the industry’s 0.3% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPer management, more than half of the patients with high-risk locally advanced gastric cancer experience disease recurrence within two years. Not only do these patients often have a poor prognosis, but also have limited options beyond standard-of-care treatments. The results from the KEYNOTE-A18 study show that Keytruda plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS compared with concurrent chemoradiotherapy alone.Merck’s Keytruda is already approved for the treatment of many cancers globally. Keytruda sales are gaining from continued strong momentum in metastatic indications, including in some types of NSCLC, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, TNBC and MSI-H cancers and a rapid uptake across recent earlier-stage launches.Story continuesKeytruda is continuously growing and expanding into new indications and markets globally. Numerous recent approvals and the expected launch of many additional indications, including in earlier lines of therapy can further boost sales.

Solid commercial delivery figures, along with robust aftermarket services trend, are likely to have boosted Boeing’s second-quarter earnings. Yet, abnormal costs associated with 787 might adversely impact its overall quarterly results.Solid Commercial Deliveries to Aid ResultsBoeing’s second-quarter deliveries reflect a solid 12.4% surge in commercial shipments from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. However, defense shipments declined 5% year over year.For manufacturing companies like Boeing, successful deliveries of finished products play a crucial role in boosting revenue growth. Therefore, such a significant improvement in the jet maker’s deliveries for its commercial segment is expected to benefit its overall second-quarter results.The Boeing Company Price and EPS SurpriseThe Boeing Company Price and EPS SurpriseThe Boeing Company price-eps-surprise | The Boeing Company QuoteWhile the jet giant’s military business revenues accounted for almost 35% of its total revenues as of 2022-end, the commercial business contributed 39%. Therefore, improvement in Boeing’s commercial shipment is likely to have outweighed the decline in defense shipment, thereby aiding its overall top-line performance.Expectations for BGSWe remain optimistic about Boeing Global Services (BGS) unit’s second-quarter performance. Notably, steadily growing domestic and international air travel are expected to have bolstered fleet utilization, thereby boosting aftermarket commercial jet services in the second quarter of 2023. Meanwhile all 737 Max operators having returned to flying this jet as of Mar 31, 2023, must have also bolstered aftermarket services revenue for Boeing in the soon to be reported quarter.This, along with several BA converted freighter and materials management agreements in the recent past, is likely to have added an impetus to BGS’ second-quarter revenues.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the unit’s revenues is pegged at $4,571 million, indicating an improvement of 6.4% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.The consensus mark for earnings is pinned at $753.7 million, indicating growth of 3.5% from the prior-year quarter’s level.Cash Flow ProjectionsHigher jet deliveries, especially that of 737 aircraft in the past couple of quarters, along with the recent strong order activity and increased aftermarket services, are expected to have contributed to Boeing’s second-quarter cash flow reserve.Q2 ExpectationsConsidering the aforementioned discussion, we remain optimistic about BA’s overall second-quarter revenue and earnings performance. However, expected abnormal costs in relation to the 787 program, along with periodic expenses, might have had an adverse impact on its bottom line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Boeing’s total revenues is pegged at $18.46 billion, implying a 10.7% improvement from the prior-year period’s reported figure. The bottom-line estimate is pinned at a loss of 99 cents per share, indicating a significant deterioration from the year-ago quarter’s reported loss of 37 cents.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Boeing this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.

Upon receipt of the 103(g) finding from the NRC, no further NRC findings are necessary in order for Southern Nuclear to load fuel and begin the startup sequence.The team at the site continues preparations for Unit 4 fuel load and start up. All 157 fuel assemblies required for the operation of the Unit 4 reactor have been delivered to the site. Each fuel assembly measuring 14 feet tall was inspected and transferred to the new fuel storage racks before being placed into the spent fuel pool where all the assemblies will be stored until they are loaded into the Unit 4 reactor during fuel load.The new Vogtle units are an essential part of Georgia Power's commitment to delivering clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to its 2.7 million customers. Once operating, each of the new units can produce enough electricity to power an estimated 500,000 homes and businesses.

MAA is slated to report second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 26 after market close.The Germantown, TN-based residential REIT delivered a surprise of 1.33% in terms of FFO per share in the last reported quarter. Its quarterly results were driven by an increase in the average effective rent per unit for the same-store portfolio.MAA has a decent surprise history. Over the trailing four quarters, MAA surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on all occasions, the average being 2.22%. This is depicted in the chart below:Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.US Residential Real Estate Market in Q2Despite cooling rent growth, apartment demand is showing signs of a solid rebound, with net absorption in the second quarter of 2023 nearing surging new supply levels. This stabilizes occupancy rates after a steep decline in 2022.Per RealPage data, in the second quarter, net demand registered at 83,449 units, and this marked a five-quarter high. While this is still below the record numbers seen during the 2021 boom, it indicates a normalization of apartment demand. What is interesting is that this demand rebound coincides with a 50-year high in apartment construction starting to convert into peak completions, with more than 107,000 units completed in the second quarter of this year itself.However, despite the supply surge, this solid demand is aiding in the mitigation of vacancy spikes in most markets, with U.S. apartment occupancy coming at 94.7% as of June, marking only a 0.1 percentage point decline since January. It marks a notable improvement compared to the occupancy fall of 1.2 percentage points in the first half of 2022 and then an additional 1.4 percentage points in the second half of the year.However, rent growth remains below normal in 2023, with year-over-year effective asking rent growth at just 1.5%. This is due to apartment operators prioritizing occupancy rates over rents, leading to more options for renters and putting downward pressure on rent growth. Same-store effective asking rents increased only 0.46% between May and June 2023.Story continuesMAA's Portfolio and StrategyAmid these, MAA’s diversified Sunbelt portfolio is well-poised to benefit from the favorable fundamentals of this market. The pandemic accelerated employment shifts and a population inflow into the company’s markets as renters seek more business-friendly, lower-taxed and low-density cities. These favorable longer-term secular dynamic trends are increasing the desirability of its markets.Additionally, MAA has been investing in its existing properties to attract new tenants and retain current ones. The company has been upgrading its amenities and technology to meet the evolving needs of renters. These improvements are likely to result in higher occupancy rates and rental income for MAA.Particularly, MAA continues to implement its three internal investment programs — interior redevelopment, property repositioning projects and Smart Home installations. The programs are expected to have helped the company capture the upside potential in rent growth, generate accretive returns and boost earnings from its existing asset base.However, the struggle to lure renters will persist as supply volumes are expected to remain elevated in some markets. This is likely to affect the company’s power to raise the rent or increase occupancy.Projections for Q2 2023We expect same-store net operating income to increase 5.7% year over year in the second quarter. Meanwhile, we project average physical occupancy of 95.8%, slightly higher than the prior quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $534.16 million. This suggests a 7.9% rise from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.MAA projected second-quarter 2023 core funds from operations (FFO) per share in the band of $2.18-$2.34, with $2.26 being the midpoint.Before the second-quarter earnings release, the company’s activities were not adequate to gain analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly FFO per share has remained unchanged at $2.27 in the past month. However, this suggests year-over-year growth of 12.4%.Here Is What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict a surprise in terms of FFO per share for MAA this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an FFO beat, which is not the case here.MAA currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of -0.66%.

That’s not good news if you’re considering investing in footwear stocks like NKE.Miranda states that Nike was a major beneficiary of the consumer largesse delivered in the form of pandemic stimulus money. Now that it’s gone and interest rate hikes are hitting people in the pocketbook, getting the latest pair of Air Jordans is not nearly as important. Like all businesses, Nike’s experiencing some weakness in its business model, and sneakers are an easy expense to cut as the interest rates increase.People will keep their wallets slammed shut until something hits the streets that is irresistible. Even though consumers might resist their temptation to spend in this environment of higher interest rates, there will always be brands that are exceptions to the rule. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIn the long run, you can’t count Nike out.

However, it has significantly outperformed Nike, so shareholders can celebrate this victory. In fact, over the past decade, it’s outdone Nike by five-fold and the index by more than 3x. I have followed Lululemon for more than a decade. Its DNA is all about quality, comfort, and style. Regarding footwear, I can testify that the brand’s sneakers are super comfortable. My 70-something mother-in-law bought a pair a few months back and she won’t use anything else now for her daily walk. In November 2022, Lululemon was given Footwear News’ Launch of the Year Award. It’s not surprising, given my anecdotal evidence of its footwear quality. Story continues“‘It feels like a long time coming that women get a shoe that’s built for us,’ said Colleen Quigley, a track-and-field athlete and Lululemon ambassador. ‘As a brand that has long been driving innovation, inclusivity and accessibility, it’s especially fitting, and personally very exciting for me that Lululemon is entering footwear with a women’s running shoe,’” Footwear News reported Quigley’s comments. Investors continue to underestimate Canada’s greatest apparel success story. With its footwear line off to such a great start, it could soon also be Canada’s greatest footwear success story. It remains one of my 10 favorite stocks for the long haul.Deckers Brands (DECK)A photograph of a person running along the side of a road.Source: It for you / Shutterstock.comDeckers Brands (NYSE:DECK) stock has more than doubled in the past year due largely to its Hoka sneaker brand. It’s a big reason the company changed its name from Deckers Outdoor. The company has become a footwear powerhouse with two billion-dollar brands and counting. Its updated branding reflects that it’s much more than UGG. The first time I wrote about Deckers for InvestorPlace was in October 2011. I recommended that investors forget about Crocs (NASDAQ:CROX) and buy Deckers instead. I wrote at the time: “Deckers might appear to be an overnight sensation, but it has taken almost four decades to get where it is today, which is at the pinnacle of footwear success. Gradual change is at the heart of its business. For instance, as of the end of the second quarter, it had 30 retail stores open in the U.S. and elsewhere. Meanwhile, Crocs has 397 stores or kiosks open worldwide, 10 times more than Deckers.”At the time, its shares were trading for less than $100. It had generated $1.38 billion in annual sales and an operating profit of $284.84 million. Today, its share price is over $530, and its 2022 revenue was $3.63 billion, with an operating profit of $652.75 million. That’s compound annual growth of 9.2% for revenue and 7.8% for operating income. That might seem like a little. However, a big chunk of the growth came in the past three years.In 2011, Hoka wasn’t even part of the company. It acquired the business in late 2012 for approximately $8.8 million. At the time, the brand had roughly $3 million in sales. In 2023, they were $1.41 billion. A third billion-dollar brand would almost certainly send its share price to four digits. Skechers (SKX)sketchers show store. sleeper stocksSource: ThamKC / Shutterstock.comOver the years, Skechers (NYSE:SKX) has had its ups and downs. However, its long-term performance for shareholders is undeniable. A $10,000 investment in SKX in 2008 is worth $81,265. That’s $33,030 better than the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY).The difference buys a lot of Nike’s. It’s been a while since I’ve taken a closer look at Skechers. As a golfer, I am intrigued by their Go Golf Elite Slip ‘In golf shoes. Not only are they supposed to be super comfortable and light, but they’re also waterproof. That’s huge. And, of course, they’re easy to slip on and off. I just bought a pair of Adidas (OTCMKTS:ADDYY) golf shoes. While similar in price and comfort, I don’t believe my shoes are waterproof, granting a big competitive edge for the new Skechers. Looking at its Q1 2023 results, its direct-to-consumer business is doing very well with revenue growth of 24.5%, to $707.3 million, with a gross profit margin of 66.0%. That’s 100 basis points higher than a year ago. Its DTC sales account for 35.3% of its overall business, up 410 basis points from Q1 2022. It should represent half the business in a year or so if it keeps up this pace. Trading at 1.07x sales — NKE is 3.30x sales — you’re getting growth at a reasonable price.   On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The bottom line decreased 14% from the year-ago quarter.Results were adversely impacted by a decline in net interest income (NII), a rise in non-interest expenses and higher provisions. However, higher rates, decent loan demand and a rise in deposit balances were the major positives. Nevertheless, non-interest income also increased for the quarter.Shares of ZION gained 5.9% in after-market trading hours despite lower-than-expected results.Net income attributable to common shareholders was $166 million, down 14.9% year over year. Our estimate for the metric was $165.8 million.Revenues Improve, Expenses RiseNet revenues (tax equivalent) were $791 million, which increased 2.2% year over year. The top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $757.3 million.NII was $591 million, marginally declining year over year. The fall was mainly driven by an increase in interest paid on deposits and short-term borrowings. It was also impacted by a reduction in interest-earning assets and a significant increase in interest-bearing liabilities. However, the net interest margin (NIM) expanded 5 basis points (bps) to 2.92%. Our estimates for NII and NIM were $630 million and 2.86%, respectively.Non-interest income came in at $189 million, increasing 9.9% year over year. This was mainly attributable to a rise in capital markets fees, wealth management fees, commercial account fees, and dividends and other income. We had projected non-interest income to be lower on the back of a challenging operating backdrop. However, a slight improvement in the operating environment in the later part of the quarter seems to have helped the company report higher numbers.In the reported quarter, ZION recorded nil net securities gains compared to a gain of $1 million in the prior-year quarter.Adjusted non-interest expenses were $494 million, up 6.7% year over year. We had expected this metric to be $457 million.Story continuesThe efficiency ratio was 62.5%, up from 60.7% in the prior-year period. A rise in the efficiency ratio indicates a decrease in profitability.As of Jun 30, 2023, net loans and leases held for investment were $56.3 billion, up 1% from the prior quarter. Total deposits were $74.3 billion, up 7.4% sequentially.Credit Quality: Mixed BagThe ratio of non-performing assets to loans and leases, as well as other real estate owned, contracted 9 bps year over year to 0.30%.In the reported quarter, the company recorded net loan and lease charge-offs of $13 million compared with $9 million in the prior-year quarter. The provision for credit losses was $46 million, up 12.2% from $41 million in the prior-year quarter. We had projected provisions of $49 million for the second quarter.Capital Ratios Improve &amp; Profitability Ratios DeteriorateTier 1 leverage ratio was 8.1% as of Jun 30, 2023 compared with 7.4% at the end of the prior-year quarter. Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 10.7% increased from 10.6%.Further, as of Jun 30, 2023, the common equity tier 1 capital ratio was 10%, which increased from 9.9% in the prior-year period.At the end of the second quarter, the return on average assets was 0.79%, down from 0.91% as of Jun 30, 2022. Also, the return on average tangible common equity was 10%, down from 12.5% in the year-ago quarter.Share RepurchasesIn the reported quarter, the company did not repurchase any shares.Our TakeZions’ strong balance-sheet position, business-simplifying efforts, higher interest rates and a rise in loan demand bode well for the future.

Nonetheless, it grew 2.8% from the prior-year quarter.However, USB's results benefited from an increase in NII, supported by higher interest rates. Also, an increase in non-interest income and moderate loan growth were positives. On the flip side, higher expenses and deterioration of the company’s credit quality were headwinds.Citizens Financial Group CFG reported second-quarter 2023 earnings per share of 92 cents, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1. Nonetheless, the bottom line rose from 67 cents in the year-ago quarter.Results reflected NII growth on a rise in interest-earning assets.

205,7166e3a9-ce7c-3d91-b5bd-cce4ae78330e,WFC,2023-07-21,Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wells-fargo-company-wfc-trending-130012112.html,1689858012,STORY,['WFC'],"[Wells Fargo (WFC) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this biggest U.S. mortgage lender have returned +11.1%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, which Wells Fargo falls in, has gained 7.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Wells Fargo is expected to post earnings of $1.24 per share, indicating a change of -4.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +3% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.84 points to a change of +54.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +2.5%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.71 indicates a change of -2.8% from what Wells Fargo is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.9%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Wells Fargo is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Wells Fargo, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $20.14 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +3.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $81.14 billion and $79.28 billion estimates indicate +10% and -2.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryWells Fargo reported revenues of $20.53 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +20.6%. EPS of $1.25 for the same period compares with $0.74 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.27 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.28%. The EPS surprise was +8.7%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Wells Fargo is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Wells Fargo. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The U.S. health regulator is expected to decide on the use of Pfizer's vaccine in pregnant women by August.Data from Pfizer's late-stage study for maternal use of the vaccine had shown the shot was 82% effective in preventing severe infections in infants when given to expecting mothers in the second half of their pregnancy.The vaccine was nearly 67% effective for those aged 60 and older with two or more symptoms of RSV, and 85.7% against severe illness defined by three or more symptoms in a late-stage trial.The European Medicines Agency's recommendations are usually taken into consideration by the European Commission for its final decision on drug or vaccine approvals.Sanofi and partner AstraZeneca's long-acting therapy against RSV infections was approved last year by the European Commission for use in infants.(Reporting by Bhanvi Satija and Raghav Mahobe in Bengaluru; Editing by Devika Syamnath)]"

The latter are used in surgeries or intensive care units for patients who are placed on ventilators, said Mike Ganio, who studies drug shortages at the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists.The Pfizer site does not make or store the company's COVID-19 vaccine or treatments Comirnaty and Paxlovid.HOW BIG IS THE SITE?Pfizer bought the eastern North Carolina factory in 2015 as part of its acquisition of the drugmaker Hospira.There is more than 1.4 million square feet of manufacturing space, or the equivalent of more than 24 football fields, and 22 packaging lines.Pfizer says well over 2,000 people work there.HOW WILL THIS AFFECT HOSPITAL DRUG SUPPLIES?It will likely lead to some long-term shortages while Pfizer shifts production to other locations or rebuilds, said Erin Fox, senior pharmacy director at University of Utah Health.“If Pfizer falls out, it makes it that much harder for other companies to make up the difference,” Fox said.The specifics of which drugs might be involved in a shortage and how long that shortage will go aren't clear.“Anyone who is aware of this event is basically holding their collective breath at this point, hoping for the best and waiting for news,” Ganio said.Story continuesHe noted that drugmakers tend to ship finished products quickly from manufacturing sites, which may limit how much inventory was damaged by the twister.HOW CAN HOSPITALS HANDLE SHORTAGES?They have several tools to soften the impact for patients.Some hospitals have started increasing inventories of stored drugs instead of relying on regular deliveries from a wholesaler. Ganio said that it's particularly true of drugs that hospital executives know will be hard to get.Hospitals also may switch to different forms of a drug by giving a patient an antibiotic pill instead of an IV if that person can handle it. If a larger vial size of a drug is more readily available, they may order that and then fill several syringes with smaller doses ready for use.AREN’T HOSPITALS ALREADY DEALING WITH DRUG SHORTAGES?Yes, it's been happening for years. But recently, hospitals have been dealing with shortages for things like chemotherapy drugs, pain medications and local anesthetics.The impact of drug shortages isn't limited to hospitals. The also affect more routine care delivered through drugstores and doctor's offices.Overall, there were 309 active drug shortages in the U.S. at the end of June, according to the University of Utah Drug Information Service. That’s up from 295 at the end of last year and the highest total recorded since 2014.WHAT WILL PFIZER DO?The company hasn’t said what happens next. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said Thursday on Twitter that the company was “working urgently to determine the best way to get back online as quickly as possible, while ensuring the safety of our people.”Drugmakers can shift manufacturing to other locations. But that can be complicated because they must reroute raw materials — usually made elsewhere — to other locations and may have to train workers to make a product.Pfizer also may have to figure out whether to cut production of another product to squeeze in more manufacturing at the new site.“It’s not always as easy as just flipping a switch to increase production,” Ganio said.___This story has been updated to show that the North Carolina plant makes nearly 25% of Pfizer's sterile injectables used in U.S. hospitals, not nearly 25% of all injectables used in U.S. hospitals.___Associated Press reporters Gary Robertson in Raleigh, North Carolina, and JoNel Aleccia in Temecula, California, contributed to this report.

This compares to earnings of $2.59 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 7.28%.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $24.02 billion.

Never be left in the dust again.TeslaTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) late Wednesday reported earnings of $0.91 per share - surpassing the $0.79 Wall Street consensus - on better-than-expected revenue of $24.93, and margins were also less bad than feared.Still, shares sank 9.7% in Thursday trading.Excluding regulatory credits, gross margins - which have been closely watched following recent price cuts on Tesla's electric vehicles - fell 6.8% to 18.2% in Q2 from the prior year, better than analysts' estimates of 16.9%.The price cuts helped the EV giant boost its installed base and rake in new customers, with vehicle deliveries surging 86% to 466,140 EVs in Q2, marking a record quarter for the company.Wedbush called the move a ""smart strategy,"" saying after the report that the price cuts ""have been in a homerun success in China, Europe, and the US… In a nutshell, we view Tesla where Apple was in the 2008/2009 period as Cupertino was just starting to monetize its services and golden ecosystem with the Street not seeing the broader golden vision at the time.""Needham and Company reiterated its Hold rating due to valuation, adding that it leans ""more bullish when thinking about TSLA's positioning vs legacy [original equipment manufacturer] peers.""Goldman Sachs said the report was ""solid"" but that headwinds remain, reiterating its Neutral rating on the stock. Bofa also reiterated Neutral given risks from price cuts, increasing competition, and near-term macro considerations - while also noting the positive factors of cost reduction and ""its ability to remain agile.""Wells Fargo, meanwhile, said Tesla delivered ""a low quality"" EPS beat ""driven mostly by other income.""Story continuesNetflixNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) dropped 8.4% on Thursday, following mixed Q2 earnings: While EPS of $3.29 came in better than the consensus of $2.84, revenue of $8.19 billion missed the consensus estimate of $8.27B.The company added 5.9 million paid net subscribers in Q2 as it successfully rolled out paid sharing to more than 100 countries, representing over 80% of its total revenue. Buyside expectations were around 4M net subscriber additions.Evercore ISI lifted the price target to $550 after ""a mother of a quarter"" and removed its Tactical Underperform rating on the stock. The firm blamed the move lower in shares on expectations correction, and not a fundamental correction, and ""would encourage investors to buy NFLX shares on this (small) pullback.""BofA, meanwhile, bumped the price target by $35 to $525 per share on Buy-rated NFLX shares. The analysts said the results were ""healthy,"" adding:Within the Media ecosystem, we believe NFLX’s depth/breadth of content positions them well to withstand the production reductions.IBMInternational Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) shares rose more than 2% after better-than-expected Q2 earnings of $2.18 a share on below-par sales of $15.58B.IBM said it continues to expect full-year 2023 constant currency revenue growth of 3% to 5%. At current foreign exchange rates, currency is expected to be neutral to revenue growth.UBS reiterated a Sell rating and a $110 per share price target on IBM stock, as the analysts believe the reiterated guidance bears a risk: They say they expect revenue to come in at the low end of the full-year 2023 ""implied"" guidance.BofA, however, kept its Buy rating on the stock and raised the price target by $8 to $160 per share, saying, ""We believe the turnaround at IBM ([revenue] growth and [free cash flow] improvement) will continue. The company has a defensive portfolio, attractive dividend yield and an underappreciated AI portfolio.""Goldman SachsGoldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on Wednesday said earnings per share plunged 60% to $3.08 in Q2, missing estimates, on lower revenue of $10.89B that squeaked past consensus.Still, shares ticked up by 1% in Wednesday trading.The results were attributed to one-off charges related to the banking giant's home improvement lending group GreenSky and losses on its consumer and real estate loan portfolios. Company top brass had already previously warned that this would be a challenging quarter.Investment banking fees also dropped by 20% to $1.43B, which trading revenue from fixed income, currency, and commodities slipped by more than a fourth.Like some of its banking rivals, Goldman's investment and trading business has suffered from a slowdown in dealmaking followed by a string of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes that have put pressure on the U.S. economy.Yasin Ebrahim, Liz Moyer, Senad Karaahmetovic, and Davit Kirakosyan contributed to this report.__Related Articles4 big earnings hits: Tesla beats but shares sink; Netflix takes a slideAnalysis-Novatek set to oust Gazprom as Russia's top gas supplier to EuropeEuropean Union agrees post-Brexit rules for hedge funds]"

This company, which is in the Zacks Beverages - Alcohol industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This beer maker has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 65.17%.For the most recent quarter, Molson Coors was expected to post earnings of $0.26 per share, but it reported $0.54 per share instead, representing a surprise of 107.69%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.06 per share, while it actually produced $1.30 per share, a surprise of 22.64%.With this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Molson Coors. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Molson Coors has an Earnings ESP of +20.90% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on August 1, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

The company is likely to report top and bottom-line declines when it reports the second-quarter 2023 results.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.59 per share, which suggests a decline of 26.1% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. However, the consensus mark has moved up by a penny in the past seven days. For second-quarter 2023 revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $24.9 billion, suggesting an 8.7% decline from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 22.2%. Its earnings outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 23.4%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.Archer Daniels Midland Company Price and EPS Surprise Archer Daniels Midland Company Price and EPS SurpriseArcher Daniels Midland Company price-eps-surprise | Archer Daniels Midland Company QuoteKey Factors to NoteArcher Daniels has been exposed to headwinds, including higher performance-related compensation, project-related costs and shifting costs from business segments into the centralized centers of excellence in the supply chain and operations. These are likely to have led to a continued rise in SG&amp;A expenses in the to-be-reported quarter. As a percentage of sales, we expect SG&amp;A expenses to increase 30 basis points to 3.3% in the second quarter.The company has also been reeling under the global impacts of inflation. It expects corporate costs for 2023 to be $1.5 billion, driven primarily by inflation and higher interest expenses. This is likely to get reflected in the company’s second-quarter cost performance, impacting margins.Our model predicts the cost of products sold, as a percentage of sales, to expand 100 bps year over year to 93.3% in the second quarter. Lower sales and higher cost of products sold rate are likely to result in a soft gross margin in the quarter. We estimate the gross margin to contract 100 bps to 6.7% in the to-be-reported quarter. On a dollar basis, gross profit is expected to decline 24.2% year over year in the second quarter.The overall Nutrition segment’s results in second-quarter 2023 are expected to be impacted by continued declines in Animal Nutrition performance because of weaker margins in amino acids. The decline is, however, likely to have been partially offset by Human Nutrition delivering almost flat year-over-year results on strong Flavors and SI growth.Nevertheless, Archer Daniels has been gaining from solid demand, improved productivity, product innovations and persistent growth. On its last reported quarter’s earnings call, management revealed its expectations of strong demand for vegetable oil and ethanol, driven largely by robust demand for biodiesel and renewable diesel.ADM expects resilient food demand to drive higher volumes and margins in starches, sweeteners and wheat milling. It expects positive contributions from productivity and innovation initiatives across the company, driving value throughout 2023. Gains from these efforts are also likely to have contributed to the company’s second-quarter performance.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Archer Daniels this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Archer Daniels currently has an Earnings ESP of -0.23% and a Zacks Rank #3.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat.Molson Coors TAP has an Earnings ESP of +20.90% and sports a Zacks Rank #1 at present.

228,d91ad2e9-9986-38b7-b678-0dc3542b5aec,GM,2023-07-21,Analysts Estimate Harley-Davidson (HOG) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-harley-davidson-hog-140234038.html,1689861754,STORY,"['HOG', 'GM']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Harley-Davidson (HOG) reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 27. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis motorcycle maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.42 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -2.7%.Revenues are expected to be $1.29 billion, up 1.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Harley-Davidson?For Harley-Davidson, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -4.24%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Harley-Davidson will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Harley-Davidson would post earnings of $1.42 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.04, delivering a surprise of +43.66%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Harley-Davidson doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, General Motors Company (GM) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.65 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +44.7%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $42.46 billion, up 18.8% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for General Motors Company has been revised 6.9% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 8.60%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), suggests that General Motors Company will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.

Rather than producing battery cells, the company's compatible module technology can be adapted to support a variety of batteries, optimizing performance and safety. The versatility of the technology could allow United to consider EPS's modules for a number of near-term applications, and as part of its longer-term operations that support decarbonization. This is United's second investment in electric battery technology, after sodium-ion battery-maker Natron.""Typically, we've had a clear vision of how to integrate sustainability investments into our operations. What makes EPS's technology different and exciting is the scope of operational possibilities where we have the option to deploy it today and, in the future, to help electrify and decarbonize our operations,"" said United Airlines Ventures President Michael Leskinen. ""United's best roadmap to reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050, without relying on traditional carbon offsets, is by using every tool at our disposal – that includes the potential use of EPS's impressive portfolio of electric aircraft powertrain solutions, including high-performance power electronics, and energy storage systems.""Electric Power Systems aims to provide a whole battery ""ecosystem"" for aviation, from the packs on aircraft to charging stations on the ground. This in turn is designed to keep costs low and provide rapid charges without degrading the life of the battery. Key to the entire proposition of electric aviation is designing a battery that can store a high amount of energy with as little weight as possible. If a battery is too heavy, it makes an aircraft uneconomic compared to conventional fossil fuel-powered planes.Story continues""We are excited to collaborate with United Airlines Ventures as we continue to advance electric aviation technology,"" said Nathan Millecam, CEO of Electric Power Systems. ""United's investment will enable us to scale our operations and expedite the development of our cutting-edge powertrain solutions. By working together, our aim is to revolutionize air travel and build a more sustainable future for the industry.""United is exploring options to move its pilot training academy, Aviate®, away from internal combustion-powered training aircraft to electric ones. EPS's powertrain could serve as the core propulsion system for a family of future electric aircraft concepts, starting with an electric trainer and scaling to larger variants as technology advances.Additionally, United has more than 12,000 pieces of motorized ground equipment across its operations, of which about one third are currently electric. EPS's battery modules could potentially be deployed in support of several uses, including:Charging electric ground equipmentCharging anticipated future electric aircraft such as electric air taxisElectrified auxiliary power unit (APU) start productsElectrified cold-chain storage product for cargo containersUnited's Commitment to Net Zero Emissions by 2050United aims to be 100% green by reducing its GHG emissions 100% by 2050, without relying on traditional carbon offsets. In addition to the UAV Sustainable Flight FundSM, United has launched a SAF purchasing program called the Eco-Skies Alliance and established a venture fund - United Airlines VenturesSM - to identify and invest in companies and technologies that can decarbonize air travel. These strategic investments include carbon capture, hydrogen-electric engines, electric regional aircraft and air taxis. In May 2023, United received validation of our 2035 near-term emissions reduction target from the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) to reduce our carbon intensity 50% by 2035 from a 2019 base year. This year, United became the first U.S. airline to show customers an estimate of each flight's carbon footprint in their search.About UnitedAt United, Good Leads The Way.

Scott KirbyThank you, Kristina, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Before I discuss our financial performance for the second quarter, I'd like to first address the operational challenges at Newark at the end of last month. I am extremely proud of the people of United for all they did to recover under very challenging circumstances. Our pilots, flight attendants, gate agents, contact center teams and others went above and beyond to inform and assist our customers in an extremely stressful situation. We're now doing more than ever to mitigate the impact of weather, congestion and other infrastructure constraints at Newark and frankly, to build a schedule at Newark that's more manageable given the frequency of weather events beyond the very real operating constraints that exist there, even on Blue Sky days.Brett will highlight just a few of those changes shortly, but we've already put them in motion, already starting to improve the working experience for our people and travel experience for our customers. A bigger picture. This quarter was yet another proof point that our United Next strategy was correct and is working almost exactly as we expected. Over the past couple of years, I've talked a lot about 3 exogenous constraints facing the industry, but also the fact that those very constraints and challenges are going to set the table for improved financial results for the airline industry; one, pilot shortages; two, supply chain disruptions; and three, infrastructure limitations. At United, we have control over the first 2 constraints, pilot and supply chain, and we've mostly got ahead of the curve and had minimal issues there. But we're probably as exposed or the most exposed to the infrastructure constraints since our hubs are in some of the largest and most crowded airports in the country.So now we're taking even more action to give us the ability to operate more reliably despite the infrastructure constraints. That means we've had to lower our capacity plans for the second half and therefore, raised our CASM-ex guidance. But the reality is that our CASM-ex will be better than it otherwise would have been because there's nothing as expensive as running an off-schedule operations and these changes are designed to get our operations, particularly at Newark, working at a level that reflects the fact that it only has one set of parallel runways operating in the most crowded airspace in the world.The flip side of this coin, however, is that these exogenous constraints were also the basis of our United Next strategy, and it is off to an incredible, even record-setting start.This was an all-time record quarter for pretax earnings and EPS on an adjusted basis. This performance reflects our success in building a strategy to; one, aggressively hire pilots; two, grow our mid-continent hubs; three, upgauge our domestic fleet and four, expand our wide-body fleet and international exposure in response to the trends that we identified at the beginning of COVID.Importantly, we now expect to deliver earnings per share of $11 to $12, even with incremental conservatism in our cost in the back half of the year. The vision and strategic outlook that we first identified nearly 3 years ago is happening. Cost convergence is happening, which has changed our business dramatically on the domestic front. Long term, positive structural changes to the international markets are also apparent in our results. We continue to anticipate that the GDP relationship between airline revenues has been reset higher due to cost conversions and will continue to improve. The outlook for United and our United Next strategy is incredibly bright, as highlighted by our financial results this quarter. This quarter demonstrates that we're ahead of our planned targets and the challenges to emphasize that the industry backdrop gives us a clear path to our 14% pretax margin in 2026.As we march towards that goal, we're focused on setting the airline up for success. I'm also pleased that we've reached an agreement on an industry-leading contract with ALPA. The 4-year agreement once ratified will deliver a meaningful pay raise and quality of life improvements for our pilots. Thanks to the team for getting this across the finish line. We are well on our way to being the best airline in the history of aviation. United Next gave us an unbeatable head start on that goal as long as we execute and execute we will.Thanks again to the United team. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brett.Brett J. HartThank you, Scott. Thank you to our United team for their hard work this quarter. As Scott mentioned, during the last week of June, we experienced one of the most challenging operational environment in United's history, impacting primarily our largest international departure hub, Newark. Our hub locations make us disproportionately prone to weather and then the second quarter, weather was particularly challenging with 25 major irregular operation days accounting for 75% of our second quarter cancellations. Despite this, we are focused on setting United up for success, and being able to recover more quickly in the future. We are implementing a few new initiatives in Newark that will improve our operation. First, we are reducing the total flying in the peak hours to align better with the capabilities of today's constrained operating environment. Second, we expect to have additional gating as we bring the remaining 6 gates in Terminal A online, 2 of which are additional wide-body gates as well as make additional tactical changes at United.Third, we are adjusting our schedules to increase our out-and-back flying to limit the downline system impact of any cancellations or delays.Fourth, we are increasing our resources and crew scheduling and accelerating the time line of our technology enhancements and automation.Lastly and importantly, our partnerships with the FAA and Port Authority are essential to the airline's success. Collaboration and communication amongst these groups has never been stronger.To that end, Scott and our government affairs team continue to remain actively engaged in working with the administration and leaders in Congress to pass an FAA reauthorization bill. Legislation that equips the FAA with the resources, tools and funding they need isn't just essential to the success of our industry. It's among the best investments that we could make for the traveling public and the U.S. economy right now. And we're committed to continuing to advocate for a smart FAA reauthorization billing and to get it passed quickly.These are only a few of the initiatives underway, but combined with lower capacity, these adjustments and approximately 1 to 2 points of incremental year-over-year pressure to our 2023 CASM-ex.Gerry will go into more details, but running a successful and efficient airline is critical and United is laser-focused on getting our customers to their destinations safely and on time. As we work to respond to these challenges, we are also investing in our customer experience. Recently, we announced new mobile app features that support our customers during travel disruptions. These first-of-their-kind tools will allow customers to rebook, track their bags and get meal and hotel vouchers when eligible on their personal device.It is important for us to provide our customers the resources they need for flight or their flight at their fingertips, especially when things don't go as planned. As Scott mentioned, over the weekend, we reached a tentative agreement with our pilots represented by ALPA. We're thankful for the hard work our pilots put in every day, and this agreement is a representation of that. We are still in active negotiations with our flight attendants represented by the AFA, and have new agreements in place for all other work groups.The United team continues to be resilient. We're making real-time changes that directly impact the travel experience for our customers and for our employees day to day. Proud to be a member of this team. I want to thank everyone for their unwavering hard work.And with that, I'll pass it over to Andrew to discuss the revenue...Andrew P. NocellaThanks, Brett. I'd like to start off today by thanking the entire United team for their hard work and dedication and taking care of our customers, particularly during the final week of the quarter. Our financial results provide proof that our United Next plans are working and that the demand environment remains robust. United finished the second quarter with top line record quarterly revenues of $14.2 billion. Total revenues in the quarter were up 17%, ahead of our guidance of 14% to 16%.June was exceptionally strong and was our best revenue month ever. Since the start of June, we've had 13 of our 16 highest loan gross revenue days. TRASM in the quarter was down 0.4% and PRASM was up 2.2% with capacity up 17.5%.International results were exceptionally strong with passenger revenues up 44% year-over-year. International PRASM increased 13.3% year-over-year. Year-over-year PRASM results were strongest in the Pacific followed by the Atlantic and then Latin America. The resurgence of the United Pacific entity has been the most transformative. Margins for our global long-haul line continued to outpace domestic margins. Our second quarter capacity deployment plans, lean and international flying with 27% more capacity year-over-year, which proved advantageous. International ASMs represent 45.4% of United's 2Q capacity, up 2 points from 2019.Domestic passenger revenues were up 7.8% on 10.5% more capacity year-over-year, largely in line with our expectations at the start of the quarter. Domestic PRASM was down 2.4%, but that was a fantastic outcome as it compares to an exceptionally strong Q2 of '22. We expect similar or slightly better results for domestic PRASM in the third quarter.Our RM setup for the quarter proved to be the right one. We held back seats early in the booking curve, saving them for higher yields and closing bookings, and we ended the quarter with record top line results.The business recovery remained stable. Revenue from international travelers flying for business grew 40% year-over-year, with 10% growth in the -- on domestic business travelers. On a ticketed basis, business travel revenue continues to trend roughly flat to 2019.Cargo revenues have normalized post pandemic. Yields were down 38% versus 2022, but do remain up 29% versus '19. We expect yields in the third quarter to be consistent with Q2. Healthy cargo revenues and yields are helping drive incremental profitability to our global long-haul flying.MileagePlus had another strong quarter with revenue up 11% year-over-year. We broke records this quarter for all key measurements from new card acquisitions to new member enrollment. Ancillary revenue from bags and seats hit a record $1 billion in Q2, up 19% year-over-year. Per passenger ancillary revenue increased 8% to $23.79.Replacement of single class RJs with mainline aircraft with multiple types of seat upgrade opportunities is a key driver of our revenue growth. Premium leisure demand remains very strong across the board. Our domestic first class capacity is up 4% from 2019, but RASM growth in that cabin is 12 points stronger than the main cabin even with corporate traffic not fully recovered.Our global long-haul Polaris product is also offsetting the loss of corporate business revenue with premium leisure demand and validates the size of our Polaris Cabin post-pandemic are correct for United hubs.For Q3, we expect the total revenue to be up 10% to 13% year-over-year with capacity up approximately 16%. The demand environment remains strong, and September and October looked particularly strong relative to both 2019 and July and August. Another sign that seasonality has changed in the summer peak period is more spread out relative to the past.Once again, Q3 capacity deployment focuses on international markets with capacity expected to be up 23% versus 13% for domestic. We believe international revenue will continue to outperform domestic revenue in the third quarter across the globe other than Latin America. Overall, our domestic margins are now back to 2019 levels while our international margins are trending well above where they were in '19.Earlier this week, we announced an expansion of our Pacific line this fall with new non-stop service from Manila to San Francisco. We also announced a second daily flight from San Francisco to Taipei, a new daily nonstop flight from Los Angeles to Hong Kong and will resume our service between Los Angeles and Narita as planned. These additions to our key Pacific destinations are in addition to our previously announced expansion plan to the South Pacific.All international volume remains our focus. We also have plans to improve domestic margins by rebuilding and enhancing connectivity versus 2019, grow and engage faster than any other U.S. carriers and staying focused on our existing 7 hubs.Domestic connectivity fell materially in the pandemic because we decided to retire about 300 regional jets. But our connectivity is growing every month as we take United Next deliveries, and that will continue to drive PRASM higher each month. Like the period from 2017 to 2019 when we grew RASM and margins by growing connectivity, we'll do it once again but this time with large mainline jets preferred by our customers.Gauge has also been a key gap and opportunity for United. Larger gate narrow-bodies with 190 or more seats operate with the best single line margins in North America.The introduction of the A321 and MAX 10 were always a key enabler of our United Next gauge growth and margin growth. The potential of these larger jets is proven and further upside to United airline when we finally enter the fleet.I also want to add to Scott and Brett's comments about Newark and our United Next plans. United Next always contemplated that the only way to grow Newark was upgauging from regional to mainline flying. We expected that to lead to higher growth in seats and ASMs at Newark even though the total number of flights would not be growing.Our growth in Newark has always been contingent upon larger aircraft, not more aircraft. While we may need to cut departures more than planned, we don't believe these changes will impact our long-term capacity from Newark due to the use of larger gauge aircraft.And with that, I will turn it over to Gerry to talk about our financial results. Gerry?Gerald LadermanThanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that for the second quarter, we delivered the highest quarterly pretax earnings in the United's history of $2.2 billion. Our earnings per share of $5.03 was also an all-time record. And in addition, we produced a record second quarter pretax margin of 15.3%, 3 points higher than second quarter of 2019 and ahead of our expectations. This exceptional performance was driven by stronger-than-expected revenue and lower-than-expected fuel prices.The severe weather at the end of June, which drove multiple consecutive days of strained operations, did lead to a 1 point reduction in capacity for the quarter. We also incurred incremental disruption related costs that weren't anticipated at the time of our guidance. The capacity loss and added costs led to a CASM-ex impact of approximately 1.5 points for the quarter.Excluding this impact, until June 24, we were trending below the midpoint of our CASM-ex range for the quarter. An indication that our core costs remain under control. And for the rest of the year, the operational and scheduling changes that Brett discussed have reduced our full year capacity plans from our prior expectations, and we now expect full year capacity to be up approximately 18% versus 2022.Additionally, our CASM-ex guidance now incorporates an expectation of additional incremental costs in order to address the operational challenges. Specifically, for the third quarter, we expect CASM-ex to be up 2% to 3% with capacity up approximately 16%, both versus the third quarter of last year. When combined with our results for the second quarter and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we now anticipate our 4-year CASM-ex to be up approximately 1% to 2% versus last year.However, just like the second quarter, outside of the revisions I discussed, our core costs for the rest of the year are trending as expected.Furthermore, our CASM-ex expectation for the year continues to include the impact of our recently announced agreement with our pilots.Turning to earnings. The strong revenue environment and moderate fuel prices continue to provide strength to our bottom line. For the third quarter, we expect earnings per share to be $3.85 to $4.35, with a fuel price of $2.50, $2.80. More importantly, given our second quarter performance and third quarter outlook, we are raising our full year earnings per share expectation to the top half of our previous guidance range of $10 to $12.On fleet, we took delivery of 20 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in the second quarter and paid for 10 of those aircraft with cash. We expect to take delivery of 28 737 MAX aircraft in the third quarter and also look forward to our first Airbus A321neo later this fall. We continue to expect our full year adjusted capital expenditures to be approximately $8.5 billion.Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $21 billion in liquidity, including our undrawn revolver. We are comfortable with our current level of liquidity, particularly given the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. In the second quarter, we opportunistically issued $1.3 billion of enhanced equipment trust certificates secured by a pool of recently delivered Boeing MAX aircraft with an interest rate of 5.8%, which was attractive in the current interest rate environment.Additionally, we prepaid $1 billion of floating rate debt, which carried a current coupon of over 9%. Our adjusted net debt is now down almost $3 billion since the end of 2022 and $6 billion since the end of 2021. With the reduction in debt and the improvement in earnings, at the end of the second quarter, our trailing 12-month adjusted net debt-to-EBITDAR ratio improved by a full turn to 2.4x versus the end of the first quarter, putting us back to where we were prior to the pandemic and ahead of pace to achieve our target of less than 3x by the end of 2023. We also continue to expect to generate positive free cash flow for the full year, including the impact of our new pilot agreements.In conclusion, we are encouraged by the trends we are seeing and believe we're adequately mitigated against additional operational risk in the back half of the year. I'm extremely proud of the United team for delivering our strong financial results.Six months ago, when we first announced our full year EPS guidance, we were met with skepticism from some of you listening. Now more than halfway through the year, as we increase our EPS guidance, I hope all of you are as comfortable as we are with the value of the United Next plan, where we continue to march toward meeting our long-term targets and delivering for our customers, employees and shareholders.And with that, I will turn it over to Kristina to start the Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionKristina MunozThank you, Gerry. (Operator Instructions).Operator(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Dave Vernon from Bernstein.David Scott VernonSo Scott and Gerry, maybe a bigger picture level question for you. We're kind of coming up to $11 to $12 in earnings this year, can you help point out the 2 or 3 things that are unique to your strategy that are going to make it possible to kind of grow from that level? And there's a lot of concern about domestic slowing down. There's a concern about peak earnings. I'm just wondering how do we think about sustaining this level of earnings power or even building on it, on a 1- or 2-year view, conceptually, not trying to get guidance for '24. Just trying to think about conceptually what's going to help us kind of build from these record levels of profitability?J. Scott KirbyI guess I'll start and maybe let Andrew give you some details to follow. But at its core, 2 to 3 years ago, we started describing United Next. We started describing the intellectual framework for United Next what we thought was going to change in the industry. And in particular, we thought that the international market was going to be really, really good because we thought demand would recover. And we were literally the only large airline in the world that decided to keep all our airplanes and actually took more airplanes during the pandemic and grow. That has, in fact, happened. Domestically, we thought that the cost convergence was likely to happen. One, because of inflation. We probably think that 2 or 3 years ago, about 18 months ago, we thought that, that inflation was going to drive cost convergence and that the expectations for capacity were going to be unfulfilled because supply chain constraints, pilot shortages and infrastructure constraints. And to fix that particular issue, all 3 of those things have to come together. It's not enough if you get the supply chain remedy. It's not enough to get pilots remedied. All 3 of them have to happen. And so kind of from a big picture level, like this is playing out exactly like we thought it would. And it's a fair question. We get the question. We've gotten it for at least 6 or 7 quarters in a row. And the results just keep getting better because the industry backdrop is getting better, particularly for large airlines that have international exposure and that are at the top of the food chain for hiring pilots and for supply chain issues, which is where United is.And you further that with United -- so that's the industry backdrop. But United specifically thought this was going to happen, and we made a really big bet on this happening. And the truth is we're the only ones in the world to do that. While everyone else was shrinking and retiring airplanes, we started betting on growth and getting ready for United Next. We thought it would play out like this. It is playing out like this. I really am confident that our margins are set to grow 1 to 2 points a year for each of the next -- at least through 2026, and that this is the new normal. Andrew?Andrew P. NocellaI guess I'll add on a few more details. First, I think we're in the really early stages of the United Next plan, and our results this quarter give us a lot of confidence. We're on the right path. But I really look at all the details. And when I look at them all, what I would tell you is, one, the MAX 10 and the A321 are really important to our plan. They're large single-aisle narrow-body jets that everybody knows has superior economics, and we don't have a single one in our fleet today, and that's a gap we will close.We've already increased gauge by 20% since 2019, more than any other U.S. airline and 8 points more than the industry and yet we lead in unit revenue performance. The United network has been under-gauged and we've said that over and over again. And our ability to add low unit cost planes at high marginal RASMs is now well proven and will drive earnings.And larger gauge, of course, gives us the ability to manage our overall unit cost down in a way others just don't have the ability to do, in our opinion, and this, again, is a unique advantage to us. We think our gauge growth in the coming years will be faster than any of our competitors based on the public sheet plans that are out there.Of course, all of our mainline jets will eventually have a signature interior with seat-back screens and Wi-Fi. These jets have higher NPS scores as a result. These jets also come with larger first-class cabins, more Economy Plus seats. We provide our customers with more options to upgrade and choose their ideal onboard experience while generating increasing levels of ancillary revenues. The pandemic clearly created a boom in premium leisure demand that we see today and these passengers often purchase an upgraded experience.As Scott said, we have a large order book of narrow-body jets. Boeing and Airbus are largely sold out until the end of the decade. We can use these planes for growth or we can use them for retirement depending on conditions.Also, as Scott said, and I think really, really important, the international long-haul environment is just structurally different. This cycle for our business will have higher international margins versus domestic, a reversal from pre-pandemic. United has the largest international network amongst U.S. carriers. And as a result, we're going to benefit the most.No other U.S. airline has coastal gateway hubs like United. Our hubs are where most of the business class, premium demand and cargo demand enter and exit the United States, and they have superior geography for connecting traffic. This advantage is largely unique to United. Of course, we have a larger order book for wide-body jets, as Scott said. Our domestic connectivity is not where we want it to be.We know we can close it and we know what the margin gains are going to be for that. And while we continue to use regional jets, we won't over rely on them. Cargo is an amazing strong spot for us and really helps fuel our long-haul growth. The other thing I'd say, and I think this is really important, is all United hubs are producing strong profit margins. And we have the option to grow these hubs with our large narrow body order book, which creates a different paradigm for United than most.Simply, we start with a strong foundation to support our growth and neither must we shrink a hub to profitability or seek to grow a hub with sub-power margins, and I think that's a really important setup for us.As Scott said, constraints to growth continue. Cost convergence is now well documented. The other thing I'll add, United is far less reliant today on contracted corporate business, and that business has clearly been slow to return, but that doesn't mean it won't. If it does, the legacy business model will benefit the most.Further, NDC is changing distribution in this space as passengers want more flexibility in when they travel and how they travel and are increasingly preferring to work directly with United on our industry-leading app. More and more often, individual corporate customers pick airlines they want to fly on versus the purchasing manager at their business recommendation. This change in consumer behavior is locked in during the pandemic and now seems irreversible to me.Of course, we're focused on our high ground and our last advantage, of course, is our great team of innovation.J. Scott KirbyAll right. Well, Dave, that was a lot. But you -- we tell, we feel confident.OperatorOur next question comes from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research.Conor T. CunninghamOn the LCCs right now are ramping back capacity and on your far sales. That seems to be out there that seems to be having like a little impact on you right now. I'm just curious on what's actually what changes is a mindset around your unwillingness to match these fares? Or is it premium cost? Just any thoughts there would be helpful.Andrew P. NocellaWell, that's largely a domestic question. And I think our domestic environment has done well. As you know, in Q2, we really just hit it right on the head in terms of our guidance for the domestic entity. And in Q3, our performance looks to be very, very similar. So we're pretty pleased by how Q3 is setting up. I just think with where we are with our brand, our network, our upgauge, we're carefully, from an RM point of view, determined in our policy. And as we started Q2, we decided to hold out and book later in the curve. I think that proved right. And as we go into Q3, I think this guidance would tell you that we don't see a change. So I'm sure there are other things happening in the environment that are both positive or negative. But we don't see a change in the Q3 environment of down a little bit for domestic PRASM is entirely consistent with the Q2. And so we don't see a change, and we see a steady and strong demand.Conor T. CunninghamGreat. And then just on the international landscape, you did obviously take a huge advantage there. Just curious on what's next for the Atlantic. Are you comfortable with that network? And then just on the Pacific build-out, there seems to be a lot of upside there. I'm just curious on your expectations for that fall launch.Andrew P. NocellaSure. I think that's a really good question. Look, what I would tell you is our international RASM in Q2 and profitability was well above even our very lofty expectations from April. As we head into Q3, the year-over-year comparison is different than Q2. And during Q3, most of the world was already easy to travel to where in Q2 '22, travel was still limited. And that will make a difference in our year-over-year comps. When we compare versus 2019, it's easy to see that Q3 is tracking very, very close to Q2. So it looks really good. So not -- unlike domestic, we go into Q3, expect an amazing performance, but tougher RASM comps year-over-year and RASMs that are roughly flat.Profitability is going to be amazingly strong. Latin America is going to be the weakest. But to your question about the Atlantic, it looks really good, particularly demand to Southern Europe. And that's motivated to us to extend our seasonal flying to Southern Europe well into Q4, which we didn't normally do. But as you can imagine, and again, to your question about the Pacific, given our announcement earlier this week, on adding 4 new Trans-Pac routes this fall, you can imagine we're most bullish on Asia.As a result, we moved capacity into the Pacific, including our first-ever nonstop flight from San Francisco to Manila, a third daily flight to Hong Kong, a second daily flight to Taipei, and we're resuming our L.A. Narita flight. We also expect that Japan is going to remain strong well into 2024 as it did not fully reopen until this spring. So in summary, Asia is going gangbusters, and we're really happy with where it's at, and we've leaned into it. And overall, for international exposure, what I can tell you is we were -- in Q2, we were up 2.3 points in terms of percent of international ASMs of the company versus 2019.And in Q4, we're going to be up 3.1 to 3.4 points to show you how much we're leaning into the global long-haul environment because that's where we think the revenue is right now.OperatorOur next question comes from Catherine O'Brien from Goldman Sachs.Catherine Maureen O'BrienI couldn't tell as I was talking, I heard my line was unmuted, so I hope you can hear me now. Can you help us think about the total impact of operational issues at the end of the second quarter into the third, plus the impact of the changes you're making to shore up operations going forward? Like what that is to third quarter and full year EPS outlook? It sounds like the 1 to 2-point headwind to CASM is all tied to this. But just wondering, correct me if I'm wrong there. I'm just wondering, correct me, to take into account any revenue impact. I'm asking mainly because of the move in the full year midpoint EPS is a bit smaller than the 2Q beat. So I would just love to get some color.Gerald LadermanCatie, let me take a crack at that. So let me talk first on the cost side, where -- what you saw us do for the second quarter, third quarter full year is a just CASM entirely related to the operational disruptions, which is why I wanted to emphasize that costs aside from that, our core costs are trending right in line with our expectations. So the variance versus our prior guidance is all attributable to this. So the way to think about it is about 1/3 of that CASM variance is related to the actual incurred costs from the disruptions and 2/3 just related to the capacity adjustment.The overall impact in the second quarter versus our forecast prior to June 24, I would call it about 1 point of margin is what we've lost in the second quarter because of the events. And we've incorporated our expectation on lower capacity in our EPS guidance for the third quarter and full year. And so it's fair to say that -- but for those adjustments, our guidance for the full year of top half of the range, yes, it could have been a little bit higher because of those changes. But that's the way to look at it.Catherine Maureen O'BrienOkay. Great. That's really helpful. And then maybe one for Andrew. Can you just walk us through some of the assumptions you're making underlying the view that domestic RASM performance is steady or better, 3Q versus 2Q? What's the corporate assumption? And really just asking because that's different from what some of your peers are expecting.So just wondering what's unique to United that's going to hold in a little bit better than some others are seeing?Andrew P. NocellaWell, I won't go through my long list of what's unique to United. Again, I think that may be a little bit too much. I would love to, but look, we're looking at the numbers for Q3. What I would tell you is that there's clearly been some shift out of Q3 into Q4. October is, I think, setting up to be a stronger month of the year than it was in 2019. And June is now the strongest month of the year itself. So that is causing some shifts in seasonality and margin, I think, for United and for the industry.But overall, we just -- I think we have a really good setup. Our international system is just performing outstandingly. There's not like a single part of the globe, a single part of the network that's not working. And we've leaned into it really strongly. And I think that's shown up in the results.And on the domestic front, I think this is just -- we have the right aircraft in the right places. New York City, in particular, is doing dramatically better than it had been in the past for us. So we're really pleased by that. And all the hubs, as I said, are profitable and performing well. So we just think a very good capacity plan and a really strong environment.OperatorOur next question comes from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley.Ravi ShankerSo just to kind of follow up on the July 4 disruptions. I don't know if it's a fair question, but are you able to quantify kind of what percentage of the disruption was sort of in your hands or factors within your control versus like what was fostered upon you, if you will, or externally imposed. And also kind of in the near term, it does make sense to draw down capacity, but kind of what is the long-term plan to make sure that Newark serves as an effective hub for you?J. Scott KirbyWell, first and most important thing is to get Newark working effectively. And we've done some tactical things at United already. We've got some more changes that are coming that are in the schedule that are kind of embedded in the cost that Gerry talked about. But I think the biggest thing that has happened in New York just this month is a level of communication, coordination with the FAA as the highest it's ever been. What that does is what is planned.And the thunderstorms are tough. And if there's thunderstorms, they close departure routes in an airport, you're going to be canceling a lot of flights. But if you can plan it in advance and not have airplanes in the air, you wind up not having to divert airplanes. And that's where you get in trouble as we have to do that. And the best to add to me is this past weekend, our team would tell you that the weather in Newark was worse than it was that last week of June. But because we were closely coordinated with the FAA, we had advanced planning. We had to cancel a lot of flights while the weather was over Newark, but we were able to immediately start the recovery as soon as the weather was passed.And in total, we canceled 77% fewer flights. And so Newark is going to always be a difficult airport. It's got 2 parallel runways, 40 departures on 1 runway, 40 arrivals per hour on another. That's a flight every 1.5 minutes. It's about the most we can do. And it's in the most crowded airspace in the world. But I feel really good about where we are and where the FAA is with us on getting the most out of Newark when those events do happen.Ravi ShankerUnderstood. And then maybe as a follow-up, I think it was mentioned earlier, and I agree that your comment on 3Q PRASM domestic being flat to up slightly is a pretty differentiated message from your peers. Do you have enough visibility into what 4Q might look like compared with 3Q?Andrew P. NocellaWe're not going to give guidance for Q4 today. And look, what I'll tell you is that I'd already hinted, October, I think, is seasonally strong relative to 2019. We spent a lot of time refining our third quarter forecast. We're obviously already at the top half of the range, and we look forward to refining our Q4 forecast, but we're not going to do that today.OperatorOur next question comes from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan.Jamie Nathaniel BakerThorough conference call thus far. Just a couple of quick ones for Gerry. The comment on free cash flow for the year being inclusive of the AIP. Just to be clear, you're including retro pay, not merely wages and work rules?Gerald LadermanWe're including all cash going out the door, Jamie.Jamie Nathaniel BakerAnd second, your profit sharing formula isn't harmonized across working groups. At least not yet. If we think about the third quarter earnings guideposts or goalposts, excuse me, can you give us the approximate blended rate that you are using?Gerald LadermanNo, Jamie, that's -- we can't right now because it really depends on the forecast. We can help you and anyone else offline with your spreadsheets on how to think about how profit sharing might best be sort of incorporated if you want.OperatorOur next question comes from Scott Group from Wolfe Research.Scott H. GroupSorry about my voice. Hopefully, you guys can hear me okay. Just to clarify just that last question. Is it -- I know you're not giving a number, but is it right that there's a pretty meaningful step-up in profit share from Q2 to Q3?Gerald LadermanScott, all we can tell you is that all profit sharing that we expect are incorporated in our full year numbers. That's the best way to look at it.Kristina MunozI'll follow up with you offline for that (inaudible) rest of the year.Scott H. GroupFair enough. And then just -- I know it's early, but how are you thinking about overall capacity growth for next year, domestic versus international? And then is there any way to just think about some of the puts and takes for CASM for next year?Gerald LadermanSure. Let me answer that. It's very early in the planning process. So this is all very preliminary. But we do know about some of the headwinds and tailwinds that we're going to see as we start putting together the plan on the cost side. Headwinds would include the full year impact of the labor contracts and contractual increases. Inflation, which, by the way, what we're seeing now is a moderation in inflation. We've got constraints on growth due to infrastructure. And one of the big ones, and you'll actually see when we file the Q, our expectation for aircraft deliveries next year. Back in December, you may recall when we announced the widebody order, we gave some multiyear expectations on deliveries and CapEx.On the narrow-body side, now that we're that much further in, we have a -- what I describe is a clear expectation on aircraft deliveries. I think for the total, including 8 787s, about 110 aircraft next year. That's down from what we showed you in December. But by the way, if you recall, that CapEx number of $11 billion for next year, we had in December, just counting aircraft, that's going to be closer to $9 billion and $11 billion of CapEx, a good guide, particularly when we are looking at free cash flow for next year.But bottom line, I would say that with a variety of tailwinds we have as well, which would include improved utilization, improved productivity as our junior workforce begins to gain some experience. Putting it all together, right now, 6 months ahead of next year, I would say we're targeting high single-digit capacity growth and in that contract targeting flat CASM-ex for next year, but much more to come as we get into the planning process.OperatorOur next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.Duane Thomas PfennigwerthSo I agree with your differentiated bet on international recovery, you're winning the jump ball this summer, winning customers in summer 2023. Question would be, how do you think about keeping those customers as international carriers restore their capacity over time? What investments are you making to keep those customers beyond just metal, especially when we think about periods of operational disruption?Andrew P. NocellaWell, I'll start, maybe Scott wants to add on to it. First of all, we think there's just been a structural change in the international capacity relative to GDP that's very different from 2019, and it will take years of changes of fleet growth by the industry and us to actually make that change. So there's nothing that we see that's really going to change the structure back to what it was prepandemic anytime soon, if ever. So it's a really good reset of the ball.We're investing a lot in our product. We actually -- we talked about the elimination of the old business class seats million times at United. Well, as of today, we are only flying the new Polaris seat on all of our wide-body jets all over the world. So I think that's a lot of progress. And we continue to focus on the customer and doing the right thing on high-speed Wi-Fi, you name it. And I think our brand is better and better positioned to compete not only here in the United States but around the globe with an award -- just leading partners in every part of the world recently adding Virgin Australia in the South Pacific, which is new and very helpful to our growth down there.And of course, Emirates in the Middle East for that region of the world. So we've set this up really well, and we are confident that the international environment is our strongest long-term opportunity. We have a lot to do domestically in the short and medium term as well, but the international environment is really set up well.Duane Thomas PfennigwerthThanks, Andrew. And just a quick one for Gerry. Can you speak to how much sale leaseback activity you'd expect to utilize this year? And can you just help us bridge -- just remind us what's the difference between net CapEx and an all-in gross CapEx?Gerald LadermanYes, I'm just trying to add together the sale leasebacks we're doing. It's probably 20 or 20 to 30 aircraft. Keep in mind, we use sale leasebacks just as another form of financing, where even if it's a sale leaseback, we're going to maintain control over that aircraft for its remaining useful life. And net CapEx, meaning CapEx net of financing or what you're asking there?Duane Thomas PfennigwerthJust the guidance is a net CapEx guidance. So how would that CapEx guidance compare to just the value of the fleet that you're bringing on?Gerald LadermanNo, $8.5 billion is total CapEx. Yes. it's gross.OperatorOur next question comes from Helane Becker from TD Cowen.Helane Renee BeckerSo lately, we've been seeing a lot of articles about pilots refusing to move from the right seat to the left seat and being short captains. And that's something that existed for the regionals. But I didn't -- I was surprised to see it exists for major airlines as well. And I'm just wondering if the new contract addresses that and how you think about having enough captains to fly what you're intending to do?J. Scott KirbyThe short answer is, yes, the new contract does address that. It is also -- it's interesting. It's the first time that I've ever known it to happen in the airline industry. And it's one of those interesting artifacts of so much growth that you added. In the past, you spent 10, 12 years sometimes before you get your first shot at captain and if you didn't take it on the first shot, it might be another 5 or 6 before we came around again and so everyone took it, but now our pilots have enough confidence in the future, I think, as they should, that they can wait and let their seniority go up a little more, which helps the quality of life. And so we have had not as many captains as we were hoped upgrading. It hasn't affected capacity yet. It is going to impact capacity in the fourth quarter. That's all in our numbers by the way, already. But the good news is the contract, I think, fixes that. It depends. I'm not sure how long before we get 100% back. I think it will be the second half of next year. The union leadership thinks it will be a lot faster than that, but somewhere in that time frame, we'll get back to a full level of captains. That's a transitory issue that's already in our numbers, but we're on a good path. And the one data point I have is our first captain -- our most recent captain bid closed last night, and it was meaningfully better, and they haven't even seen the new contract yet. They just know that there is a new contract and so it's already made a difference. And this is a unique issue that will be in the rearview mirror sometime next year.Helane Renee BeckerThat's very helpful. And then my other question is kind of unrelated. The app that allows people where you're -- I guess you're pushing meal vouchers or hotel vouchers or whatever to customers, how does that figure into your costs? Like how do you know what the impact of those that I don't know how to ask the question of that technology, like how do you figure out the impact of that on operations by pushing to customers rather than making them, I guess, go to a gate agent for a voucher.Linda P. JojoHelane, this is Linda Jojo. I think the way to think about these vouchers is it's a more customer-friendly way and a more efficient way for operations to deliver to them what they would already get. So this is more about letting our agents be able to serve other aspects of the disruption versus this piece and making it much easier for our customers to actually receive them.Gerald LadermanHelane, just as a reminder, that kind of cost, which improves customer experience is also in our guidance.OperatorOur next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies.Sheila Karin KahyaogluI wanted to ask about margins that you guys alluded to in the opening remarks, just great performance. Obviously, domestic margins in Q2 returned to 2019 level as well. International remained above 2019 levels. I guess on a comparative basis, can you let us -- give us an idea of the delta between the 2 today and how you think about it longer term? Does it reach equilibrium? Is there international runway from here?Andrew P. NocellaI'm not going to give you the exact number. I'm going to say they are well above domestic margins, and we expect for this cycle for them to remain well above domestic margins. So look, our domestic margins are very solid, too. So I don't want to say anything too negative about that. I think international is just performing really well because of the structural change that happened during the pandemic.OperatorWe will now switch to the media portion of the call. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Alison Sider from the Wall Street Journal.Alison SiderI guess this has probably been on the rough line. So I'll just ask. Scott, could you say anything about what caused you to take that private flight during the operational problems at Newark, like what was so urgent. And then if you've had any kind of conversations or feedback or consequences from the Board since then?J. Scott KirbyIt was a mistake. And the best thing I learned at the Air Force Academy was to say no excuses, sir or no excuses, ma'am, in this case and move forward, and that's what I'm good here.OperatorOur next question comes from Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg.Mary SchlangensteinCan you guys put a full dollar value on the cost of the Newark disruptions, like a dollar value of lost revenue or the cost? And are you also providing figures at this point in terms of how you're adjusting the flight if you're cutting flights by 5% or you're cutting 30 flights a day or whatever. Can you provide more specifics on that?Gerald LadermanLet me just talk about the financial impact first. So as I mentioned earlier, that disruption effectively cost us 1 point of margin in the second quarter.Andrew P. NocellaIn regards to the flights, our summer schedule normally is about 435 flights per day. In August, we expect our schedule to be well below 400, somewhere in the, I think, the 390 range.OperatorOur next question comes from Leslie Josephs from CNBC.Leslie JosephsCan you just repeat a bit on Newark, you were going from 435 flights per day to 390? Just go over like the 2 in the from and the cut and does it go into September? And then broadly, just considering all the weather that we've had in Newark, are you considering pulling back from that hub this year, next year and then maybe over the coming 5 years, how do you see Newark in your strategy?Andrew P. NocellaSure. Let me give it a try. The normal schedule in Newark in a summer, which has been the same schedule for many, many years, pre-pandemic, is about 435 flights per day. This summer, we are scheduling about 410 and this August, we're going to bring that down to 390. We are in constant conversation with the FAA about Newark and its overall ability to handle capacity, and we're going to work collaboratively with them to try and figure out the overall level of flight activity. I expect that level of flight activity will be down from our traditional 430 flights per day in the summer until we can come up with a creative solution to the constraints that we're all facing there. So hopefully, we will return to that bigger schedule in the future. But for next summer, I do think that we will have a smaller schedule, and we will operate a reliable schedule, and we're going to do that in cooperation with our partners at the port and the FAA and the Department of Transportation to make sure that we get it right for all of the customers that fly in and out of Newark and New York City.OperatorI will now turn the call back over to Kristina Munoz for closing remarks.Kristina MunozThanks for joining the call today, everyone. Please contact Investor and Media Relations if you have any further questions, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.OperatorThank you, all. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.]"

Carriers and a federal audit say the Federal Aviation Administration must boost air traffic control staffing.Buttigieg has opened numerous investigations and imposed fines for carrier misbehavior. President Joe Biden has often criticized airlines, saying in February ""airlines can’t treat your child like a piece of baggage.""While Buttigieg works with airlines when possible, he added: ""We're going to beat 'em up when we think that's important to get passengers a better deal.""Buttigieg said he is ""in the middle of what I intend to be the biggest expansion of passenger rights in years. And there are tensions that are naturally going to come through with that.""United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby recently suggested the Federal Aviation Administration had ""failed us"" before changing his tone.In late June and early July, United had higher cancellations that it blamed in part on air traffic control staffing issues.""It was another scenario where you had the rest of the system seem to recover and one player struggling - so certainly something we're looking at it,"" Buttigieg said.In late 2022, Southwest Airlines suffered an operational meltdown after bad weather that also affected peers was compounded by its legacy scheduling system. Buttigieg has an ongoing investigation into Southwest's meltdown but he declined to discuss findings.Story continuesButtigieg said the U.S. airline industry has improved over last year, citing lower cancellation rates and adding ""the schedules are more realistic, certainly the outcomes are better.""The Transportation Department plans to propose new rules requiring airlines compensate passengers for significant flight delays or cancellations when carriers are responsible.Buttigieg said the July 1 rollout of 5G C-Band has gone better than expected with minimal disruptions. Last month, he warned of potential delays for airplanes without upgraded radio altimeters.Buttigieg said airlines were largely prepared but that ""took a lot of pressure. It took multiple moments where we had to really just make sure they could read our body language that we really were serious... I don't think the airlines believed us early on.""The FAA has been without a Senate-confirmed administrator since April 2022 and a prior nominee withdrew in March.Buttigieg said the White House was close to naming a new nominee. The White House has been considering naming former Deputy FAA Administrator Michael Whitaker, sources told Reuters, but Buttigieg declined to identify the expected nominee.

Raymond James Managing Director Savi Syth reviews the outlook for airline stocks as they face travel demand tailwinds and headwinds in the form of pricing pressures and operational issues.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: We're watching shares of airlines, American and United, on the heels of earnings. Both airlines beating the expectations from the street and also raising their guidance. But the stock's today moving in opposite directions. American Airlines under pressure, off just about 6.5%, as Wall Street had even higher expectations going into the quarter.Joining us now for more, Savi Syth, Raymond James Managing Director. Savi, it's great to speak with you. So that modest outlook from American, that's one of the big reasons why we're seeing that stock under pressure today. Was American Airlines, was that report almost a reality check here for the industry on the heels of the extremely strong results that we got from United and Delta last week?SAVI SYTH: Yeah. I think for American, the issue is, I mean, it was a really good outlook and guide. The revenue-- the top line outlook for the 3Q '23 was a little softer than what we were expecting and what the Street was expecting. And so I think that is just adding to fears of pent-up demand going away or a recession around the corner. And so it's not giving people confidence in the domestic market. And they're talking up the good guys at United and Delta to the strength in international. So I think that's what's weighing on American and the shares in part today.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And it's an interesting story, too. If you look over long-term share price action, because despite the demand that we've seen, the positive data, if you take a look at a five-year of United, Delta, and American, they're all significantly down. American is actually down more than 50%. So what do you think it will take to get investors back on board to the levels that they once were at?Story continuesSAVI SYTH: Yeah. I think partly, you know, with United and American, the one thing we have to keep in mind is there was some share dilution there. But beyond that, I think, what is important is confidence of the sustainability of the current earnings projections. And again, if there's a fear that you're heading into a recession, I think people aren't just willing to give the same multiples as they did before.And so I think we just need to show that, you know, there isn't this kind of demand or a cliff that's going to happen with especially the domestic consumer. And I think as you gain more confidence in that, I think you'll start to see the shares improving as well, because from a profitability of 2023 guide, I think they're already showing good resumption of profitability.SEANA SMITH: Savi, how much pricing power do airlines still have? Because, yes, we have seen airfares cool a bit on a year-over-year basis. But still, air travel, air tickets are much higher than they were pre-pandemic.SAVI SYTH: Look, I think, one, I think a lot of things are more expensive versus pre-pandemic. And so I think that's what you're seeing on the airline fare side, too. Even the jet fuel, it's not as high as it was last year. Last we went double, 2019. Now, you're about 20% above 2019. But you're still at prices that are above 2019.So I think part of this is just the inflation that you've seen globally. And the other part of it is you did have a lot of fleets that were retired. You had Boeing and Airbus that are having difficulty delivering new aircraft. And so there is a real supply shortfall relative to demand that has come back very strong and, you know, back to kind of trend line level. So for that reason, I think there is pricing power here. And then you have a lot of costs that are going up that will, I think, keep those fares relatively high, which is what you're seeing today.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And speaking of some of those costs, on the earnings call this morning, American did say it was committed to matching United when it comes to those pilot wages. How do you see those negotiations going? And what could that mean from a margin perspective?SAVI SYTH: Yeah. The American pilots are already getting about a 21 pay increase with this new contract. It's really making up for the fact that, you know, during-- you're supposed to have a contracts, you know, early 2020 and the pandemic got in the way. So you're making up for a few years of not getting pay increases.If they do match United, it's another 1% to 2%. So relative to what you are matching today, I don't think it's a significantly higher increase. So I think their 2023 guide isn't going to be significantly impacted by anything that they're matching with the United contract.SEANA SMITH: Savi, one of the themes that we've heard from a number of airlines this quarter and also we started to hear about it last quarter was the pent-up demand for international travel. And international really being a standout, especially in this quarter's results. Do you see that accelerating into 2024?SAVI SYTH: I think what you're seeing this year, you know, if you remember internationally the testing requirements really only came off in the June time frame. And so what you're seeing this year is last year, a lot of people were still taking domestic or near International trips, because that's where they could go easily and conveniently. And so this year, you're finally starting to see both on the leisure and business side more of those trips being taken internationally.So-- so it is a little bit pent-up, in that you're catching up for some of that. But it's also kind of diverse, you know. You're getting some of the trips that was in the domestic market shifting to international. And I think you'll see-- you know, so we start to really kind of lap that maybe late this year, because, even though kind of the things were lifted, I think you really only started to see international comeback in a big way and kind of that late-- late 2022 time frame. So I think we still have another quarter or a couple of quarters of good international momentum.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And on that international side, we're seeing extreme heat in Europe right now. Summer is usually a time where everyone wants to flock to Europe. So do you think those temperatures and what's happening overseas, could that potentially impact any earnings heading into next season?SAVI SYTH: Yeah. I mean, it's definitely-- there are a lot of things going against operating a good airline. You know, the heat being one of them. There is air traffic control issues everywhere. And in Europe, you do have a lot of industrial action as well. And so I think airlines are taking that in stride and making the adjustments, because they do want to run a good operation, because that's the worst thing that can happen from a demand perspective is if passengers don't appreciate or don't have a good experience, they're not going to continue flying.So you are seeing them, you know, tactically and strategically responding to some of these challenges. And it's not something that-- some of this will get better. ATC staffing should improve as time goes on. But some of it like weather, it's something that's here to stay. And that they'll have to continue to adapt.ALEXANDRA CANAL: I'm trying to plan a trip to Europe in the fall. So hopefully, things are good then. But Savi Syth from Raymond James, thanks so much for joining us today.]"

237,f37d4192-fee2-355b-bb22-2b3a9be207b4,PNC,2023-07-21,PNC earnings 'quite strong' despite revenue miss: Analyst,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/pnc-earnings-quite-strong-despite-163951183.html,1689698391,VIDEO,"['ZION', 'PNC', 'CMA']","[PNC Financial reported mixed results for its second quarter, with earnings topping estimates, but revenue coming in lighter than expected. CFRA Research Senior Equity Research Analyst Alexander Yokum tells Yahoo Finance Live that despite the revenue miss, PNC's earnings were ""quite strong"" noting that PNC's credit quality improved and that its deposit runoff wasn't as bad as feared. When it comes to banks he is concerned about, Yokum highlights Zions Bancorp and Comerica ""because they have high levels of non-interest bearing deposits, which have been shown to see higher outflows,"" though he notes those stocks could pop if they report positive news on deposits.Video Transcript- We have more on what PNC's performance means for its small and mid-sized peers. For analysis on that, we're joined by Alexander Yokum, Senior Equity Research Analyst at CFRA Research. Thanks so much for joining us-- joining us this morning. Let's get into PNC's results. How does it look to you especially when you compare it to the broader regional banking sector?ALEXANDER YOKUM: Yeah, thank you-- thank you for having me on. I think initially, there was a little bit concern with revenue coming in a little bit light. But once you look past that, I think, the results were actually quite strong.You know, one of the bigger talks recently has been credit quality, and PNC's credit quality actually improved this quarter. So it's actually been two straight quarters of improving credit quality, which I thought was a really good sign considering, you know, they're trading at a pretty depressed multiple right now. So if the credit quality can stay strong, there definitely could be some outperformance there.There was also a little bit of deposit runoff, which has been you know sort of a trend for regional banks in general, obviously following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. But it wasn't that significant, and PNC has excess deposits. And by allowing some of those deposits to run off, they actually kept their margins pretty strong. So their net interest margin only fell 5 basis points quarter over quarter.Story continuesAnd we think that bodes well for profitability going forward. Maybe-- maybe that won't be so strong at other regional banks that have a little bit less pricing power. But for PNC, we thought the results were actually pretty good.JULIE HYMAN: I'm curious, Alex. It's Julie here. How flexible, how mobile, how mutable are deposits because we talked to an investor earlier who said, you know, people right now are going into things like money markets, other short-term instruments where they're getting a higher rate coming out of their bank accounts? Once that starts to change, though, do you expect those flows to come back?ALEXANDER YOKUM: So, yeah, I guess the flows could come back if interest rates fall. But I think it's worth pointing out that, you know, the three banks that really struggled, if you think about First Republic, Signature Bank, and Silicon Valley Bank, they all had very high levels of uninsured deposits. And that basically translates to large account sizes. And if you have a large account size, higher interest rates, you know, you're more likely to want to search for yield.But PNC, you know, their average consumer account size is about $11,000. So a 1% change in interest rates is not that significant in terms of the income you're earning. It's much more important about services. So we think banks that have high levels of insured deposits, so smaller account sizes face less of these pressures- So, who are you concerned about in light of that, Alexander?ALEXANDER YOKUM: Yeah, so I mean definitely the three banks that struggled. But I mean two-- I guess two banks that potentially have issues just because they also have high levels of non-interest bearing deposits which have been shown to see higher outflows Zion and Comerica have a little bit of potential pressures. But it is worth noting that they're, you know, generally, they have sold off pretty significantly. So if they had any deposit surprises on the upside, they could potentially see really strong results.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, I mean, I was going to ask sort of the flip side of that who you think is going to weather all of this the best.ALEXANDER YOKUM: Yeah, so from the large regional banks, we actually do like PNC as our top-- as our top pick just because we really like them on the deposit side. And then there have been a lot of talks about increasing capital requirements. So you know the three super regionals-- PNC, US Bank, and Truist-- we think PNC is best positioned because Truist and Us Bank have some, you know, larger unrealized losses in their securities portfolio which could potentially dent their capital ratios if there's reforms there.So yeah, PNC on the large banks, like I said very well diversified. Their CEO has a very strong track record of success, has outperformed over the last 10 years the peer group pretty significantly, and we think they're well positioned going forward given that well diversified banking model. And like I said, on a deposit perspective, we think they're well positioned to not necessarily face as much pressure than the rest of regional banks.- That makes sense. I know, you know, in terms of their credit quality performance, as you mentioned, they did better. Their net loan charge offs were stable as they noted in their earnings report. Are there any risks on the horizon that would concern you when it comes to PNC?ALEXANDER YOKUM: So the credit quality was better. I guess the risk there is office. So they do have some office exposure. We did see charge offs increase pretty significantly this quarter. They almost tripled, which sounds bad, but you know, it's coming off a low base and it's a small percentage of their portfolio.So you know, in terms of that, you know, there's some concern just because you know, office it's tough to see that getting, you know, significantly better going forward. But since it's a small percentage of the portfolio, we think it's, you know, they're well positioned. I mean I think funding costs, like we said, we think PNC is better positioned than other regional banks. But the entire industry could underperform if these funding costs continue, if interest rates stay high, and if consumers continue to move their money because right now, if you're trying to gain deposits, it's very expensive.So if you let some deposits run off, that's OK to keep costs low. But trying to actually add deposits is very expensive in this environment. So if this continues and you're trying to add loan growth, that could become very costly going forward, if this environment continues.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, and it's certainly not out of the question that it will continue at least for a little while here. You mentioned commercial real estate. And so, how should we be thinking about that exposure right now amongst the regional banks, especially since that issue has been so talked about?ALEXANDER YOKUM: Yes, yeah, there was definitely I think a negative reaction last week to Wells Fargo. You know, they were pretty conservative on their commercial real estate, increased their allowances. So we think, you know, because regional banks have larger exposure to commercial real estate, there's definitely concern there.But I think the positive is most of commercial real estate is actually OK right now. It really is office. And that is a small percentage of these bank's portfolio, typically 2%, 3%, 4%. So you know, relatively well positioned.We also like that they've had a long time to prepare for this. You know one reason why, you know, the collapses in the spring were so sudden was because it was-- it was a factor that people weren't necessarily as concentrated on. You know, being unrealized securities losses, that wasn't necessarily something people were talking about.And then like, uninsured deposits, you know, those were arguably considered positive because wealthy clients tend to be more profitable. So you know, that was a quick flip whereas you know, commercial real estate office, it's been known for a while now. So we actually think, you know, generally speaking, these executive teams have done a pretty good job building up reserves and preparing for a potential downturn.JULIE HYMAN: Well, we're just at the beginning when it comes to the regionals. So it should be interesting. Alexander Yokum, thank you so much for giving us your perspective, Senior Equity Research Analyst at CFRA research. Appreciate it.]"

Now Target is leading the charge.I Work at Costco: Here Are 12 Insider Secrets You Should Know  Learn: How To Get Cash Back on Your Everyday PurchasesDuring the company’s first-quarter earnings call in May, Target CEO Brian Cornell said he anticipated that organized retail crime would fuel as much as a $500 million increase in stolen and lost merchandise, bringing the total loss — called “shrink” in the retail industry — to well over $1 billion.That’s no small cost, and it’s no joke for Target’s financials either. That hit comes directly out of the company’s bottom line, so it should come as no surprise that it’s prompting action.Check out the money-saving secrets Target does not want you to know.How Much Money Has Target Lost to Shoplifting?It’s not easy to accurately quantify the true cost of theft. Retail shrink doesn’t just measure shoplifting; it covers any unforeseen loss of inventory — things like internal theft, goods damaged or lost in transit from distribution centers and merchandise that is sold for the wrong price or as something else.Check Out: 6 Best Items To Buy at Aldi This SummerTarget’s total shrink was around $400 million in fiscal year 2021 and rose to $736 million in 2022. If the anticipated $500 million increase does materialize in 2023, that would bring the three-year total to a whopping $2.4 billion — but it’s hard to say how much of that can be attributed to shoplifting.According to the National Retail Federation, which tracks shrink on a large-scale basis, retailers lost $94.5 billion in 2021. That same data shows that only 37% of that shrink came from external retail crime. If that ratio holds true for Target, then less than $900 million of that $2.4 billion would be driven by theft. However, Cornell has remained insistent that it’s shoplifting, by organized crime in particular, that is driving the recent growth in shrink.Story continuesHere We Go Again?If this all sounds familiar, it may be because Walgreens executives made similar claims in fall 2021, when they cited organized shoplifting as the reason they were closing five locations in San Francisco. They walked that back during an earnings call early this year, during which Walgreens Chief Financial Officer James Kehoe conceded that the company had likely overspent on security measures and might have gone so far as to mischaracterize how much theft had actually taken place.Target, like many retailers, is in a tough position. It’s no secret that the company has struggled lately, with falling profit margins and earnings misses driving the stock price down over the last six months. Pushing a narrative like a shoplifting crime wave could be a way to deflect some attention away from leadership for tough business results.What Changes Target Is MakingWhether the shoplifting narrative is overblown or gospel truth, there’s no doubt that Target has been taking steps to mitigate theft in its almost 2,000 locations in the U.S. Cornell said the company already has begun installing protective fixtures in some stores, as well as adjusting assortment (likely removing the most frequently stolen merchandise from stores in higher-crime areas).Cornell also noted that the company is connecting with policy makers, law enforcement organizations and industry trade groups to explore political solutions to the issue. So far, however, there are no plans for store closures. Cornell said Target is “focused on keeping our stores open in the markets where problems are occurring.”More From GOBankingRatesI'm a Real Estate Agent: Buy Real Estate in These 5 Countries To Be Rich in 10 YearsCostco's 7 Best Premade Meals To Save You Money3 Ways to Recession Proof Your Retirement9 Best Small Business Ideas To Make Money From HomeThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Things Are Changing at a Target Near You: The Damaging Effects of Shoplifting]"

Underlying inflationary pressure, a slowing labor market, a higher interest rate environment and reductions in pandemic savings have collectively dampened demand. Of late, players in the Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry have been encountering these headwinds.That said, industry participants have been focusing on deepening engagements with consumers, adding more compelling products and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. Inventory management, supply-chain enhancement, cost-structure realignment and investments to accelerate digitization have been working in favor of companies like Costco Wholesale Corporation COST, The TJX Companies, Inc. TJX, Target Corporation TGT and Ross Stores, Inc. ROST.About the IndustryThe Retail – Discount Stores industry comprises companies that offer apparel, accessories, footwear, beauty products, personal and baby care products, cleaning products, pet supplies, and food and beverage products at lower prices than traditional retail outlets. The industry participants also provide home textiles, home furnishings, housewares, art and craft supplies, toys and seasonal decor products. These companies sell their products through stores, digital channels, or both. Some industry players operate membership shopping warehouse clubs, offering branded and private-label products in a range of merchandise categories. Most discount stores are gradually emerging as one-stop shopping destinations. The profitability of players depends on a prudent pricing model, a well-organized supply chain and an effective merchandising strategy.4 Key Industry Trends to WatchSoft Demand May Hit Revenues: The industry’s prospects are correlated with the purchasing power of consumers. Consumer spending, a key catalyst for the economy, has recently shown signs of slowing down. Several factors have come into play, including underlying inflationary pressure, a slowing labor market, a higher interest rate environment and reductions in pandemic savings. We note that U.S. retail sales experienced a slight uptick in June 2023, falling short of analysts’ expectations. Retail sales showed 0.2% growth, marking a deceleration from the 0.5% growth recorded in May. Additionally, there are indications that the Federal Reserve is likely to resume raising interest rates this month, following a period of unchanged rates in June.Story continuesPressure on Margins to Linger: Companies in the industry are vying for a bigger share on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. Further, the increasing dominance of e-commerce players has made the retail-discount space highly competitive. This has compelled many players to strengthen their digital ecosystem and boost shipping and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors drive sales, they entail high costs. Apart from these, higher marketing, advertising and other store-related expenses might compress margins. Of late, the industry participants have been dealing with product cost inflation. Nonetheless, companies have been focusing on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges. These include streamlining operational structures, optimizing supply networks and adopting effective pricing policies.Consumers Seek Better Bargains: The strategy to sell products at discounted prices has helped industry players draw customers in low-to-middle-income groups who have been seeking both value and convenience, particularly in the face of rising prices. Industry participants have been focusing on creating innovative and compelling products and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities to attract price-sensitive consumers.Digitization Is the Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns, industry participants have been evolving to play dual in-store and online roles. Initiatives, such as building omnichannel, coming up with loyalty and marketing programs, enhancing the supply chain and providing faster delivery options, be it doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at the store, are worth mentioning. Simultaneously, companies are investing in renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers’ product preferences and growing inclination toward online shopping, retailers have been replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry is housed within the broader Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #235, which places it in the bottom 6% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates drab near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Since the beginning of January 2023, the industry’s earnings estimate has declined 10.5%.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry vs. Broader MarketThe Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry has underperformed the broader Retail – Wholesale sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.Stocks in this industry have collectively increased 3%.

Let's take a look at some of the movers here after-hours. Three stocks for you. Let's start off with Intuitive Surgical. This is the robotic surgical company here, provider of equipment. That's under pressure in after-hours trading, off just about 5% when it comes to the numbers for its most recent quarter, actually beating the Street's estimates on revenue. Procedure growth was up 22%. The company saying that more surgeries helping its results.But we got to remember that this stock has certainly been on fire since the start of the year. We've seen a massive run-up as of late, up just about-- this is Sirius. Let's go over to Intuitive Surgical. Here we go. A massive run-up as of late, up just about 31% year-to-date. So it's giving back some of those losses there. We mentioned the fact that for some of these companies, the bar is very, very high, especially when we see gains over the last couple of months. That's why we're giving back some of that excitement. At least right now, off just about 5%.Flipping over to CSX Corporation, the railroad operator. That's also moving lower, off nearly 5%. The company missed on revenue. It was down about 3% from just about a year ago, falling coal fuel prices, hurting sales, also weaker shipping volumes, something that we have talked about industrywide. That is weighing on CSX's results here for its latest quarter. Year-to-date, the stock is still in the green, up just about 8%. Over the past year, up about 13%. But again, the fact that it fell just a bit short of analyst expectations. That's what's putting pressure on shares right now.Rounding out with Capital One, a look here at the consumer, credit card spending trends, auto delinquencies. We're actually seeing a rise of just about a half of a percent. Deposits did slightly miss expectations. Also, the company reporting higher auto and car-- and credit card delinquencies, something that we have really been closely tracking here as we get a number of results here from the credit card companies from the banks. That's offering us a closer glimpse, a closer look into what exactly the spending behavior is right now. Over the last three months, looking at Capital One, up just about 18%. Since the start of the year, up about 23%.]"

(“EPS”), and non-GAAP diluted shares outstanding. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance by excluding items such as amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation (“SBC”) and long-term incentive plan expenses, and other special items. Long-term incentive plan expense relates to phantom share awards granted in China by the Company’s Intuitive-Fosun joint venture to its employees that vest over four years and can remain outstanding for seven to ten years. These awards are valued based on certain key performance metrics. Accordingly, they are subject to significant volatility based on the performance of these metrics and are not tied to performance of the Company’s business within the period. The Company presents constant currency revenue to provide a framework for assessing how the Company’s underlying business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. The Company believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to its historical performance. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors, because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, and (2) they are used by institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the performance of the Company’s business.Constant currency revenue growth. The Company calculates constant currency revenue by translating current period revenue using prior period exchange rates. The constant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the increase in the current period constant currency revenue over the prior period revenue. Second quarter 2023 as reported revenue increased 15.4% compared to the second quarter of 2022. Foreign currency fluctuations had a 1.3% unfavorable impact on second quarter 2023 revenue. Second quarter 2023 constant currency revenue increased 16.7% compared to the second quarter of 2022.Non-GAAP gross profit. The Company defines non-GAAP gross profit as gross profit, excluding amortization of intangible assets and SBC and long-term incentive plan expenses.Non-GAAP income from operations. The Company defines non-GAAP income from operations as income from operations, excluding amortization of intangible assets, SBC and long-term incentive plan expenses, litigation charges and recoveries, and a gain on the sale of a business.Non-GAAP net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. and EPS. The Company defines non-GAAP net income as net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc., excluding amortization of intangible assets, SBC and long-term incentive plan expenses, litigation charges and recoveries, a gain on the sale of a business, gains (losses) on strategic investments, adjustments attributable to noncontrolling interest in joint venture, net of the related tax effects, and tax adjustments, including the excess tax benefits or deficiencies associated with SBC arrangements and the net tax effects related to intra-entity transfers of non-inventory assets. The Company excludes the excess tax benefits or deficiencies associated with SBC arrangements as well as the tax effects associated with non-cash amortization of deferred tax assets related to intra-entity non-inventory transfers, because the Company does not believe these items correlate with the on-going results of its core operations. The tax effects of the non-GAAP items are determined by applying a calculated non-GAAP effective tax rate, which is commonly referred to as the with-and-without method. Without excluding these tax effects, investors would only see the gross effect that these non-GAAP adjustments had on the Company’s operating results. The Company’s calculated non-GAAP effective tax rate is generally higher than its GAAP effective tax rate. The Company defines non-GAAP EPS as non-GAAP net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. divided by non-GAAP diluted shares, which are calculated as GAAP weighted-average outstanding shares plus dilutive potential shares outstanding during the period.There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP measures versus measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc., and non-GAAP EPS exclude items such as amortization of intangible assets, SBC and long-term incentive plan expenses, excess tax benefits or deficiencies associated with SBC arrangements, and non-cash amortization of deferred tax assets related to intra-entity transfer of non-inventory assets, which are primarily recurring items. SBC expense has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense in the Company’s business. In addition, the components of the costs that the Company excludes in its calculation of non-GAAP net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. and non-GAAP EPS may differ from the components that its peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations. Management addresses these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. and non-GAAP EPS and evaluating non-GAAP net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. and non-GAAP EPS together with net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. and net income per share attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. calculated in accordance with GAAP.INTUITIVE SURGICAL, INC.UNAUDITED QUARTERLY CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME(IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)   Three Months

Westrock Coffee Company, LLC operates as an integrated coffee, tea, flavors, extracts, and ingredients solutions provider in the United States and internationally. The US$865m market-cap company posted a loss in its most recent financial year of US$78m and a latest trailing-twelve-month loss of US$71m shrinking the gap between loss and breakeven. Many investors are wondering about the rate at which Westrock Coffee Company will turn a profit, with the big question being “when will the company breakeven?” We've put together a brief outline of industry analyst expectations for the company, its year of breakeven and its implied growth rate. See our latest analysis for Westrock Coffee Company Westrock Coffee Company is bordering on breakeven, according to the 4 American Food analysts. They expect the company to post a final loss in 2022, before turning a profit of US$2.0m in 2023. So, the company is predicted to breakeven approximately 12 months from now or less. At what rate will the company have to grow in order to realise the consensus estimates forecasting breakeven in under 12 months? Using a line of best fit, we calculated an average annual growth rate of 162%, which is rather optimistic! If this rate turns out to be too aggressive, the company may become profitable much later than analysts predict.earnings-per-share-growthUnderlying developments driving Westrock Coffee Company's growth isn’t the focus of this broad overview, though, keep in mind that by and large a high forecast growth rate is not unusual for a company that is currently undergoing an investment period.One thing we would like to bring into light with Westrock Coffee Company is its relatively high level of debt. Typically, debt shouldn’t exceed 40% of your equity, which in Westrock Coffee Company's case is 93%.

I will now turn the call over to today's speaker, Matthew Korn, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.Matthew KornThank you, Operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Joining me this afternoon are Joe Hinrichs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jamie Boychuk, Executive Vice President of Operations; Kevin Boone, Executive Vice President, Sales and Marketing; and Sean Pelkey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. A presentation accompanying this call, you will find our forward-looking disclosure on Slide 2, followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on Slide 3. And with that, it's my pleasure to introduce Mr. Joe Hinrichs.Story continuesJoseph R. HinrichsThank you, Matthew, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our conference call. Our performance over the second quarter met our expectations, led by the strong results of our merchandise business. As we had indicated at year-end and again last quarter, we knew that we would have to manage through lower intermodal storage revenue and normalizing export coal prices. We expect intermodal volumes to be soft as imports slowed and destocking activity continued. That said, we also knew that we were gaining momentum with our customers, led by our improved service performance and in our own workplace as our ONE CSX efforts took hold. Our network continues to run well and our company's initiatives, combined with our employees' hard work and commitment of making a big difference in helping to set our railroad apart. There is much more to do but our results this quarter show signs of the progress we are making as we lay the groundwork for long-term growth and value creation.Turning to Slide 5. Let's review the highlights of the second quarter. We moved over 1.5 million carloads in the second quarter, led by a 3% volume growth in merchandise and 4% growth in coal, and our margins remained strong with an operating ratio below 60%, including the impact of the quality carriers trucking business. We generated $3.7 billion in revenue, which was 3% lower than the previous year and flat from the first quarter.Operating income decreased 13% year-over-year to $1.5 billion, and our earnings per share decreased by 9% to $0.49. When making comparisons to last year, it's important to remember that our second quarter 2022 results included $122 million gain, representing $0.04 per share of EPS related to the Commonwealth of Virginia property sale. All in, this was a solid performance highlighted by great results in our core business. The fact that our team was able to drive 3% merchandise volume growth in such an uncertain macroeconomic market is a testament to what we are able to do when we work together.Now moving on to Slide 6. Earlier this month, CSX released its new 2022 ESG report, which highlights the tremendous progress that our team has made in moving our company forward. And since I started here last fall, you've heard me talk about ONE CSX, about building a supportive and positive culture and about the need to consider all of our stakeholders when measuring our success as a company.Many of you have asked me what this really means in practice? What does the railroad look like, where people feel valued and included? For its customers feel appreciated and where the communities in which it operates are respected. I think the pictures and highlights that you see here offer a small view into how we're making this happen here at CSX.To us, incorporating environmental, social and governance considerations into the priorities of our company goes hand-in-hand with our ONE CSX focus, adding to the greater sense of purpose that we all share. These are real authentic actions that we are taking today. We talk often about our environmental leadership and our clear advantage here over trucks as a core part of our value proposition to our customers and our shareholders. By expanding our user technology, conducting practical testing of alternative fuels and offering support and encouragement to our suppliers, we continue to make progress.As we reported in our press release last week, we are testing biodiesel blends in locomotives in revenue service. Last month, you heard that we were in talks with CPKC to form a joint venture for the development of hydrogen-powered locomotives, which offer encouraging promise as a low emissions fuel solution. What we probably do not talk enough about are all the incredible efforts made by our railroaders to build up the places in which we live and work. It has been a priority of ours to increase our company's positive cultural impact, and I'm proud of how quickly the people of CSX have responded.As you see here, our volunteer hours are up substantially. Our CSX-sponsored community events have multiplied and the number of people who we have been able to help and support has been incredible. I look forward to much more to come. There's one last item I'd like to mention.As CSX, safety is our top priority, and that's why we focus so much on our reported injury and accident rates. Our fundamental goal is to make sure that every one of our employees gets home safely every day. When that does not happen, and we lose one of our colleagues as we lost Derek Little last month, it affects us deeply. As a reminder, why we make so much effort on safety and how much more work we need to do.Now let me turn it over to the team.Jamie J. BoychukThank you, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. As Joe just said, we continue to make every effort to enhance our company's safety performance. As Slide 8 shows, we made good progress this quarter with both our FRA injury frequency and FRA train accident rate improving sequentially. Our injury rate also improved year-over-year and was the lowest rate for a second quarter that we've seen since 2015. Our focus is to ensure that every employee, including new hires who are less familiar, understands and appreciates their part to reinforce our safety-focused culture.Turning to Slide 9. Our operating performance held up well over the second quarter and continues to lead the industry. Thanks to the hard work of our railroaders who execute the operating plan every day. I've seen firsthand a positive response to the efforts being made by our employees to strengthen our culture. Our men and women in the field are valued, included, respected, appreciated and listen to, which helps them feel even more pride in the service they're delivering to our customers. Because of them, we're able to show how well our scheduled railroading model works, and I'm excited as there are more opportunities ahead.Velocity averaged 17.7 miles per hour in the second quarter, slightly lower than last quarter, but up substantially from the same period in 2022. Dwell averaged 9.3 hours, an improvement of over 20% compared to the same period last year. Intermodal trip plan performance of 96%, increased by 6 percentage points year-over-year, while carload trip plan performance of 84% improved by 25 percentage points. I'm pleased with the compliments and support we have received from our customers, regulators and shareholders on our service improvements. Our goal is to keep improving our service and sure that we can continue to sustain this over time so we can drive long-term growth for CSX.With that, I will turn it over to Kevin to discuss our sales and marketing performance.Kevin S. BooneThank you, Jamie. As Joe noted, despite headwinds across many of our markets, the team was able to capitalize on strong year-over-year improvement in service. Importantly, as service has improved, is opening up opportunities to discuss new business with our customers, where we are seeing our year-to-date pipeline up 30%. I'm proud of the team and the progress we have made. It means a lot of work ahead of us as we focus on building our pipeline of growth opportunities.Initiatives, including white-boarding sessions with customers, increasing direct engagement with small and medium-sized shippers bringing new technology tools to better serve our customers and finally, expanding our reach by leveraging our TRANSFLO network in collaborating with both with our short line and Class I partners are just a few of the focus areas for the team as we move into the back half of the year.Turning to Slide 11. Our strong merchandise performance continued into the second quarter. With revenue increasing 5%, even as our fuel surcharge declined substantially on lower diesel prices. This growth was driven by 3% higher volume compared to last year and a 1% all-in increase in revenue per unit. As we saw in the first quarter, our customers are seeing improved service levels, which is opening opportunities and encouraging them to bring more of their business to our network.For the quarter, we saw many of the market trends continue from the start of the year. In automotive, we are seeing more consistent production, and we've seen our improved service with new opportunities and business wins. Minerals benefited from strong construction demand for aggregates and our improving cycle times in our metals and equipment business continues to be a bright spot with volumes up across steel, scrap and equipment. We've been successful in expanding our commercial relationships by translating our service product and to convert new business wins.I'm also pleased that our fertilizer business delivered higher volumes year-over-year, supported by strong domestic shipments of [potash] and nitrogen. On the other side, chemicals continue to be soft, as demand remains challenged across our broad book of business. Office products faces headwinds in paper and pulp board, we've also seen some slowdown in export grains for ag and food. For the second half of the year, we expect to build on the successes we have had to win more wallet share of our existing customers while continuing our efforts to attract new customers away from truck. We expect auto, minerals and metals markets to remain supportive and will be important contributors to volume growth over the remainder of 2023. We look for destocking activity to wind down in many of the markets we serve, including chemicals, though timing there remains uncertain. What's most important is that our team is not sitting back and waiting for markets to turn, we are pushing forward with our own initiatives. Our business development group has been making great progress with our select site program and expanding our pipeline of partner projects, and we're strategically investing in developing new locations providing additional transloading capabilities and investing in railcars to drive more business to CSX.Turning to Slide 12. Second quarter coal revenue decreased 2%, as a 4% volume gain was more than offset by a 6% decline in revenue per unit driven by lower export coal benchmarks. We saw continued growth in export volumes due to beneficial cycle times, good performance at our Curtis Bay terminal and a push among our coal customers to move more tonnage into the overseas markets.Domestic utility shipments declined as we expected, as low natural gas prices weighed on coal burn, though demand in Southern utilities remained favorable. We expect momentum in export markets to continue over the second half of the year, with CSX volumes supported by new mine capacity and coal producers making opportunistic shipments into the international markets. On the domestic side, we see tougher comparisons versus a strong second half last year. But the hot summers providing a helpful tailwind early in this quarter. And just recently, we are seeing a few customers looking for additional sets. Of course, as international pricing benchmarks have eased from last year's record highs, we will see an impact on our revenue per unit into the third quarter.Most of our exports are met coal with a benchmark around $225 per metric ton. We anticipate our third quarter all-in coal RPO will sequentially decline by a mid-teens percentage. Current international benchmark prices remained very healthy in supportive of strong production into the back half of the year.Now turning to Slide 13. Second quarter revenue decreased by 18% due to a 10% decline in volume and a 9% reduction in revenue per unit, reflecting the effect of lower fuel surcharge. As in the first quarter, international intermodal drove most of the volume decrease with the business seeing headwinds from declining imports and inventory destocking. Volumes in the domestic business showed a much more modest decline helped by the good progress we continue to make with rail conversions and the team's efforts to identify new markets and lanes.Our best-in-class Eastern service product continues to position us for truck conversion in the quarters and years ahead. Looking forward, while we and our customers are still looking for a rebound in the international business, pressing ahead with our own initiatives, we brought on a new shipper late in the quarter that recognize the value of our strong service product and we're seeing other opportunities in new lanes and growing activity at inland ports. Domestically, we're encouraged by many opportunities to work more closely with all of our Class I partners to target truck conversion. Just one example of this is the agreement we reached with CPKC just a few weeks ago to create a new interchange in Alabama that will link our customers across the Southeast with key markets in Texas and Mexico. We think there's much more opportunity for new creative partnerships that can help bring even more business to all of the railroads. And we remain very excited about the opportunities ahead of us.Now I'll turn it over to Sean to discuss the financials.Sean R. PelkeyThank you, Kevin, and good afternoon. Looking at the second quarter results. Revenue was lower by 3% or $116 million. Declines in fuel recovery, other revenue and benchmark-based export coal pricing [offset] benefits from strong merchandise pricing as well as volume growth across merchandise and export coal.Operating income was down 13% to $1.5 billion, reflecting a $122 million headwind from cycling a gain on the Virginia property transaction. I'll discuss the expense line items in more detail on the next slide.Interest and other expense was $25 million higher compared to the prior year, and income tax expense decreased by $64 million on lower pre-tax earnings. As a result, EPS fell by $0.05, reflecting a $0.04 impact of lower property gains. Let's now turn to the next slide and take a closer look at expenses.Total second quarter expense increased $105 million. Lower fuel price was largely offset by the prior year Virginia gain. While network efficiency improvements resulted in over $20 million of cost savings, across labor, PS&amp;O and rents, it was not enough to overcome more than $100 million of headwinds from inflation and higher depreciation.Turning to the individual line items. Labor and fringe expense increased $57 million, impacted by inflation and increased headcount. Importantly, service improvements are helping us get more employees home sooner with overtime ratios down nearly 10% and a significant reduction in the number of employees stuck away from home over 24 hours. As a reminder, midyear union wage rates stepped up by 4% on July 1 and will be reflected in our second half cost per employee.PS&amp;O expense increased $37 million with inflation and higher repair and maintenance expense partly offset by savings in intermodal operations and cycling of costs related to the Pan Am acquisition. While we are overhauling and rebuilding more engines than last year, locomotive efficiency was 4% improved in the quarter. Depreciation was up $33 million as a result of last year's equipment study as well as a larger asset base.Fuel cost was down $134 million, driven by a lower gallon price. Equipment and rents was $5 million favorable, reflecting strong improvement in car cycle times with merchandise cycles 13% better than last year. These efficiency gains more than offset costs from inflation and higher volume, particularly in the automotive market. Finally, as discussed, property gains were $117 million unfavorable in the quarter. Now turning to cash flow and distributions on Slide 17. After fully funding infrastructure investments and strategic projects, CSX has generated $1.5 billion of free cash flow year-to-date. This has supported $2.4 billion in shareholder returns, including over $1.9 billion in share repurchases and $450 million of dividends. We were encouraged to receive recent news of a credit ratings upgrade. This move reflects the strong core cash-generating power of CSX through economic cycles, which supports our ongoing commitment to investing in the business, and our balanced opportunistic approach to capital return. Economic profit, as measured by CSX cash earnings is up over $80 million year-to-date. While intermodal storage revenue declines and export coal headwinds will have a more significant year-over-year impact in the second half. We remain committed to cultivating and investing in return-seeking projects that see the pipeline of mid- and long-term growth and efficiency gains.With that, let me turn it back to Joe for his closing remarks.Joseph R. HinrichsAll right. Thank you, Sean. Now let us conclude with some comments on our outlook for 2023, as shown on Slide 19. First, we reiterate our expectations that revenue ton-miles will grow in the low single-digits for the full year. We remain very happy with the performance of our merchandise business through the first half of the year and we look for volumes to be supported by continued strength in automotive, minerals and metals and the successes we have had in the marketplace.We expect full year coal volumes to be higher driven by strong demand for export coal. As we noted last quarter, domestic coal shipments will likely soften as demand is impacted by low natural gas prices. For intermodal, as Kevin said earlier, we have seen modest signs of improvement for domestic intermodal activity starting late in the second quarter, but there are no signs yet of a near-term recovery for the international business. We are still benefiting from a favorable pricing environment though our expectation for a $300 million decline in supplemental revenue is unchanged, with most of that year-over-year reduction occurring in the second half of the year.Lower international net coal benchmark prices will also impact our coal revenue per unit over the remainder of the year. As before, we are making our best efforts to drive efficiency and control costs to offset real inflationary pressures and we are committed to staying focused on improving service to our customers. And finally, we still estimate capital expenditures of $2.3 billion with a strong focus on innovation and growth.To sum up, I am proud of the progress of the One CSX team continues to make. There is no doubt that we face some mixed economic conditions in the near term. However, there are so many opportunities opening up for us to win share, expand our markets and achieve profitable growth if we remain focused on safety, service, execution and working together. I am very excited about what is ahead for CSX. Thank you, and we'll now take your questions.Question and Answer SessionMatthew KornThank you, Joe. (Operator Instructions).

WetherbeeI guess maybe I wanted to start with some thoughts on how the second half of the year, I guess. And in particular, how you think about matching resources to the volume and revenue environment that we're in right now. As you noted, you have coal and you have other revenue headwinds that are greater on a year-over-year basis as we move into the back half of the year. Certainly, volume is still like -- it's a little bit uncertain, Joe, as you mentioned, around the economic outlook. So how do we think about sort of managing the resources? I know service is coming back. Is it time that head count starts to decelerate on a sequential basis? Do you think that there's more work to be done there? Conceptually, how do you think about that fits in and what it maybe means to profitability in the back half of the year?Joseph R. HinrichsThanks, Chris. It's Joe. I think at a high level, we've noted some of the things that won't repeat from last year's second half, as you referenced. But we're really focused on getting our manpower levels up to continue to sustain the improved customer service levels that we've been delivering. And Jamie highlighted the tripling compliance in the second quarter around 84%. We've been in the 80s now pretty regularly since November of last year, and that's really resonating with our customers. We're watching very carefully what's happening with the volume. And we have a mixed kind of market out there, and Kevin highlighted, we've seen growth in metals and automotive and other parts of our business. Intermodal has been softer as we highlighted in chemicals, a little down. We'll see when that turns. But generally speaking, our volume has been holding up on the merchandise side. We've been growing merchandise business. So we're watching the volumes very carefully and making sure that we have the staffing levels to support sustained high levels of customer service. And the reason why that's so important is that Kevin and his team have really started to have some really good conversations with our customers.We gained share in the first half of the year, and that picked up momentum in the second quarter and we're having very good conversations with our customers now that we're sustaining these high levels -- higher levels of service. And as Jamie noted, we want to continue to improve. Our focus is really on making sure we have the manpower to be able to sustain that. And also, at the same time, of course, if we see volume reductions further than what we're seeing right now, and we'll respond accordingly. But right now, the volumes that we're seeing are supporting this merchandise volume growth and our high levels of service.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore.Jonathan B. ChappellSean, I wanted to ask you about the productivity improvements in the first quarter. You said $15 million to $20 million. You said more than $20 million in the second quarter. I think the plan was to eventually get to $30 million -- so I guess the question is essentially, do you get to $30 million by the back half of this year as a quarterly run rate? And kind of along the lines of Chris' question, if the volume environment is a bit softer, than you had anticipated 6 months ago? Could that $30 million even become greater as you think about 2H '23?Sean R. PelkeyThanks, Jon, for your question. Yes, your recollection is right in terms of what we said first quarter. So yes, we are building some momentum with $20 million -- a little over $20 million of what I would call sort of fluidity related savings year-over-year. Now just to be clear, we aren't really counting sort of changes in volume in that number up or down if there's costs related to that. This is sort of independent of that. This is things like cycling the cars faster and reducing costs related to that, reducing overtime, things along those lines.We do have line of sight to that number continuing to increase over the balance of the year, and we should be in that $30 million to $40 million range in the second half of the year is our plan, especially as we get out of summer here and labor availability starts to pick up, we get some more employees out of training. We feel pretty good about what that's going to set us up for in the second half of the year.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.Brandon Robert OglenskiKevin, I was wondering if you could follow up on the commentary around merchandise pricing reflecting service and a higher inflationary environment. But maybe contrasting that with the loss coal revenue and intermodal surcharges, if you could?Kevin S. BooneYes. I mean when you look at our coal market, and particularly the export market, it moves with the benchmark prices. So that's something that as a swing producer keeps the producers here in the U.S., in the market, and it's worked very, very well and it's a great mechanism. We participate, obviously, when the pricing is very good. I mean it remains very, very supportive. We just had extraordinary prices last year that nobody expected would continue. But again, we participated in that. When you look across our -- the rest of our portfolio, particularly on the merchandise side, it remains supportive of the inflationary environment out there. And our customers are getting price in the market and they're not surprised that our ability to go and have those discussions are similar to what they're having with their customers. So the alignment is there. Certainly, I think the market would be. People are looking for inflation to come down a little bit, and we'll see how the market continues. But market from a pricing perspective, both in merchandise and maybe a little bit less so in the spot market on the intermodal side. Obviously, that's been a little bit softer, but still very, very healthy and will carry forward into next year.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research.Scott H. GroupSorry about my voice. Hopefully, you can hear me. So the coal RPU guidance was helpful. How should we think about the fuel impact in the third quarter? What are the other puts and takes as I think about operating ratio, profit Q2 to Q3? And then just like bigger picture, it feels like there's still a pretty good gap between underlying pricing and some really elevated inflation. Like when does that normalize in your mind?Sean R. PelkeyScott, it's Sean. Yes, so in terms of Q3 versus Q2, I mean, I think step back just a minute and think about what are we ultimately trying to achieve here. We've got a service product that's -- it's well in excess of where it's been and certainly one of the best if not the best in the industry. That's ultimately going to translate into the ability to win business off the highway and we're seeing those. We're seeing a number of those opportunities present themselves. Over time, that's going to have a really positive impact, not just on margins, but also on obviously being able to grow the top and bottom line of the company.When we look at the third quarter specifically relative to the second, we've got the headwinds that Kevin talked about on coal pricing. We've had positive fuel lag all year long. We're seeing fuel prices settle a little bit here, so that could be a little bit of a headwind into the third quarter. And then as I mentioned, we've got the union wage rate increases of 4%. So that will add some costs.In terms of the second half of your question, the gap between pricing and inflation, we're seeing mid-single-digit inflation across both labor and fringe and purchase services and other. That's going to persist here for the balance of the year. We've got a clean line of sight into the labor line. And most of the PS&amp;O is essentially set for the year from a rate perspective.I would also say, and Kevin can chime in if there's additional info. But I think most of the pricing for the year has been done, we'll start to get into pricing for next year as we get towards the end of the year. And so far, conversations have been -- continue to be very supportive.Kevin S. BooneYes, I think that's right. We've seen the pricing reflect in inflationary environment. And there's multiyear contracts that we'll still have to touch at the back half of this year that probably need a little bit of catch-up. But beyond that, I think it's well in line with what the inflationary market is out there, particularly on the merchandise business today.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.Kenneth Scott HoexterSo just to understand this environment, Joe or maybe, Kevin, as you move into the third quarter, you're targeting -- still targeting low single-digit revenue ton-mile growth. I guess you're running about 2% or so year-to-date. So do you think that moves negative based on the current weak volumes that we're seeing so far right now? And then if we do get that weak environment that we're talking about, can you still improve operating ratio as we move into the third quarter, if you're looking at revenue stay above cost of inflation?Kevin S. BooneYes. I think, Ken, you'll remember, I think as you move into the back half of the year and as you enter into the fourth quarter, we're also going to lap a lot of easier comps, whether it's the international intermodal market or some of the markets that we saw. Some order softness begin in September and really carry through the fourth quarter. So I would say things will probably trend positively through the quarter, which will be helpful from a revenue -- RTM growth perspective.Coal is a dynamic market right now. Look, 2 weeks, 3 weeks ago before this hot summer started probably a little bit lower outlook for domestic coal business. But just recently, we're getting a lot more interest and a lot more inbounds on what we can do, given some of the heatwaves we're having. In fact, I think we got a heat warning here in Jacksonville this afternoon. So things have been hot. Obviously, that's supportive of that market. And so things can change, our very dynamic can change quickly.The destocking, I think I mentioned it in my prepared remarks, we've seen destocking for a while in some of these markets. I don't -- I can't call the month or the quarter of when that stops, but there's many markets right now where we're underrunning I think, the demand that's out there in the business. So once that normalizes to the underlying demand in the economy, I think that's an opportunity for us, too. And I'm hopeful that as we move into the fourth quarter, we'll see some of those dynamics play out. And then as Joe pointed out, there's -- the team has been doing a fantastic job and some of the efforts and some of the collaboration that we've had with Jamie and his team on the operations side is resulting in wins and those start to layer in as we move through the year and into next year, and you'll start to see that in our business as well.Sean R. PelkeyYes. And Ken, just on the second part of your question, I think the commentary you heard from Kevin suggest we're not calling a pullback in volumes. But to the extent that the macro presents something like that, there's things that we can do, there's levers that we can pull. And certainly, we would look to do that, but not to jeopardize the ability to continue to gain momentum and gain share off the truck, which is the ultimate goal here to kind of grow the pie and grow our profitability.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan.Brian Patrick OssenbeckSo maybe just on the topic of truckload conversion, it's been mentioned several times on the call. Obviously, it's a big opportunity. But can you give us any context in terms of the wins you're getting or you have line of sight to? Would you be able to quantify that at some point in time because clearly, making the long-term decision to go after that and sounds like you're getting some -- but it's hard to say what relative size that could be. And then, Sean, if you could just clarify cost per employee that we should expect for the next quarter? I know payments go up or the wages go up another 4%, but you got mix over time, a few other things in there as well. So it would be helpful if you can clarify that, too.Kevin S. BooneYes. I think in terms of numbers, we'll probably put a finer point on the truck conversion opportunity over the next 3 years at some time in the future. There's a huge focus by the team to really look at our pipeline and measure it and focus on those customers where there's an opportunity and some customers have a lot more opportunities than others and making sure we have the resources up against those customers to really drive that conversion. So a lot of activity. We have a lot of new tools internally that we're focused on in terms of measuring that. So our data is getting better and better every day, and there's a lot of momentum. And as I mentioned, our pipeline, as we measure it on a year-over-year basis, is up significantly, up 30%.On a dollar volume perspective, it's up even more than that. So a lot of momentum building. Obviously, the trucking market is not the most receptive market to compete against right now. Hopefully, there's some optimism that's firming up here, and that will even drive more opportunities as we work with customers over the next few months to drive more opportunities. And we're upwards of 25 white-boarding sessions year-to-date, and those are driving a lot of opportunities. They don't necessarily come to fruition tomorrow. But over the next couple of quarters, we think those are going to translate into a lot of opportunities to shift share from truck as well. So teams are very, very excited. I don't think we've had this much of momentum in terms of the things that we can control going forward. It's just some of these markets obviously are against us right now.Over to you, Sean.Sean R. PelkeyAnd in terms of cost per employee, it should be fairly stable other than the 4% wage increase on the union piece. I think there are some opportunities to drive some efficiencies there. So we hope to do better than a 4% increase from the first half to the second half, but we'll certainly feel the impact of higher wages.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens.Justin Trennon LongI wanted to ask about intermodal because there's a big divergence between the domestic intermodal and international intermodal volume trends. And I was wondering if you could share how those numbers compared in the second quarter? And looking into the back half, around your comment about the domestic intermodal market gaining momentum. Is that a function of demand getting better or your expectation for business wins starting to kick in?Kevin S. BooneYes. I think when you look at the second quarter, think about the international market being down in that high-teens range. We probably from a bottom perspective, peak down in that mid-20s, and it's improved slightly from there. So our exit rate is a little bit better than what we saw middle of the quarter.What we saw through the quarter on the domestic side is sequential improvement month-over-month or on a year-over-year basis each month as we get to move through the quarter. So that gives us optimism there. The team has done, quite frankly, a fantastic job of introducing some new lanes, working with some of our Class I partners to do that and identify new business. And some of those things are really playing out. Some of our partners have done really, really well in the market despite some of the obviously, headwinds there. So working with them, identifying markets where we have some opportunities. And in these kind of markets, it gives you more flexibility to go out there and look at things, look at your network, identify opportunities, try things out that may work. And really go after it. So that's what the team has been using the softness in the market to go and do and set us up for growth as the market rebounds. And I think you're starting to see that in the numbers here.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS.Thomas Richard WadewitzYes. Great. Appreciate it. I know you've got a lot of questions, Kevin, on volume. And maybe there is not -- tough not to have a clear crystal ball in this type of environment. But I guess, how do you think about the kind of -- in a -- you've got good momentum with the service, good discussions with customers. You're talking about the pipeline is good. If we see some improvement get beyond inventory reduction, just see a bit of improvement in demand. Do you think you're going to see maybe a bigger cyclical swing up and maybe more evidence of some of that truck conversion coming through? Or I guess I'm just trying to think about -- we know it's a tough rate backdrop, but what is -- how do these things translate when you see some improvement in markets? Is it mid-single-digit volumes higher? How do you think about that potential framework, maybe looking at a little ways?Kevin S. BooneYes, I probably won't put numbers around it, but there's a reason we're hiring. There's -- we see all the things that we can control internally, setting us up nicely for when the markets rebound. And yes, I think the combination of markets returning at least to -- in some cases, just the current demand levels is going to create a lot of leverage in our business to do that. And I think you'll see some of these businesses. We're having discussions around truck conversion as the market firms up, more willing to move that freight back over to rail or move it to rail for the first time. So -- it's -- the pipeline takes a while to build up. It's been -- as Joe was pointing out earlier, it's been about 9 months since we've seen that rail improvement. And the customers are reacting to it, some sooner than others. But yes, that's the idea of all these investments, obviously, will help us participate when that cyclical upside starts to occur.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Fadi Chamoun with BMO Capital Markets.Fadi ChamounMy question on the service level, like obviously, you have done a great job in rebuilding the service and doing the -- a comprehensive work on building the culture to sustain that longer term. But as we know, like some of the service issues we saw in the last 2, 3 years were all rail related. You had obviously a lot of friction coming to you from outside of your own network. I'm just wondering, how are you kind of thinking about some of these problems that are affecting your service from outside your network. But some of these partnerships that Kevin talked about, try to kind of iron out some of these friction areas that you see in the supply chain or are there opportunities to kind of build the service level that can be sustained even as demand comes back, which historically has been a challenge to service levels?Joseph R. HinrichsYes. Thanks for the question. This is Joe. You're right. Over the last several years, supply chain across the globe was challenged, and we certainly felt the effects of some of that. We've got some benefits from that on the supplemental revenue side of things because things were gummed up in storage. But generally speaking, from a customer standpoint, it definitely impacted everyone. And as we've noted in the past, around 40% of what we moved on the carload side touches another rail provider. So interchanges are important and the overall service levels of the partners we have across the Class I rails is really important. If you think about going forward, the ports aren't congested as much as they were, and we don't have a lot of the network all gummed up in the intermodal facilities and et cetera. So we should be able to run more fluidly when the market comes back on the intermodal side especially. So I think from a customer perspective, the things that have calmed down help and as our Class I rail partners continue to improve their service, the collective service that we give to the customer holistically will improve as well, which -- that's an opportunity for the whole industry going forward. That's the way we're thinking about it.We can control our piece of it, and we want to keep getting better and more repeatable and more predictable and also working with our other Class I rail partners to do the same. At the same time, the other parts of the business have also freed up -- so as Kevin was alluding to, when that market comes back, we'll have the manpower levels, and we'll have the fluidity in our network and the system overall should be able to handle it in a better way, which should be better for the overall economy.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank.Amit Singh MehrotraKevin, can you just talk about the direction of travel for non-coal yield? I just would have expected a little bit of a better performance in the second quarter sequentially. I know there was a few headwinds that's pretty severe incrementally, that fuel headwind kind of moderates in 3Q. So just wondering what the direction of travel on that is. And then Sean, you made some good progress on PS&amp;O costs in the quarter relative to I guess, that insurance gain adjusted first quarter. I know you've got some like leases that are expiring around intermodal container storage jars and things like that in the back half. What's the right way to think about PS&amp;O coming down in the back half relative to what you did in the second quarter?Kevin S. BooneYes. Obviously, putting coal aside, obviously, that we've talked about on the international side. When you look at yields broadly, there's always mix, right? And when you look at our merchandise business, in general, one of the markets we've highlighted is obviously under cyclical pressure right now is the chemical market, which typically has a higher RPU. So that's weighed on the overall benefit you've seen from the merchandise side, and there's a lot of moving parts within it. But if you look at what we were able to achieve within the individual markets is quite healthy, I think despite some of the fuel surcharge headwinds that you saw. The intermodal market obviously is unique given some of the challenges on the truck in what we have to do there, particularly on the spot market. But again, fuel surcharge is a much larger impact there. And absent that, you saw a flattish-type RPU, and that was mainly impacted by some of our longer-term contracts, obviously had positive rate. But on the flip side, some of the spot markets saw some significant downgrade along with the truck. But the market held in, obviously, a lot better than some of the trucking rates out there and what the markets do there. But overall, I was very pleased in some of the NPA results as we measure it are some of the highest results that we've seen in a long time, if you look broadly across some markets.Sean R. PelkeyAnd Amit, your question on PS&amp;O, I'm always hesitant to predict that line because there's a number of different puts and takes within it, that can impact the quarter. I will say that we are very -- we're focused on cost control, and we're making sure that we've got only the costs that are necessary in order to move the volume to the extent that intermodal volumes pick up a little bit, that will have an impact on PS&amp;O costs. But outside of volume-related expenses, I would fully expect that we'd be able to kind of hold the line on the improvement that you saw in the second quarter in the PS&amp;O going forward. And if you look at it on a year-over-year basis for the second half, that means we'll probably be able to absorb most of the inflationary impact in the second half, notwithstanding any sort of volume-related impacts that we might see.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Sanford Bernstein.David Scott VernonSo Kevin, just to kind of dig into the mid-teens guidance for RPU sequentially. Does that kind of bring us to mark-to-market for $225 -- and then -- how do we think about the sensitivity? Can we extrapolate that sensitivity going forward if we're going to expect sort of benchmark pricing to either go up or down? Is that a good way to think about the sensitivity on further price changes? Because $225 was still, call it, $75 above the long run average in the prior decade.Kevin S. BooneYes. I think that's fair. Obviously, there's bottoms, right? And there's -- we protect ourselves both on the bottom and then on the top end, we don't participate in some of the extreme [stream] cases, but I think that's fair. $225 is kind of embedded in what we're coming into the quarter -- we've seen a little bit of positive uplift in that. So even as recently as the last couple of days. So we'll see where that trends. But we've seen a lot of stability, if not a little slight uptick in that market here recently, and we'll see what the fourth quarter brings.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs.Paul StoddardThis is Paul Stoddard on for Jordan. I guess with the recent agreement on the West Coast for the long Shoreman, there's some anticipation that there could be some more freight being diverted back to the West Coast. I guess how are you thinking about that in terms of international intermodal long term? And do you think that's going to be offset by domestic intermodal?Kevin S. BooneI think the long-term trend, if you -- you just go to Charleston, you go to Savannah and you look at all the investments being made, there's a long-term growth opportunity on the East Coast and you'll continue to see our growth in the East Coast, which we'll continue to serve and benefit from.Some stability on the West Coast is going to be helpful. As you know, a lot of our international business still comes across the west through Chicago and other interchange points. And unfortunately, a lot of that volume given some of the congestion on the West was either trucks, and we didn't see that volume. So as that we should benefit from a recovery there. So I don't see it as necessarily taking share away from what we're doing in the East, more as something that -- obviously, if the rails in the West begin to perform better on a year-over-year basis will benefit the Eastern network and some of that traffic coming to us.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.Allison Ann Marie Poliniak-CusicJust want to go back to Brian's question on modal conversion. When you talk to customers that aren't quite ready to convert yet. Is it simply price that's holding them back? Or is there something from a service perspective that they're looking for you to provide, that's just not quite there yet? Just any thoughts on that.Kevin S. BooneLook, I think the most important thing for customers is reliability, right? And in some customers' eyes, they want to see more of that reliability. They like what they see today. We've got to continue to perform and how those conversations and sometimes it's lane-by-lane. It's carload-by-carload where we get that confidence from a customer. And so we're in the very early innings of this, and we feel the acceleration from first quarter to second quarter, and I expect those conversations to pick up even more in the third and fourth quarters as we continue to perform.Sharing what we're doing on the hiring side is incredibly helpful. Sharing with them what we plan to do to make our network more resilient, winning their confidence, but that's the #1 issue. It's not price. 99% of the time, we have a pricing advantage versus our truck competitor. So that's the opportunity for us. We have the environmental advantages. So we have all these things. We've just got to get the reliability to improve and that reliability is sustainable.Operator(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets.Walter Noel SpracklinI just wanted to shift focus from -- the pipeline looks really good, Kevin, and presumably that's merchandise base mainly. But looking into 2024 on some of your bulk areas and in particular, ag and coal, the EIA has just revised downward its forecast for next year by quite a bit. And then on the ag side, it looks like there's some severe drought conditions forming that's going to impact the current growing season. So looking into 2024, I mean that suggests that we could be bracing for some down double-digit volume growth in those 2 categories. Is there any offsets there that you would flag for next year that would offset some of those fairly negative forecast for those two particular commodities?Kevin S. BooneWell, really hot summer certainly doesn't hurt. And that's what we're in the middle of. Obviously, from a coal perspective and you're referencing mainly the domestic side, that's obviously dependent on the weather conditions and weather, I think is a surprise from a heat perspective to the upside here over the last few weeks, and we're seeing that with a lot of our customers running full out here and deploying some of the inventory levels. And -- so we'll see how the winter plays out. I think it's really, really early in July to call 2024. That seems a bit premature to me.We see a very healthy export market as well. Obviously, that's driven by global macro conditions, but we have new supply coming online that will ramp up next year. That supply is going to land in the market. It's very competitive in the market, and we expect to participate in it. Many of the mines that we serve are going to be in the market almost no matter what conditions. So we see the volume there sustainable. On the ag side, again, I followed these markets for a long time. I think July is a little bit premature as well. It has been hot out there. We'll see how the market firms up here but there's a lot of moving parts. We're seeing a little bit of weakness here in the third quarter, but we see some good indications into the fourth. So we'll see how that trends, and we'll watch the crop conditions as you are to see how that moves into the back half of the year. Obviously, we don't have as large of a franchise on that side as some of the other railroads, particularly in the West from an export perspective. So a little less exposure.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with TD Cowen.Elliot Andrew AlperGreat. This is Elliot Alper on for Jason. On the international intermodal side, last quarter, you talked about how some of your larger customers were expecting a pickup in the back half of the year. So I guess, what have your customers said that has changed over the past 3 months that has resulted in no inflection yet? Maybe there's been any change in view in the peak season?Kevin S. BooneI don't -- I wouldn't read any of our comments that just been any type of inflection down. We're just -- I don't think there's -- we're seeing in real time and inflection up in the market and I mentioned earlier, in the fourth quarter, we obviously start to lap a lot easier comps on a year-over-year basis. So I think from an overall growth perspective, fourth quarter will be a much easier comp than what we've seen throughout the year. And hopefully, that momentum will carry into next year. But there's no indications that the market is necessarily picking up. I don't -- I think we bottomed from that perspective. The question is how quickly the market recovers? And that will be heavily relying on the consumer and how that stands out into the holiday season going forward.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, this concludes our Q&amp;A session for today and today's conference call.

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)A 3% drop in revenue put pressure on CSX’s net profits for the second quarter of 2023, according to financial results that the company released late Thursday.Revenue at the eastern U.S. Class I railroad fell 3% to $3.7 billion from the second quarter of 2022 amid lower fuel prices, reduced supplemental revenue, a decline in export coal benchmark prices and a decrease in intermodal volumes, the company said. While there were volume increases for coal and CSX’s merchandise segment — including “solid gains in merchandise pricing” — those factors weren’t enough to offset the revenue decline, according to CSX.Net income for CSX (NASDAQ: CSX) in the second quarter of 2023 was $996 million, or 49 cents per diluted share, down 15% from $1.18 billion, or 54 cents per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2022. Second-quarter 2022 results were also affected by a $122 million gain related to a property sale agreement with the Commonwealth of Virginia.Operating income fell 13% to $1.48 billion, while operating ratio (OR) was 59.9%, compared with 55.4% in the second quarter of 2022. OR is a metric that investors sometimes use to gauge the financial health of a company, with a lower OR implying improved health.Expenses increased 5% year over year to $2.2 billion amid higher labor and fringe costs as well as higher depreciation and amortization expenses.“The ONE CSX team continued to build momentum this quarter as our merchandise and coal businesses continued to demonstrate significant volume gains,” CSX President and CEO Joe Hinrichs said in a release. “Though intermodal activity remains challenged, our strong service performance distinguishes us in the marketplace and is attracting shippers to our network. We look forward to meeting the opportunities ahead in the second half of the year and over the long term as we position CSX for sustainable, profitable growth.”Subscribe to FreightWaves’ e-newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inbox.Story continuesClick here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.Related links:Sites across US primed for rail-served industrial developmentRailroads move to create more access between Mexico, Texas, US SoutheastCPKC, CSX form joint venture for hydrogen locomotivesFreight rail leaders realize relationship rebuilding requiredThe post CSX’s Q2 profit slips 15% on lower revenues appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

Let's take a look at some of the movers here after-hours. Three stocks for you. Let's start off with Intuitive Surgical. This is the robotic surgical company here, provider of equipment. That's under pressure in after-hours trading, off just about 5% when it comes to the numbers for its most recent quarter, actually beating the Street's estimates on revenue. Procedure growth was up 22%. The company saying that more surgeries helping its results.But we got to remember that this stock has certainly been on fire since the start of the year. We've seen a massive run-up as of late, up just about-- this is Sirius. Let's go over to Intuitive Surgical. Here we go. A massive run-up as of late, up just about 31% year-to-date. So it's giving back some of those losses there. We mentioned the fact that for some of these companies, the bar is very, very high, especially when we see gains over the last couple of months. That's why we're giving back some of that excitement. At least right now, off just about 5%.Flipping over to CSX Corporation, the railroad operator. That's also moving lower, off nearly 5%. The company missed on revenue. It was down about 3% from just about a year ago, falling coal fuel prices, hurting sales, also weaker shipping volumes, something that we have talked about industrywide. That is weighing on CSX's results here for its latest quarter. Year-to-date, the stock is still in the green, up just about 8%. Over the past year, up about 13%. But again, the fact that it fell just a bit short of analyst expectations. That's what's putting pressure on shares right now.Rounding out with Capital One, a look here at the consumer, credit card spending trends, auto delinquencies. We're actually seeing a rise of just about a half of a percent. Deposits did slightly miss expectations. Also, the company reporting higher auto and car-- and credit card delinquencies, something that we have really been closely tracking here as we get a number of results here from the credit card companies from the banks. That's offering us a closer glimpse, a closer look into what exactly the spending behavior is right now. Over the last three months, looking at Capital One, up just about 18%. Since the start of the year, up about 23%.]"

264,616e4e7a-4720-3ee9-bd86-e88dea17c5dc,RCL,2023-07-21,Royal Caribbean (RCL) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/royal-caribbean-rcl-earnings-expected-140209355.html,1689861729,STORY,['RCL'],"[The market expects Royal Caribbean (RCL) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 27. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis cruise operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.57 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +175.5%.Revenues are expected to be $3.38 billion, up 54.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.27% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Royal Caribbean?For Royal Caribbean, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.88%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Royal Caribbean will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Royal Caribbean would post a loss of $0.71 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.23, delivering a surprise of +67.61%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Royal Caribbean doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, the results fell below the initial expectations due to the impacts of a recent IT security incident disclosed in June.The company anticipates adjusted EPS in the range of $2.30-$2.35. Despite the setback caused by the security breach, the company expects to report strong free cash flow generation for the quarter.The disruptions resulting from the IT security incident primarily affected the Propulsion and Engine P&amp;A segments. Although the company's facilities and systems are now fully operational, the disruptions at the end of the quarter limited the opportunity for a full recovery in this period. Although the company is expected to recover some losses going forward, the lost production of high horsepower outboard engines may prove challenging to compensate. The company plans to be in full production for the rest of the year but with limited ability to make up for lost output.Looking ahead to the rest of the year, BC will likely benefit from stronger-than-expected new boat retail in recent months and continued high Mercury retail market share. Also, the effective management of inventory levels across its businesses bodes well.The company now estimates its full-year adjusted EPS to be approximately $9.50. Earlier, it had projected earnings in the range of $9.50-$11.00. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings is pegged at $10.30 per share. The lingering effects of the IT security incident, coupled with ongoing global consumer pressure, have made the company cautious about its financial performance in the second half of the year.Price PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares of BC have increased 13.2% in the past year compared with the industry’s 18.3% rise.

267,faf75ba6-2f47-3981-b28f-c463d0acbc73,ROST,2023-07-21,4 Retail Discount Stocks Thriving Amid Industry Challenges,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-retail-discount-stocks-thriving-151200970.html,1689865920,STORY,"['ROST', 'COST', 'TGT', 'TJX', '^GSPC']","[Consumer spending activity, which is one of the pivotal factors driving the economy, has somewhat slowed down. Underlying inflationary pressure, a slowing labor market, a higher interest rate environment and reductions in pandemic savings have collectively dampened demand. Of late, players in the Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry have been encountering these headwinds.That said, industry participants have been focusing on deepening engagements with consumers, adding more compelling products and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. Inventory management, supply-chain enhancement, cost-structure realignment and investments to accelerate digitization have been working in favor of companies like Costco Wholesale Corporation COST, The TJX Companies, Inc. TJX, Target Corporation TGT and Ross Stores, Inc. ROST.About the IndustryThe Retail – Discount Stores industry comprises companies that offer apparel, accessories, footwear, beauty products, personal and baby care products, cleaning products, pet supplies, and food and beverage products at lower prices than traditional retail outlets. The industry participants also provide home textiles, home furnishings, housewares, art and craft supplies, toys and seasonal decor products. These companies sell their products through stores, digital channels, or both. Some industry players operate membership shopping warehouse clubs, offering branded and private-label products in a range of merchandise categories. Most discount stores are gradually emerging as one-stop shopping destinations. The profitability of players depends on a prudent pricing model, a well-organized supply chain and an effective merchandising strategy.4 Key Industry Trends to WatchSoft Demand May Hit Revenues: The industry’s prospects are correlated with the purchasing power of consumers. Consumer spending, a key catalyst for the economy, has recently shown signs of slowing down. Several factors have come into play, including underlying inflationary pressure, a slowing labor market, a higher interest rate environment and reductions in pandemic savings. We note that U.S. retail sales experienced a slight uptick in June 2023, falling short of analysts’ expectations. Retail sales showed 0.2% growth, marking a deceleration from the 0.5% growth recorded in May. Additionally, there are indications that the Federal Reserve is likely to resume raising interest rates this month, following a period of unchanged rates in June.Story continuesPressure on Margins to Linger: Companies in the industry are vying for a bigger share on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. Further, the increasing dominance of e-commerce players has made the retail-discount space highly competitive. This has compelled many players to strengthen their digital ecosystem and boost shipping and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors drive sales, they entail high costs. Apart from these, higher marketing, advertising and other store-related expenses might compress margins. Of late, the industry participants have been dealing with product cost inflation. Nonetheless, companies have been focusing on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges. These include streamlining operational structures, optimizing supply networks and adopting effective pricing policies.Consumers Seek Better Bargains: The strategy to sell products at discounted prices has helped industry players draw customers in low-to-middle-income groups who have been seeking both value and convenience, particularly in the face of rising prices. Industry participants have been focusing on creating innovative and compelling products and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities to attract price-sensitive consumers.Digitization Is the Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns, industry participants have been evolving to play dual in-store and online roles. Initiatives, such as building omnichannel, coming up with loyalty and marketing programs, enhancing the supply chain and providing faster delivery options, be it doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at the store, are worth mentioning. Simultaneously, companies are investing in renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers’ product preferences and growing inclination toward online shopping, retailers have been replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry is housed within the broader Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #235, which places it in the bottom 6% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates drab near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Since the beginning of January 2023, the industry’s earnings estimate has declined 10.5%.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry vs. Broader MarketThe Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry has underperformed the broader Retail – Wholesale sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.Stocks in this industry have collectively increased 3%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector has risen 6.8% and the S&amp;P 500 has rallied 14.1% in the said time frame.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is commonly used for valuing retail stocks, the industry is currently trading at 25.13 compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 20.14 and the sector’s 23.62.Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 29.98X and as low as 18.04X, with the median being at 23.59X, as the chart below shows.Price-to-Earnings Ratio (Past 5 Years)4 Retail Discount Store Stocks to Keep a Close Eye OnCostco: The discount retailer’s growth strategies, better price management and decent membership trends have been contributing to its performance. Cumulatively, these factors have been aiding this Issaquah, WA-based company in registering decent sales numbers. The company's distinctive membership business model and pricing power set it apart from traditional players. We believe a favorable product mix, steady store traffic, pricing strength and strong liquidity should benefit Costco.Costco has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 1.8%, on average.

I am very proud of the work our associates have done and believe we are well-positioned to deliver solid financial performance in any environment.""SUMMARY OF SECOND QUARTER 2023 RESULTS:Quarter Ended(amounts in millions, except per share data)6/30/20233/31/20236/30/2022Net income$581$612$583Preferred dividends and other252425Net income available to common shareholders$556$588$558Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding939942940Actual shares outstanding—end of period939935934Diluted earnings per common share$0.59$0.62$0.59Selected items impacting earnings:Pre-tax adjusted items(1):Adjustments to non-interest expense(1)$(1)$(2)$6Adjustments to non-interest income(1)—(1)—Total pre-tax adjusted items(1)$(1)$(3)$6Diluted EPS impact*$—$—$—Pre-tax additional selected items**:Provision (in excess of) less than net charge-offs$(37)$(52)$(22)Capital markets income (loss) - CVA/DVA(9)(33)20Residential MSR net hedge performance(4)(3)11Incremental operational losses related to check fraud(82)——*Based on income taxes at an approximate 25% incremental rate.**Items impacting results or trends during the period, but are not considered non-GAAP adjustments.Non-GAAP adjusted items(1) impacting the company's earnings are identified to assist investors in analyzing Regions' operating results on the same basis as that applied by management and provide a basis to predict future performance.Story continuesTotal revenueQuarter Ended($ amounts in millions)6/30/20233/31/20236/30/20222Q23 vs. 1Q232Q23 vs. 2Q22Net interest income$1,381$1,417$1,108$(36)(2.5)%$27324.6%Taxable equivalent adjustment121311(1)(7.7)%19.1%Net interest income, taxable equivalent basis$1,393$1,430$1,119$(37)(2.6)%$27424.5%Net interest margin (FTE)4.04%4.22%3.06%Non-interest income:Service charges on deposit accounts$152$155$165(3)(1.9)%(13)(7.9)%Card and ATM fees13012113397.4%(3)(2.3)%Wealth management income110112102(2)(1.8)%87.8%Capital markets income68421122661.9%(44)(39.3)%Mortgage income26244728.3%(21)(44.7)%Commercial credit fee income28262327.7%521.7%Bank-owned life insurance191716211.8%318.8%Securities gains (losses), net—(2)—2100.0%—NMMarket value adjustments on employee benefit assets*—(1)(17)1100.0%17100.0%Other43405937.5%(16)(27.1)%Non-interest income$576$534$640$427.9%$(64)(10.0)%Total revenue$1,957$1,951$1,748$60.3%$20912.0%Adjusted total revenue (non-GAAP)(1)$1,957$1,952$1,748$50.3%$20912.0%NM - Not Meaningful* These market value adjustments relate to assets held for employee and director benefits that are offset within salaries and employee benefits and other non-interest expense.Total revenue of approximately $2 billion remained relatively stable on both a reported and adjusted basis(1) compared to the first quarter of 2023. Consistent with the company's expectations, net interest income decreased during the quarter to $1.4 billion or 3 percent compared to the first quarter attributable to accelerating deposit and funding costs partially offset by higher market interest rates and the company's asset sensitive balance sheet. Total net interest margin decreased 18 basis points to 4.04 percent.Non-interest income increased 8 percent on both a reported and adjusted basis(1) compared to the first quarter of 2023 primarily driven by increases in capital markets income and card and ATM fees. The increase in capital markets income was driven primarily by improvement in CVA/DVA valuation adjustments. Excluding the impact of CVA/DVA, capital markets income increased 3 percent as growth, primarily in real estate capital markets, was partially offset by declines in mergers and acquisitions, debt underwriting and loan syndication income. Card &amp; ATM fees increased 7 percent driven primarily by seasonally higher transaction and spend volumes, as well as a card rewards liability adjustment in the prior quarter that did not repeat.Non-interest expenseQuarter Ended($ amounts in millions)6/30/20233/31/20236/30/20222Q23 vs. 1Q232Q23 vs. 2Q22Salaries and employee benefits$603$616$575$(13)(2.1)%$284.9%Equipment and software expense10110297(1)(1.0)%44.1%Net occupancy expense737375——%(2)(2.7)%Outside services42393837.7%410.5%Professional, legal and regulatory expenses20192415.3%(4)(16.7)%Marketing262722(1)(3.7)%418.2%FDIC insurance assessments292513416.0%16123.1%Credit/checkcard expenses15141317.1%215.4%Operational losses95131382NM82NMBranch consolidation, property and equipment charges12(6)(1)(50.0)%7116.7%Visa class B shares expense989112.5%——%Other97897589.0%2229.3%Total non-interest expense$1,111$1,027$948$848.2%$16317.2%Total adjusted non-interest expense(1)$1,110$1,025$954$858.3%$15616.4%NM - Not MeaningfulNon-interest expense increased 8 percent on both a reported and adjusted basis(1) compared to the first quarter of 2023. Commensurate with trends experienced by banks across the industry, the increase in operational losses was attributable to a spike in check fraud. Importantly, the company has effective countermeasures in place, and losses have returned to normalized levels. Excluding the incremental increase in operational losses, non-interest expense remained relatively stable. FDIC insurance assessments increased 16 percent attributable to changes in various inputs including normalizing credit conditions and an increase in average assets. Partially offsetting these increases, salaries and benefits decreased 2 percent primarily due to a seasonal decrease in payroll taxes and lower benefit costs.The company's second quarter efficiency ratio was 56.4 percent on both a reported and adjusted basis(1). The effective tax rate was 20.2 percent in the second quarter. Compared to the first quarter, the lower effective tax rate was attributable to deductions for equity compensation that occurred during the current quarter.Loans and LeasesAverage Balances($ amounts in millions)2Q231Q232Q222Q23 vs. 1Q232Q23 vs. 2Q22Commercial and industrial$52,039$51,158$46,538$8811.7%$5,50111.8%Commercial real estate—owner-occupied5,1975,3055,477(108)(2.0)%(280)(5.1)%Investor real estate8,4828,4047,428780.9%1,05414.2%Business Lending65,71864,86759,4438511.3%6,27510.6%Residential first mortgage19,42718,95717,5694702.5%1,85810.6%Home equity5,7855,9216,082(136)(2.3)%(297)(4.9)%Consumer credit card1,2171,2141,14530.2%726.3%Other consumer—exit portfolios450527836(77)(14.6)%(386)(46.2)%Other consumer*5,9845,7915,6891933.3%2955.2%Consumer Lending32,86332,41031,3214531.4%1,5424.9%Total Loans$98,581$97,277$90,764$1,3041.3%$7,8178.6%NM - Not meaningful.* Other consumer loans includes EnerBank (Regions' point of sale home improvement portfolio).Average loans and leases increased 1 percent compared to the prior quarter driven primarily by growth in commercial and industrial lending, investor real estate, residential first mortgages and EnerBank. Growth in average business lending was broad-based across the telecommunications, multifamily, and energy industries. Approximately 84 percent of this quarter's business loan growth was driven by existing clients accessing and expanding their credit lines. Commercial loan line utilization levels ended the quarter at approximately 43.5 percent, decreasing 20 basis points over the prior quarter, while line commitments grew approximately $1.5 billion during the quarter.DepositsAverage Balances($ amounts in millions)2Q231Q232Q222Q23 vs. 1Q232Q23 vs. 2Q22Total interest-bearing deposits$78,361$79,450$80,681$(1,089)(1.4)%$(2,320)(2.9)%Non-interest-bearing deposits47,17849,59258,911(2,414)(4.9)%(11,733)(19.9)%Total Deposits$125,539$129,042$139,592$(3,503)(2.7)%$(14,053)(10.1)%($ amounts in millions)2Q231Q232Q222Q23 vs. 1Q232Q23 vs. 2Q22Consumer Bank Segment$80,999$82,200$85,224$(1,201)(1.5)%$(4,225)(5.0)%Corporate Bank Segment34,86036,27341,920(1,413)(3.9)%(7,060)(16.8)%Wealth Management Segment7,4708,46310,020(993)(11.7)%(2,550)(25.4)%Other2,2102,1062,4281044.9%(218)(9.0)%Total Deposits$125,539$129,042$139,592$(3,503)(2.7)%$(14,053)(10.1)%Ending Balances as of6/30/20236/30/2023($ amounts in millions)6/30/20233/31/20236/30/2022vs. 3/31/2023vs. 6/30/2022Consumer Bank Segment$81,554$83,296$84,987$(1,742)(2.1)%$(3,433)(4.0)%Corporate Bank Segment35,33235,18541,4561470.4%(6,124)(14.8)%Wealth Management Segment7,1767,9419,489(765)(9.6)%(2,313)(24.4)%Other2,8972,0382,33185942.1%56624.3%Total Deposits$126,959$128,460$138,263$(1,501)(1.2)%$(11,304)(8.2)%Consistent with the company's expectations, total ending deposits declined approximately 1 percent, while total average deposit balances decreased approximately 3 percent in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2023.

Total net charge-offs for the quarter were $81 million, or 33 basis points of average loans, and provision expense totaled $118 million.The increase to the allowance for credit losses compared to the first quarter was attributable primarily to continued credit normalization, economic outlook changes, and loan growth.The allowance for credit loss ratio increased 2 basis points to 1.65 percent of total loans, and the allowance as a percentage of nonperforming loans increased to 332 percent.Capital and liquidityAs of and for Quarter Ended6/30/20233/31/20236/30/2022Common Equity Tier 1 ratio(2)10.1%9.9%9.2%Tier 1 capital ratio(2)11.4%11.2%10.6%Tangible common stockholders’ equity to tangible assets (non-GAAP)(1)6.09%6.31%5.76%Tangible common book value per share (non-GAAP)(1)*$9.72$10.01$9.55Loans, net of unearned income, to total deposits78.1%76.3%67.6%* Tangible common book value per share includes the impact of quarterly earnings and changes to market value adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive income, as well as continued capital returns.Regions maintains a solid capital position with estimated capital ratios remaining well above current regulatory requirements. The Common Equity Tier 1(2) and Tier 1(2) ratios were estimated at 10.1 percent and 11.4 percent, respectively, at quarter-end.As a Category IV bank, Regions did not participate in this year's supervisory capital stress test; however, the company did receive its preliminary Stress Capital Buffer reflecting planned capital changes including plans to increase its common stock dividend. From the fourth quarter of 2023 through the third quarter of 2024, the company's preliminary Stress Capital Buffer will remain at 2.5 percent.During the second quarter, the company declared $187 million in dividends to common shareholders and did not repurchase any shares of Regions' common stock. Earlier this week, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.24 per share, a 20 percent increase over the second quarter. This increase is in addition to the 18 percent increase last year, representing two consecutive years of robust dividend growth well supported by underlying financial performance.The company's liquidity position also remains robust as of June 30, 2023, with total available liquidity of approximately $53 billion, which includes cash held at the Federal Reserve, FHLB borrowing capacity, unencumbered securities, borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve's discount window, and the Federal Reserve's Bank Term Lending Plan facility. The loan-to-deposit ratio totaled 78 percent at the end of the quarter.(1)Non-GAAP; refer to pages 12, 16, 17, 18 and 20 of the financial supplement to this earnings release for reconciliations.(2)Current quarter Common Equity Tier 1, and Tier 1 capital ratios are estimated.Conference CallIn addition to the live audio webcast at 10 a.m. ET on July 21, 2023, an archived recording of the webcast will be available at the Investor Relations page of https://ir.regions.com/ following the live event.About Regions Financial CorporationRegions Financial Corporation (NYSE:RF), with $156 billion in assets, is a member of the S&amp;P 500 Index and is one of the nation’s largest full-service providers of consumer and commercial banking, wealth management, and mortgage products and services.

Therefore, we caution you against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, but are not limited to, those described below:Current and future economic and market conditions in the United States generally or in the communities we serve (in particular the Southeastern United States), including the effects of possible declines in property values, increases in interest rates and unemployment rates, inflation, financial market disruptions and potential reductions of economic growth, which may adversely affect our lending and other businesses and our financial results and conditions.Possible changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies of, and other activities undertaken by, governments, agencies, central banks and similar organizations, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses and our financial results and conditions.Changes in market interest rates or capital markets could adversely affect our revenue and expense, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital and liquidity.Volatility and uncertainty related to inflation and the effects of inflation, which may lead to increased costs for businesses and consumers and potentially contribute to poor business and economic conditions generally.The impact of pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, on our businesses, operations, and financial results and conditions. The duration and severity of any pandemic could disrupt the global economy, adversely affect our capital and liquidity position, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans and increase our allowance for credit losses, impair collateral values, and result in lost revenue or additional expenses.Any impairment of our goodwill or other intangibles, any repricing of assets, or any adjustment of valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets due to changes in tax law, adverse changes in the economic environment, declining operations of the reporting unit or other factors.The effect of new tax legislation and/or interpretation of existing tax law, which may impact our earnings, capital ratios, and our ability to return capital to shareholders.Possible changes in the creditworthiness of customers and the possible impairment of the collectability of loans and leases, including operating leases.Changes in the speed of loan prepayments, loan origination and sale volumes, charge-offs, credit loss provisions or actual credit losses where our allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover our eventual losses.Possible acceleration of prepayments on mortgage-backed securities due to declining interest rates, and the related acceleration of premium amortization on those securities.Loss of customer checking and savings account deposits as customers pursue other, higher-yield investments, which could increase our funding costs.Possible changes in consumer and business spending and saving habits and the related effect on our ability to increase assets and to attract deposits, which could adversely affect our net income.Rising interest rates could negatively impact the value of our portfolio of investment securities.The loss of value of our investment portfolio could negatively impact market perceptions of us.The effects of social media on market perceptions of us and banks generally.Volatility in the financial services industry (including failures or rumors of failures of other depository institutions), along with actions taken by governmental agencies to address such turmoil, could affect the ability of depository institutions, including us, to attract and retain depositors and to borrow or raise capital.Our ability to effectively compete with other traditional and non-traditional financial services companies, including fintechs, some of whom possess greater financial resources than we do or are subject to different regulatory standards than we are.Our inability to develop and gain acceptance from current and prospective customers for new products and services and the enhancement of existing products and services to meet customers’ needs and respond to emerging technological trends in a timely manner could have a negative impact on our revenue.Our inability to keep pace with technological changes, including those related to the offering of digital banking and financial services, could result in losing business to competitors.Changes in laws and regulations affecting our businesses, including legislation and regulations relating to bank products and services, such as special FDIC assessments, any new long-term debt requirements, as well as changes in the enforcement and interpretation of such laws and regulations by applicable governmental and self-regulatory agencies, including as a result of the changes in U.S. presidential administration, control of the U.S. Congress, and changes in personnel at the bank regulatory agencies, which could require us to change certain business practices, increase compliance risk, reduce our revenue, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise negatively affect our businesses.Our capital actions, including dividend payments, common stock repurchases, or redemptions of preferred stock, must not cause us to fall below minimum capital ratio requirements, with applicable buffers taken into account, and must comply with other requirements and restrictions under law or imposed by our regulators, which may impact our ability to return capital to shareholders.Our ability to comply with stress testing and capital planning requirements (as part of the CCAR process or otherwise) may continue to require a significant investment of our managerial resources due to the importance of such tests and requirements.Our ability to comply with applicable capital and liquidity requirements (including, among other things, the Basel III capital standards), including our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable terms, and if we fail to meet requirements, our financial condition and market perceptions of us could be negatively impacted.The effects of any developments, changes or actions relating to any litigation or regulatory proceedings brought against us or any of our subsidiaries.The costs, including possibly incurring fines, penalties, or other negative effects (including reputational harm) of any adverse judicial, administrative, or arbitral rulings or proceedings, regulatory enforcement actions, or other legal actions to which we or any of our subsidiaries are a party, and which may

businesses.Our ability to execute on our strategic and operational plans, including our ability to fully realize the financial and nonfinancial benefits relating to our strategic initiatives.The risks and uncertainties related to our acquisition or divestiture of businesses and risks related to such acquisitions, including that the expected synergies, cost savings and other financial or other benefits may not be realized within expected timeframes, or might be less than projected; and difficulties in integrating acquired businesses.The success of our marketing efforts in attracting and retaining customers.Our ability to recruit and retain talented and experienced personnel to assist in the development, management and operation of our products and services may be affected by changes in laws and regulations in effect from time to time.Fraud or misconduct by our customers, employees or business partners.Any inaccurate or incomplete information provided to us by our customers or counterparties.Inability of our framework to manage risks associated with our businesses, such as credit risk and operational risk, including third-party vendors and other service providers, which could, among other things, result in a breach of operating or security systems as a result of a cyber attack or similar act or failure to deliver our services effectively.Our ability to identify and address operational risks associated with the introduction of or changes to products, services, or delivery platforms.Dependence on key suppliers or vendors to obtain equipment and other supplies for our businesses on acceptable terms.The inability of our internal controls and procedures to prevent, detect or mitigate any material errors or fraudulent acts.The effects of geopolitical instability, including wars, conflicts, civil unrest, and terrorist attacks and the potential impact, directly or indirectly, on our businesses.The effects of man-made and natural disasters, including fires, floods, droughts, tornadoes, hurricanes, and environmental damage (specifically in the Southeastern United States), which may negatively affect our operations and/or our loan portfolios and increase our cost of conducting business. The severity and frequency of future earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, floods and other weather-related events are difficult to predict and may be exacerbated by global climate change.Changes in commodity market prices and conditions could adversely affect the cash flows of our borrowers operating in industries that are impacted by changes in commodity prices (including businesses indirectly impacted by commodities prices such as businesses that transport commodities or manufacture equipment used in the production of commodities), which could impair their ability to service any loans outstanding to them and/or reduce demand for loans in those industries.Our ability to identify and address cyber-security risks such as data security breaches, malware, ransomware, ""denial of service"" attacks, ""hacking"" and identity theft, including account take-overs, a failure of which could disrupt our businesses and result in the disclosure of and/or misuse or misappropriation of confidential or proprietary information, disruption or damage to our systems, increased costs, losses, or adverse effects to our reputation.Our ability to achieve our expense management initiatives.Market replacement of LIBOR and the related effect on our LIBOR-based financial products and contracts, including, but not limited to, derivative products, debt obligations, deposits, investments, and loans.Possible downgrades in our credit ratings or outlook could, among other negative impacts, increase the costs of funding from capital markets.The effects of problems encountered by other financial institutions that adversely affect us or the banking industry generally could require us to change certain business practices, reduce our revenue, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise negatively affect our businesses.The effects of the failure of any component of our business infrastructure provided by a third party could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure of and/or misuse of confidential information or proprietary information, increase our costs, negatively affect our reputation, and cause losses.Our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries, in particular Regions Bank, could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends to shareholders.Changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the FASB or other regulatory agencies could materially affect our financial statements and how we report those results, and expectations and preliminary analyses relating to how such changes will affect our financial results could prove incorrect.Fluctuations in the price of our common stock and inability to complete stock repurchases in the time frame and/or on the terms anticipated.The effects of anti-takeover laws and exclusive forum provision in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws.The effects of any damage to our reputation resulting from developments related to any of the items identified above.Other risks identified from time to time in reports that we file with the SEC.The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. For discussion of these and other factors that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, look under the captions ""Forward-Looking Statements"" and ""Risk Factors"" in Regions’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 and in Regions’ subsequent filings with the SEC.You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible to predict all of them. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update or revise any forward-looking statements that are made from time to time, either as a result of future developments, new information or otherwise, except as may be required by law.Use of non-GAAP financial measuresManagement uses pre-tax pre-provision income (non-GAAP) and adjusted pre-tax pre-provision income (non-GAAP), as well as the adjusted efficiency ratio (non-GAAP) and the adjusted fee income ratio (non-GAAP) to monitor performance and believes these measures provide meaningful information to investors. Non-interest expense (GAAP) is presented excluding certain adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the adjusted efficiency ratio. Non-interest income (GAAP) is presented excluding certain adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the adjusted fee income ratio. Adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP) and adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP) are used to determine adjusted pre-tax pre-provision income (non-GAAP). Net interest income (GAAP) on a taxable-equivalent basis and non-interest income are added together to arrive at total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. Adjustments are made to arrive at adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis (non-GAAP), which is the denominator for the adjusted fee income and adjusted efficiency ratios. Net loan charge-offs (GAAP) are presented excluding adjustments to arrive at adjusted net loan-charge offs (non-GAAP). Adjusted net loan charge-offs as a percentage of average loans (non-GAAP) are calculated as adjusted net loan charge-offs (non-GAAP) divided by average loans (GAAP) and annualized. Regions believes that the exclusion of these adjustments provides a meaningful basis for period-to-period comparisons, which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the Company and predicting future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of Regions’ business. It is possible that the activities related to the adjustments may recur; however, management does not consider the activities related to the adjustments to be indications of ongoing operations. Regions believes that presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the Company on the same basis as that applied by management.Tangible common stockholders’ equity ratios have become a focus of some investors and management believes they may assist investors in analyzing the capital position of the Company absent the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. Analysts and banking regulators have assessed Regions’ capital adequacy using the tangible common stockholders’ equity measure. Because tangible common stockholders’ equity is not formally defined by GAAP or prescribed in any amount by federal banking regulations it is currently considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure and other entities may calculate it differently than Regions’ disclosed calculations. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess Regions’ capital adequacy using tangible common stockholders’ equity, management believes that it is useful to provide investors the ability to assess Regions’ capital adequacy on this same basis.Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP. In particular, a measure of earnings that excludes selected items does not represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to stockholders.Management and the Board of Directors utilize non-GAAP measures as follows:Preparation of Regions' operating budgetsMonthly financial performance reportingMonthly close-out reporting of consolidated results (management only)Presentation to investors of company performanceMetrics for incentive compensationRegions’ Investor Relations contact is Dana Nolan at (205) 264-7040; Regions’ Media contact is Jeremy King at (205) 264-4551.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230721405397/en/ContactsMedia Contact: Jeremy King(205) 264-4551Investor Relations Contact: Dana Nolan(205) 264-7040]"

These companies are also better equipped to weather an economic downturn, providing another beneficial advantage for investors from a long-term standpoint.And for those interested in investing in strong cash flows, three companies – Apple, Visa and Broadcom – are all cash-generating machines. Let’s take a closer look at each.BroadcomBroadcom is a premier designer, developer, and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor devices. The company’s earnings outlook has modestly improved over the last several months.For those with an appetite for income, Broadcom has that covered; AVGO shares currently yield a solid 2% annually, more than double the Zacks Electronics – Semiconductor industry average. Dividend growth is also there, with the payout growing by nearly 20% over the last five years.And the company has the cash flow to back up the dividend payments, with Broadcom generating $4.4 billion in free cash flow throughout its latest quarter. The company’s free cash flow has remained on a solid trajectory.VisaVisa, a multinational financial services company, facilitates electronic funds transfers through Visa-branded debit, credit, and prepaid cards. The financial titan reported free cash flow of $3.6 billion in its latest quarter, 13% higher than the year-ago period.The company has been a consistent earnings performer, exceeding top and bottom line expectations in 13 consecutive quarters. Keep an eye out for the company’s upcoming quarterly release on July 25th; estimates suggest 6% earnings growth on 11% higher revenues.Visa shares could also entice growth-focused investors, with estimates alluding to 14% earnings growth in its current fiscal year (FY23) and an additional 13% in FY24. Sales growth is also expected to be solid, forecasted to improve by 11% and 10% in FY23 and FY24, respectively.Story continuesAppleApple is one of the biggest cash-generating machines in the S&amp;P 500. The technology titan created $25.6 billion in free cash flow throughout its 2023 Q2, owing to its successful operations.Apple shares have become a bit rich regarding valuation, perhaps steering away those implementing a value-conscious approach. Shares currently trade at a 32.5X forward earnings multiple (F1), well higher than the 24.9X five-year median and approaching highs of 35.6X in 2021.The company is scheduled to unveil its Q3 release on August 3rd. Analysts have been modestly bullish for the quarter to be reported, with the $1.20 per share estimate up nearly 2% over the last 60 days. iPhone revenue will also be closely watched; the Zacks Consensus estimate for iPhone sales stands at $40.1 billion, modestly lower than the year-ago period.Bottom LineCompanies boasting strong cash-generating abilities can be great investments, as they have plenty of cash to fuel growth, pay out dividends, and easily wipe out debt.And as mentioned above, these companies are better equipped to handle an economic downturn, undeniably a positive.For those seeking cash-generators, all three above fit the criteria.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

V is set to continue its earnings beat streak in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the results of which are expected to be released on Jul 25, after the closing bell.What Do the Estimates Say?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal third-quarter 2023 earnings per share of $2.10 has remained stable over the past week. The estimate is indicative of a 6.1% increase from the year-ago reported figure. Visa beat earnings estimates in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an average of 8%. This is depicted in the graph below.Visa Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Visa Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseVisa Inc. price-eps-surprise | Visa Inc. QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $8.1 billion, suggesting a 10.7% jump from the year-ago reported figure.What the Quantitative Model SuggestsOur proven model predicts a likely earnings beat for Visa this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is precisely the case here.Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is +0.53%. The Most Accurate Estimate is pegged at $2.12 per share, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.10. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: Visa currently has a Zacks Rank #3.Before we get into what to expect in the to-be-reported quarter in detail, let’s see how the company performed in the last quarter.Q2 Earnings RewindIn the last reported quarter, the payments technology company’s adjusted earnings per share of $2.09 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.1%, primarily on the back of higher payments, cross-border volumes and processed transactions. Steady cross-border travel growth and lower-than-expected client incentives aided the results, partially offset by higher costs.Now, let’s see how things have shaped up prior to the fiscal third-quarter 2023 earnings announcement.Story continuesFactors Driving Better-Than-Expected Q3 EarningsContinued growth in travel and entertainment-related spending is expected to have driven Visa’s results in the fiscal third quarter. The growth in the adaption of digital payments is expected to have continued in the quarter under review. Our estimate for total volume, which consists of cash volume and payments volume (the primary lever of service revenues), indicates an increase of almost 4% from the year-ago level of $3,553 billion.As the company draws revenues as a set percentage of total transaction value every time a customer makes payments with a debit/credit card, higher spending means more revenues in the form of transaction processing fees. We expect total processed transactions for the fiscal third quarter to increase more than 4% year over year.Our estimate for total payments transactions indicates a 5.6% year-over-year increase. We expect the metric for U.S. operations alone to jump 8.6% year over year. With the growth in payments volume and processed transactions, Visa’s operating efficiency is expected to have improved in the fiscal third quarter.Our estimate for data processing revenues indicates 10% year-over-year growth in the fiscal third quarter. Also, we expect service revenues to have witnessed an almost 16% year-over-year increase. Furthermore, our estimate for international transaction revenues predicts 14% increase from the year-ago period.The factors stated above are expected to have positioned the company for year-over-year growth in the fiscal third quarter and an earnings beat. However, rising expenses and client incentives (a contra-revenue item) are likely to have partially offset the positive impact of higher volumes.We expect adjusted total operating expenses for the quarter under review to increase almost 11% year over year due to increased Personnel, Marketing and Professional Fees expenses. Our estimate for client incentives suggests that the metric will cross $3 billion mark in the fiscal third quarter.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other companies from the broader Business Services space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:Avis Budget Group, Inc. CAR has an Earnings ESP of +1.46% and is a Zacks #2 Ranked player. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Avis Budget’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $9.78 per share, which witnessed one upward estimate revision over the past month against no movement in the opposite direction. Furthermore, the consensus mark for CAR’s revenues is pegged at $3.2 billion.Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation BAH has an Earnings ESP of +3.20% and a Zacks Rank of 2.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Booz Allen’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $1.25 per share, which suggests a 10.6% year-over-year jump.

SPGI has an Earnings ESP of +2.05% and a Zacks Rank of 2.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for S&amp;P Global’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $3.09 per share, indicating 10% year-over-year growth.

(MAR) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marriott-international-inc-mar-trending-130013428.html,1689858013,STORY,['MAR'],"[Marriott International (MAR) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this hotel company have returned +8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.6% change. The Zacks Hotels and Motels industry, to which Marriott belongs, has gained 5.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Marriott is expected to post earnings of $2.18 per share, indicating a change of +21.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.9% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $8.42 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +25.9%. This estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.14 indicates a change of +8.6% from what Marriott is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Marriott.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Marriott, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $6.05 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $23.49 billion and $24.43 billion estimates indicate +13.1% and +4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMarriott reported revenues of $5.62 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +33.7%. EPS of $2.09 for the same period compares with $1.25 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.28 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.42%. The EPS surprise was +12.37%.Over the last four quarters, Marriott surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Marriott is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Marriott. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?Story continuesNicholas T. PinchukThanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. Today, I'll start the call by as usual, by covering the highlights of the second quarter, and I'll give you my perspective on the environment and the trends we're seeing. Along way we'll cover the markets. They're encouraging actually. And I'll take you through the segments and the advancements we've made. Then Aldo will provide a detailed review of the financials. We see the second quarter as a period of significance. Sometimes you see a performance where our breakthrough into new heights. And this is one of those times. I'm going to tell you why we believe that to be true. In some ways, though, it was similar. This period was similar to many periods we've seen over time as we continue to have significant headwinds. And there's always turbulence variation from market to market. But we believe it's our job to confront and overcome these obstacles, and we did just that in the second quarter by wielding the strength of our advantages, executing on our strategic runways for growth, making the most of our runways for improvement and by relying on the skills and dedication of our people. And once again, it paid off the numbers screen it's sold but here they are. As reported, second quarter sales of $1,191.3 billion were up 4.8% from 2022, including the impact of $8.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Organic activity was up 5.6%. The 12 straight quarter of year-over-year expansion beyond pre-pandemic levels. That's a trend that demonstrates that we believe it is a solid consistency during pretty uncertain times. Now let's talk about the earnings. Earnings.Opco operating income for the quarter, including the effects of unfavorable foreign currency was $277 million, up 12.3% and our opco operating margin, the operating margin, it was 23.3%, up 160 basis points from last year, (inaudible). When I said new levels, I mean it. For Financial Services, the OI of $66.9 million represented an increase of $1.6 million, and it all combined to author an overall consolidated operating margin of 26.8% up 130 basis points from last year.And the second quarter EPS, it was $4.89, up $0.62 or 14.5% from last year's $4.27. I think I'll say it again, $4.89, up 14.5%. The productivity and profitability of Snap-on operations shining through as the supply chain viscosity diminished. We believe Snap-on is stronger now than ever before, and the quarter's profitability makes that crystal clear. Well, those are the overall numbers. Now let's speak to the market, auto repair. Again, this quarter, it's favorable. Miles driven are up. Spending on vehicle maintenance, up. Technician count, up. Technician wages, up. Consistently positive year-over-year, consistently positive year-over-year trajectory across all essential categories. Drivers and vehicle repair are fairly understood. Car parks growing, getting older every year, and every year, the tests involved in maintaining and repair the vehicle park get increasingly complex, requiring more hours, great scale, increased wages and more sophisticated tools, hands or power or data-driven tools. There's a significant need for more technicians and greater capabilities. The competition for that talent is growing, and it's being reflected in the rising wages at an everyday level.I think you can see this demand when you're trying to schedule a maintenance appointment or just by visually seeing one of the cars and trucks in the repair base are parked outside, crowded around the shops waiting for their turn to get in. And in fact, just this month, I was with a group of franchisees and customers in Bristol, Tennessee, the NHRA Thunder nationals, the drag races, and they energetically expressed their enthusiasm during our conversations. You can feel their optimism of resonating with an appreciation for our products, our solutions and how we make work easier. So we expect that the trajectory of vehicle repair is solid. And we'll continue through the quarters and on into the years ahead, we expect that vehicle repair is the -- we believe that vehicle repair is a great place to operate and the repair information -- our repair information group and our tools group are well positioned to take advantage of that.Now on to the critical industries or our commercial industrial over, C&amp;I takes our business out of the garage and solves to have a consequence where the penalty for failure is high in a wide range of sectors, where custom tools are often required to get the job done. This is also the segment where we have a most significant international presence and the attended variations from country to country with many versions of economic and social headwinds. In the U.S., the landscape actually is pretty positive. We see progress across a number of sectors. Aerospace is strong. Increased demand in commercial aviation and momentum within space exploration. The military business was another strong quarter of growth now better matching actual needs. Natural resources continue to advance in oil and gas and wind after the uncertainty of the last fall, energy repair is a positive place to be.Also begin the period with Industrial Transportation. Supply chain turbulence, I think, has raised the attention on rail and heavy-duty fleets, society now more than ever see the essential need to keep commercial supply moving and it's accruing positively for us.Now there are tepid spots across the globe. Place is traumatized by the Ukraine or we see that weakness in some of the agent Pacific operations. But one of the clear and large positives in the period is the general rise of critical industries. And our Industrial division is well positioned and it's taking advantage with this capability to customize products to a large number of applications, and it's working. Our critical industry teams are on an upward trajectory utilizing their capability and the enhanced capacity to capture -- the enhanced capacity to capture significant gains.Overall, the story of Snap-on outside the garage looks quite promising. And as we move forward, we'll continue to capitalize on an abundant potential. And as part of that, we'll keep engaging Snap-on value creation, customer connection and innovating, developing profitable, new profitable, new products and solutions delivered by the insights and knowledge gains standing next to the customers right in the work place and will drive RCI all over the enterprise, including in the Tools Group. We will keep working to increase our franchisee selling capacity with efficient processes with advanced training programs with social media and digital content and expanded manufacturing capacity to meet the rising demand, all combining to take full advantage of the opportunities and continue the positive trends we've seen into the future. Well, that's a market overview.Now let's move to the segments. For the C&amp;I group, as reported sales rose 1.4%, including $5.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency. Organic volume was up by 3%. A quite strong performance in the Industrial division was attenuated by shortfalls in some of our more challenged areas. Power tools had smaller volumes as customers anticipated the arrival of new products in the third quarter, our European-based hand tool business, SNA Europe, but our Asia Pacific operations demonstrated growth in several markets, but softness in Eastern Europe and currency pressure in Japan, the yen was weak was some offset.But our industrial vision isn't just growing in volume. The margins are strong and rising. Customized product is a wonderful thing. So C&amp;I OI was $68.1 million, a 12.4% increase over last year. And the operating margin was 16%, one of the highest ever for the group, representing a gain of 160 basis points over the second quarter last year. The Industrial division wielding the capacity provided by our new building and Kenosha registered significant sales progress. In April, we discussed the recovery of the military business in the military segment. In this quarter, we continued that momentum, capturing significant long-term contracts, our product line, wide and effective. produced in the U.S. made the difference. So we believe things look promising for the military business and for all our industrial segments.Beyond the Industrial division in C&amp;I, our specialty tools operation continue to advance, meeting the need for precision with new torque products, covering a vast spectrum of clamping forces for challenging applications. Torque accuracy is rising in importance and Snap-on is ready to capitalize. We are confident and committed to extending in critical industries, and that conviction is anchored by the ongoing expansion of our lineup of innovative products, explicitly designed for particular tasks, offerings like our automated tool control or ETC enabled by proprietary digital imaging technology that scans toolbox, drawers, recording in real time, which tools are required are removed to replace. It's an increasingly crucial feature for aerospace for industrial manufacturing and for commercial transportation operations.Imagine working out plan or a locomotive engine and unknowingly leaving a tool behind in the workplace. Not good, not good. This is a mistake that could result in a failure in any tight tolerance mechanism, one small item can be a huge problem. Well, ATC has an answer, keeping track of the tools. identifying missing items, tracing, who signed them out and where are they to be used and giving the all clear when everything is returned. So the plans can take off. Snap-on critical industries are on the rise and ATC is part of the reason. And in the quarter, we released our next generation of ATC, a larger touchscreen to improve the shop productivity and upgraded processes with the latest technology for seamless integration with any central IT system. And as you might expect, our customers were enthusiastic, sophisticated products for complex products. It's a winning combination for C&amp;I, and you can see it in the quarter's results.Now on to the Tools Group. Organic sales grew 1.1%, which includes 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency. Growth in the international markets and a slight improvement in the U.S. network. Based on our franchisees and customer feedback, like I said already, vehicle repair is robust. But in the period, our record demand met capacity constraints before our plant expansion, so we're fully operational, limiting some of the potential possibilities and somewhat attenuating the volumes. But for operating earnings, payrolls in the quarter by $13.3 million or 10.7%, reaching $137.7 million. That's almost double the prepandemic level. The operating margin was 26.3%, a rise of 240 basis points against 50 basis points of negative currency. Let me say that again, Tools Group OI margin was 26.3%. [Boomshakalaka!] This is an eye-popping number.So the Tools Group had another positive quarter with substantial profitability. We are confident in the strength of our van network and I believe is borne out of quantitative evidence, franchisee health metrics. We monitor them regularly every quarter. And again, this quarter, they remained strong. So what are you talking about talking to the franchisees at Thunder Valley or looking at the numbers, vehicle repair does appear robust and continues to be so.Now when you think of the Tools Group profitability, which is a pretty important subject this time, you think about hand tools, that high-margin lineup was -- they were -- that was up in the period. And new products led the way. One example of successful innovation that came from another customer -- customer connection was a number of franchisees observed that diesel technicians struggling to access sensors on Class 8 semi trucks that were struggling to do that. So to change the part without risking damage. The path had to be cleared by removing several other blocking components. Believe me, that's a time-consuming process. And so armed with customer connection insights, those customer connection insights. Our engineers developed an innovative design quickly produced a 3D prototype and confirmed that it solved the problem. And that tool, the SWR 5 90-degree special crowfoot wrench is being made right now at our Elizabeth and Tennessee plant, and it's getting a lot of attention. It really does make truck repair easier. The techs love it and we kind of like the margins.Profitable customer connection is one of the drivers behind the Tools Group success. And another example of this quarter is our 2-piece horizontal pushing adapter set. The (inaudible), these names are something, teched at a Subaru dealership where they were taking a lot of time to remove and install control arm bushings from suspension setups on the newer models. Our team assessed the procedure and designed 2 new adapters to integrate with our existing ball joint press, and that enabled the fit for the new -- a good fit for the new Subaru with suspension and say 2 hours in repair time per procedure, that's a big savings in the garage generated by customer connection and innovation. SNL a while ago, SNL's Roseanne Roseannadanna said, it's always something. And it's true. There are always new repair challenges, whether the powertrain is internal combustion, plug-in hybrids or EV platforms. Vehicle architecture is getting tighter, packed with more devices, creating additional accessibility constraints, it's all music to our ears.Our franchisees and engineers observe the work, identify complications and simplify the complex and multifaceted tasks to raise efficiency and keep the world moving, and the attendant value is considerable. You can see that in the Tools Group profits. Now one of the highlights of the quarter was the continuing growth of our big ticket sales. A sign of technician confidence in the vehicle repair shop driving some of that trend with the latest tool storage unit, the KMP-1023ZLT7, a 72-inch master series roll cab painted with a unique apparent scheme we call green envy, a break green body paired with black trim. It stands out and makes a statement in any repair shop beyond the eye-popping optics. The box is also a productivity enhancing powerhouse equipment 14 drawers, including 3 spanning the full width of the unit putting the most important tools of any size right in hand. It also offers our popular power drawer and dedicated space, equipment. You have 5 power outlets and 2 USB ports for charging a full array of core accessories. And for the hard to manage small parts, our 2-inch speed door, it makes for easy organization with green envy color-coordinated dividers, custom slots for components of various sizes. The box is already one of our hit products. It really energized franchisees and was well received by our customers. And as I said, it helped keep the big ticket train moving. Well, that's the Tools Group, strong profitability, built on solid foundations of innovative products and franchisee success mixed with a considerable portion of RCI gain.Now visible as supply that RCI gain is now clearly visible as a supply chain turbulence receives. And then now, let's go on to RS&amp;I. Sales as reported reached $452 million that represented a $35.2 million or 8.4% increase. Gains in the equipment and OEM essential programs paired with -- gains in equipment and OEM paired with our successful rollout of our new handheld diagnostic platform. The OI in the period was $110.4 million, up 14.7% or 15.4% -- up $14.7 million or 15.4%, and the operating margin was 24.4%, a rise of 140 basis points. Nice. Nice.As we said, the vehicle repair environment is strong, offering significant opportunity and the second quarter results for C&amp;I says it's so. And the recent launch of our new SOLUS Plus diagnostic platform was a big key to that success. Great new features including a 2-second boot up, the fastest in the industry and an 8-inch colored touch free with 60% higher resolution, making it much easier for technicians to view in brighter lighting. It supports the latest communication protocols and it offers access to SureTrack. That's our library of vehicle-specific real fixes, repair tips and commonly replace parts that wheels our proprietary database of 2.5 billion repair records and 325 billion vehicle events. SOLUS Plus, the franchisees have been positive, the customers have been excited and the sales have been robust.New powertrains are driving the need for extending product lines, including vehicle lifts, enabling independent shops and dealerships to accommodate the new models. So -- and in meeting this opportunity with advantage, part of RS&amp;I success has been our undercar equipment division. It's one of the drivers between our -- behind RS&amp;I's strong growth. Take our challenger lift operation in Louisville. The plant offers thousands of SKUs matched a separate lifting test and the numbers have been growing to meet the specific challenges of EV lifting. And in the quarter, that facility hosted Chief Executive Magazine's Smart Manufacturing Summit, and the event underlines the power of product customization and driving expansion and the extraordinary ability of RCI to render that low-volume production quite profitable. It's that approach that drove RCI's gains. OI up 140 basis points in the quarter and we expect that it will keep doing just that as we go forward throughout the group and all across Snap-on.RS&amp;I, improving position with repair shop owners and managers, growing OEM relationships, expanding the product offerings, welding RCI everywhere, and it all combined to deliver substantial growth and strong profitability. The Snap-on second quarter, continued opportunities in vehicle repair and critical industries, progress along our runways for coherent growth and advancements down our runways for improvement, overall sales increasing organically 5.6%, margin strong in every segment. Opco OI margin, 23.3%, up 160 basis points overcoming unfavorable currency and EPS $4.89, up versus all comparisons. It was another encouraging quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?Aldo J. PagliariThanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $1,191.3 billion in the quarter represented an increase of 4.8% from 2022 levels, reflecting a 5.6% organic sales gain, partially offset by $8.3 million or 80 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency translation. From a geographic perspective, we experienced year-over-year organic sales growth in North and South America as well as Europe, while sales in Asia Pacific were down low single digits, mostly due to weakness in the yen contributing to less activity in Japan. Consolidated gross margin improved 200 basis points at 50.7% from 48.7% last year as gross margins expanded across all of our operating segments. Contributions from increased sales volumes and pricing actions lower material and other costs and benefits from the company's RCI initiatives were partially offset by 30 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 27.4% compared to 27% last year. The increase of 40 basis points is primarily due to increased investment in personnel and other costs. Operating earnings before financial services of $277 million in the quarter compared to $246.6 million in 2022 as a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 23.3%, including 30 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, reflects an expansion of 160 basis points over last year.Financial services revenue of $93.4 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared to $86.4 million last year, while operating earnings of $66.9 million compared to $65.3 million in 2022. Consolidated operating earnings of $343.9 million in the quarter compared to $311.9 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 26.8% reflects an improvement of 130 basis points from 2022. Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 22.9% compared to 23.8% last year. Net earnings of $264 million or $4.89 per diluted share, including $0.09 share impact from unfavorable foreign currency reflected an increase of $32.5 million or $0.62 per share from 2022 levels and represented a 14.5% year-over-year increase in diluted earnings per share. Now let's turn to our segment results for the quarter.Starting with the C&amp;I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $364.2 million increased from $359.1 million last year, reflecting a $10.7 million or 3% organic sales gain which was partially offset by $5.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic growth primarily reflects a double-digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries, partially offset by declines in power tool volumes. With respect to critical industries, sales to the military were robust as was activity in the aviation and heavy-duty sectors. Gross margin improved 220 basis points to 39.5% in the second quarter from 37.3% in 2022.This is largely due to increased volumes and the higher gross margin critical industry sector, pricing actions, lower material and other costs and benefits from RCI initiatives. These improvements were partially offset by 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased 60 basis points to 23.5% in the quarter, from 22.9% in 2022, mostly due to increased sales and higher expense businesses.Operating earnings for the C&amp;I segment of $58.1 million compared to $51.7 million last year. The operating margin improved 160 basis points to 16% from 14.4% last year. Turning now to Slide 8.Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $523.1 million compared to $520.6 million a year ago, reflecting a 1.1% organic sales gain partially offset by $3.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales growth reflects a mid-single-digit gain in our international operations and slightly higher sales in our U.S. business. Higher sales of hand tools and big ticket items in the quarter were partially offset by lower sales of power tools. Gross margin improved 300 basis points to 49% in the quarter from 46% last year. This increase is primarily due to higher sales volumes and pricing actions, lower material and other costs and benefits from RCI initiatives, partially offset by 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Material costs benefited from reduced expenses for various steel types used in our product offering. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales went up by 60 basis points to 22.7% from 22.1% last year primarily due to increased investment in personnel and other costs.Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $137.7 million, including $3.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $124.4 million last year. The operating margin of 26.3%, including 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to 23.9% in 2022, reflecting an improvement of 240 basis points.Turning to the RS&amp;I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $452 million compared to $416.8 million in 2022 reflecting an 8.5% organic sales gain, partially offset by $300,000 of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase is comprised of a double-digit gain in sales of undercar and collision repair equipment, a high single-digit increase in activity with OEM dealerships and a mid-single-digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers. Gross margin improved to 180 basis points to 45% from 43.2% last year, primarily due to increased sales volumes and pricing actions, lower material and other costs and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales went up by 40 basis points to 20.6% from 20.2% last year, primarily due to increased personnel and other costs.Operating earnings for the RS&amp;I group of $110.4 million compared to $95.7 million last year. The operating margin improved 140 basis points to 24.4% from 23% reported last year.Now turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services increased $7 million to $93.4 million from $86.4 million last year, reflecting the growth of the loan portfolio. Financial services operating earnings of $66.9 million, including $200,000 of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $65.3 million in 2022. Financial services expenses were up $5.4 million from 2022 levels, including $4.9 million of higher provisions for credit losses. The year-over-year increase in provision reflects both the growth of the portfolio as well as a return to what we believe to be a more normal pre-pandemic rate of provision. Sequentially, the provision for credit losses decreased by about $500,000. For reference, Provisions for finance receivable losses in the current quarter were $13.7 million as compared to $9.1 million in the second quarter last year.In the second quarters of 2019 and 2018, Provisions for losses were $11.9 million and $13.6 million, respectively. In addition, our gross worldwide extended credit of finance receivable portfolio has increased 9.1% year-over-year and we believe the delinquency and portfolio performance trends currently remain stable. In the second quarter of 2023 and 2022, the respective average yield on finance receivables were 17.6% and 17.5%. In the second quarter of 2023 and 2022, the average yield on contract receivables were 8.6% and 8.5%, respectively.Total loan originations of $326.3 million in the second quarter represented an increase of $18.7 million or 6.1% from 2022 levels reflecting a 5.7% increase in originations of finance receivables and an 8.3% increase in originations of contract receivables. Gains in extended credit originations in the U.S. were led by franchisee sales of diagnostic products, including our recently launched SOLUS and ZEUS platforms.Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.4 billion of gross financing receivables with $2.1 billion from our U.S. operation. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.3% for U.S. extended credit compared to 1.4% in 2022. On a sequential basis, the rate is down 20 basis points, reflecting the seasonal trend we typically experience in the second quarter. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $46.4 million represented 2.45% of outstandings at quarter end, which is down slightly from the 2.46% reported at the end of last quarter.Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $270.3 million in the quarter compared to $140.8 million last year. The improvement as compared to the second quarter of 2022 primarily reflects lower year-over-year increases in working capital investment and higher net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $94.6 million included net additions to finance receivables of $68.6 million and capital expenditures of $25.8 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $136.5 million included cash dividends of $85.9 million and the repurchase of 359,000 shares of common stock for $94.8 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $336.7 million of common stock under our existing authorizations.Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $25.1 million from 2022 year-end. Day sales outstanding of 61 days was the same as 2022 year-end. Inventories increased $13 million from 2022 year-end. And on a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.4 compared to 2.5 at year-end 2022. Our quarter end cash position of $871.3 million compared to $757.2 million at year-end 2022. Our net debt to capital ratio of 6.5% compared to 9% at year-end 2022. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million available under our credit facilities. And as of quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding.That concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2023. We anticipate that capital expenditures will approximate $100 million. In addition, we currently anticipate that our full year 2023 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?Nicholas T. PinchukThanks, Aldo. Well, that's the quarter. RCI shining through as the supply sky is clear to show the new levels of performance. Vehicle repair continuing its strength. Critical industry is accelerating. RS&amp;I growth, growth in both dealerships and independent shops, advances in helping customize shops to new vehicles, OI margin, 24.4%, up 140 basis points. Tools Group growth attenuated. But strong new products, solving specific problems, creating extraordinary value and an OI of $137.7 million, almost double pre-pandemic levels and OI margins of 26.3%, up 240 basis points, overcoming 50 basis points of unfavorable currency.C&amp;I extending in the critical industries wielding new capacity, achieving broad growth and an OI margin of 16%, 160 basis points over last year, also overcoming unfavorable currency. And Snap-on credit, profits up, originations rising indicating broad confidence in vehicle repair, and it came together for an attention getting overall performance. Snap-on organic sales rising 5.6%, an OI margin of 23.3%, up 160 basis points and an EPS of $4.89, new levels indeed. It was an encouraging quarter. And we believe that these results representing new heights, highlight the opportunities in our markets. They're essential, demonstrate the power of our approach. It creates extraordinary value solving the critical. And most of all, confirms the strength and reliability of our team, capable and battle-tested, reliability of that team to wield our Snap-on value creation processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, all to overcome challenges and drive the corporation higher.And we expect that our decisively advantages, those decisive advantages and opportunities and approach. And then people will author a continuing upward trajectory even beyond these levels throughout the remainder of this year, and on into 2024. Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I want to speak directly to our associates and franchisees, the Snap-on team.I know many of you are listening. These results do represent new heights. But more than that, there are ringing testimony to your unwavering focus on moving our enterprise forward. Your extraordinary achievements, hard one. Yes, my congratulations. For the capability you demonstrate every day, you have my admiration. And for the unshakable confidence you hold in our path forward, you have my thanks. Operator.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) At this time, we will take our first question, which will come from Scott Stember with ROTH MKM.Scott Lewis StemberNick, you talked about in tools that there was, I guess, it sounded like your ability to meet demand in certain areas was not met because of production. Can you maybe talk about that and maybe tie that into the decline that you talked about in Power Tools?Nicholas T. PinchukSure. Sure. Look, I think they're semi-related, but here's the thing. I think we started -- I probably said 12 times in this pitch. We think the market is robust. So you're not seeing the market in those numbers. The situation simply here is rooted in hand tools and tool storage primarily, where generally, the mix of products we got exceeded our capacity. We expected a certain mix. We got a different mix. And part of that was the people saying, well, power tools is going to launch in the future new products. And therefore, power tools is not so popular, and it was down in the quarter, anticipating those power tools. And so we bumped up against capacity, particularly around the more customized models, which are more difficult to build and more difficult to turn out. So that's pretty much what it was. I mean fundamentally, if you look at power tools, I mean, tools in the quarter, hand tools, biggest ever, biggest ever...And you look at tool storage, not only does the tool storage factory have to supply some. And hand tools are some of this, but tools storage, not only does the tool storage factory, you have to supply the tools group. But when you see the acceleration associated with the critical industries that they have boxes as well. And they were expanded. So put a lot of pressure on those factories. So we couldn't able -- we weren't able to follow the market. But -- we had anticipated expansion. Those expansions are starting to be ready now. So the hand tools plant in Milwaukee. We have about 2/3 of the expansion will be ready this month. And in the fourth quarter, the rest of it will be ready. The Elizabethton tool storage -- not tool storage, but the hand tool plant in Elizabethton will have its expansion in the end of the third quarter and the fourth quarter, expanding space and the expansion along our tool storage business is starting to get in place sort of the end of this month.So we're expanding the capacity just that in this quarter, the mix of the products pretty much somewhat reflective of power tools being down and, therefore, filling that in with customized products bumped up against demand.Scott Lewis StemberGot it. Okay. And as far as sell into the van sell-through, it sounds as if probably...Nicholas T. PinchukPretty good it was above our numbers like it has been for a couple of periods. We like to say that over time, that's all going to even out. But in this quarter, the sell-through was fell off the van, we say, was better.Scott Lewis StemberOkay. And you would expect that to balance out?Nicholas T. PinchukIt always balances out. A quarter doesn't mean that much in that situation. But what I'm trying to say is that we still think that demand is pretty strong. You see that when you talk to franchisees and customers themselves. And the whole idea, Scott, is big ticket items are an indication of confidence usually in this market. I mean I suppose it isn't for sure. But generally, in our history, when we've seen big ticket items sell and they did. Originations were up and tool storage had -- I think it's one of its best quarters ever, if you put industrial and hand tools together, that indicates that customers are willing to enter into those longer payback items. And we also saw a nice range of diagnostics numbers this quarter. So those big ticket items really look good, positive sell-through. And so that indicates because the technicians are willing to enter into those longer payback items. And that as they think at least, that the market is good.Scott Lewis StemberAnd just to be clear, sales off the van are stronger right now than into the channel. Got it.OperatorOur next question will come from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.Christopher D. GlynnYes. I had a question on the gross margin, which was very strong. You mentioned supply chain clearing. Is that more or less recovered now? Or does supply chain...Nicholas T. PinchukWell, every time I have a review, if somebody brings up something that says they got some spot buys still coming through. But in general, like I said, the skies have cleared. And we're going to get a little more benefit, but most of it is out now. Our big problem was, of course, everybody saw commodity prices to go up and freight price to go up. But the big problem for a company like us is we had a spot pricings in a lot of situations, which we're paying 2 or 3x sometimes what the original price was. And so that ends up going in inventory. Just think about it. If you have a trouble getting stuff, you tend to overbuy at sometimes because you want to have it in stock because you want to deliver as the first priority. And so you get yourself in that situation. And so you're seeing that clear. And so what happens in that situation, the advances in new value products and the RCI we've been doing all this time starts to shine through.Christopher D. GlynnGreat. And given the expansion at SOT over the past few years and your bandwidth capacity to sell, you've -- I think, grown your actively serviced technicians. I'm wondering, does that reopen the gate to add franchisees and were franchisee -- was U.S. franchisee count? Is that pretty stable, as I understand it to be?Nicholas T. PinchukIt's pretty stable. We're down a few franchisees this quarter, but not many. It's not a factor for government work, Chris. But -- and we're not -- we're probably not going to add people. We believe that our franchisees sell more because we tell them, you're our guys. And if we do well, so you, and so we believe that subdividing their opportunity probably isn't the best alternative. Now we think we have the world covered. We have over 3,400 franchisees around the country. So we think we have most of the places covered. I suppose there's the odd place that we might find that we'd add one or 2. But really, that's not going to be a problem for us. Our way up is to get the guys to be more aggressive and in this instance, to be able to deliver better.We need to -- we're expanding our capacity, so that should relieve some of the problem. But it's a happy problem actually that people saying we're waiting for your tool storage products.Christopher D. GlynnYes. And is franchisee turnover still stable?Nicholas T. PinchukIt's still about the same -- it's about the same. It's about -- I think it's about 10% and you'd say, Chris, what, 5% of that is retirements. You'd say 5% is guys pretty much every year, you'll get that. And so 10% is pretty stable. It had been higher sometimes, but now last multiple quarters has been stable, about that number.OperatorOur next question will come from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.David Sutherland MacGregorI guess I wanted to -- maybe a question for Aldo, but obviously, some huge incremental margins in both Snap-on Tools and in C&amp;I. And you referenced the raw material benefit. So I mean we were expecting to report good margins, but these were certainly above what we were anticipating. How much of this price cost carries forward into 3Q and 4Q? Can you just talk about kind of the trajectory?Nicholas T. PinchukI could let out. Okay. Aldo agreed. Okay, you can answer the question, Aldo. Go ahead.Aldo J. PagliariNo. I think, David, I think most of the pricing actions a lot of incurred in the rearview mirror. So what you have now, as Nick has mentioned already, when you attenuate the incremental cost of spot buys that not gone completely, but they're greatly reduced. And steel, different grades of steel at different prices, but particularly cold rolled steel, which is used in our tool storage products has come down, and we're able to hold on to the price that was set before and therefore, the benefit of material cost reductions accrue to the margin. So that's what you're seeing. And yes, I think that with a brand like Snap-on and the power of our approach to the market and the demand that Nick described that's out there, I expect that we'll be able to retain these types of margin performance as we move forward. Nothing's guaranteed, of course.Nicholas T. PinchukI was watching a show last night and somebody said on the show, he was moving and said, electronic prices only go down, Snap-on prices only go up. We don't drop our -- I mean it's because you've got all the promotions and everything. It's hard to put your finger on it. But generally, I don't see us surrendering that too easily.David Sutherland MacGregorCan I just ask how much of that margin benefit that incremental margin was a result of the capacity constraints forcing the mix towards more customized tools because that sounds like that's a fairly..(inaudible)Nicholas T. PinchukI don't know. It could be -- there could be some of that in there. Certainly, that -- the big factor, though, there could be some of that. You're probably right. Just some of that. But the big factor, I think, is the improvements in the face of the idea of no more spot buys, no more of those huge spot buys. So you're seeing that. Actually, we've been making improvements better than we have been showing for some time because of the material cost. And so what you see that is abating. So you're seeing a lot of that. So basically, I don't know where I put it on the foot of more customized product. We did sell a lot of customized products. So that works but we don't necessarily want to back off it. And so when you do have capacity constraints, you do tend to go to that. But on the other hand, when you got capacity constraint, you spend a little more money. You're looking at the SG&amp;A and stuff like that, SG&amp;A is up a little bit. And it takes you a little bit to manage through that. So you got some goes ins and goes out there. But there's a factor. But the big pack is RCI.David Sutherland MacGregorSo let me just ask you about the organic growth of Snap-on tools because you report 1% organic growth. When you were talking about the Snap-on tool gross margin, you say both volume increases and price gains as drivers. So how do we reconcile the volume increases and price gains that you referenced in the gross margin story with the 1% organic growth and essentially flat in the U.S. Do we just take away from that, that the gross margins were essentially all cost reduction as opposed to revenue growth?Nicholas T. PinchukWell, look, I mean, some of this can be plant to plant and production line to the production line, but I think you can say in aggregate, that's probably true. That's probably true. You don't get much wind in your sales from that kind of increase. It's not 0 though, not 0 increase. And so you get some of that. You have some international businesses that came back in this situation. So we had some things happen in that situation. but that's got to be the case right? You didn't get that much volume.David Sutherland MacGregorYes. Last question for me because we're getting at the top of the hour here. But what's the trend in the total number of active stops across the Snap-on system in the U.S.?Nicholas T. PinchukActive stocks, meaning what?David Sutherland MacGregorStops. I mean a number of actual customer locations. I know you track that. So I'm just wondering what's the trend there in terms of the total number of stops?Nicholas T. PinchukIt's -- I don't have that number right here, but my feeling is it's moving upwards. But we don't really count the stops so much as we count the technicians and the technicians are growing. So we're getting more technicians.OperatorOur next question will come from Luke Junk with Baird.Luke L. JunkFirst question, I'm just wondering the capacity constraints you ran into the tools group this quarter, how that might play out in the near term versus mix of business that you'd expect in the third quarter and what would typically be little bit of a seasonal decline sequentially. And if I listen to the cadence in terms of things coming online either end of this month or into the early part of the fourth quarter. It sounds like you think you'll be in a better position in the fourth quarter overall from a supply chain standpoint. Am I hearing that right now?Nicholas T. PinchukYes. We think that -- we think the fourth as I've said, probably on every one of these calls in the second quarter, that the third quarter is always kind of squarely because you've got the franchisee conference, then you got vacations, which if franchisees take long vacations that can affect it a little bit or they take short vacations also can affect it. So you have that in place what the Snap-on franchisee conference occurs. Now we might be seeing some little bit of anticipation for that as we did in the power tools. Certainly, power tools is not going to be affected by capacity. I don't think. So that's not going to be. Those new launches shouldn't be affected by capacity. And the capacity is coming online. And so we'll see how efficacious that is. We tend to be pretty good in putting these things in place. So I think you'd be right that the fourth quarter would be -- where we'd be hitting on more cylinders.Luke L. JunkAnd then for my follow-up, just hoping you could comment on the trends that you saw in C&amp;I. You mentioned Europe briefly in Asia, you highlighted the weakness that you saw in Japan hoping you could just expand on Europe more broadly in Asia Pacific, excluding.Nicholas T. PinchukActually, the European business was up in RS&amp;I and interestingly, the U.K. and the Tools Group came off of probably it was flat on its back last year, I think. So it came back some. But the C&amp;I business was kind of a little bit up and down in Europe. And so you -- one of the things that was positive was critical industries. So the critical industry in C&amp;I, boy, volumes and margins, new capacity in place smoke, but the other business is up and down, European hand tool based business in a number of different environments like the Nordics and so on, probably affected by concerns over the war and so on. That is a little bit up and down and not very robust. And I don't know where that's going to tell you. Your guess is as good as mine. I think we're well positioned, but I do think there are macros there that are hard to predict. In Asia Pacific, boy, it's hard to find too many areas that aren't -- maybe India, I would say, is doing well.But generally, a lot of areas seem to be having trouble creating a recovery from the COVID for a number of reasons. China, I think it's well documented. Everybody talks about China. We're holding our own in China. But Japan, the currencies make a little different. The yen is pretty weak versus the U.S. dollar and has been for a while, and it's weakened recently versus the RMB. So products into Japan are not so competitive in some cases. So that weakens that. And the market itself is down somewhat. So you're seeing those kinds of things play out. I think Asia will start to work its way out because I don't think it has a long-term problem like the war or like some concerns over hydro or where they're going to get their fuel or energy. So I think that fixes itself more quickly than Europe. While in Europe, I'm not sure where it's going.Now the auto repair business in Europe in terms of the repair shop owners and managers is pretty good, particularly collision. The industrial business, pretty good, the critical industries business. But the basic up and down the street business and our tools business kind of...OperatorAnd our next question will come from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research.Gary Frank PrestopinoNick, I know we've talked about this [ad nose], but I'm really -- I'm a little bit confused here about what's going on in the Tools Group. Could you maybe just talk about the product segments where you had these capacity constraints? I think you mentioned tool storage, but what other products were you having or segments where you're having issues with capacity constraints?Nicholas T. PinchukHand tools. Hand tools is at an all-time high. And some particular products are at over all-time high, like certain versions of the sockets. And so when you got those socket, it sometimes your promotion is ready to go on a particular array of socket as kind of a new package that will address a certain promise and you just don't have the capacity for, say, half of the package. And so that's open to us in this situation. So it's basically those guys bumping up against it and then over the top in tool storage, the industrial business starting to expand its capacity and being able to source more of other products from other people and so on, and break basically, the industrial business have been bound up in a kind of Gordian knot of shipments. I talked about it many times in the quarter. They cut that Gordian knot this quarter and started to ship more and that created more demand on the tool storage and hands tool plant as well.Gary Frank PrestopinoOkay. And then as we work through the year, you're bringing on capacity and this should alleviate as we work through that?Nicholas T. PinchukYes. I mean we've been saying this for a long time. It's just the particular ordering -- this ordering pattern in this quarter kind of bumped us up against it quicker than we thought. That's simply it.Gary Frank PrestopinoWere the hand tools typical run-of-the-mill hand tools? Or were they more, like you said, customized? I'm just trying to understand how...Nicholas T. PinchukNo, they were not so much standard-standard. But there's a lot of lower run. I mean, by that would be shorter production run hand tool in these kinds of mixes. And when you get into them, they eat up a lot of capacity. You see what I mean because you got to stop and start the machines and so on. So it's not a linear thing necessarily. If it was just standard-standard products, we probably could have shipped out of inventory if we needed to. But these other products make it difficult. But we saw it coming, which is this particular one with the idea that people weren't buying as many power tools because they're waiting for the new stuff kind of shifted the mix towards these -- even more towards hand tools and power tools. I mean still storage.Gary Frank PrestopinoOkay. I just want to understand what's going on there. And then over time, as things have evolved here, could you maybe -- do you have any numbers or metrics you can circle around? What percentage of what you're doing in the tools or even across the whole company is going into collision repair versus mechanical repair?Nicholas T. PinchukIt's -- well, let's put it this way. I would say collision repair is about -- let me think about this. Equipment, the undercar equipment business is about 1/3 of RS&amp;I, and I would say about maybe 20% to 1/4 of that is collision repair. That kind of ballpark and growing, though because equipment has been growing double digits for some time. It was up double digits again, and its margins were up nicely again.OperatorThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Sara Verbsky for any closing remarks.Sara M. VerbskyThank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly at snapon.com.

In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Snap-On (SNA), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Snap-On currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for SNA that show why this tool and diagnostic equipment maker shows promise as a solid momentum pick.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor SNA, shares are up 4.36% over the past week while the Zacks Tools - Handheld industry is up 2.9% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 7.85% compares favorably with the industry's 7% performance as well.While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Shares of Snap-On have increased 15.81% over the past quarter, and have gained 41.62% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 10.29% and 17.69%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to SNA's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. SNA is currently averaging 249,372 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with SNA.Over the past two months, 2 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost SNA's consensus estimate, increasing from $17.74 to $17.81 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that SNA is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Snap-On on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

SNA reported second-quarter 2023 results, wherein both earnings and revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, sales and earnings advanced year over year. Results have benefited from continued positive business momentum and contributions from its Value Creation plan.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have gained 13.7% in the past three months compared with the industry's 7.5% growth.Q2 HighlightsSnap-on’s earnings of $4.89 per share in second-quarter 2023 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.53. The figure also improved by 14.5% from earnings of $4.27 reported in the prior-year quarter.Net sales grew 4.8% year over year to $1,191.3 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,184 million. The increase can be attributed to organic sales growth of 5.6%, which can be compared with our estimate of 7.6% growth. This was somewhat offset by an $8.3 million negative impact of foreign currency translations.The gross profit of $603.7 million improved by 9.1% year over year, while the gross margin expanded by 200 basis points (bps) year over year to 50.7% in the reported quarter. We had expected a gross margin of 50% and a gross margin expansion of 130 bps for the quarter under discussion.The company’s operating earnings before financial services totaled $277 million, up 12.3% year over year. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings before financial services expanded 160 bps to 23.3% in the second quarter. Financial Services' operating earnings were $66.9 million in the quarter, up 2.5% year over year.Consolidated operating earnings (including financial services) were $343.9 million, up 10.3% year over year.

This was partly offset by a negative currency impact of $5.6 million. Organic growth was aided by an increase in activity with customers in critical industries, partially offset by lower power tool volumes. In the quarter, we had expected sales of $368.7 million from the segment.The Tools Group segment’s sales rose 0.5% year over year to $523.1 million, driven by organic sales growth of 1.1%, partially offset by a $3.2-million negative impact of foreign currency. Robust sales in international operations and the U.S. franchise operations aided organic sales.Sales in Repair Systems &amp; Information Group advanced 8.4% year over year to $452 million, with organic sales growth of 8.5%. Sales gains were somewhat offset by a $0.3-million negative impact of foreign currency. Strong sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers and a rise in sales of under-car equipment contributed to segment organic sales growth. Increased activities with OEM dealerships have also aided the segment’s results. Our estimate for sales from this segment was $439.6 million in the quarter.The Financial Services business’ revenues rose 8.1% year over year to $93.4 million in the quarter. Our estimate for sales from this segment was $87.8 million in the quarter.Story continuesFinancialsAs of Jul 1, 2023, Snap-on’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $871.3 million, with long-term debt of $1,184.2 million and shareholders’ equity (before non-controlling interest) of $4,757.1 million.

283,96db8b8f-6d6b-3013-b48a-dab3f539aedd,SNA,2023-07-21,"With 86% institutional ownership, Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE:SNA) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/86-institutional-ownership-snap-incorporated-132632871.html,1689859592,STORY,['SNA'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Snap-on's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions50% of the business is held by the top 20 shareholders Insiders have sold recently If you want to know who really controls Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE:SNA), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 86% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Snap-on. See our latest analysis for Snap-on ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Snap-on?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Snap-on. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Snap-on's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Snap-on is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 13% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.8% and 4.2%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. In addition, we found that Nicholas Pinchuk, the CEO has 1.3% of the shares allocated to their name.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 20 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Snap-onWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Snap-on Incorporated. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$283m. It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 12% stake in Snap-on. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

A handful of well-known big cap stocks have sunk to new lows. Several are even at decade lows. Many long-term investors have been caught in the sell-off and are unsure about what to do.As Zacks Kevin Cook always says about investing decisions: have a plan. Investors who have a plan, and execute it, will feel better about their choices and will regain a sense of control.But many investors get paralyzed as a sell-off picks up steam, especially if they have owned the stock for years.  Should you buy more shares, hold it and do nothing or sell it?5 Stocks Trading at Multi-Year Lows1.      Verizon Communications, Inc. VZVerizon is a favorite of income investors because of its large dividend, which is currently yielding 7.7%.But shares of Verizon have been sliding for the last 2 years. It’s down nearly 40% during that time and has sunk 13% year-to-date. Recently, there have been concerns about reporting that there may be lead-covered cables which may need to be replaced nationwide. Verizon is cheap, with a forward P/E of 6.7. But it hit a multi-decade low this week.Story continuesIs this a buying opportunity in Verizon?2.      AT&amp;T Inc. TAT&amp;T, like Verizon, is a favorite of income investors because it is paying a dividend yielding 7.7%.But, just like Verizon, shares of AT&amp;T have hit multi-decade lows this week on the uncertainty about the alleged lead-covered cables. Shares of AT&amp;T have sunk 20.5% year-to-date but are down 31% over the last 2 years. Over the last 10 years, it hasn’t been any better. AT&amp;T is down 46.5% while the NASDAQ was up 371% and the S&amp;P 500 rose 217%.AT&amp;T is dirt cheap with a forward P/E of just 5.6. Should new investors be taking a chance on AT&amp;T?3.      3M Company MMM3M has paid a dividend for 100 years and has raised it 64 years in a row. It’s a dividend aristocrat. But shares of 3M hit new 10-year lows in May 2023 as the company announced it was entering into a class resolution about forever chemicals in the water for $10.3 billion, payable over 13 years.Shares of 3M are still down 13.7% year-to-date. Over the last 10 years, they’re up just 9.3% while the S&amp;P 500 has gained 217%. But 3M is now paying a dividend of 5.9% and it’s cheap, with a forward P/E of 11.7.Is the worst news already priced into 3M?4.      The Walt Disney Co. DISDisney has been a favorite investment for decades by parents wanting to buy stocks for their kids. But shares of Disney recently hit 9-year lows last seen in June 2014. Disney shares are up 58% over the last 10 years through July 17, 2023, but the S&amp;P 500 is up 217% in that time.Disney isn’t cheap, despite the stock sell-off. It trades with a forward P/E of 22.8.Is this a buying opportunity in Disney even as it stumbles in 2023?5.      Walgreens Boots Alliance WBAWalgreens Boots Alliance is another big cap company that has paid a dividend, first as Walgreens and now as Walgreens Boots Alliance, for more than 90 years. That dividend is currently yielding 6.5%.But shares have been on the decline the last two years. It’s down 35% over those 2-years and recently traded at June 2012 levels. Over the last 23 years, from Jan 4, 2000 to July 17, 2023, shares of Walgreens Boots are up just 4.3% while the S&amp;P 500 was up 224% in that same period.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.68%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.47%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 3.19%.Heading into today, shares of the largest U.S. cellphone carrier had lost 5.19% over the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 3.15% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 3.58% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Verizon Communications as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be July 25, 2023. On that day, Verizon Communications is projected to report earnings of $1.17 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 10.69%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $33.39 billion, down 1.18% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $4.69 per share and revenue of $134.85 billion, which would represent changes of -9.46% and -1.45%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Verizon Communications. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.02% higher within the past month. Verizon Communications is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Story continuesInvestors should also note Verizon Communications's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 7.25. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 19.65, so we one might conclude that Verizon Communications is trading at a discount comparatively.We can also see that VZ currently has a PEG ratio of 2.07. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Wireless National industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.56 as of yesterday's close.The Wireless National industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 40, which puts it in the top 16% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

Recently, the tech company eventually found itself considered to be a meme stock by many retail traders. Mahoney says Palantir has ""the runway to make some money,"" citing the stock's main ""catalyst is government contracts."" Pacer's Cash Cows 100 ETF components include energy stocks, potentially exposing it to geopolitical risks tied to the Russia-Ukraine War and oil demand pressures; Mahoney views the portfolio as being diversified enough that it secures growth opportunities for investors.On the sell-side of the trade, telecommunication companies AT&amp;T and Verizon have declined at near identical patterns this year. Verizon has fallen by 31% year-to-date, while AT&amp;T fell by over 20%. According to recent news reports, AT&amp;T has been found to be using toxic lead in its cables. Mahoney characterizes these negative stock performances as being ""stuck in quicksand"" to analysts after extensive losses, with the narrative compounded by negative news coverage.Video TranscriptALEXIS KEENAN: We want to bring back in Ken Mahoney, CEO of Mahoney Asset Management. Ken, let's get right to it with your first pick, it jumped out to me, and that's Palantir. This is a stock that has had a massive run up. Yes, it's been volatile, but it's up 170% since the start of the year. Some on Wall Street are cautioning right now saying it's not the time to jump in, but you see more upside potential. What's the catalyst?KEN MAHONEY: So the catalyst is government contracts. This doesn't really get all the buy ratings and strong buy ratings because the way they came public. They didn't go through investment backing. They kind of did direct, so they kind of snubbed Wall Street a little bit, so they don't get all the love. But it's contract after contract. They hit a high yesterday at the open in 19, settling down around 17.Story continuesLook, the runway, by the way, next month is the earnings. We don't like to hold a lot of positions overnight to earnings, example, Netflix and Tesla. But we do think there's a little runway here to make some money. We think it's exciting longer term once we get past this earnings season, because again, it could be sell the news. But Palantir's looks like in good shape, a good way to play AI outside Nvidia, Microsoft, the obvious ones. This one makes a lot of sense to us.- You also like Pacer US Cash Cows 100 ETF, ticker COWZ. Now, this ETF has a lot of exposure in oil and energy. What's the bull case there, especially with geopolitical risks like the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war?KEN MAHONEY: Well, I always feel like there's some type of Saudi put or OPEC put, which anytime we get below $70 a barrel, here they come cutting a million here, a million there. Our strategic reserves are very, very low. And again, we've had such a red hot first half of the year with tech. Again, I do believe some of that money will rotate into energy that's been off or rotate into banks, which has not been all that exciting as of late.So with Cows also though, you do get Apple in there, Cisco, companies that have great cash flow. That means they're doing pretty well in this environment. And with that cash flow, those companies are actually buying back stock, they're raising their dividends, in some cases doing both. So you get pretty much a nice diversified blend, value and growth with companies that can really grow their cash. And again, that really favors shareholders when you can buy back stock and raise dividends.ALEXIS KEENAN: Ken, on the flip side, you've got a couple of warnings here for investors, two stocks that you're saying stay away from. Both are telecom Giants, AT&amp;T and Verizon. We know obviously that journal report recently calling out the fact that so many of these cables that the telecoms giants left behind are covered in toxic lead. We've seen a massive sell-off since that report. But what does that downside look like?KEN MAHONEY: I still think there's more downside there until they just-- look, at some point, we want to go back and revisit when it starts making higher lows. If you look at it, it's still a downtrend. And when these type of things pop up, think about OPEC, Valdez, and some of these other major, major stories, they don't just get written off after a couple of weeks. They hang, they linger, and next thing, investors are sitting in quicksand with AT&amp;T and Verizon.Again, the reason why I picked those is that they pay high dividends, they look very, very attractive. And maybe they'll get a good turnaround. Maybe they will get higher lows. But at the moment until they break the downtrend, again, I think it's a sucker's bet because I do think there's still some more unfortunately to come out of this negative sentiment, especially when we're talking about lead poisoning. And you don't just clean that up in a couple of weeks and get off the front pages. They're going to be in front pages for some time.- Yeah. And besides those unfortunate headlines surrounding the lead cable situation, are there other fundamental risks you think for these two companies?KEN MAHONEY: They do have a lot of debt, right? And look, I've always been a belief instead of having an 8% dividend like AT&amp;T does, cut the dividend a little bit, pay down their debt, get rid or diversify some of their holdings and so forth. So the risk is actually when you look at a chart and you see it going down in a strong market, you know there's a lot going on.But I would say one thing that keeps coming up about Verizon and AT&amp;T is the debt load that they have, the covering of the dividend. And believe it or not, they cut the dividend, the stock may go higher because it could give them more breathing room.ALEXIS KEENAN: All right. Ken, thanks so much for sharing that insight. Always great to get your perspective. Ken Mahoney, CEO of Mahoney Asset Management.]"

We will hold the telecommunication companies responsible and take swift action to remediate any problems,"" Hochul said.Verizon said it is ""taking these concerns regarding lead-sheathed cables very seriously. Lead-sheathed infrastructure has not been deployed in decades by Verizon or its predecessor companies.""AT&amp;T declined to comment but says it believes the cables pose no public health risk.""If there’s any new scientific data, we’ll work cooperatively with all stakeholders to address new safety concerns,"" AT&amp;T CEO John Stankey said in an email to employees.The Communications Workers of America said on Thursday that AT&amp;T agreed to allow employees who may have been exposed to lead during work to receive paid time off to be tested for lead levels.""AT&amp;T’s commitment to addressing our members’ exposure to lead must go beyond point-in-time testing of blood lead levels and incorporate proper follow up,"" the union said.AT&amp;T said in a court filing it planned voluntary testing for employees who work with or have worked with lead-clad cables, expanding a prior practice of providing testing for technicians involved in lead-clad cable removal.Story continuesFederal Communications Commission chair Jessica Rosenworcel on Thursday said she had reached out to the Environmental Protection Agency and White House Council of Environmental Quality to discuss lead-cable concerns.""We want to discuss with them what their plans are and want to figure out how we can assist them going ahead,"" said Rosenworcel, who heads the telecom regulator.U.S. Representative Pat Ryan of New York on Thursday wrote to the CEOs of Verizon, AT&amp;T and industry group U.S. Telecom, demanding that they remove lead cables.""They need to clean up their mess and safely remove these cables immediately,"" Ryan said.(Reporting by Mrinalika Roy in Bengaluru; Editing by Vinay Dwivedi and Marguerita Choy)]"

A handful of well-known big cap stocks have sunk to new lows. Several are even at decade lows. Many long-term investors have been caught in the sell-off and are unsure about what to do.As Zacks Kevin Cook always says about investing decisions: have a plan. Investors who have a plan, and execute it, will feel better about their choices and will regain a sense of control.But many investors get paralyzed as a sell-off picks up steam, especially if they have owned the stock for years.  Should you buy more shares, hold it and do nothing or sell it?5 Stocks Trading at Multi-Year Lows 1.      Verizon Communications, Inc. (VZ)Verizon is a favorite of income investors because of its large dividend, which is currently yielding 7.7%.But shares of Verizon have been sliding for the last 2 years. It’s down nearly 40% during that time and has sunk 13% year-to-date. Recently, there have been concerns about reporting that there may be lead-covered cables which may need to be replaced nationwide. Verizon is cheap, with a forward P/E of 6.7. But it hit a multi-decade low this week.Is this a buying opportunity in Verizon?2.      AT&amp;T Inc. (T)AT&amp;T, like Verizon, is a favorite of income investors because it is paying a dividend yielding 7.7%.But, just like Verizon, shares of AT&amp;T have hit multi-decade lows this week on the uncertainty about the alleged lead-covered cables. Shares of AT&amp;T have sunk 20.5% year-to-date but are down 31% over the last 2 years. Over the last 10 years, it hasn’t been any better. AT&amp;T is down 46.5% while the NASDAQ was up 371% and the S&amp;P 500 rose 217%.Story continuesAT&amp;T is dirt cheap with a forward P/E of just 5.6. Should new investors be taking a chance on AT&amp;T?3.      3M Company (MMM)3M has paid a dividend for 100 years and has raised it 64 years in a row. It’s a dividend aristocrat. But shares of 3M hit new 10-year lows in May 2023 as the company announced it was entering into a class resolution about forever chemicals in the water for $10.3 billion, payable over 13 years.Shares of 3M are still down 13.7% year-to-date. Over the last 10 years, they’re up just 9.3% while the S&amp;P 500 has gained 217%. But 3M is now paying a dividend of 5.9% and it’s cheap, with a forward P/E of 11.7.Is the worst news already priced into 3M?4.      The Walt Disney Company (DIS)Disney has been a favorite investment for decades by parents wanting to buy stocks for their kids. But shares of Disney recently hit 9-year lows last seen in June 2014. Disney shares are up 58% over the last 10 years through July 17, 2023, but the S&amp;P 500 is up 217% in that time.Disney isn’t cheap, despite the stock sell-off. It trades with a forward P/E of 22.8.Is this a buying opportunity in Disney even as it stumbles in 2023?5.      Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)Walgreens Boots Alliance is another big cap company that has paid a dividend, first as Walgreens and now as Walgreens Boots Alliance, for more than 90 years. That dividend is currently yielding 6.5%.But shares have been on the decline the last two years. It’s down 35% over those 2-years and recently traded at June 2012 levels. Over the last 23 years, from Jan 4, 2000 to July 17, 2023, shares of Walgreens Boots are up just 4.3% while the S&amp;P 500 was up 224% in that same period. Walgreens Boots Alliance is cheap, with a forward P/E of 7.3.Should value investors be considering Walgreens Boots Alliance?What Else do you Need to Know about Losing Stocks?    Listen to this week’s podcast to find out.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

293,4136298f-198e-3453-9ea4-1259939ffdd5,VZ,2023-07-21,T-Mobile (TMUS) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/t-mobile-tmus-earnings-expected-140238570.html,1689861758,STORY,['VZ'],"[The market expects T-Mobile (TMUS) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 27, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis wireless carrier is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.71 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +19.6%.Revenues are expected to be $19.34 billion, down 1.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for T-Mobile?For T-Mobile, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +3.94%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that T-Mobile will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that T-Mobile would post earnings of $1.51 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.58, delivering a surprise of +4.64%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.T-Mobile appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerVerizon Communications (VZ), another stock in the Zacks Wireless National industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.17 for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -10.7%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $33.39 billion, down 1.2% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Verizon has been revised 0.2% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.86%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Verizon will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

300,127850f0-14b9-3342-a22c-6bc03dd5d376,NVDA,2023-07-21,Bull of the Day: Cadence Design Systems (CDNS),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bull-day-cadence-design-systems-092000181.html,1689931200,STORY,"['CDNS', 'NVDA']","[I last profiled Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) in late March, right before the AI-propelled moonshot of NVIDIA (NVDA) shares from $250 to $475.The reason this is important is that NVIDIA , the ""King of AI"" with GPU computing, is a big Cadence customer and partner in the design and simulation of semiconductor architectures.If you are reading this before Monday afternoon July 24, you still have time to buy Cadence near $240 before it goes higher on what I expect will be another beat-and-raise quarterly report.What Hath ChatGPT Wrought?In a special report on ChatGPT for Zacks Confidential members in March, I reiterated why NVIDIA was so important to computing -- even before the ""chatterbot that ate the internet"" became all the rage.And I also recommended investors buy the only meaningful competitor for Cadence -- another electronic design automation (EDA) wizard called Synopsys (SNPS) -- since I already owned both NVDA and CDNS in my TAZR Trader portfolio.Investors could have bought NVDA under $260, SNPS under $375, and CDNS near $200 in late March. You can find that report at this link or by emailing Ultimate@Zacks.com. Tell 'em Cooker sent you.ChatGPT: Time to Become An AI ConversationalistHere was the summary of my reco...Buy Synopsys (SNPS): This is half of a ""duopoly"" in semiconductor software EDA (electronic design automation) and SDE (system design enablement). My NVDA investors already know that I am heavily invested in Cadence Design Systems (CDNS), which is the ""other half"" and a Zacks #1 Rank, because it is a key R&amp;D partner for NVIDIA simulation and design. Synopsys offers a full suite of products used in the logic synthesis and functional verification phases of chip design, including a broad array of reusable design building blocks. Shares are cheaper on a relative basis to Candence -- on both EPS and price/sales metrics -- and the stock is poised to break out above $400.And here's what I wrote in my March 29 Bull of the Day feature on CDNS...Cadence is one of my favorite ""stealth"" semiconductor stocks -- and even more so with the explosion of use cases for AI tools like ChatGPT, the Generative Pretraining Transformer model that has taken 2023 by storm.Cadence is at least a fifth-gen CAD/CAM software platform that allows semiconductor manufacturers to design and simulate myriad possibilities in the intricate and microscopic architecture of sub-10 nanometer integrated circuitry.Why Buy Cadence Now?NVIDIA is a Cadence customer precisely because Jensen Huang and his teams of engineers are highly focused on simulating all facets of their chip design and testing.Huang and his top engineering teams don't want to send any designs to the chip foundry that haven't been fully simulated under all parameters that are demanded from the world's top GPU ""cards"" -- that go by the thousands into DGX supercomputer systems and sell for $10,000 to $20,000 each depending on the generation and complexity.It was only a few years ago that Jensen &amp; Co. were building a supercomputer for Tesla (TSLA) with 5,700 GPUs that could execute 1.8 exaFLOPS (a quintillion floating point operations per second). Those Volta gen cards only had 21 billion transistors and were deployed to help Tesla with the ""massively parallel architectures"" needed to harness the data demands of Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology.Tesla engineers have now learned enough about AI computing that Elon Musk is building their own in-house supercomputer and may not need NVIDIA GPUs anymore (but I doubt it).Because now that NVIDIA leads the dive under 5-nanometer architectures, their new Ampere and Grace Hopper chip sets can contain anywhere from 50 to 80 billion transistors -- in the space of a shoebox. This is to say nothing of the NVIDIA ""CUDA"" stack of hardware + software. CUDA stands for Compute Unified Device Architecture.To learn more about how NVIDIA drives the AI revolution with their GPU-CUDA engines for machine learning and deep learning -- that a 10-fold stack of global corporations suddenly realized they needed -- see this recent video and article...Nvidia DGX: Workhorse of AI Will Drive NVDA to $2 TrillionCadence Wins as an Arms Dealer in the Nanometer WarsThrough its Intelligent System Design strategy, the company offers software, hardware, services and reusable IC (integrated circuit) design blocks to electronic systems and semiconductor customers.Cadence's core EDA software and services enable engineers to develop different types of ICs. Its design IPs are directly integrated into the ICs.Besides the fact that CDNS is like a planet orbiting the star of NVDA, more Wall Street analysts are finally waking up to the importance of what Cadence calls ""Intelligent System Design.""Stifel Nicolaus semi analysts upgraded CDNS from Hold to Buy this past week and launched their price target on shares from $210 to $300.The Stifel team titled their report ""AI is Likely to Drive a Virtuous Cycle for EDA.""That's an understatement. Here's what I highlighted over two years ago when I first saw NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang feature Cadence in a virtual keynote he gave...Nexus of Software and Industrial DesignThe software to design semiconductors has become ever more important for at least 3 reasons...First, transistor architecture has slipped to sub-microscopic levels under 10 nanometers, smaller than the coronavirus.Second, the proliferation of applications in autos, mobile, home, factory, and datacenter are accelerating demand and custom solutions for OEMs.Third, the engineering, testing and simulation of these ultra-miniature designs are critical before they are shipped to a chip foundry, or ""fab.""(end of notes from April '21)As if being a major intelligent planet orbiting the stellar NVDA wasn't enough, Cadence is embedded in other key partnerships with Taiwan Semiconductor, the giant chip foundry, and Microsoft (MSFT), the giant engine of ChatGPT, to accelerate the physical verification of digital designsThe collaborations will help minimize design schedules and compute costs using the Cadence Pegasus Physical Verification System. Considering designers are always under pressure to meet design schedules and compute budgets, any procedural improvements are enabled to progress more efficiently -- and profitability.Announced in April, this new system should optimize CPU usage to decrease cloud computing costs by as much as 20%.What to Listen for on Earnings CallCadence has many products, growth initiatives and strategies that are too in-depth to explain here. So let me just share some of these pivot points that analysts may focus on...Cadence is expected to benefit from secular trends like 5G, rising hyperscale computer consumption at the enterprise level, and emerging AI/ML technologies, which are all fueling digital transformation across various end markets and accelerating demand for advanced semiconductor chips.The company's System Design and Analysis division is likely to have benefited from its growing presence in industries like 5G, aerospace &amp; defense, wireless and communications.Frequent product launches and strong uptake of the company's existing solutions like Palladium Z2 and Protium X2 systems, Cerebrus, Clarity 3D Transient Solver, Sigrity-X, and Xcelium Logic are likely to have driven the second-quarter performance.The launch of Virtuoso Studio and Allegro X AI is anticipated to have helped the company tap the growing demand for generative AI solutions in the digital, verification and systems arenas.What About the Valuation?Besides the Stifel team upgrade, there were other notable moves in the past few weeks before Monday's quarterly earnings report...KeyBanc: Cadence Design price target raised to $265 from $235Wells Fargo: Cadence Design price target raised to $270 from $250With current sales projections of $4.5 billion next year (10% growth), the stock price-to-sales valuation is very rich at 16.5 times. So, it's possible that these analysts have been somewhat reluctant to jump on the NVDA starship and are simply motivated now by FOMO in case Cadence delivers another big beat-and-raise.So, they don't want to be caught flat-footed. But I think that with any key satellite of a new star like NVDA, it takes time for institutional investors to accept this kind of valuation.And so most of Wall Street is still catching up to a software innovator they didn't see coming. I say to investors that you can still hitch your wagon to the NVIDIA star.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Adult Nutrition sales improved 6% organically. Per the company, Adult Nutrition sales benefited from the strong global sales performance of Abbott's complete and balanced nutrition brand, Ensure.Diagnostics sales were down 46% year over year on a reported basis (down 44.7% on an organic basis) to $2.32 billion. For this segment, we had projected revenues of $3.18 billion for the second quarter.Core Laboratory Diagnostics sales were up 9.5% organically. Molecular Diagnostics declined 32.1% on an organic basis. Rapid Diagnostics sales dropped 72.3% on an organic basis, whereas Point of Care Diagnostics sales rose 2.4% organically.MarginsThe gross profit in the reported quarter fell 13.1% year over year to $5.50 billion. The gross margin contracted 111 basis points (bps) to 55.1%.SG&amp;A expenses were down 0.6% year over year to $2.74 billion. Research and development expenses increased 4.5% year over year to $715 million. The company reported an adjusted operating profit of $2.04 billion in the quarter under review, down 29.2% year over year. Also, the adjusted operating margin contracted 517 bps to 20.4%.2023 GuidanceAbbott maintained its original 2023 EPS guidance, as announced on the first-quarter 2023 earnings call.Full-year adjusted earnings (excluding specified items of $1.28 per share) are expected in the range of $4.30-$4.50 (unchanged). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $4.39.Abbott projects full-year 2023 organic sales growth, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, in the low double digits (from the earlier projection of at least high single digits) and COVID-19 testing-related sales of around $1.3 billion (earlier $1.5 billion).Our TakeAbbott exited the second quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. However, the quarter’s earnings and revenues declined year over year. On a positive note, the company delivered strong growth across its underlying base business.The Diabetes Care business continued to benefit from the growing sales of its flagship, sensor-based continuous glucose monitoring system, FreeStyle Libre. Last month, Abbott’s FreeStyle Libre 2 system marked the first and only continuous glucose monitoring system to receive expanded national reimbursement in France, which will now include all people with diabetes who use insulin.Within Medical Device, the company registered double-digit organic growth in Diabetes Care, Electrophysiology, Structural Heart and Neuromodulation in the reported quarter. Abbott’s highly-productive pipeline is likely to position well for its growth in the future.Meanwhile, a significant year-over-year decline in COVID-19 testing-related sales negatively impacted the quarter’s top line.Zacks Rank and Other Key PicksAbbott currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Penumbra PEN, Zimmer Biomet ZBH and McKesson MCK.Penumbra, carrying a Zacks Rank #2, reported a first-quarter 2023 adjusted EPS of 23 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 109.1%.

And now I'd like to turn the call over to Alan.Story continuesAlan David SchnitzerThank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. In the face of an historic cat quarter, our top and bottom-line results demonstrate the strength of our franchise and the resilience of our business model.This quarter, we reported strong underlying results and investment returns as well as net favorable prior year reserve development, which were essentially offset by an historic level of industry-wide catastrophe losses. There were PCS-designated catastrophe events taking place on 88 of the 91 days of the quarter.Despite pretax catastrophe losses of $1.5 billion, we generated slightly positive core income for the quarter. We are very pleased with the underlying fundamentals of our business. Pretax underlying underwriting income of $781 million for the quarter was up nearly 40%, driven by record net earned premiums of $9.2 billion and a consolidated underlying combined ratio, which improved 1.7 points to an excellent 91.1%. Earned premiums were higher in all 3 of our business segments.Underlying profitability in our Business Insurance segment was particularly strong. The underlying combined ratio improved by 3 points to an excellent 89.4%. The underlying combined ratio in our Bond &amp; Specialty business was higher year-over-year, but at 87.8%, still generated a very attractive return. In our Personal Insurance segment, the underlying combined ratio improved by 2 points, reflecting the actions we have taken to improve profitability.Turning to investments. Our high-quality investment portfolio generated net investment income of $594 million after tax for the quarter, reflecting stronger and reliable returns from our fixed income portfolio, and solid returns from our nonfixed income portfolio. Given our confidence in the strength of our business, we returned $633 million of excess capital to shareholders during the quarter, including $400 million of share repurchases.Turning to production. Thanks once again to excellent execution by our colleagues in the field, we grew net written premiums by $1.3 billion or 14% to a record $10.3 billion. In Business Insurance, we grew net written premiums by 18% to $5.2 billion. Renewal premium change in the segment was a record high at 12.8%, driven by renewal rate change, which accelerated 2.5 points sequentially to 7.2%. The renewal premium change we achieved this quarter was broad-based. RPC was double-digit or near double-digit in every line other than workers' compensation, and it was higher sequentially in every line, including workers' compensation. Even with strong pricing, retention, an important indicator of marketplace stability, remained very strong at 88%. New business increased 36% to $671 million led by the property line.In Bond &amp; Specialty Insurance, record net written premiums were about even with the prior year quarter. Retention in our management liability business was an excellent 91% and new business increased 11%. Surety net written premiums were also once again strong. Given the attractive returns, we are very pleased with the strong production results in both of our commercial business segments. The growth we're putting on the books is from geographies, products and distribution partners that we know well.In Personal Insurance, top line growth of 13% was driven by higher pricing. Renewal premium change was 19.2% in our homeowners and other business and increased to a record high 16.1% in our auto business.Another quarter of terrific production across the board positions us well for the rest of the year and into 2024. We'll hear more shortly from Greg, Jeff and Michael about our segment results.Before I turn the call over to Dan, I'd like to spend a few minutes on what Travelers is doing in an important area for us, artificial intelligence. We subscribe to the view that over time, the impact of AI across the economy is going to be profound. So is the opportunity for Travelers. With our perform and transform mindset and our disciplined framework for assessing our investment priorities, we've been focused for years on responsibly developing differentiating AI capabilities across our 3 innovation priorities, extending our lead in risk expertise, providing great experiences for our customers, agents, brokers and employees and optimizing productivity and efficiency.Between our colleagues who are dedicated to AI specifically and others in enabling disciplines, we have a very significant number of our employees engaged on the objective of making sure that we're leading when it comes to AI.As we've shared before, and as you can see on Slide 23 of the webcast presentation, for some time, we've been steadily increasing our technology spend. This year, we'll spend more than $1.5 billion on technology. As the slide demonstrates, we've also been improving the strategic mix of our tech spend. That includes a meaningful increase in investments to develop or acquire cutting-edge AI capabilities built on modern cloud technology. Importantly, we've done all that while significantly improving our expense ratio in no small part, thanks to the success of our technology investments.The quantity and quality of data are key differentiators when it comes to AI. For more than a decade, we've been investing in data sets, data quality and data accessibility. Between submissions in our commercial businesses and quotes in PI, we intake millions of business opportunities each year. We also take in, adjust and adjudicate millions of claims. As one of the largest risk control organizations in the industry, we provide risk mitigation to our commercial customers, completing more than 100,000 risk control consultations annually. We capture valuable data from virtually all of those interactions.Our data also include decades of curated institutional knowledge in the forms of policies, procedures, guidelines, forensic investigations and so on. All of that creates an excellent foundation for the next iteration of generative AI.In addition to our extensive proprietary data, we've been assembling actionable third-party data for years. In fact, we have more than 2,000 data sets from hundreds of third parties. All in, we believe that we have a significant and hard to replicate data advantage. Given the competitive advantages that will come from deploying AI across the insurance value chain, and the expertise, resources and data required to get there, scale will increasingly be a differentiator in our industry as will the ability to execute complex initiatives effectively and efficiently. Expertise, resources, data, scale and execution excellence, all favor Travelers.The potential use cases for AI and our industry are many and varied. We pursue very focused opportunities that are consistent with our innovation priorities and will create meaningful and sustainable competitive advantages, all with an eye towards leveraging strategic capabilities across our organization.AI capabilities that we currently have in production span the spectrum from those driving efficiency through automation to more advanced generative AI and large language models. More advanced models augment various aspects of our underwriting, claim handling, service delivery and other work. We use intelligent process automation broadly throughout our business to handle hundreds of routine workflows. Automation and AI have been meaningful drivers of our expense ratio improvement over the past 7 years or so.A key success driver in insurance is segmenting risk as finely as possible to achieve pricing that is accurately calibrated to the risk. Deep learning models have significantly improved our ability to classify and segment risk in our flow businesses.For example, in Personal Insurance, we leverage proprietary AI and aerial imagery to assess roof and other site-related conditions at the parcel level. Parcel level risk assessment at scale was practically unimaginable until several years ago. And that type of information is very difficult to obtain from the insured with a reliable degree of accuracy.In our Select Accounts business, we estimate that AI has improved business classification, a critical underwriting input by more than 30%. In our Middle Market business, we've developed a suite of sophisticated AI models, which facilitate targeted cross-selling, supporting our effort to sell more products to more customers. We're also using AI to better understand our customers and their needs. With this improved customer segmentation, we can better align new product development and generate insights that improve the customer experience, enhancing our industry-leading analytics using machine learning models to deliver sophisticated actuarial insights and to loss cost trends in development, which improve our already strong pricing and product monitoring capabilities.On the most advanced end, we're leveraging generative AI in large language models, and we've been doing so for several years. For example, in our Bond &amp; Specialty business, our proprietary large language models have processed hundreds of thousands of broker submissions as we work toward improving intake time from hours to minutes. This will improve our responsiveness to our customers and distribution partners and contribute to our productivity.In our claim organization, a proprietary large language model ingests legal complaints filed against our insureds and then highlights key liability and coverage issues, assist in routing the cases to the best suited defense counsel and provides risk-related insights that can be incorporated back into our underwriting process.We've also developed and are piloting a Traveler's claim knowledge assistant, a generative AI tool trained on many thousands of pages of proprietary technical source material that was previously only accessible through thousands of different documents. The model provides claim professionals with the ability to easily access accurate actionable information on technical and procedural claim matters, increasing speed, accuracy and consistency in various workflows, including in interactions with our customers and distribution partners.So in terms of AI, we're investing with speed and strategic direction, consistent with our stated objective of delivering industry-leading returns. I've only shared some of what's in flight, and the capabilities that we've developed are in various phases of adoption. The full impact of the capabilities we're developing and others on our road map are still ahead of us.To sum things up, we are very confident in the outlook for our business. We have terrific underlying fundamentals in our commercial businesses, improving underlying results in our Personal Insurance business and steadily rising investment returns in our fixed income portfolio.As you've heard, we're also investing in impactful new capabilities to advance our ambitious innovation agenda. With that momentum and the best talent in the industry, we are well positioned to continue to deliver meaningful shareholder value over time. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.Daniel Stephen FreyThank you, Alan. We're pleased to have generated record levels of earned premium this quarter and an underlying combined ratio of 91.1% and a 170 basis point improvement from last year's strong results. This led to a very strong underlying underwriting gain of $615 million after tax, up $171 million or 39% from the prior year quarter.The expense ratio for the second quarter improved 40 basis points from last year to 28.6%. Once again, benefiting from the combination of our focus on productivity and efficiency, coupled with strong top line growth.As Alan mentioned, the industry experienced a very active cat quarter and our second quarter results include $1.5 billion of pretax catastrophe losses, our second largest ever cat amount for a second quarter. As disclosed in the significant events table in our 10-Q, we had 6 events surpass the $100 million mark in Q2, the most ever for a single quarter since we began disclosing the table in 2013.Turning to prior year reserve development, we had total net favorable development of $60 million pretax. In Business Insurance, net unfavorable PYD of $101 million was the result of better-than-expected loss experience in workers' comp across a number of accident years, being more than offset by an increase in some of our other casualty reserves as well as for runoff operations.In Bond &amp; Specialty, net favorable PYD of $119 million was driven by better-than-expected results in management liability and surety. Personal Insurance had $42 million of net favorable PYD driven by homeowners and other. After-tax net investment income of $594 million was in line with the prior year quarter. Fixed maturity NII was again higher than the prior year quarter reflecting both the benefit of higher average yields and higher invested assets.Returns in the nonfixed income portfolio were solid, but as expected, were not as strong as the double-digit yield we experienced in the prior year quarter.With interest rates having moved higher during the second quarter, we are raising our outlook for fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities by $35 million after tax for the back half of the year. We now expect approximately $570 million after tax in the third quarter and $595 million after tax in the fourth quarter. New money rates as of June 30 are about 140 basis points higher than what's embedded in the portfolio, so fixed income NII should continue to improve as the portfolio gradually turns over and continues to grow.Turning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.5 billion were again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $2 billion. In late May, we issued $750 million of 30-year debt in order to maintain the debt-to-capital ratio in line with our target range as our premium volume has continued to grow.Interest rates increased and spreads widened during the quarter, and as a result, our net unrealized investment loss increased from $3.9 billion after tax at March 31 to $4.6 billion after tax at June 30. As we've discussed in prior quarters, the changes in unrealized investment gains and losses generally do not impact how we manage our investment portfolio. We generally hold fixed income investments to maturity, the quality of our fixed income portfolio remains very high and changes in unrealized gains and losses have little impact on our cash flows, statutory surplus or regulatory capital requirements.Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses was $115.45 at quarter end, up 1% from year-end and up 3% from a year ago. We returned $633 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising share repurchases of $400 million and dividends of $233 million. We have approximately $6.2 billion of capacity remaining under the share repurchase authorization from our Board of Directors.Since the significant level of cat losses in late June resulted in lower earnings for the quarter than we had anticipated, we expect the level of share repurchases over the back half of the year to be lower than the level of share repurchases in the first half of the year.Turning to the topic of reinsurance. Page 20 of the webcast presentation shows a summary of our July 1 reinsurance placements. While we did see some meaningful price increases on our reinsurance renewals, those increases were broadly in line with the price increases we are obtaining on the direct property premiums we're writing. So there's little or no impact expected on margins.Let me take another moment to highlight a few items on Page 20. First, we renewed our main cat reinsurance program at terms that were generally consistent with the expiring program. Second, we increased the coverage under our Northeast Property Treaty by fully placing the $850 million layer above the attachment point of $2.5 billion. A year ago, we placed $750 million of that $850 million layer and the attachment point was $2.25 billion. This treaty remains pretty far out on the tail for us.Finally, as part of our ongoing management of tail-risk exposure for the enterprise and in response to inflation-driven growth and insured values in our Personal Insurance property book, we added a new hurricane cat excess-of-loss reinsurance program specific to Personal Insurance coastal exposure, providing 50% coverage for the $1 billion layer above an attachment point of $1.75 billion, again, far out on the tail. Any margin impact from this new program will be de minimis, given both the size of our PI property book and the level of price increases we are obtaining on that book.To sum up the quarter, our ability to absorb $1.5 billion of pretax cat losses and still report slightly positive core income for the quarter is a testament to the overall strength of our franchise and the underlying fundamentals of our business. Q2 was another quarter of double-digit premium growth, improved underlying profitability and further improvement in our outlook for fixed income NII, all of which bodes well for our future returns. With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance.Gregory Cheshire ToczydlowskiThanks, Dan. Business Insurance produced $402 million of segment income for the second quarter, down from the prior year quarter driven by prior year reserve development and higher cats, as Dan mentioned. Underlying underwriting results continue to be exceptional with underlying underwriting income up more than 50% from the prior year quarter.We're once again particularly pleased with the quarter's underlying combined ratio of 89.4% which improved by 3 points from the prior year quarter. The loss ratio benefited from property losses that were about 1.5 points better than our expectations for the current year quarter. The loss ratio also improved due to earned pricing. The expense ratio remained strong at 30.1%.Net written premiums increased 18% to a quarterly record of $5.2 billion, driven by renewal premium change of 12.8%, retention of 88% and new business of $671 million, all record highs. Underneath RPC, renewal rate change accelerated sequentially from the first quarter by 2.5 points to 7.2%. We're thrilled with these production results and the superior execution by our field team in the marketplace.In terms of pricing, we're pleased with our response to the persistent environmental headwinds in both the property and liability lines. In each of our product lines, renewal premium change was higher than the first quarter. And beyond pricing, we continue to improve terms and conditions to ensure we're achieving an appropriate risk/reward trade-off on the business we write.As we always say, we execute in a granular manner, deal by deal, class by class. And to that point, we're thrilled with our execution demonstrated by a record retention of 88% on our very high-quality book of business and a rate that is thoughtfully segmented by return profile.New business as a percentage of the book returned to pre-pandemic levels, led by the property line. We're pleased with new business dollars at an all-time high. And as always, when it comes to new business, we remain focused on risk selection, underwriting, terms and conditions and pricing. We're also very pleased with the impact that our strategic investments are having on our production results.As for the individual businesses, in select, renewal premium change was up 1 point from the first quarter to a strong 10.6% while retention also remained historically high at 84%. New business increased $30 million or 28% from the prior year quarter driven by the continued success of our BOP 2.0 product.In Middle Market, renewal premium change was up more than 2 points sequentially from the first quarter to a historically high 10.5% with renewal rate change increasing sequentially by 1.5% to 5.9% and continued strong exposure growth. Retention was once again exceptional at 90% while new business was up 32% from the prior year quarter with increases across all account sizes in most markets.To sum up, Business Insurance had another strong quarter and continue to execute on the fundamentals to drive profitable growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.Jeffrey Peter KlenkThanks, Greg. Bond &amp; Specialty posted strong top and bottom-line results for the quarter. Segment income of $230 million was up slightly from the very strong prior year quarter. The combined ratio was a terrific 77.1%. The underlying combined ratio was a solid 87.8% for the quarter. A small number of surety losses drove the roughly 4-point increase in the underlying loss ratio year-over-year.As we've said before, surety losses can be a bit lumpy. Even with the incremental losses this quarter, our returns in the surety line remain excellent.Turning to the top line. We delivered record net written premiums this quarter. In domestic management liability, we are pleased that we drove record retention of 91% in the quarter, up 2 points sequentially and 3 points from the second quarter of 2022 while continuing to achieve solid renewal premium change. This result reflects our team's deliberate execution to retain our high-quality book of business in light of the very strong returns.We're also pleased that we increased new business 11% from the prior year quarter. That's a reflection of the strong franchise value we offer to our customers and distribution partners and a lot of hard work by our team in the field. Additionally, we're pleased to report record surety net written premiums in the quarter.So both top and bottom-line results for Bond &amp; Specialty were once again strong this quarter, driven by our continued underwriting and risk management diligence, excellent execution by our field organization and the benefits from our ongoing strategic investments to extend our market-leading competitive advantages. And now I'll turn the call over to Michael.Michael Frederick KleinThanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. In Personal Insurance, the second quarter segment loss of $538 million and a combined ratio of 122% were significantly impacted by catastrophes. While it's not unusual for us to have a loss in the second quarter, given it's typically the quarter with the highest weather-related losses, catastrophe losses this quarter for both us and the industry were significantly elevated compared to historical results.Net written premiums for the quarter grew 13%, driven by double-digit renewal premium change in both domestic automobile and homeowners and other. The underlying combined ratio of 94.1% improved 2 points from the prior year quarter, reflecting an improvement in the underlying combined ratio in homeowners and other, partially offset by an increase in automobile.In automobile, the second quarter combined ratio was 108.4% with an underlying combined ratio of 103.5%. The underlying combined ratio increased 1.7 points from the prior year quarter due to higher severity driven by increased vehicle replacement and repair costs, and a mix shift from collision only claims towards claims with bodily injury and third-party property damage, which is more consistent with more cars on the road, leading to more multicar accidents. These increases were partially offset by the growing benefit of earned pricing and a lower expense ratio.While some of the inflationary pressures in auto are beginning to show signs of easing, they are not improving at the rate we expected. Consequently, we're not yet achieving the written rate adequacy levels we had anticipated. While we continue to make progress and expect to get there in the coming quarters, exactly when will depend on a few things. For example, how quickly inflation comes down, how quickly we can get additional rate through the regulatory process and our actual loss experience.In homeowners and other, the second quarter combined ratio of 135.1% increased 17.1 points due to significantly higher catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio of 85.2% improved 5.1 points, primarily driven by non-cat weather losses that were lower than in the prior year quarter. Non-cat weather losses in the quarter were also better than our expectations as more events reached our catastrophe threshold.Turning to production. Our results continue to demonstrate disciplined market execution of rate and non-rate actions in both lines as we remain focused on improving profitability and managing growth in response to continued inflationary pressures in the environment. In domestic automobile, renewal premium change of 16.1% increased 2.1 points from the first quarter of 2023. We expect renewal premium change to continue to increase from current levels throughout the second half of this year.In domestic homeowners and other, renewal premium change of 19.2% was broadly consistent with the first quarter. We expect renewal premium change to remain in the high teens through the end of the year.Before I conclude, I just want to take a minute to thank our claim partners for responding to our customers when it matters most. Behind the aggregate statistics of catastrophe events occurring virtually every day of the quarter, are tens of thousands of individual customers whose homes and vehicles are damaged or destroyed and whose lives are disrupted. In each case, our claim team is responding, helping those customers get their homes repaired and their cars back on the road, continuing to deliver high-quality customer service despite the high volume of claims.Both the loss environment and the Personal Insurance marketplace remain dynamic. We continue to respond to the changing environment with a steadfast focus on execution, quickly addressing changes in loss experience with targeted pricing, underwriting and other non-rate actions, remaining disciplined in writing business that is consistent with our appetite and making thoughtful and impactful investments for the future. We're confident that the actions we've taken and will continue to take will improve profitability as we move through 2023 and beyond. Now I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.Abbe F. GoldsteinThanks, Michael. We're ready to open up for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Greg Peters of Raymond James.Charles Gregory PetersI guess notwithstanding Michael's comments, I -- just curious about if there's going to be any shift in the strategy on property considering what's going on with catastrophe losses. And I'm also trying to triangulate or bridge the difference between personal lines, which clearly was a negative surprise. And I think, Greg, in your comments, you said property actually was a better -- a net gain for you guys relative to expectations. So any broad comments on your views on property in light of the cats and in the different segments, too, please?Michael Frederick KleinSure. So I can start on the property side, Greg. Certainly, the catastrophe experience in the quarter was significantly worse than prior year and worse than our expectations. In terms of a shift in strategy, what I would say is we continue to execute a series of actions in the property line to manage growth and improve profitability. And again, first and foremost, you see that in the pricing, in the production statistics that we shared with you on the webcast. But beyond that, we're managing terms and conditions, think deductibles, think roof age eligibility, think coverage levels on roof replacement in a variety of actions that we look at very granularly state by state, market by market, account by account.And then one of the other things we're really encouraged by, Alan mentioned in his discussion around artificial intelligence, is our aerial imagery and artificial intelligence-enabled capability we have there to refine our underwriting and our risk selection. So less a shift in strategy and more a continuation of a really broad array of profit management and profit improvement efforts in the personal lines' property space.Gregory Cheshire ToczydlowskiAnd Greg, this is Greg. Just to follow up on the commercial side. So many times, the catastrophes, the split between personal and commercial can be -- that really depends on the concentration of where the catastrophes hit in terms of where commercial businesses are. In terms of your comment, I think your reference in my prepared comments when I was explaining the underlying combined ratio. And I mentioned that property was better than expectation, and that really was non-cat property.Charles Gregory PetersGot it. All right. And then I guess I'll pivot, Greg also during your comments, you talked about reserve development. Maybe spend a minute, don't really touch upon workers' comp, but the adverse development in the other lines.Daniel Stephen FreyGreg, it's Dan Frey. I'll take the PYD comment. So in the quarter for Business Insurance, as we said, overall unfavorable $101 million. Comp continues to be favorable. The comp favorable was very strong this quarter, more than $250 million of good news. So that leaves us with the other liability lines, including runoff being unfavorable. And that's really led by umbrella, which is sort of the poster child for perpetual core levels of inflation, just compounding and pushing more claims up into the umbrella layer.But a couple of things to put that in context, I guess, we're making a relatively small adjustment to those liability lines, given the fact that there are more than $15 billion worth of reserves in those lines. The returns in BI continue to remain excellent. And across the company, I'd just remind us, including the good news coming out of Bond &amp; Specialty, which is also liability-type coverage, we had a net favorable $60 million for the quarter.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of David Motemaden of Evercore ISI.David Kenneth MotemadenI had just a follow-up question just on the adverse prior year development. I guess, what does that do to your view of future loss cost trends. It sounds like some of it is runoff, but also some of it is more business that you're obviously still writing. So I'd be interested in how you've changed your 5.5% to 6% loss trend assumption.Alan David SchnitzerYes. David, it's Alan. Thank you. Two things in response to that. One, I would say that -- I would just point you to the combined ratio and underlying combined in BI in a quarter. And obviously, we think about how prior year development influences that through base year changes, and you can see a pretty solid result. And as we've shared with you before, I always want to just preface this by saying it's a very blunt instrument to try to capture what's going on across billions of dollars of premiums in a single loss trend metric. Every line has its own dynamics and the question usually comes in, in terms of loss trend, but of course, there's base year changes, there's exposure changes. There's other adjustments to loss activity. So always puts and takes in all those measures, but all in, I'd say there really hasn't been much significant change.And I would go back to a comment that Dan made on $15-odd billion of reserves, this is a relatively small adjustment, and we're always every quarter looking at all our reserves and sometimes they go up, sometimes they go down, but relatively small. And as Dan said, the returns in BI continue to be exceptional.David Kenneth MotemadenGot it. And then I guess I should just take that. I mean, it's obviously a very fluid environment. But I guess it would -- fluid macro environment. It would seem that just given the re-acceleration in renewal rate change, the gap between written rate and loss trend has been expanding. I guess, is that the right take? Or is there anything else that I'm missing there? Obviously, we have to take catastrophes into account. But there -- I know Fidelis has come in. I'm just wondering if there's anything else I'm missing on the underlying loss ratio.Alan David SchnitzerNo. I mean other than -- Greg mentioned in his script that the non-cat property losses came in a little better than we thought. But for the most part, I think the way you size it up is about right.Daniel Stephen FreyYes. And David, it's Dan. I'll just -- you mentioned Fidelis. I mean we said at the beginning of the year that Fidelis was not going to be big enough to have a meaningful impact on the underlying combined ratio, and that's still the case, including Q2.Alan David SchnitzerBut I think you got it right, David.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis of Autonomous Research.Ryan James TunisSo yes, Alan, I hear you that you got $15 billion of reserves, sometimes they go up, sometimes they go down. But I guess I'd say they don't usually go up by this much in a given quarter, especially when there's so much workers' comp reserve releases. And I mean there's also like a pretty sharp acceleration of pricing. So it does look from the outside, like, I don't know, maybe you guys are seeing something new or you've identified something from a trend perspective. I guess just anything in this review, what have you learned this year that I guess you might not have known a year ago.Alan David SchnitzerLet me start, Ryan and then I'll turn it over to Dan but we're squaring triangles and we're doing -- we're applying actuarial analytics to a series of triangles in historical losses and that's really how we're coming up with this. I mean the overwhelming thing that all of us are looking at is higher levels of economic inflation. And so that is no doubt a contributor here.Daniel Stephen FreyYes, Ryan, the only thing I think I'd add to Alan's comments, which I agree with, we've said, as people have asked over the last several quarters and pricing has continued to be strong for quite a while now, is that sustainable? And here you see it ticking up. And I think we just keep going through the litany of pricing is going to be a reaction to what's your return target and what's happening in the loss environment. So we talk about continued increased frequency and severity of weather losses and you see that certainly this quarter. Headline inflation, social inflation that we said never went away and an uncertain overall macro environment. And so those things continue to factor into our pricing. Those things also get evaluated every quarter and every year in terms of our view of loss trend in prior year reserve development.So what you're seeing here again across the place, net favorable prior year reserve development, I get the focus on the liability lines. So -- but really, what you're seeing there is a degree of difference as opposed to some surprise. We've been talking about inflation for a long time, and we were the first people to be talking about social inflation and never thought that one anywhere. So directionally, it's not a surprise. It's just an adjustment to the order of magnitude.Ryan James TunisGot it. And then for Michael and maybe, Greg, I guess on the cat front, I mean you guys were highlighting frequency of events, but it seems like to me that severity must be at least as big of a contributor. Maybe, I guess, talk about -- yes, in other words, I don't think I would have ever expected $1 billion of personal lines (inaudible) with 6 PCS events. So from a severity perspective, like how -- what's weighing on is here? Is it like the size of the hail, in other words, like the nature of the weather? Or how much of it is elevated repair cost, demand surge like that type of thing?Michael Frederick KleinSure, Ryan, it's Michael. Yes, all of that. So I think your point is a good one. So if you look at the quarter, I think the number of events, PCS-designated events was 19, that is above the long-term average. So there's a frequency of events that's higher. And that's a relatively high number for Q2. But actually, the majority of it really is severity.Now some of that severity, to your point, is the underlying weather activity itself. I think on average, the events in this second quarter impacted about 8 states a piece as opposed to 6 states a piece. So they were a little broader and more all-encompassing than again, historical averages. So you've got the number of events and then the size and magnitude.There certainly are -- there's anecdotal evidence of more severe larger hail, those types of things. But the other item that you mentioned, it really is as big, if not a bigger factor than sort of the frequency and the magnitude of the events, and that's just insured values and cost to repair and the severity pressures that we've been talking about across both auto and property and frankly, any first-party coverage is that, that we offer as an organization, really exacerbating that.So I think it's all of those things, but it's at least as much a severity issue and at least as much driven by economic inflation as it is the weather activity itself.Gregory Cheshire ToczydlowskiAnd Ryan, from a Business Insurance or a commercial point of view, we weren't immune from some of the same dynamics that Michael just articulated. I think we just have a broader array of products that you get a little more diversification when you add the workers' comp to GL and all the other products on top of that.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Alex Scott of Goldman Sachs.Taylor Alexander ScottFirst one I had for you is on the Business Insurance underlying loss ratio improvement. I was hoping you could help us unpack it a little in terms of workers' comp versus maybe the other products, certainly, the reserve development is sort of a good indication about healthy things there are on workers' comp, but pricing is down. I mean is that a business line that's helping the underlying improvement year-over-year? Or is it detracting from it? Could you kind of dimension that and help us think through some of the underlying drivers?Daniel Stephen FreyYes, Alex, it's Dan. We're really -- we don't do profitability by line. We're not going to go into that level of detail. You call out comp, it has been a good line for us. It continues to be a good line for us. But really, the way to think about BI is the blend of the products, and that's the level at which we'll talk about the underlying.Taylor Alexander ScottOkay. The second question I had is on pricing. There was, I'd say, more re-acceleration in your pricing than we're hearing from, I guess, Marsh earlier today in some of the barometers that are out there and so forth. Anything that's unique around the way you're approaching the market there and could you help dimension at all how much of that re-acceleration of pricing is necessary for the reinsurance costs you mentioned. It sounds like maybe loss cost trend hasn't moved that much. But help us think a little bit about how much of that can help you tread water versus allow more underlying improvement?Alan David SchnitzerI think we're going to try to stay away from forecasting margins. And I think it may have been David, who went to this question earlier and just said, renewal premium change is close to 13% and you're saying there's not a lot of movement in loss trend is -- should we take it on face value. I think broadly, the answer is yes. But really, I think what's going on here is there are some headwinds. There's -- reinsurance costs are higher, inflation is higher. We're in a tight labor market, there's weather and so on. So we're reacting to all those things. And on the other hand, after years of pretty good pricing, returns are in a pretty good place. And so hats off to our field organization, they are threading that needle incredibly well. And returns are -- were excellent. And we're pricing to continue to maintain and maybe even improve the returns.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo.Elyse Beth GreenspanMy first question, within BI, the underlying loss ratio improved. When we look at the quarter, right, the improvement year-over-year was about [300] basis points. And I know you guys said that there was 150 basis points from better property results. I think that was 1 point negative last year. So if we're looking year-over-year, is it right to say it was 2.5 points better on property and then the remainder, like 50 basis points is earned rate over trend? Or is there something else going on? And I know that's just kind of looking all in, but something else going on with the margins in the quarter?Daniel Stephen FreyYes, Elyse, it's Dan. So I think you're thinking about the property piece the right way. And then there's 50 basis points left over and Greg mentioned the continued benefit of earned pricing. That's not the only thing going on in there. As always, there are pluses and minuses. We're trying to call out the main drivers for you. And those are the 2 main drivers. If there was anything else of real significance, I think we do a pretty good job of trying to make sure we include that in the commentary.Elyse Beth GreenspanAnd then my second question, the RRC improved a good amount sequentially. It sounds like that was broad-based in property and liability lines. I know this is obviously a bigger quarter for property in terms of business mix. I just want to get a sense of -- just confirm that I'm thinking about that right, that it was more than just property that drove the improvement in the RRC. And how should we think about -- any color you could just give in terms of that RRC as we think about the Q3 and beyond?Alan David SchnitzerAre you talking about renewal price change, Elyse? Is that...Elyse Beth GreenspanWell, I was talking about the renewal rate, but -- renewal rate yes, in BI.Gregory Cheshire ToczydlowskiYes, Elyse, you're right. I mean clearly, we had a real strong quarter in terms of both rate and exposure in property, but we also had significant movement across the rest of the portfolio also, again, in both rate and exposure.Alan David SchnitzerI'd say, Elyse, if you're asking whether it was broad-based or narrow, I think the answer to that, it was broad-based.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith of UBS.Brian Robert MeredithA couple here. First for Jeff, I know you talked about the surety losses just being a couple and they can be lumpy. But are we seeing any signs of maybe some pressures in that line from a loss cost perspective, given what's going on with commercial real estate and other things that are happening right now?Jeffrey Peter KlenkBrian, it's Jeff. Thanks. I would say that we're watching inflation in materials and labor costs relative to construction. But honestly, really, I think the prepared remarks really summed it up for you, right? We had a couple of losses that drove the underlying loss ratio change. And ultimately, this can be a lumpy line, and we feel really good about our market-leading surety book.Brian Robert MeredithThe higher interest rates matter also? I mean when you get a big cut -- big jump in financing costs, right, first for contractors and stuff?Jeffrey Peter KlenkSure. The credit availability for our contractors is absolutely an issue. We take that into account with our high credit quality book of business, the way we underwrite this book. We've got a high-quality book of contractors that we focus on there. And so your point is well taken. It's a part of the underwriting process. That's where I'd leave it. Thanks for the question.Brian Robert MeredithAnd then, Michael, I'm just curious, can you talk a little bit about kind of the regulatory environment right now in personal lines. Obviously, some states are getting a little more kind of an even rate, but are we seeing any pushback kind of starting to emerge from certain states as far as the level of rate going through?Michael Frederick KleinYes, Brian. Thanks for the question. And I think it's an astute observation. As we talk about pretty consistently, we feel pretty good about our relationships with the departments of insurance, we really endeavor to make sure they have all the information necessary to evaluate and improve our rate increase requests. And starting with us, we continue to file for increases that align with our most recent experience and our indicated rate needs. That said, and we're seeing and you're seeing in the headlines, some news about increased scrutiny and/or states considering or proposing changes to the way that they regulate pricing in response to the continued parade of increases necessary to keep up with loss costs and so I'd say on the margins, there's a couple of places where it's getting a little more challenging. But broadly speaking, we have still been able to file and get approved the rate we think we need in response to increased costs.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker of Bank of America.Joshua David ShankerAlan, you began the conference call with a preempt on artificial intelligence and analytics. It's been an unusual 3 years in terms of interpreting loss cost trends with the courts being opened and closed during COVID and very wildly changing conditions under loss trend. Is the data quality that you are looking at right now, any less reliable in your mind than you think it normally is? Are we in a state where extra caution needs to be placed on being comfortable with those numbers that you're using for reserving practices?Alan David SchnitzerI would say the answer to that, Josh, is yes. And I think we've said pretty consistently over the last few years that we have been cautious in reflecting that level of uncertainty into the way we think about loss cost and reserves. So I think the answer is yes, and we've been doing exactly that.Joshua David ShankerAnd I mean, look we're all just throwing shells from the cheap seats a little bit. Can you talk a little bit about some of that -- how you get more conservative or how you -- in a time of uncertainty, how you get better or what you're doing in order to offset the risks associated around with bad data and whatnot?Alan David SchnitzerYes. It's probably a longer conversation, Josh, we can follow up, but let me just give you one example, and I think we've said this over the last couple of years, if you were just looking at the data, you might have assumed that some aspects of loss trend had improved over the last couple of years and whether that's true in Personal Insurance and you see the lack of negative PYD in personal auto, for example. Or if you look at social inflation, we said as the courts were closed, that data could have been misinterpreted to mean things were getting better. You look at that data and you say, ""I don't believe it."" And we understand that it's distorted and that there are other things that could be impacting it. And so we're going to do the best we can to try to understand where the uncertainty is coming from and to make sure that we're reflecting our view of uncertainty as we're thinking about either our prior year reserves or managing our current loss pace.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields of KBW.Meyer ShieldsI want to start with a question on personal lines. Michael mentioned that the deceleration in claim cost inflation wasn't as strong as anticipated. And I was hoping you could give us some color on what I guess, the indicators that you've previously used, what they're suggesting for personal loss cost inflation for the back half of the year?Michael Frederick KleinSure, Meyer. I don't know that, that the external indicators that we look at are significantly different than the ones you look at or do have available. What I can say is auto severity has sort of remained stubbornly in the low double digits, and we had not anticipated that it would remain in double-digit territory for this long.I think the other thing I commented on in my prepared remarks was that we are seeing some signs of easing. The predominant thing I'm talking about there is the Manheim wholesale index. And again, an update just came out this week on that. And I believe Manheim's estimate now is that used car prices will end 2023 below 2022 levels. But importantly, that's just one element of our loss costs, right? So wholesale car prices impact, retail car prices, which impact our total loss settlement values, which is a portion of our loss costs. I think one of the reasons you continue to see double-digit pressure on severity is continued elevation in repair costs, labor materials, et cetera.And then again, we've talked about just broad-based severity pressure. I think what we are seeing is some of the potential good news that we're starting to see in the physical damage coverages is being offset a little bit by this shift in mix to more claims with bodily injury and property damage. And so on a mix -- that mix impact impacts those loss costs as well. But again, the short answer is we're still seeing low double-digit trends in auto severity, and we hadn't anticipated that they would last this long.Meyer ShieldsOkay. Perfect. That's helpful. A broader question, when we look at, I guess, whether it's possibly changing weather patterns or the mix shift within BI slightly towards property or just inflation pushing more weather losses above the cat threshold. How do you think about sort of the magnitude of coming years, catastrophe load compared to where you've been recently.Alan David SchnitzerI'm not sure we're quite ready to talk about that or to certainly give an outlook for that. Obviously, as we start to put our views together for 2024 and beyond, we'll think about the experience that we've had this year and in recent years and other factors, whether that's changes in exposure in our book or other things, and we'll come up with a view that we hope will be sort of thoughtful and appropriate.OperatorWe have time for one more question. Your next question comes from the line of Tracy Benguigui of Barclays.Tracy Dolin-BenguiguiMy focus these days is on latent liabilities and I appreciate your legal perspective given your background, Alan, and I'm not sure if A.J. is on the call or not. The last quarter, you indulged me by talking about this. And this quarter, I'm wondering if you can indulge me again and talk about PFAS. Sorry, in advance my question is quite meaty. Is PFAS a chemical explicitly excluded from GL like included in a pollution exclusion? And for pre-1986 exposure, does the statute of limitations apply?Alan David SchnitzerTracy, it's hard to answer a question like that without a claim and a policy. So I'm going to avoid that. And we're happy to take this offline with you and talk a little bit more about it if we can do that consistent with Reg FD.About PFAS, what I would say about that is this issue has now been around for a while. What we know about it is reflected in our reserves. And I'm not sure there's a lot more to say about it at this point.Tracy Dolin-BenguiguiOkay. So you said reflecting reserves. So the adverse development you took in the quarter didn't reflect an update to PFAS.Daniel Stephen FreyDidn't say that, Tracy, but we're not going to really go into the drivers. We gave you the big drivers of PYD. We're not going to go into specific coverage issues in PYD.OperatorThere are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein.Abbe F. GoldsteinThank you very much. We appreciate everyone's time. And as always, if there's any follow-up, please feel free to reach out directly. Thank you.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.]"

Be it electric vehicles, energy transition metals, or the green hydrogen economy. With the markets in a recovery mode after a deep correction in 2022, it’s a good time to accumulate energy transition stocks. This column focuses on hydrogen stocks that are poised for multi-bagger returns in the coming years.To put things into perspective, the global demand for hydrogen was 87 million metric tonnes globally in 2020. Demand is expected to increase to 212 million metric tonnes by 2030 and further to 528 million metric tonnes by 2050. Another estimate indicates that demand is likely to grow to 660 million metric tonnes by 2050. This growth estimate backs the case for sustained growth in some of the best hydrogen companies.Given the bullish outlook, let’s discuss three millionaire-maker hydrogen stocks to buy and hold.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAir Products and Chemicals (APD)An image of hydrogen fuel silos standing against a blue skySource: Audio und werbung / ShutterstockAir Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD) is my top pick among hydrogen stocks. The reason is that APD is a blue-chip stock that trades at an attractive valuation. Further, a dividend yield of 2.38% is healthy.Being a blue-chip, Air Products has a strong balance sheet. While there are several emerging hydrogen stocks, Air Products has the highest financial flexibility. This will allow the company to make aggressive investments in the coming years. To put things into perspective, Air Products reported an investible cash flow of $1.7 billion in the last 12 months.If we look at specific investments, Air Products and AES will be building the largest green hydrogen facility in North Texas. The cost of the project is estimated at $4 billion.Separately, the company will be investing $4.5 billion in the world’s largest blue hydrogen production facility in Louisiana. A NEOM green hydrogen complex is also being built in Saudi Arabia. With a strong investment pipeline, the growth outlook is robust and I expect APD stock to trend higher.Story continuesPlug Power (PLUG)An image of a hydrogen fuel pipeline running through a grassy field, with wind turbines and solar panels in the background. top hydrogen stocks to buySource: petrmalinak / ShutterstockIn the last 12 months, Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) stock has declined by 38%. It however seems that the correction is overdone and PLUG stock is poised for a strong reversal rally.An important point to note is that Plug Power is still at an early growth stage. For Q1 2023, the company reported revenue of $210.3 million, which was higher by 49% on a year-on-year basis. By 2026, the company expects $5 billion in annual sales.Furthermore, sales will swell to $20 billion by 2030 with a gross margin of 35%. Purely based on the total addressable market, the target seems achievable.It’s also worth noting that the company has guided for a 10% gross margin for 2023. Therefore, significant margin expansion is on the cards. If this ambitious target is achieved, PLUG stock is positioned for multi-bagger returns.Bloom Energy (BE)An image of a hydrogen fueling station with a truck parked in the backgroundSource: ShutterstockBloom Energy (NYSE:BE) stock has been sideways for the last 12 months. A big breakout on the upside seems imminent backed by positive business developments. Recently, RBC assigned an “outperform” rating for Bloom with a price target of $24. This would imply an upside potential of 36.4% from current levels.As an overview, the company’s solid oxide hydrogen fuel cell technology can be used for accelerating the production and usage of hydrogen. Like Plug Power, the company is in an early growth stage with 2023 revenue likely at $1.45 billion. However, the company expects 2031 revenue to be in the range of $15 to $20 billion.Another important point to note is that the solid oxide fuel cell has been deployed in applications across healthcare, manufacturing, retail, and data centers, among others. The global addressable market is to the tune of $2 trillion by 2030. The overall outlook is therefore bullish.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

DonahueThank you, Sid, and good morning. Welcome to our second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. We are pleased to report another solid quarter with record sales and double-digit adjusted earnings growth. Our second quarter once again highlights the value and benefit of our global automotive and industrial businesses and the mix and geographic diversity of our company which we believe are competitive advantages that differentiate GPC in the marketplace.A few highlights from our second quarter results include: Total sales of $5.9 billion, an increase of 5.6% from the prior year. Total company segment margin of 10.4% and an increase of 60 basis points from the same quarter last year. Earnings per share of $2.44, an increase of 10.9% from adjusted earnings per share last year, and our 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted earnings growth. And finally, we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet while generating solid cash flow to support our growth initiatives and capital allocation priorities.Our global team remains focused on the strategic initiatives we highlighted at our Investor Day in March. And we believe our One GPC approach is contributing to our strong financial performance. We compete in 2 very large and fragmented markets and see significant opportunities to grow our business, expand our margin profile and generate strong cash flow to support our strategic investments while delivering returns to our shareholders. As we continue to navigate a dynamic macro environment, we believe our focused execution, investments in our business and strong industry fundamentals, position GPC for long-term success.Looking at our Industrial segment, demand trends held solid through the second quarter, even as the rate of sales growth tempered a bit relative to the first quarter as we expected. Motion's growth rate on a 2-year basis continues to be exceptional. And while certain economic indicators have slowed, we believe our strong market share position, along with the diversity of our products, services and end markets bode well for our continued growth prospects.In addition, future reshoring opportunities and the growth of domestic manufacturing industries provide significant opportunity for Motion. And as you will hear from Will, our team's focus on productivity and efficiency is driving significant margin expansion in the Industrial segment.Our global automotive business continues to benefit from the broad geographic diversity of our markets. In addition, we believe our long history of supporting the DIFM customer segment which is 80% of our global automotive sales, positions us well as sales growth to DIFM customers continues to outpace DIY sales growth.During the second quarter, our international Automotive businesses delivered strong mid-single to double-digit growth, while our U.S. automotive business experienced low single-digit growth.The fundamentals of the automotive aftermarket remain favorable with trends such as increasing miles driven and aging and complex vehicle fleet, rising interest rates, and continued high prices for vehicles, all contributing to underlying demand.While the near-term environment remains dynamic, we are very pleased with our year-to-date performance. And with the strong earnings growth in the second quarter, we are once again raising our outlook for 2023 earnings per share, which Bert will discuss further.As we look forward, we remain confident in our strategic plans, and we'll continue to invest to strengthen our business and achieve both our near- and long-term financial targets while returning capital to shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases.So in closing, I'd be remiss if I didn't highlight the outstanding work of our HR and IT teams in Q2 around our implementation of Workday. In early July, we completed the first phase of our implementation of the Workday HR platform in North America. Continuing to demonstrate the modernization of our system platforms and supporting our teams with the right tools and the right technology. Our HR and IT teams delivered an exceptional outcome, well ahead of schedule, showcasing the benefits of our One GPC talent and technology initiatives. So before I turn it over to Will, we want to thank each of our 58,000 GPC teammates for their hard work and continued dedication to serving our customers around the world. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Will.William P. StengelThank you, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I'd also like to thank the global GPC team as well as our supplier partners for their ongoing commitment to serving our customers. We appreciate all the hard work to take care of our customers every day with solutions that help keep the world moving. We do this with focus on our foundational priorities, including talent and culture, sales effectiveness, technology, supply chain and emerging technology, all complemented by a disciplined M&amp;A strategy. We work together as One GPC team to create customer success and shareholder value.On behalf of the entire GPC team, we would like to congratulate Kevin Herron on his well-deserved retirement after an amazing 34-year career at the company. Kevin earned success in all of his roles over the years, including the last 5 years as President of the U.S. Automotive business. He embodies our GPC values and he's been an inspirational leader and mentor to many around the world. We're deeply grateful for his significant contributions to Genuine Parts Company and wish him the very best in his retirement.With Kevin's retirement, we also want to congratulate Randy Breaux on his promotion to Group President, GPC North America effective July 1st. In the new role, Randy will oversee both the automotive and industrial businesses across North America, while assuming day-to-day responsibility as President of the U.S. Automotive Group. Randy is a proven leader with a track record of performance. His relevant expertise across distribution industries, familiarity with GPC teammates and stakeholders and success at Motion make him the ideal candidate for the role. This transition represents the depth of our leadership team and our talent strategies as we continue to leverage the power of One GPC.Now turning to our 2 business segments. Total sales for Global Industrial were $2.3 billion, an increase of $125 million or 5.9%. Comparable sales growth increased 6.0% in the second quarter versus last year. The cadence through the quarter was relatively consistent with April being the strongest month followed by mid-single-digit growth in both May and June. The sales growth at Motion was broad-based again in the second quarter, with all product categories and major industries served posting positive gains from the prior year.During the quarter, we saw strength from industries such as food products, iron and steel, chemicals, mining and oil and gas. In addition, Motion continues to make excellent progress with its initiatives including inside and outside sales, pricing, e-commerce, growth-focused tech and supply chain strategies, they're all helping to win profitable market share. As an example, Motion has seen a nearly twofold increase in average daily sales across its e-commerce platform since 2021, which now represent nearly 30% of total Motion daily sales.In Asia Pac, our Motion business also delivered strong performance in the second quarter with double-digit sales and profit growth. Customer-centric initiatives across talent and culture, inventory availability and operational excellence are delivering positive results.Industrial segment profit in the second quarter was $283 million or 12.5% of sales, representing a 190 basis point increase from the same period last year. The profit improvement in Industrial was driven by excellent operating rigor in both North America and Australasia and the disciplined execution of strategic initiatives. In addition, the Motion North America team continues to realize synergies related to the KDG acquisition. The team is substantially complete with the branch consolidation and merger efforts well ahead of initial plans. And we expect to exceed our 3-year $50 million synergy commitment by the end of this year, also well ahead of initial plans.Turning to Global Automotive. Total sales in the second quarter were $3.7 billion, an increase of $188 million or 5.4% versus the same period in 2022. Similar to the first quarter, total automotive sales benefited from our global diversification as our businesses outside the U.S. posted mid-single-digit to double-digit growth in local currency. On a comparable basis, global automotive sales increased 4.3%, ranging from low single-digit growth in the U.S. to low double-digit growth in Europe. We saw global automotive sales inflation moderate from high single-digit growth in the first quarter to low to mid-single-digit growth in the second quarter. We remain encouraged by favorable fundamentals and solid team execution, which we believe will continue to drive profitable growth.Global Automotive segment profit in the second quarter was $329 million, up 2.1% versus the same period in 2022. And segment operating margin was 9.0% compared to 9.3% in 2022. As expected, Automotive's margin showed an improvement versus the first quarter. The improvement in the second quarter reflects the impact of the cost actions implemented at U.S. Automotive, and we expect to see an increased benefit of these actions in the second half of the year. Now let's turn to an overview of our automotive business performance by geography. In the U.S., automotive sales grew approximately 2% with comparable sales growth up 1% for the second quarter. April and May were the stronger months while trends lagged in June, particularly as we headed into the July 4th holiday weekend. That said, we're encouraged by the early trends thus far in July. Growth was relatively consistent across our regions with the East and West regions recovering in the second quarter after the slow start to the year due to the impact from weather. More broadly, we offset sluggish categories in heating and cooling, exhaust and ride control with strength in various core categories such as filters, batteries and fluids, all of which had growth above the U.S. average. Sales to both commercial and retail customers were positive with commercial growth outpacing retail. Our commercial business saw sales increases across most customer segments with fleet and government outperforming again this quarter with high single-digit growth.In Canada, sales grew approximately 6% in local currency during the second quarter with comparable sales growth of approximately 6%. Our Canadian performance reflects strong growth in several categories like heating and cooling, paint and body and tools and equipment, all of which were up double digits. Our automotive and heavy-duty businesses performed well, both posting mid-single-digit growth in the second quarter. Our Canadian team executed well in the quarter, especially given the destructive wildfires across the country and we continue to see attractive opportunities for long-term growth due to our leading market position, solid industry fundamentals and share gain initiatives. In Europe, our automotive team delivered another exceptional quarter with total sales growth of approximately 15% in local currency and comparable sales growth of approximately 11%. We continue to drive strong growth and market share gains across our European markets due to the ongoing execution of our key initiatives. For the second quarter, we delivered mid-single-digit to double-digit growth across each of our geographies. As our teams continue to win business with key accounts, drive higher share of wallet with existing accounts and expand the NAPA brand in the region.The team is on track to deliver EUR 400 million in sales of NAPA-branded products in 2023. In addition, we continue to strategically roll out our next Drive offering across our European markets that position our team to lead the industry in the growing EV aftermarket. Recent bolt-on acquisitions in Europe are tracking ahead of growth and synergy plans as we leverage our scale, integrate with discipline and expand margins. For example, comparable growth in our Iberian markets was approximately 25% during the second quarter, significantly ahead of our initial expectations. In the Asia Pac automotive business, sales in the second quarter increased approximately 9% in local currency with comparable sales growth of approximately 7%. Both commercial and retail sales performed well with retail outpacing commercial in the second quarter. The team continues to strategically invest in the business to extend its customer value proposition. For example, the recent opening of distribution centers in Auckland, New Zealand and Melbourne, Australia will drive long-term profitable growth and productivity. We complement organic growth with strategic acquisitions to capture share in our fragmented markets and create shareholder value. We completed several bolt-on acquisitions primarily consisting of small automotive store groups that increased local market density in existing geographies. Our acquisition pipeline remains active, and we will remain disciplined to pursue transactions that extend our leadership positions and create long-term value. In closing, the global GPC team delivered strong second quarter results, and we remain confident in our plans for continued growth through the balance of the year despite a dynamic environment. Our company is benefiting from our strategic business mix and global geographic diversification. Our teams remain focused to execute our strategic initiatives that deliver customer solutions and create value. We're committed to investments in our people, customer solutions, technology, supply chain and emerging technology that will continue to enhance our capabilities and leadership positions. Thank you again to the entire GPC team for the hard work and excellent performance. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bert.Herbert C. NappierThank you, Will, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Our teams continue to operate at a high level and perform through this dynamic environment. And I'm pleased to walk you through the highlights of our second quarter performance. Before I get started on the details of our results, I would like to note that we had no nonrecurring items in the second quarter and 6 months of 2023. Our comparisons to the prior year, however, excludes certain nonrecurring items in 2022, primarily related to the sale of S.P. Richards Real Estate and the integration of KDG which represented a net $59 million benefit or $0.42 per diluted share. GPC revenues increased 5.6% or $313 million to $5.9 billion in the second quarter of 2023. This reflects a 4.9% improvement in comparable sales, including low single-digit to mid-single-digit levels in inflation and a 1.8% contribution from acquisitions. These items were partially offset by a 0.9% unfavorable impact of foreign currency. The value and advantage of our balanced portfolio and global diversification was highlighted again as we delivered another quarterly sales record.Our gross margin was 36.1%, a 110 basis point improvement from the second quarter last year, driven by the ongoing favorable impact of our pricing and sourcing initiatives. We believe the execution of key strategic initiatives around gross margin will continue to drive strong results. And for the full year, we now expect our gross margin rate to improve 30 to 50 basis points from 2022, an increase from our prior estimate of 20 to 40 basis points of improvement year-over-year.Our total operating and nonoperating expenses in the second quarter were $1.7 billion, up 9% from adjusted expenses in 2022 and at 28.4% of sales. This compares to total adjusted expenses of 27.6% of sales in the second quarter last year or approximately 80 basis points of deleverage year-over-year. The deleverage in SG&amp;A in the second quarter is primarily attributable to a few key factors, 2 of which were planned, our investments in wages and benefits for our teams and increased spending in technology.Our investments in the IT and digital initiatives we showcased at Investor Day, impacted SG&amp;A by 20 basis points in the second quarter. In addition, planned investments in wages and benefits for our team members impacted SG&amp;A by 30 basis points, much of this as a feat of inflationary pressure on wages. Finally, during the quarter, we recorded charges related to cost improvement actions at our U.S. automotive business and a true-up of stock compensation expense for retirement-eligible employees totaling 30 basis points, both of which we would not expect to repeat in the future.For the full year, we continue to expect SG&amp;A deleverage of 30 to 40 basis points, driven by investments in our team members and IT. Our second quarter growth and gross margin improvement drove total segment profit of $613 million, up 11.8%. Segment profit margin was 10.4%, a 60 basis point increase from last year and our sixth consecutive quarter of margin expansion. While we delivered strong overall margin expansion, margins in our Global Automotive segment were lower in Q2 due to pressure in our U.S. Automotive business. As we discussed in the first quarter, following the slow start to the year, we anticipated that the profitability of this business would remain challenged in the second quarter, and it did. However, our teams are making great progress as evidenced by the acceleration in the rate of gross margin expansion from the first quarter to the second quarter and the sequential improvement in segment margins.As Will mentioned earlier, we are executing cost improvement actions to address the elevated levels of operating costs in this business and to continue to improve profitability. We expect these actions, combined with our ongoing discipline on costs across the remainder of the business, and execution of our broad base of strategic initiatives to drive further improvement in operational efficiencies and productivity for GPC. Our second quarter net income was $344 million or $2.44 per diluted share. This compares to adjusted net income of $313 million or $2.20 per diluted share in 2022, an increase of 10.9%. This represents our 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted earnings growth and is a true testament to our team's hard work and continued focus to drive our profitability.Turning to our cash flows. We generated $457 million in cash from operations for the first 6 months of 2023. Recall that our cash flow in 2022 included a sale of $200 million in receivables under our AR sales agreement. For the first 6 months of 2023, free cash flow was $252 million, and we closed the second quarter with $2 billion in available liquidity. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA is 1.6x, which compares to our targeted range of 2 to 2.5x.We remain well positioned with the financial strength and flexibility to take advantage of future growth opportunities across GPC. Our key priorities for capital allocation remain unchanged. And includes investment in our business through capital expenditures and M&amp;A and the return of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.During 2023, we have invested $205 million in capital expenditures, including $117 million in the second quarter. These investments continue to support the initiatives we believe will drive growth and the modernization of our business moving forward. Acquisitions remain a key element of our growth strategy, and we invested $106 million year-to-date for acquisitions, and we continue to generate a robust pipeline of acquisition targets for our businesses.Thus far in 2023, we have also returned $395 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. This includes $260 million in cash dividends paid to our shareholders and $135 million in cash used to repurchase 841,000 shares. As we enter the second half of 2023, we are well positioned to effectively deploy our capital through all business cycles.Turning to our outlook for 2023. We are updating our full year guidance previously provided in our earnings release on April 20th. We are raising our guidance for diluted earnings per share to a range of $9.15 and to $9.30, an increase of approximately 10% to 11.5% from 2022. This represents a $0.20 increase from our previous guidance of $8.95 to $9.10.Our sales guidance is unchanged, and we continue to expect total sales growth for 2023 to be in the range of 4% to 6%. By business segment, we are guiding to the following: 4% to 6% total sales growth for the Automotive segment with comparable sales growth also in the 4% to 6% range. For the Industrial segment, we are expecting total sales growth of 4% to 6%, also with 4% to 6% comparable sales increase, and we continue to expect sales growth to moderate in the second half of 2023 relative to the first half of the year.Turning to a few other items of interest. Our guidance includes cash from operations in a range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion and free cash flow in a range of $900 million to $1 billion. We continue to plan for CapEx of $375 million to $400 million for the full year, which includes incremental investments in technology and supply chain, among others.Overall, we are very pleased with our first half results. Through this dynamic environment, our teams have demonstrated their ability to be agile while staying focused on serving our customers around the world. Our updated outlook for 2023 earnings per share reflects the ongoing confidence in our teams and their ability to execute and drive solid results. We believe GPC is truly differentiated with our business mix, global footprint, our size and scale, the execution of initiatives and our talent, we have a unique value proposition.We look forward to reporting on our progress in our third quarter call in October. Thank you. And I will now turn it back to Paul for a few closing thoughts before we address your questions. Paul?Paul D. DonahueThank you, Bert. Before we get into Q&amp;A, we'd like to take a moment to acknowledge Sid Jones, who has announced his decision to retire from Genuine Parts Company after 33 years of service to the company. Sid has been leading our Investor Relations team since 2003 and today marks his 83rd quarterly earnings call at GPC in that role. We thank Sid his many contributions over the years and wish him and his family the very best in his retirement. Tim Walsh has been working closely with Sid and the team for over a year and will be named Head of Investor Relations on August 1st. We look forward to having Tim in his new role and now he will do an exceptional job for us. So with that, we are now ready for your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperatorWe will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Liz Suzuki of Bank of America.Elizabeth Lane SuzukiSid, you're going to be greatly missed. So we'll miss you a lot. Just a question on the U.S. automotive comp is plus 1%. You noted that globally, both DIY and -- for me were positive with DIFM outpacing DIY. Was that the case in the U.S. as well? You may have mentioned it and I missed it, I'm just not sure if you gave that detail for the U.S. in terms of DIY versus DIFM.William P. StengelWe did Liz, DIFM outperformed retail in the U.S. Automotive group for the quarter.Elizabeth Lane SuzukiOkay. Great. No, that's very helpful. And then just a question on the Industrial business. The margins have been really healthy there. I mean should we think about that 2Q operating margin is a decent run rate going forward? And is there any seasonality we should keep in mind that may have changed one way or another after the KDG acquisition?Herbert C. NappierLiz, it's Bert. I don't think you have on part to Q2 as the proxy for industrial for the full year. As you -- as we've commented, we see that industrial growth rate moderating here in the second half. Having said that, we still will get margin expansion for the full year on the Industrial segment. But we're thrilled with where the business performed in Q2 that 12.5% rate is a proxy for we can go long term as we shared at Investor Day, but we still have a lot of work to do to continue to grow that business and would use -- not use that as a proxy, but look to still see expansion of margin for the full year.OperatorThe next question comes from Chris Horvers of JPMorgan.Christopher Michael HorversChris Horvers from JPMorgan. Sid we will miss you very much, and congratulations on your retirement and all the best in your future endeavors. My first question is just following up on the U.S. -- the U.S. NAPA comp, I think you implied in April that you're maybe running about a 4 and you imply that June was down. So was June down sort of low to mid. And can you talk about what you're seeing that you're encouraged by in July and how you're thinking about U.S. NAPA comps in the back half?William P. StengelYes, Chris, happy to walk you through, and I'll maybe just kind of walk through some of the comments that we had in the prepared remarks. But so for U.S. automotive, April and May, as you noted were the stronger months in the quarter, low single-digit growth. The first half of June, in fact, was a solid start to the month, and we saw a tapering towards the end of the month that left June to be flattish, which puts together the 2 and then the 1 comp for the quarter, U.S. Automotive.We have seen an improvement to start the month in July. Obviously, we've had some extreme heat that is going to have a positive impact and -- while it's probably early to call the whole month, we're encouraged by the positive momentum plan to build on that through the quarter. As Liz just asked, we saw outperformance and do-it-for-me versus retail, both growing in positive directions. And we continue to be bullish about our fleet and government segment, which we mentioned in the prepared remarks, that grew nicely in the quarter. Good strength in filters, batteries and fluids, which are important categories for us. So we're excited about some of the things we're doing from a merchandising standpoint in those categories. And I think it wasn't a total surprise to us given the weather patterns in the second quarter that some of our heating and cooling categories didn't perform the way we expected them to, just given. It wasn't an overly warm second quarter in the aggregate for the U.S. market. But we're excited about what we're working on in the business. Obviously, we think we've got more potential than we showed in the quarter. We're excited about Randy's leadership now in place here for the first couple of weeks. He's been out in the field working with the teams. I think there's a lot of energy and positive momentum there.Gross margin, as Bert talked about, continues to be a great piece of execution, both on the pricing and sourcing side of the house. Also very proud of the team and their quick adjustments to all things cost. So they're operating with a lot of intensity and focus. And importantly, we're investing in the business for the long term. So making sure that we're balancing near-term actions with long-term potential. So in the aggregate, a lot to be proud about the team. We're going to continue the grind and push through the second half of the year, but proud of what we're working on.Paul D. DonahueAnd Chris, I would just tag on to that, that the fundamentals of the industry are still solid -- miles driven, going in the right direction as gas prices moderate a bit. New car sales being still a bit soft compared to historic numbers. And we're seeing the same across our international business as well. So as we reported our team in Europe had a phenomenal quarter, strong double-digit growth. Many of the fundamentals there, the same here across North America, rock solid. And our team in Asia Pac, Australia, New Zealand also had another really strong quarter. So fundamentals of automotive are still rock solid. And we certainly see improvement as we move forward through the back half of the year.Christopher Michael HorversSounds great. And then a follow-up question on the gross margin. I mean 36.1% is quite impressive. If you look back historically, the second quarter is a reasonable proxy for the year on gross margin. I know 1Q was a lot lower. But perhaps, was there anything unsustainable in the gross margin performance in the second quarter? And do you think over time, this is a level that is around 36% is sort of the destination? Or is it an area that perhaps you could even grow from?Herbert C. NappierChris, it's Bert. Look, I think we had a great quarter here. In the past couple of quarters, I've given you the offsets for gross margin. We had a clean number this time around. We had no offsets from some of the things we've talked about in the past, whether it's inflation or mix. So we're just thrilled with the work that the team is doing and so important in this environment when we've got all the different economic pressures out there. So we've got a great focus on sourcing and getting the right inventory in the right place at the right time. We also have great work happening on pricing across all of the business. And so that 110 basis point improvement for the quarter up to 36.1%, I think is a reflection of really, really hard work. We're going to continue to stay focused on gross margin expansion through those 2 prisms, through pricing and sourcing. I'm not going to call the bulges yet on where that number can ultimately end up. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're more bullish on where it can be for this year. We had originally been planning for 20 to 40 basis points of improvement, and we've got that to 30 to 50 basis points.Within that, again, benefit from the execution of our strategic initiatives. We do have a little bit of a benefit modeled in for ocean freight, which we see turning positive for us here in the second half. So those are the 2 things I'd call out with really no foreseen at this point impact from either FX or inflation or mix.OperatorThe next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli of Truist.Scot CiccarelliI have a follow-up on Christopher's question. So the slowdown you've experienced in U.S. auto, do you think there's any share shifts occurring given some of the strong results we've seen from a few of your competitors or would you really just point to weather as the headwind in 2Q?William P. StengelYes, Scot, we don't think there's any share shifts. We always study the analytics. We use third-party independent information. We look at it by category and feel good about where we are. We act on that data every week and every month. We review it as a team and feel good about where we are. So no, we don't think that there's share loss happening here. We have specific strategies by category that we're executing against. And so the story can be quite different at a category level, but that's part of the science and art of all things, category management. So really proud of what the teams are working on. And as I said, we use independent data to keep ourselves honest to make sure that we're winning in the marketplace.Scot CiccarelliOkay. So maybe some of the delta could be due to geographic differences potentially?William P. StengelWhen you say geographic, you mean U.S. geography differences?Scot CiccarelliWell, no. I mean, within the U.S., like your results, like if we had positive results from both DIY and commercial. And obviously, you had a 1% comp, like neither was up very strongly, right? So on -- specifically on the commercial side, like could we potentially attribute -- or did you potentially see like significant geographic differentiation in your business, stronger in the South, weaker in the West, what have you?William P. StengelWe really don't see a material difference across our regions. We've got 5 regions. The growth rates are not materially different. There's always region specific customers and dynamics. But as I said in my prepared remarks, we saw a recovery in the Northeast and West, which we planned and expected based on their slow start driven by weather, we saw that come to bear. And for the second quarter, though, by themselves, there's not a material difference by region.Scot CiccarelliGot it. And then just a quick housekeeping item. The $80 million or so that you guys highlighted for cost actions and the stock comp true-up. Were they the main drivers in the spike of corporate expense? And should we expect that line item to moderate in the back half?Herbert C. NappierScot, it's Bert. I'll take that one. Look, we did have an increase in the corporate expense as a result of the 2 items you noted, one on the stock comp true-up and the other on the cost actions. The other thing contributing to corporate, and this is a little obscured in the 10-Q, but if you take a chance to read through the 10-Q, you get some good color on that either from the first quarter or the one that will be filed later today. We transferred some functions at the beginning of this year into the corporate environment that we felt were better suited to be run on a more consolidated basis, one of them being cyber security and our work around cybersecurity globally. We did a little bit of that related to some of the finance functions and also our management of our product liability cases and litigation. When we did that, we actually got a benefit so far this year in terms of being ahead of where those items were being spent last year. But it did create a transfer left pocket, right pocket, which makes the corporate number look a little bit bigger.We're still guiding for the year of corporate expense in the $300 million to $325 million range. Longer term, we target for that to be about 1% of revenue. It's up this year because of those transfers and we'll look up for the full year. But like I said, we're already seeing the benefit of the move of centralization by streamlining those functions and seeing them operate at a lower cost rates than they had in the past.Scot CiccarelliOkay. But some of the margin expansion that we've seen at the segment level is because of that cost transfer, just to be clear.Herbert C. NappierYes, it's pretty small there, Scot. I mean we're talking about costs totaling year-to-date, $29 million in the aggregate. So it's a pretty small move. It stands out at corporate a little bit bigger because of the size and scale of the corporate expense line. But it's very negligible at the segment level.OperatorThe next question comes from Bret Jordan of Jefferies.Bret David JordanCongrats to Sid and Randy. Randy now that you run them both, I guess, where do you see the biggest opportunity industrial or auto in the U.S. in the next, say, 2, 3 years?William P. StengelBret, the good news is Randy is not on the call with us, but that's a tough question for him to answer. He loves both these businesses now. He's been out in the field and has a ton of energy and excited about the opportunities in front of us. So...Bret David JordanI was going to ask you what you like better, but I figure out you too.William P. StengelHe wouldn't have answered that question? He like them both.Paul D. DonahueWhich one is your favorite kids, you know, Bret?Bret David JordanThat's easy. Question on price, I guess. We were talking about sort of low mid-single-digit benefit from inflation in Q2. How do you see the second half cadence? The bar gets higher, I guess, year-over-year, but maybe you've got some incremental price passing along some of the rate inflation from your suppliers. How do we think about the organic price comp second half?Herbert C. NappierYes. Bret. I'll take that one, it's Bert. On inflation, I'll kind of start at a high level. As we expected, we saw inflation moderate again in Q2, and I think really falling in line with our original thinking as we started the year, monetary policy in the U.S. and around the world, I think it's having its desired effect. You can see that in the U.S. CPI data. Just to reiterate, for the quarter -- second quarter inflation with low single digits all up for GPC, mid-single digits in auto, and low single digits for industrial. That industrial number has stayed pretty consistently in that low single-digit range for the year. Auto ticked down from high single digit to mid-single digit. And then on the whole, GPC has ticked down from mid-single digit to low single digits.So really falling right in line with what we thought when we started out the year. We're seeing some inflationary pressure on operating expenses, particularly in wages, and that was in my prepared remarks. That's sitting in the mid-single-digit range right now. It's probably the most pronounced impact in the business, but we're managing it. We're doing all the right things and taking some actions to try to offset that. And I think that's not a GPC-specific comment, it's a comment that all businesses are facing with wage pressure and inflation and wages. As we look ahead, we think inflation will continue to moderate throughout 2023. And I think policy will continue to have its desired effect. Auto will tick down from high single digits to start the year to low single digits to close out the year. And industrial is going to bounce along that low single digits for the full year. We'll see GPC close out in the aggregate from a mid-single digit to a low single-digit. So it's not a one-size-fits-all for our business segments, but hopefully, that gives you a little color on how we're thinking about the rest of the year. And that's all factored into our guidance and our update to the guidance for the year.Bret David JordanOkay. And then one follow-up on another pricing question. I guess one of your auto peers reported pretty rough Q1 and talked about price competition in the market. I guess could you comment about what you see, I guess, from pure pricing, any cadence of change in pricing in year-to-date '23?Paul D. DonahueYes. I'll take a shot at that, Bret. And then maybe Will can tag on what perhaps more specific thought. Look, first and foremost, I'd say we're not going to speak to specific strategies of our competitors. We got a lot of respect for our peers and they're doing what they've got to do for their business. What I would tell you, the competitive landscape, the dynamics are still rational. We play in huge markets, as outlined by Will. We've got lots of different competitors across all those markets, both big and small. What we really spend our time thinking about, Bret, and you won't -- this is not new news. It's about inventory availability. Ensuring we've got the right people in the right markets, ensuring we've got our store footprint -- the right store footprint to cover all of our strategic markets and allowing us to continue to grow profitably.We're in a break-fix model and helping our customers really solve their problems quickly with the right part in the right market at the right price. It's all part of our value prop. That hasn't changed, Bret. And honestly, I don't see that changing anytime soon. Do we think about price? Sure, we do. But right now, our customers are really more focused on ensuring they can be productive in their shops. That they're taking care of their customers. And we think we're a pretty good partner not only here in North America, but around the world to solve those challenges for them. So Will, I don't know if there's anything else from a pricing environment that you would want to comment on?William P. StengelWell, I would just say, operationally, what the teams are working on is incredibly helpful in this environment as it has been for the last couple of years, hence, the investment and focus on it. And more importantly, the teams globally are learning from each other. And so I think in one of our previous calls, we've talked about all the great work that's happening in U.S. automotive. We're sharing that work over in Europe. And so these are some of the benefits of working together as a team and sharing all the learnings from an environment that's very similar around the world and gross margin performance in the total company. I think, is a good data point to suggest that we're having some success. So it's an important part of distribution business and it's especially important part of navigating this environment, and we're going to continue to get better at it and invest in it so that we can make the right decisions for our customers.OperatorThe next question comes from Greg Melich of Evercore ISI.Gregory Scott MelichI wanted to -- one question on the U.S. auto business and then follow-up on industrial guidance. I just want to understand a little bit better with that inflation number, I think we're still seeing mid-single digits. Would it be fair to say a 1 comp would translate into negative 4 units. And then could you give us a little more color on the non-fleet and government business, how the independent dealers did and how NAPA AutoCare did?William P. StengelYes, Greg. So I don't -- it's not as simple as minus 4% because we got to do it for me in retail. So you've got a distinction on transactions there. So do it for me, positive transaction and price, do it yourself as expected, transactions down tick it up. So in the aggregate, that's a little bit more noisy than just the minus 4%.On the other parts of the business, the AutoCare business continues to perform well. Obviously, our value prop with that segment is incredibly important and it's a challenging time. So partnering with them to make sure that they're being productive and navigating the environment. So that was a part of the business that performed to our expectations. Major accounts is a very customer-specific book of business. So there are some pockets of strength in that book of business as well as some areas of opportunity. I would reinforce our philosophy here that it's really important that we think about partners and growing our business through the medium term in a profitable way. And so I think we're going to bring a lot of discipline and rigor to thinking about the trade-offs between profitable share and not in our major account business. So in the aggregate, a bit of a mixed story, but positive in total.Gregory Scott MelichDid the company stores do materially different than the jobbers?William P. StengelWe didn't see a material difference in the performance. It was pretty close to each other. And...Gregory Scott MelichYes, okay. Just maybe DIY, do-it-for-me mix a little bit, but no difference in that cut. The -- I guess the follow-up is on industrial. I just want to make sure I got that right. I mean, with obviously the big numbers continue to come through it. But the margin, the 12.5% margin, I just want to make sure I'm not -- do we assume that industrial margins will actually be down in the back half or that was -- they'll still be up for the year? Was that -- interpret that wrong, Bert?Herbert C. NappierYes. Actually, you did interpret it wrong. But let me back it up and maybe pull it up and give a little color on guidance in general, and I'll work my way back down to segment margins. As you can expect, we're pleased with the first half performance on an overall basis, allowed us to raise our outlook again for the year this time by $0.20 to the $9.15 to $9.30. And in doing that, we see some upside in industrial profitability versus our previous expectations, the international automotive business, which is about 50% of the segment revenue for global automotive, we see some upside. And then obviously, we've taken up our gross margin performance expectations. That guidance delivers EPS growth with a midpoint of 10.6%, and that's putting us in a position to expect our third consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth, which in this environment, is, we think, pretty impressive.On a growth basis, top line, we had exceptional '21 and '22. We still see strong growth but moderated growth to mid-single digits overall for this year. And that really, as we look at a pretty choppy macro environment and difficult to interpret [Tea Leaves] we're keeping an eye on some of these things that are out there, whether it's inflation, monetary policy, interest rates, the political landscape globally and foreign currency. So we're keeping a close eye on all of that. We balance that against confidence in our own business. Paul talked about strong industry fundamentals. We've got some great cash flows that allow us to invest in our business. And taking that all together, while it's a little bit more cautious, we do have a lot of confidence in GPC. A few details just to remember, again, gross margin, we've ticked up to 30 to 50 basis point increase expectation versus our original 20 to 40 basis points. On segment margins, we're looking for those to be up for the full year, 20 to 40 basis points. That's expansion again. We do think industrial will be up for the year. So just to clarify, Industrial will be up for the year, but not using the 12.5% for Q2 of the proxy. Industrial segment margin will outpace automotive, but we believe automotive will be in a position to recover here in the second half, as Will outlined.The only point I would call out on just a headwind is SG&amp;A. We will see deleverage as we expected for the year 30 to 40 basis points, which is consistent with our original expectations. So all that together allowed us to take our guidance up for the year slightly better on international auto, industrial profit conversion and better gross margin expectations.Gregory Scott MelichGot it. Thanks for piecing that together. And I guess I will say said, thanks for everything, and I didn't realize 83 quarters you must have started in college. So...Sidney G. JonesAll right, I lead them up too easy.OperatorThe next question comes from Daniel Imbro of Stephen Bank.Daniel Robert ImbroSid, I'll add my congratulations to the group. Well deserved -- working together.Well, I want to start on the U.S. auto side, maybe taking a step back from the quarter, just more strategically, obviously, with the promotion of Randy to the new responsibility, can you talk about what's the strategy is there, maybe bringing Motion and auto under singular leadership rather than kind of running separately. Is that a reflection of running the businesses closer together? Is that just a personnel decision? Can you talk to me about how you view that? And you mentioned some early positive internal response. Can you share any more color on what that's been.William P. StengelYes. Thanks for the question. Look, I think, as I said in my prepared remarks, Randy is a proven leader. He is well understood by our organization and brings a lot of relevant expertise to the NAPA business. As we've talked about often, at the end of the day, these are distribution businesses. And while -- they obviously have a different customer and product catalog. The value creation initiatives are all the same. And so Randy's progress and momentum and building a great team there at Motion that is incredibly deep, I think, it's all relevant and has spoken for itself in terms of the performance. And so I think it's more about how do we quickly build on the momentum of the business. And I think Randy brings is a great opportunity to do that. So I don't think it's operationally, meaning that we're putting the 2 business. In fact, I know it's not. We're not putting the businesses together, but I think it's just going to allow us to be a little bit more efficient and at pace to work together as kind of a One GPC team, which is a philosophy that we've been talking about as an organization. And I think an advantage that we have, given the similarities of all the initiatives that we're doing around the world to go at pace and drive impact faster than perhaps if we were not together as a company.Paul D. DonahueDaniel, I would just add to Will's comments, Randy has done a phenomenal job at Motion as you've seen in the numbers, and we expect that to continue because we've got a great leadership team at Motion. And as you know, every business, it's much bigger than one person. I would say the same by U.S. automotive, Daniel. And I'm glad you asked the question because it gives me the opportunity to recognize that team. Kevin did a great job over the last few years of really bringing in a lot of new talent into the leadership group at U.S. Automotive. That team, I have 100% confidence, it is going to continue to drive improvements in U.S. automotive. And I have no doubt Randy will continue on with the good work that Kevin did by leading that team. So we're excited by the moves and look forward to the impact that Randy is going to have across both businesses.Daniel Robert ImbroAnd then follow up on the automotive guidance, not to get too into it, but trying to reconcile the 4% to 6% comp guide and the 4% to 6% total revenue guide on the automotive side. I think FX rates just as we sit today are at least a few points better than what you initially guided. So trying to reconcile how that wouldn't be more of a tailwind. Are you hedging out some of that translational benefit in the back half? Or is the right interpretation, it will be more FX benefit? And maybe lighter organic growth just within that same guidance range. Just trying to square away how FX rates can change the guide, kind of gets maintained.Herbert C. NappierYes, sure. Look, on the top line, I think we've been consistent pretty much throughout the year with our initial outlook on the top line guide. And we've just basically done what we said we would do on both with the 4% to 6%. As we look at the rest of the year through de-comping and trying to get a little bit more color on global automotive I would say that the international automotive will continue to outpace the U.S. We'll expect it to be on the higher end of our comp range. We'll expect the U.S. to be on the lower end. So the international is a bit on the higher end, you probably get a little bit of improvement from FX to your point, but that's kind of how we're thinking about those things. And look, in the U.S. automotive business, as Will has highlighted, there's more potential there. But we are being a little bit conservative on how we think about the rest of the year and how that business recovers and continues to improve over the second half.On industrial, I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about the industrial side. They've had a fantastic first half. But as we expect in the second half, moderates a bit to low single digits in the second half versus high single digits in the first half, which gives you the 4% to 6% for industrial. But even with that low single-digit. As I've said a couple of times, we will see some nice margin expansion for the full year in the Industrial segment. So hopefully, that reconciles that and squares the circle for you.Daniel Robert ImbroJust one follow-up on the comp guide. You just mentioned you called the back half conservative on the outlook. But in the U.S., you're calling for an acceleration. Inflation is moderating. So clearly, you're implying traffic is going to further accelerate to get the total comp up. I guess, what are the specific buckets? Or what are you looking at in the business that gives you guys the confidence that the traffic will be ultimately accelerating from here through the back half of the year to get that acceleration towards the low end of the 4% to 6% comp guide in the U.S.Herbert C. NappierYes. I'm not sure I would have interpreted that way. I'll just reiterate kind of what we're thinking. As we look at the 4% to 6% for the back half for automotive. We've had consistent growth throughout the year on the 4% to 6% range. We expect that for the next 2 quarters, full year automotive at 4% to 6%. International on the higher end and U.S. automotive on the lower end of that range, and I think we'll just leave it there.OperatorWe have time for one last question, and that question will come from Seth Basham of Wedbush.Seth Mckain BashamCongrats to Sid as well, we'll miss you buddy. My question, not to beat a dead horse is back on the U.S. auto business and the cadence of comps through the quarter. Perhaps we were mistaken, Will. But I thought on the last quarterly conference call, you said that April to date had accelerated from the 3% level in the first quarter. That implies a pretty material deceleration through the balance of the quarter, he said zero-ish, flattish in June. Where were we in April and May?William P. StengelI think the comment that we made in the first call was true. In April, we did accelerate from the March performance. And as you articulated, and as I think we said, April and May were close to each other in this quarter and then June was the deceleration, and we called it flattish. So call it low single digit, low single digit, flattish for the quarter.Seth Mckain BashamAll right. Fair enough. And then secondly, just following up on your comments regarding the major accounts segment. Seems like that's the segment where there's the most price competition, you're being more disciplined with how you approach some customers there. Can you give us any more color? Are you walking away from some business that you don't see as being profitable enough at this point in time?William P. StengelI'm not sure I'd go that far. I would say, first and foremost, this part of the business is always discussing price, obviously, because they're big scale accounts. So I wouldn't say that those types of discussions are more intense today than they were before. I think we're just bringing a fresh perspective to making sure that our value prop is being appreciated. And we're also doing work with smaller regional ""major accounts"" that we can really drive a lot of value with given all the capabilities that we bring to them. So I think it's just a stepped-up level of focus and strategic discipline about taking care of our customers.OperatorThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.Paul D. DonahueYes. Thank you. And I just want to reiterate, we are super proud of our team, the way they continue to operate and in a challenging environment around the world. I'd also like to thank all of you for joining us today, and thanks for your combined and continued interest in Genuine Parts Company. We'll look forward to hosting another call in the third quarter and report on our results. So we'll have another call on October 19th. In the meantime, stay cool and enjoy the rest of your summer. Thank you.OperatorThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.]"

This change outpaced the S&amp;P 500's 0.68% loss on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.47%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 3.19%.Heading into today, shares of the engine maker had gained 10.98% over the past month, lagging the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector's gain of 23.63% and outpacing the S&amp;P 500's gain of 3.58% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Cummins as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be August 3, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Cummins to post earnings of $5.16 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 8.18%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $8.26 billion, up 25.49% from the year-ago period.CMI's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $19.82 per share and revenue of $32.87 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +31.08% and +17.09%, respectively.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Cummins. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.43% higher within the past month. Cummins is holding a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) right now.Investors should also note Cummins's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 13.06. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 13.06, so we one might conclude that Cummins is trading at a no noticeable deviation comparatively.Story continuesAlso, we should mention that CMI has a PEG ratio of 1.44.

Jon Christian, Qvest EVP, Digital Supply Chain, tells Yahoo Finance Live that the company benefits not just from having local content to provide to local viewers, but there is ""quite a bit of room"" for growth when it comes to U.S. consumption of international content. Christian also highlights Netflix role in sports, noting how its focus on documentary-style programs instead of live sports is ""creating a connection"" between fans and athletes in a way that hasn't been done before.Video Transcript- The streaming company sought a beat on earnings per share coming in at $3.29, but just missed expectations on revenue at $8.19 billion USD. Even though still, Netflix is still working to differentiate from its competitors and stay on top of the content game with major difficulties like AI, the Hollywood strikes and diversification of content, Netflix's future strategy could take many avenues.Qvest is the world's largest media and entertainment focused consulting firm. Let's bring in Qvest US EVP of digital supply chain Jon Christian to dig into what may be Netflix's trajectory going forward. Good to have you on the show here.So, I mean, obviously, we've come a long way from where Netflix first started when the competition was not this fierce. What is going to be the key then? What is going to be the key value add or differentiator for Netflix at this point of the industry?JON CHRISTIAN: Well, I think you kind of hit the nail on the head. So Netflix originally differentiated with their technology platform. They are basically the first in the game in streaming. They are a cloud enabled. And the other advantage that Netflix has over the others is they haven't done a lot of acquisitions.And as a result, they are literally going off a single media supply chain. And there's a ton of efficiencies that could come off of that. So from a cost perspective, I see that Netflix is definitely going to dive deeper into the technology. There will be a ton of automation on an AI side when it comes to localization and globalization.Story continuesAnd I think where Netflix also has a strong differentiator is in their global model. So traditional content creators are creating content in the US, and then localizing it internationally, where Netflix is doing a ton of in territory content creation. And I think that could actually pay off pretty well. And especially with the impending strikes, leveraging the content from international territories and bringing that into the US also could pay dividends.- And you raise a good point because with the double strike going on at the moment, when you look at other markets that have really been a boon for Netflix, I mean, you look at some of the Korean language content. We have content coming out of India, Nigerian Nollywood content as well, how much room is there to grow for Netflix in those markets?I think quite a bit. And not only-- so obviously, the interioritory content, it's a great boon for basically that territory because they actually want to see local talent, not just be dependent on actors from Hollywood.But I think the surprise to many was how well it was received in the US market. If you just even look at the success of Squid Games and things of that nature, I think there's quite a bit of room. And I think you're going to see the other studios and content creators. They're actually going after that same type of market too.- And we've seen a lot of consolidation in this space. A lot of movie companies and streamers trying to figure out about putting some of these releases in movie theaters versus how long they should keep them as actual just streaming products and services there. What is the game play here in terms of what will give them the best bang for their buck. And how they should be thinking about the types of content that they do put out in movie theaters.JON CHRISTIAN: Yes. So think first of all is I think if you look at the past two years, it was get subscribers at all cost and create content at all costs. And I think some of the quality was sacrificed as a result in being able to do that. In this particular case in terms of great creation of the content-- and I'm sorry, just one more time, would you mind just reminding me the question?- Sure. When you look at where some of these streamers are getting the most bang for their buck and they're thinking of theatrical releases versus keeping them as a series on the platforms.JON CHRISTIAN: Thank you. So sorry. So Netflix has been very against the theatrical release because they want it to be a technology platform. And everything was about putting it on the platform. You look at the other traditional studios, what's amazing about what they do is when they create a theatrical release, they're able to recapture all of that cost in the theatrical market, or at least a good portion of that, and not even release it to the streaming platform for a period of time.They have a release window, and being able to do that. So I really do think that Netflix should think long and hard that if they are going to create theatrical release, feature release, non-episodic content that they should have a strategy to go to the theaters. That at least will allow them to recoup some of their costs, and even potentially have a higher revenue.And that is that makes them more of a traditional kind of studio. And I know they want to stay on the technology platform. But I think that's a much better route to go than trying to diversify into gaming or something like that.- And as they do focus on quality versus quantity, we keep hearing about the next stage perhaps being sports. But very expensive for some of these live sports broadcasting. Is that something that you think is going to pay off for Netflix at this point?JON CHRISTIAN: So let's talk about what they have done in sports. So if you look at what they've done with Formula One, what they've done with golf, what they've done with tennis, it's not live, but they're doing documentary style content delivery.And then being able to do that, they are creating a connection with the fans to basically those particular athletes or personas. And you're feeling very close. Just look at how much F1 is taken off in the US in the recent years. And I think a lot of that is owed-- is owed to basically Netflix and being able to do that.So people that weren't even watching F1 before are now attached to drivers, understand the different car makers and basically how it works. And now they're attending live events in Austin and Miami and things like that.And so what they're able to do, and they also have a very rich data analytics platform, they could see how well this is being received. That could give them very informed decisions on if they actually want to get into the market and go into live streaming of sports content. So I do think that is an uncharted territory that could have major dividends for them if they want to get into that game.- Definitely want to see where that goes. The documentaries have been fantastic. So it definitely makes sense that would be the next natural evolution. A big thank you there to Qvest US, EVP of digital supply chain. John Christian, thank you for your time this morning.JON CHRISTIAN: Thank you so much. Appreciate it.]"

Although results were mixed with shares dropping 5% after hours, they were better than expected which is a sharp contrast to The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) and Warner Bros. Discovery Inc (NASDAQ: WBD) who have been pulling content from their streaming services to save on licensing fees as both trimmed their workforce by thousands of employees in the previous year as part of a cost saving strategy. Moreover, Paramount Global (NASDAQ: PARA) and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA) warned this year that their streaming business are in for the biggest annual losses to date.Second Quarter HighlightsAnnouncing its latest quarterly finances, Netflix made a profit of $1.8 billion on the back of revenue that amounted to $8.3 billion.But the most important achievement is the fact that Netflix added 5.9 million subscribers while analysts expected only 2 million new households, with its global userbase now amounting to 238 million subscribers across the globe. In the US and Canada, it added 1.2 million subscribers which is its largest regional quarterly gain since 2021. More importantly, this is a sign that Netflix’s primary initiatives for the year are luring in subscribers. Netflix did it by cracking down password sharing and launching a cheaper advertising tier of $6.99 per month. CFO Spencer Neumann confirmed that the users who had previously shared the service and now chose to pay for their own accounts were the primary fuel for revenue acceleration.GuidanceNetfix expects to gain another 6 million subscribers with revenue of $8.5 billion in the undergoing quarter, which translates to a 7% YoY increase but below the $8.7 billion expected by analysts. Revenue is expected to accelerate during the remaining half of the year as the full picture of benefits from cracked down password sharing comes to light, along with the growth of the ad-supported plan. Netflix improved its free cash flow guidance for the full year from $3.5 billion to $5 billion as the actors and writers strike lowered content spend.Story continuesUnlike Disney, Netflix ReboundedIt seems that even as the media industry finds itself in havoc brought on by the strike, Netflix’s fundamental business is doing fine and certainly much better compared to last year’s comparable quarter when its subscriber growth came to a halt.Disney, on the other hand, is pulling back to find focus and slowing down, as its CEO Bob Iger confirmed to CNBC. Disney is undergoing a deep reorganization of its business with with $5.5 billion cost-cuts, with a $3 billion trim of content spending, excluding sports.With recent Pixar misses, Iger announced that licensing the company’s content to other streaming platforms remains a possibility with Warner Bros. Discovery Inc (NASDAQ: WBD) reportedly already in talks to do the same with its HBO content, even to Netflix.Netflix Barely Mentioned Gaming Because It Was Not NeededUnlike Disney, Netflix does not need to board another train and therefore, it didn’t need to talk much about gaming. Netflix spoke about the video game business back in 2021 when it needed a new growth narrative, one that it no longer needs as its basic one is working out just fine. All in all, Netflix portrayed a very positive picture with its latest results that is entirely different to last year when it lost subscribers for the first time in its history.  Advertising is pleasing investors, users are happy with its content offerings, and as a result, more cash is in store. With its international content, Netflix is among rare players who are well positioned to weather the extended writers and actors strike which is the first time both unions have walked out since the 1960s.Netflix Is Better Positioned Than OthersWith the pay strike and the use of AI potentially disrupting the industry from all sides, some analysts such as Deutsche Bank believe Netflix has superior positioning compared to its streaming peers. In a note to investors, Deutsche Bank even argues that virtually all of the headwinds that are hampering operations of traditional TV focused media companies are in fact tailwinds for Netflix who now also counts on another income source from ad-supported subscriptions. While Disney fights to recreate magic at its kingdom, Netflix is shining amid dark times for the media industry.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

The CEAA program, originally launched in 2020 in response to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, was designed with community-based organization Chatham Business Association (CBA) to increase both education and access to financial assistance options that can help income-eligible customers pay their electric bills, while creating local employment opportunities for this same vulnerable population.""At ComEd, ensuring all our customers can access safe and reliable electricity is just as important as delivering it,"" said Melissa Washington, ComEd’s chief customer officer and senior vice president of customer operations. ""It’s important to us that families and businesses know they can turn to us for help from the moment they start electric service and through any changes and hardships they may encounter. It’s a tremendous honor to be recognized by the utility industry for these efforts.""Since its inception, the CEAA program has provided employment to approximately 300 residents from Chicago’s underserved south and west sides. During the 2022-23 winter season alone, CEAAs reached out to approximately 1,800 families; 27% of whom received a total of more than $59,000 in assistance. This effort contributed to ComEd helping connect more than 87,000 eligible customers to more than $26 million in bill assistance during the first quarter of 2023. For ComEd, this is the largest amount of assistance provided – and second-largest number of customers supported – for any first quarter dating back to at least 2019.Story continuesThe annual Chartwell Best Practices Awards recognize excellence among electric and gas utilities with respect to customer-oriented projects, programs and service initiatives. Each year, judges, made up of members of Chartwell’s research team, select the best projects for recognition. More than 90 entries were submitted across all six categories for this year’s selection process.""Chartwell’s Best Practices Awards are truly the mark of excellence in utility service and marketing, and that’s because awards are judged by industry experts,"" said Russ Henderson, Director of Research, Chartwell Inc. ""It feels like Best Practices Awards submissions get better and better every year, and I think that’s because utilities continue to raise their game in serving their customers. Customer expectations have risen in recent years, and utilities like ComEd keep raising the bar to meet those expectations.""In developing the CEAA program, ComEd analyzed 40 communities with the lowest median incomes within the areas it serves. Research showed that many low-income customers, despite qualifying for bill-assistance, did not apply for resources that were available to them. To increase education about available resources, ComEd and CBA hired individuals who live and work within these same communities to foster relationships and educate customers about energy assistance programs available.""I am grateful for ComEd’s trust in CBA to manage the CEAA program,"" said Melinda Kelly, CBA chairman and president. ""ComEd looks to CBA to collaborate with reputable community organizations and stakeholders so that, together, we can provide the type of education and outreach that helps anyone access the assistance they need.""Other Chartwell Best Practices AwardsChartwell also presented ComEd the Gold Customer Service Award for its development of an Email Welcome Series for new and relocating ComEd customers. These customers receive a series of four emails, which begin shortly after their electric service is activated, that provide guidance on the full range of programs and offerings available by ComEd and address questions most frequently asked of customers establishing or moving their electric service. The goal is to proactively address customer needs, boost awareness and participation in programs that help the customer, and lay the foundation for a superior customer service experience.Exelon earned the Silver Digital Experience Award for the development of its ""I Sign Up &amp; Move"" (ISUM) program that further simplifies the process for customers establishing a service account or transferring service with each of Exelon’s utilities, including ComEd. The program provides customers with more personalization, autonomy and simplicity in creating and managing their utility accounts. It also streamlines the account-registration process and provides customers with real-time review and edit capabilities for stopping, starting, and moving their electric service. Since its launch, Exelon has increased customer-satisfaction rates and seen a reduction in operational costs.Visit the Chartwell website for the full list of 2023 Best Practice Award winners.About ComEdComEd is a unit of Chicago-based Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ: EXC), a Fortune 250 energy company with approximately 10 million electricity and natural gas customers – the largest number of customers in the U.S. ComEd powers the lives of more than 4 million customers across northern Illinois, or 70 percent of the state’s population.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Exelon and MGE are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that EXC is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.EXC currently has a forward P/E ratio of 17.58, while MGEE has a forward P/E of 23.56. We also note that EXC has a PEG ratio of 2.63. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. MGEE currently has a PEG ratio of 4.40.Another notable valuation metric for EXC is its P/B ratio of 1.65. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, MGEE has a P/B of 2.61.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to EXC's Value grade of B and MGEE's Value grade of D.Story continuesEXC sticks out from MGEE in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that EXC is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

328,cb29f743-a427-30c5-9816-0f10828b055d,CMCSA,2023-07-21,How Netflix can separate itself from its streaming rivals,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/netflix-separate-itself-streaming-rivals-165245505.html,1689871965,VIDEO,"['NFLX', 'PARA', 'PARAA', 'PARAP', 'DIS', 'CMCSA', 'WBD']","[Many analysts have been arguing that Netflix may be able to withstand a prolonged Hollywood actors' strike better than rivals due to its pipeline of international content. Jon Christian, Qvest EVP, Digital Supply Chain, tells Yahoo Finance Live that the company benefits not just from having local content to provide to local viewers, but there is ""quite a bit of room"" for growth when it comes to U.S. consumption of international content. Christian also highlights Netflix role in sports, noting how its focus on documentary-style programs instead of live sports is ""creating a connection"" between fans and athletes in a way that hasn't been done before.Video Transcript- The streaming company sought a beat on earnings per share coming in at $3.29, but just missed expectations on revenue at $8.19 billion USD. Even though still, Netflix is still working to differentiate from its competitors and stay on top of the content game with major difficulties like AI, the Hollywood strikes and diversification of content, Netflix's future strategy could take many avenues.Qvest is the world's largest media and entertainment focused consulting firm. Let's bring in Qvest US EVP of digital supply chain Jon Christian to dig into what may be Netflix's trajectory going forward. Good to have you on the show here.So, I mean, obviously, we've come a long way from where Netflix first started when the competition was not this fierce. What is going to be the key then? What is going to be the key value add or differentiator for Netflix at this point of the industry?JON CHRISTIAN: Well, I think you kind of hit the nail on the head. So Netflix originally differentiated with their technology platform. They are basically the first in the game in streaming. They are a cloud enabled. And the other advantage that Netflix has over the others is they haven't done a lot of acquisitions.And as a result, they are literally going off a single media supply chain. And there's a ton of efficiencies that could come off of that. So from a cost perspective, I see that Netflix is definitely going to dive deeper into the technology. There will be a ton of automation on an AI side when it comes to localization and globalization.Story continuesAnd I think where Netflix also has a strong differentiator is in their global model. So traditional content creators are creating content in the US, and then localizing it internationally, where Netflix is doing a ton of in territory content creation. And I think that could actually pay off pretty well. And especially with the impending strikes, leveraging the content from international territories and bringing that into the US also could pay dividends.- And you raise a good point because with the double strike going on at the moment, when you look at other markets that have really been a boon for Netflix, I mean, you look at some of the Korean language content. We have content coming out of India, Nigerian Nollywood content as well, how much room is there to grow for Netflix in those markets?I think quite a bit. And not only-- so obviously, the interioritory content, it's a great boon for basically that territory because they actually want to see local talent, not just be dependent on actors from Hollywood.But I think the surprise to many was how well it was received in the US market. If you just even look at the success of Squid Games and things of that nature, I think there's quite a bit of room. And I think you're going to see the other studios and content creators. They're actually going after that same type of market too.- And we've seen a lot of consolidation in this space. A lot of movie companies and streamers trying to figure out about putting some of these releases in movie theaters versus how long they should keep them as actual just streaming products and services there. What is the game play here in terms of what will give them the best bang for their buck. And how they should be thinking about the types of content that they do put out in movie theaters.JON CHRISTIAN: Yes. So think first of all is I think if you look at the past two years, it was get subscribers at all cost and create content at all costs. And I think some of the quality was sacrificed as a result in being able to do that. In this particular case in terms of great creation of the content-- and I'm sorry, just one more time, would you mind just reminding me the question?- Sure. When you look at where some of these streamers are getting the most bang for their buck and they're thinking of theatrical releases versus keeping them as a series on the platforms.JON CHRISTIAN: Thank you. So sorry. So Netflix has been very against the theatrical release because they want it to be a technology platform. And everything was about putting it on the platform. You look at the other traditional studios, what's amazing about what they do is when they create a theatrical release, they're able to recapture all of that cost in the theatrical market, or at least a good portion of that, and not even release it to the streaming platform for a period of time.They have a release window, and being able to do that. So I really do think that Netflix should think long and hard that if they are going to create theatrical release, feature release, non-episodic content that they should have a strategy to go to the theaters. That at least will allow them to recoup some of their costs, and even potentially have a higher revenue.And that is that makes them more of a traditional kind of studio. And I know they want to stay on the technology platform. But I think that's a much better route to go than trying to diversify into gaming or something like that.- And as they do focus on quality versus quantity, we keep hearing about the next stage perhaps being sports. But very expensive for some of these live sports broadcasting. Is that something that you think is going to pay off for Netflix at this point?JON CHRISTIAN: So let's talk about what they have done in sports. So if you look at what they've done with Formula One, what they've done with golf, what they've done with tennis, it's not live, but they're doing documentary style content delivery.And then being able to do that, they are creating a connection with the fans to basically those particular athletes or personas. And you're feeling very close. Just look at how much F1 is taken off in the US in the recent years. And I think a lot of that is owed-- is owed to basically Netflix and being able to do that.So people that weren't even watching F1 before are now attached to drivers, understand the different car makers and basically how it works. And now they're attending live events in Austin and Miami and things like that.And so what they're able to do, and they also have a very rich data analytics platform, they could see how well this is being received. That could give them very informed decisions on if they actually want to get into the market and go into live streaming of sports content. So I do think that is an uncharted territory that could have major dividends for them if they want to get into that game.- Definitely want to see where that goes. The documentaries have been fantastic. So it definitely makes sense that would be the next natural evolution. A big thank you there to Qvest US, EVP of digital supply chain. John Christian, thank you for your time this morning.JON CHRISTIAN: Thank you so much. Appreciate it.]"

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230719834298/en/MachineQ for Indoor Asset Tracking (Photo: Business Wire)The company is unveiling a suite of active asset tags, including the Nano RT, Nano LP, the Dura ET, Dura PT, and Dura AC. These low-energy tags bring diverse form factors, environmental ratings, and capabilities to meet customers’ unique asset tracking needs—from low-profile tags for tracking small, hand-held assets to ultra-durable tags designed to withstand harsh environments.The Nano RT and Nano LP tags, in particular, offer enterprises distinct features and capabilities typically unavailable in a tiny form factor. For example, the Nano RT, one of MachineQ’s smallest tag form factors, has an up to 8+ year battery life and includes a remotely triggered LED for last-meter item finding in high-density environments. The Nano LP offers an up to 2+ year battery life and ultra-slim form factor, making it ideal for tracking hand-held assets, like tools or pipettes, without interfering with the ergonomics of the equipment.""These tags were purpose-built to offer customers flexible options for tracking and monitoring equipment and assets critical to their day-to-day operations,"" said Gaurav Naik, Head of Engineering at MachineQ. ""We leaned into the operational expertise of our team to evaluate how to fit in as many features and capabilities without compromising base requirements such as extended battery life. As a result, in life sciences, for example, these new tags can enable companies to track assets through solvent-based wash cycles in a wide temperature operating range – from -40ºC to +80ºC.""Story continuesIn addition to debuting the new asset tag form factors, MachineQ is augmenting its current suite of indoor asset tracking and facilities wellness solutions by adding space utilization. This new solution leverages privacy-centric sensors to count the number of people occupying a room, helping facility managers understand space utilization and traffic patterns. With real-time and historical occupancy data – visualized through the MQinsights application – organizations can make data-driven decisions regarding space allocation and layout, resource distribution, and operational efficiency.In life sciences, for example, lab management and facilities teams can identify if lab space and equipment are being over or underutilized and optimize the distribution of lab equipment, helping provide scientists with the tools and space they need to perform science and drive revenue. Additionally, the data derived from the space utilization capability provides procurement and finance teams with information to help them optimize budgets and right-size inventory – from consumables to equipment – bolstering the data’s value across the broader enterprise.""We're thrilled to diversify our product and solution set to meet the evolving needs of our customers,"" said Steven Corbesero, Jr., Director of Product and Solutions at MachineQ. He adds, ""We’re helping to provide organizations with peace of mind knowing they can use our tools to support monitoring their operations in real-time for immediate, corrective, and predictive actions. Plus, we’re doing so with the total cost of ownership in mind and continuously looking to roll out new solutions on top of the same IoT network connectivity platform our customers already use for their asset tracking needs.""With these bolt-on products and solutions, enterprise customers can help maximize the value of capital investments by increasing data visibility, reducing issues relating to leak detection and temperature and humidity monitoring – improving the quality and safety of operations, and attaining a holistic view of asset health remotely and in real-time.About MachineQMachineQ, a Comcast Company, makes it simple for enterprises to build, connect and deploy IoT solutions at scale.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 27, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis cable provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.98 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -3%.Revenues are expected to be $30.25 billion, up 0.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.36% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Comcast?For Comcast, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.22%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Comcast will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Comcast would post earnings of $0.80 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.92, delivering a surprise of +15%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Comcast appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Cable Television industry, Rogers Communication (RCI), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.84 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +25.4%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $3.82 billion, up 26.1% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Rogers Communication has been revised 0.6% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -0.79%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Rogers Communication will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Meanwhile, as the scorching heat bears down on many corners of the globe, investors are enjoying an extended moment in the sun.The markets have been on a consistent upward trend, evoking memories of the euphoric days during the pandemic when gains seemed to come free and easy. In fact, billionaire Seth Klarman suggests that the so-called pandemic bubble may not have burst at all, and what we’re experiencing now might be an extension of those times.“You had a bubble, it was really a credit bubble, that became an everything bubble,” Klarman recently said. The value-minded Klarman, who runs the Baupost Group and oversees ~$25 billion in assets, concedes the bubble did a “pretty good job of collapsing” last year but warns that there could be more carnage on the way. “We haven’t seen a lot of bodies float up,” added the hedge fund boss ominously. “I don’t know what that means. But I’d be worried.”That’s not to say those worries have Klarman packing up his portfolio and taking a vacation from the investing world. Despite the concerning take, he remains heavily invested in several names. We ran a pair of his picks through the TipRanks database to find out if the Street’s analyst corps agree these make good additions to a portfolio right now. Let’s check the results.Liberty Global (LBTYA)Accounting for one of his biggest holdings in his portfolio (16.55%), and worth more than $896 million, the first Klarman-backed stock we’ll look at is Liberty Global, a global telecommunications and media conglomerate.Established in 2005 and based in London, UK, the company has solidified its position as a leading provider of cable and broadband services, delivering high-speed internet, TV, and voice solutions to millions of customers. Operating under various brand names in different countries, including Virgin Media in the UK and Ireland, Sunrise in Switzerland, and Telenet in Belgium, Liberty Global has built a substantial network infrastructure and a diversified portfolio of entertainment offerings.Story continuesAdditionally, the firm’s global investment arm, Liberty Global Ventures, has a portfolio of over 75 companies with stakes in names such as ITV, Lionsgate and Univision.Liberty will deliver Q2 earnings next week, but we can look back to Q1 for its most recent financials. In the quarter, Liberty felt the effect of rising energy and labor costs for its core FMC (fibre-mobile-convergence) businesses. The result was a Q1 earnings loss of $713.5 million, amounting to a 166.3% year-over-year decline and translating to EPS of -$1.59 vs. a $1.93 profit in 1Q22. Total revenue reached $1.87 billion, a 1.1% year-over-year increase, and edging ahead of the forecasts by $70 million.Liberty is committed to buybacks, and through May 5th this year, had already repurchased $330 million of stock. That is one of the reasons why Berenberg analyst Carl Murdock-Smith thinks investors should pay attention here.“There are two main reasons to be supportive of Liberty Global shares in the medium term: 1) remaining synergy delivery in the UK and Switzerland; and 2) consistent buybacks driving cash flow per share growth over time,” Murdock-Smith said, before expounding on the latter. “Liberty has reduced its share count from 895m at the end of 2016 to 445m at the Q1 2023 results. At its Q2 results, we will be interested to see whether it boosts its plan to buy back 10% of shares this year. This reduction in share count should drive considerable cash flow per share growth over time.”To this end, Murdock-Smith rates LBTYA stock a Buy, while his $26 price target implies shares will post growth of ~38% in the months ahead. (To watch Murdock-Smith’s track record, click here)Elsewhere on the Street, the stock collects an additional 3 Buys and 4 Holds, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Going by the $25.68 average target, a year from now, investors will be locking in returns of 36%. (See LBTYA stock forecast)Fidelity National Information Services (FIS)Next up on our Klarman-endorsed list is Fidelity National Information Services, a leading global financial tech company that offers a wide range of solutions and services to the financial industry. The company caters to a diverse clientele, including banks, credit unions, insurance companies, government entities, and merchants, providing them with innovative technology solutions, payment processing services, risk management tools, and consulting expertise.Over the years, Fidelity National Information Services has expanded its global footprint through strategic acquisitions and partnerships, cementing its position as a reliable partner for financial institutions worldwide.Acquisitions have been on the Fidelity menu recently but in the other direction. An agreement has been reached with private equity firm GTCR, which stipulates the company will purchase a majority stake (55%) in Fidelity’s Worldpay business for a total of $18.5 billion. The transaction is expected to close in 1Q24.The sale comes off the back of a strong Q1 report. Fidelity dialed in revenue of $3.51 billion, representing a modest 0.6% increase from the same period a year ago, yet beating the consensus estimate by $100 million. Adj. EPS of $1.29 also fared better than the analysts’ forecast, by $0.08.The full-year outlook also Impressed. The company is calling for revenue in the range between $14.285-$14.535 billion, compared to consensus at $14.39 billion. Adj. EPS is expected to come in between $5.76-$6.06. The Street was looking for $5.86.These results must have pleased Klarman, who holds 4,841,549 shares of FIS. At present, these shares are valued at over $294 million.The hedge magnate is not the only bull here. Assessing the company’s prospects, Raymond James analyst John Davis thinks that FIS has made a strategic move with the Worldpay sale.“We are maintaining our Strong Buy rating on FIS following the announcement of the sale of a 55% stake in its Worldpay business to GTCR at a $17.5B valuation, excluding $1B of contingent consideration. In our view, the $17.5B valuation is not only fair and likely better than expected (9.8x 2023E EBITDA), the transaction also gives FIS shareholders the chance to participate in the potential upside of a Worldpay turnaround in the very capable hands of CEO Drucker and GTCR,” Davis opined.“Simply put,” Davis further said, “we think investors are overly focused on near-term EPS dilution (~mid-teens in 2024) and a complicated deal structure (no clean break), but we firmly believe this is in the best interest of shareholders longer-term… All told, we believe once the dust settles, the current pro-forma valuation imply doesn’t reflect the quality of the business, and we expect shares to re-rate higher…”Davis’ Strong Buy rating on FIS is backed by a $79 price target, suggesting the shares will climb 30% higher in the year ahead. (To watch Davis’ track record, click here)Looking at the consensus breakdown, based on 9 Buys vs. 6 Holds, the view is that this stock is a Moderate Buy. The forecast calls for 12-month gains of ~14%, considering the average target stands at $69.60.

337,359de4e6-0f05-39e4-aa0e-14965c89bf00,AON,2023-07-21,Turkey and Syria Earthquakes Drive Nearly Half of Economic Losses from Global Catastrophes in First Half of 2023: Aon,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/turkey-syria-earthquakes-drive-nearly-145400968.html,1689864840,STORY,['AON'],"[Global insured losses were fourth highest on record at $53 billion, elevated by U.S. severe convective stormsLONDON, July 20, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Aon plc (NYSE: AON), a leading global professional services firm, today published its Global Catastrophe Recap: First Half (1H) of 2023, revealing a preliminary estimate of $194 billion in economic losses stemming from global natural disasters. Notably, this is above the 1H average of $128 billion for the 21st century, the fifth highest on record and the highest since 2011.The earthquakes in Turkey and Syria during the first quarter of 2023 were responsible for nearly half of the total economic losses, estimated at $91 billion. The event also became the deadliest global disaster since 2010 and the costliest in both countries' modern histories. As a result, economic losses in the EMEA region were unprecedented at $111 billion, far exceeding the previous 1H record of $71 billion set in 1990.The event showed that regulation and enforcement of modern building codes are of critical importance to prevent material losses and fatalities. Despite relatively strict and modern building codes currently in place in Turkey, structural integrity and performance varied in the affected regions. Many of the collapsed buildings were built relatively recently, with many total collapses of newly built multi-story residential buildings.""Despite the reality that communities globally remain at risk to catastrophes, only about 27 percent of economic losses this year have been insured. These devastating events reinforce the importance of resilience and the mitigation of risk – such as enforcing building codes, which was highlighted by the Turkey and Syria earthquakes,"" said Michal Lörinc, head of Catastrophe Insight, Aon. ""As we continue to face interconnected risks, we are focused on scaling risk mitigation and helping organizations make better decisions to close the global protection gap and enrich lives around the world.""Story continuesWhile the earthquake event was the costliest from an insurance perspective, severe convective storm (SCS) activity in the United States dominated global losses during this period. In the first half of 2023, U.S. SCS activity was responsible for at least 13 individual billion-dollar events and $35 billion in total preliminary insured losses, setting a new 1H record.Additional highlights from the report include:Two back-to-back, billion-dollar disasters impacted the North Island of New Zealand within a three-week period in the first quarter of 2023: remnants of Cyclone Gabriele and severe flooding in Auckland. These events are ranked as the fifth and sixth costliest events for insured losses in New Zealand overall, only surpassed by the earthquakes of 2010, 2011 and 2016.Prolonged wildfire activity across multiple Canadian provinces resulted in more than 10 million hectares of land being burned, and thick smoke plumes generated hazardous air conditions with potentially significant health impacts for tens of millions of people across North America. While some populated areas were affected with an estimate of hundreds of millions in economic losses – notably on the outskirts of Halifax in Nova Scotia by the Tantallon wildfire – the vast majority of the fires did not cause significant material damage to property.This year's economic losses of $194 billion already constitute 60 percent of the average annual global total. Global insured losses from natural disaster events in 1H 2023 were $53 billion, preliminarily 46 percent above the 21st-century average. Disaster costs continued to be affected by inflationary pressure, still persistent in many parts of the world, as well as other societal factors including demographics and wealth distribution that remain a major driver of financial loss.Notable heatwaves occurred worldwide, with the global sea surface temperature extremely high: recorded temperatures this year were higher than in any previous year since 1981. In the first half of the year, some areas experienced water temperatures of up to 5˚Celsius, or 9˚ Fahrenheit, higher than usual. This trend is continuing into the second half of the year.Access Aon's Global Catastrophe Recap: First Half of 2023 here.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So, when we ran our eye over McDonald's' (NYSE:MCD) trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on McDonald's is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.22 = US$11b ÷ (US$52b - US$4.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Thus, McDonald's has an ROCE of 22%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Hospitality industry average of 8.8%. View our latest analysis for McDonald's roceIn the above chart we have measured McDonald's' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsWe'd be pretty happy with returns on capital like McDonald's. The company has employed 53% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 22%. With returns that high, it's great that the business can continually reinvest its money at such appealing rates of return. You'll see this when looking at well operated businesses or favorable business models.What We Can Learn From McDonald's' ROCEIn short, we'd argue McDonald's has the makings of a multi-bagger since its been able to compound its capital at very profitable rates of return. And long term investors would be thrilled with the 114% return they've received over the last five years. So even though the stock might be more ""expensive"" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.Story continuesMcDonald's does have some risks though, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for McDonald's  that you might be interested in.High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma breaks down what analysts and investors will be watching for.Video TranscriptALEXANDRA CANAL: We have some big food names reporting. Who's up first?BROOKE DIPALMA: Absolutely. Well, Domino's kicks off next week, earnings block of fast food and fast casual companies, followed by Chipotle out on Wednesday, McDonald's out before the bell on Thursday, and Sweetgreen after the bell. Now, taking a closer look at what exactly analysts are expecting in terms of these big players.Domino's expects low same-store sales growth. But ultimately, this is just a low hurdle for Domino's to get over many on the street, waiting to hear more about the Uber Eats partnership that many think will benefit same-store sales growth later on this year or rather in 2024 and beyond. Chipotle, in addition to that, of course, as we noted before, they're set to report on Wednesday after the bell. Same-store sales up there expected to be nearly up 8%. They're expected to regain market share as they kept prices below peers in 2023. So ultimately, benefiting from that value advantage that they now have over their competitors.But food inflation continues to weigh in the company. Beef, right now, makes up about 20% of their food basket. Avocado makes up about 9%. Both are seeing higher prices. But in the call, we're also hoping to hear more color on the expansion into Middle East.And moving right along, McDonald's continues to gain foot traffic because of that lower income audience, in addition to a tighter consumer wallet. We expect same-store sales to be up more than 9% there, led by international same-store sales growth. Of course, menu pricing and market share gain continues to be a play for them. And we're just waiting to hear more on that grimace shake and how that blew off absolute expectations of how it performed in the month of June. Also, that's expected to carry on into early July.Story continuesAnd we're set to close out the week with Sweetgreen. They're set to report Thursday after the bell. Of course, this past quarter, they launched that chicken and Chipotle bowl. In addition to that, they did take an additional 1% pricing at the beginning of the quarter. They also launched a loyalty program. But tomato and chicken costs, they're lowering now. So that's something Wall Street is looking out for.SEANA SMITH: The grimace milkshake, have you tried it yet?ALEXANDRA CANAL: I have not. And I think it's gone already.BROOKE DIPALMA: I haven't.SEANA SMITH: It's gone already? I know it looks so good.ALEXANDRA CANAL: It was all plain vanilla. I like plain vanilla.SEANA SMITH: You are?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, I know--BROOKE DIPALMA: They're also coming out with a Peanut Butter McFlurry, rumor has it. So--SEANA SMITH: I saw your tweet about that. That looks so good. And that's right up my alley. All right. Brooke, you're also keeping an eye across the consumer staple sector. We heard Pepsi, they reported last week, got off to a pretty strong start. Coca-Cola's on deck next week, right?BROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah. Coca-Cola, Keurig, Dr. Pepper, as well as Mondelez, all on deck for next week. And what we're really looking to gain further insight to is really pricing power that these companies have over consumers. All these companies continue to increase prices. And now, they're seeing volumes. For example, PepsiCo last week saw volumes decline for the past, I believe, three quarters.And so really what we're seeing here is ultimately how they continue to raise prices and how exactly volumes continue to remain to slow down or rather lower in these upcoming quarters. Of course, Coca-Cola, their price makes up nearly 7.5%. Keurig, Dr. Pepper, price is up nearly 7% year-over-year. But volumes occurring Dr. Pepper expected to drop nearly 3%. And so really, when will the consumer stop putting up with these higher prices? And when can we expect prices to drop year-over-year, if at all?]"

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 27, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis world's biggest hamburger chain is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.75 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +7.8%.Revenues are expected to be $6.2 billion, up 8.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.31% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for McDonald's?For McDonald's, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.11%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that McDonald's will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that McDonald's would post earnings of $2.31 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.63, delivering a surprise of +13.85%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.McDonald's appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), another stock in the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $12.21 for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +31.3%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $2.52 billion, up 14% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Chipotle has been revised 0.4% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 1.01%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), this Earnings ESP indicates that Chipotle will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.

(AP) — A South Florida jury awarded $800,000 in damages to a little girl who received second-degree burns when a hot Chicken McNugget fell on her leg as her mother pulled away from the drive-thru of a McDonald's restaurant.Lawyers for the family of Olivia Caraballo, who was 4 when she was burned in 2019, were seeking $15 million in damages. Jurors reached their verdict after deliberating for less than two hours on Wednesday, the South Florida SunSentinel reported.The jury's verdict form allotted $400,000 in damages for the past four years, and another $400,000 for the future from the McDonald's USA and its franchise operator, Upchurch Foods. A separate jury decided in May that the company and franchise owner were liable for the injury, which occurred outside a McDonald's in Tamarac, near Fort Lauderdale.“I’m actually just happy that they listened to Olivia’s voice and the jury was able to decide a fair judgment,” Olivia's mother, Philana Holmes, told reporters outside the courtroom. “I’m happy with that. I honestly had no expectations, so this is more than fair for me.”She testified on Tuesday that Olivia, now 8, calls the scar on her inner thigh her “nugget” and is fixated on having it removed, the newspaper reported.Lawyers for McDonald's argued that the child's discomfort ended when the wound healed, which they said took about three weeks. They contended that the girl's mother is the one who has the problem with the scar, and told jurors that $156,000 should cover damages, both past and future.“She’s still going to McDonalds, she still asks to go to McDonald’s, she’s still driving through the drive-thru with her mom, getting chicken nuggets,” defense attorney Jennifer Miller said in her closing argument Wednesday. “She’s not bothered by the injury. This is all the mom.”Defense attorneys declined to speak after the verdict.Holmes testified that she had purchased Happy Meals for her son and daughter, who was sitting in the back seat, and was driving away when the nugget fell on the child's leg. She said that the girl screamed in pain, and when she pulled over in a parking lot, she realized the nugget was lodged between Oliva's thigh and the seat belt.Story continuesThe mother testified that at no point did McDonald's warn her the food might be unusually hot. The company testified they follow food safety rules, which require McNuggets to be hot enough to avoid salmonella poisoning, and that what happens with the food once it leaves the drive-thru window is beyond their control.While both sides agreed during the trial in May that the nugget caused the burns, the family’s lawyers argued the temperature was above 200 degrees (93 Celsius), while the defense said it was no more than 160 degrees (71 Celsius).Photos the mother took of the burn and sound clips of the child's screams were played in court.The case may stoke memories of the McDonald’s coffee lawsuit of the 1990s, which became an urban legend of sorts about seemingly frivolous lawsuits, even though a jury and judge had found it anything but.A New Mexico jury awarded Stella Liebeck, 81, $2.7 million in punitive damages after she was scalded in 1992 by hot coffee from McDonald’s that spilled onto her lap, burning her legs, groin and buttocks, as she tried to steady the cup with her legs while prying the lid off to add cream outside a drive-thru.She suffered third-degree burns and spent more than a week in the hospital.She had initially asked McDonald’s for $20,000 to cover hospital expenses, but the company went to trial. A judge later reduced the $2.7 million award to $480,000, which he said was appropriate for the “willful, wanton, reckless” and “callous” behavior by McDonald’s.]"

Investors scrutinize year-over-year changes in earnings — or funds from operations for REITs — and revenue. But stocks can experience significant fluctuations depending on whether they beat or fall short of analyst estimates. And companies that lower forward guidance from previous forecasts can get crushed.Take a look at some of the initial second-quarter operating results from various REITs and how Wall Street has been reacting to them.Equity LifeStyle Properties Inc. (NYSE:ELS) is a residential REIT that owns and operates manufactured home communities, RV resorts and campgrounds. It owns 450 investment properties throughout North America, including 225 RV resorts, 202 mobile home communities and 23 marinas.After the bell on July 17, Equity LifeStyle Properties announced its second-quarter operating results. Funds from operations (FFO) of $0.66 was in line with analyst estimates but 2 cents higher than FFO of $0.64 in the second quarter of 2022. Revenue of $370 million missed estimates for $376.33 million but was 1.29% above revenue of $365.31 million in the second quarter of 2022.Equity LifeStyle Properties also released full-year 2023 guidance on FFO with a range of $2.80 to $2.90 per share. The average analyst's estimate was $2.85.The day after the release, Equity LifeStyle shares were down about $2 but have bounced back nicely over the past few days.Equity LifeStyle Properties’ most recent dividend payout was $0.45 per share, putting the REIT’s dividend yield at 2.5%.Check out:This REIT just teamed up with the company that built Elon Musk's tiny house to develop affordable housing communities. Here's how you can be among the first to buy shares.Story continuesPrologis Inc. (NYSE:PLD) is a San Francisco-based industrial REIT founded in 1983. Prologis has long been a stalwart in the ownership and management of approximately 1.2 billion square feet in 5,500 industrial logistics properties throughout the U.S. and 18 other countries.Its occupancy rate at the end of May was 97.5%.On July 18, Prologis announced its second-quarter operating results. FFO of $1.83 was $0.16 better than estimates and up 64.86% from FFO of $1.11 in the second quarter of 2022. Revenue of $1.65 billion missed the estimate of $1.69 billion but was 50.73% higher than revenue of $110 billion in the second quarter of 2022. Prologis also increased its 2023 full-year guidance from $5.42-$5.50 to $5.56-$5.60.Despite the year-over-year improvements, Wall Street was not happy with the revenue miss and took the stock down about 6% in the first two days following the report. Prior to the earnings announcement, Prologis had run up from $117 to just under $130, so it wasn't that surprising to see a ""buy on the rumor, sell on the news"" reaction, despite some fairly good FFO and revenue numbers.Prologis’ most recent dividend was $0.87 per share, putting its yield at 2.83%.SL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE:SLG) is a New York City-based office REIT and the largest office building landlord in New York. As of June 30, SL Green Realty held interests in 60 buildings, totaling 33.1 million square feet. Many income-oriented investors like owning SL Green Realty for its monthly paying dividend.After the closing bell on July 19, SL Green Realty reported second-quarter operating results. FFO of $1.43 was down 23.53% from FFO of $1.87 in the second quarter of 2022 but beat the estimates by $0.09. Rental revenue of $165.65 million was better than rental revenue of $136.5 million in the second quarter of 2022. Total revenue of $221.07 million was above estimates for $205.97 million.After running up over 5% the day before earnings were announced, SL Green Realty was down 8% the morning after its results were announced.SL Green Realty currently has a 9.04% dividend yield.

Crown Castle owns more than 40,000 cell towers and 85,000 route miles of fiber and has 120,000 small cells in its portfolio.Crown Castle works with businesses and governments to design and build solutions that meet connectivity needs like wireless coverage and custom fiber optic networks. It has a market cap of $50.84 billion, making it one of the largest REITs in the U.S.On July 19, Crown Castle reported its second-quarter operating results after the closing bell. FFO of $2.05 was up from $1.80 in the second quarter of 2022 and $0.04 better than analyst estimates. Revenue of $1.87 billion was ahead of estimates for $1.86 billion and was 7.67% higher than revenue of $1.73 billion in the second quarter of 2022.Crown Castle's full-year 2023 guidance on adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) was a midpoint of $7.54, below its previous guidance of $7.63. Crown Castle also cut its outlook for adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) by $50 million.Wall Street focused on the lower guidance numbers and sent Crown Castle down almost 6% in premarket trading.Crown Castle has a dividend yield of 5.52% with its most recent payout being $1.57 per share.Based on the preliminary results, it appears that any REIT that falls short of revenue estimates or provides weaker guidance is likely to experience a decline in share price, regardless of whether FFO exceeds expectations or compares favorably to its second-quarter 2022 figures.Weekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it's too late.

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Significant attention has been given to advancing warehouse management systems (WMS) in the FreightTech landscape, revolutionizing operations within physical buildings for enhanced transparency and optimization.However, yard management systems (YMS) have received less investment, and their innovations have been relatively dormant compared to WMS. YMS has traditionally relied on manual processes with limited technological support.Related: FreightWaves opens 2024 FreightTech nominationsTo confront this challenge, Austin, Texas-based Terminal Industries came out of stealth mode on Thursday, along with profound partners, to strategically optimize yard operations globally utilizing its unique artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.The company announced it has closed $17 million in seed funding, led by supply chain investor 8VC and global warehouse provider Prologis, with participation from strategic investors including Ryder Ventures, NFI Ventures, Lineage Logistics, Vehicle Velocity Group and the Friedkin Group.Bringing AI to a yard near youAccording to Terminal Industries, 92% of yards lack technology solutions to eliminate wasted capacity, drive down unforeseen costs and improve inventory operations, leading to $146 billion in excess transportation costs.For this reason, CEO Max Constant and chief technology officer Neil Robertson, a former professor at Queen’s University Belfast, teamed up with 8VC and Prologis to utilize the duo’s AI expertise to digitize the yard.Constant explained in an interview with FreightWaves that the company leverages a specific type of AI — computer vision — to obtain yard operations data that has been traditionally difficult to obtain.Constant explained why there was no better AI than computer vision to solve the problems that cameras are picking up.“There is a lot of camera data that is aggregating across these yards that nobody knows how to utilize,” he said. “… We can index and analyze all of this information passively and then you can turn around and use that information for a whole variety of reasons.”Story continuesThese use cases could include yard process improvement, detention, idling and demurrage expense reduction, capacity visibility and on-time performance metrics to name a few.While fixing these problems could bring down substantial industry costs, Constant also noted that recent regulatory requirements and proposals could elevate this technology to a fundamental necessity for warehouse operators.He pointed to regulations like the Warehouse Indirect Source Rule, which aims to reduce nitrogen oxides and diesel particulate emissions connected to warehouse operations in Southern California, or the Securities and Exchange Commission’s proposed climate disclosure rules.People, ideas and partnershipsWhile clarifying the potential impact of Terminal Industries’ solutions on the logistics sector, Constant finds particular excitement in spearheading the adoption of its solution alongside industry partners who possess a genuine appreciation for the issues they address.In an interview with FreightWaves, Jake Medwell, co-founder and partner of 8VC, expounded upon the alignment between Constant’s sentiment and Terminal Industries’ potential profound influence on the global economy, deeming it a catalyst for investment.“[8VC] builds companies around people, ideas and partnerships,” he said. “Terminal was founded on all three of these pillars. We know Prologis, Ryder and NFI incredibly well. Each one of them cares about technology and long-term commitments to efficiency. They’re also all vertically integrated. We could not ask for better co-development partners for Terminal.”Funding amountFunding roundLead investors8VCPrologisSecondary investorsRyder VenturesNFILineage LogisticsBusiness goals for the roundTotal fundingFunding details:Terminal Industries“Yard management is essential to improving efficiencies at warehouses, yet there has not been a platform to fully digitize yard operations — until Terminal,” said Will O’Donnell, managing director of Prologis Ventures, in the release. “We know customers are seeking technology that would give them real-time data insights on the intersection between transportation and warehouse operations. Terminal’s AI solution is a significant leap forward.”Outside of the founding members and seed round investors, the team packs a punch with its advising team, including Chris Sultemeier, former executive vice president of Walmart; Alan Gershenhorn, former executive vice president and chief commercial officer of UPS; Shaleen Devgun, executive vice president and chief technology officer of Schneider; and FreightWaves founder and CEO Craig Fuller.Matt Yearling, former CEO of yard management and visibility provider PINC, will also join the team as Terminal Industries president.“We are the AI experts and they are the transportation experts, and I think the convergence of those two disciples can be very powerful,” Constant said. “It is our job now as innovators, with these partners, to construct a roadmap to help adopt and integrate these technologies into the industry. … We are talking about restructuring 100-year-old processes, and it’s exciting to sit at this inflection point.”Articles by Grace SharkeyRead moreKontainers founder launches Ship Angel, acquires WaySyncTransfix looks to raise Series F with 60% devaluation, source suggestsRose Rocket closes $38M Series B to expand into enterprise fleet solutionsThe post Terminal Industries departs stealth mode with $17M for AI yard operations appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

In the past year, shares of STX have lost 22.8% of their value compared with the sub-industry’s growth of 2.2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFactors Setting the Tone for Q4Seagate’s performance is likely to have been affected by global macroeconomic turmoil (especially lower economic activity in China) and inflation. The company’s nearline demand among large customers is being affected due to elongated customer inventory correction and reduced IT hardware budgets.  Cautious spending patterns amid macroeconomic weakness by customers, including global enterprise OEMs and certain domestic cloud clients, are likely to affect the demand for mass capacity solutions in the near term. The enterprise, and video and image applications market have also been suffering from prevailing macroeconomic challenges.Moreover, declining trends witnessed in PC shipments in second-quarter calendar-year 2023 are likely to have negatively impacted HDD sales. This, in turn, may have affected STX’s performance in the quarter under review.Our estimate for revenues from the HDD segment is pegged at $1,454 million, indicating a plunge of 40% year over year. The estimate for the non-HDD (which includes enterprise data solutions, cloud systems and solid-state drives) segment is pegged at $248 million, implying an increase of 13.8% year over year.Story continuesSeagate Technology Holdings PLC Price and EPS SurpriseSeagate Technology Holdings PLC Price and EPS SurpriseSeagate Technology Holdings PLC price-eps-surprise | Seagate Technology Holdings PLC QuoteSTX is focused on cutting costs to better align with changing market conditions and support its long-term business strategy.

353,db7e953d-094e-3de6-9f09-4f29cf543cb8,PCAR,2023-07-21,Ford Motor Company (F) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-motor-company-f-expected-140231611.html,1689861751,STORY,"['F', 'PCAR']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Ford Motor Company (F) reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 27. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.48 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -29.4%.Revenues are expected to be $39.45 billion, up 4.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.28% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ford Motor Company?For Ford Motor Company, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +3.73%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #1.So, this combination indicates that Ford Motor Company will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Ford Motor Company would post earnings of $0.40 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.63, delivering a surprise of +57.50%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Ford Motor Company appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, Paccar (PCAR), is soon expected to post earnings of $2.12 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +53.6%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $8.02 billion, up 18.2% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Paccar has been revised 1.6% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.25%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Paccar will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

356,909a153f-ff32-3ce1-834c-70b7cf123982,UPS,2023-07-21,The State of Freight: 5 takeaways on Yellow’s fate and a UPS strike,FreightWaves,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/state-freight-5-takeaways-yellow-223959354.html,1689892799,STORY,['UPS'],"[With two big Teamsters-related issues grabbing the trucking headlines, it was no surprise that the focus of the State of Freight webinar for July was on Yellow Corp. and UPS.Here’s are five takeaways from the more than one-hour chat Thursday between FreightWaves CEO Craig Fuller and Director of Freight Market Intelligence Zach Strickland.  (You can register for it and view the archive here).The history between Yellow and the Teamsters is key to the storyFuller said understanding the back-to-back combination of a 2006 freight recession and the financial crisis that began in 2008 and dragged into 2009 is important in analyzing the current standoff. Yellow (NASDAQ: YELL) management led by Chairman, President and CEO Bill Zollars had brought several less-than-truckload carriers under the Yellow banner, including Roadway Corp., which it acquired in 2003. That left the company with significant debt when the freight market took those successive hits.Jimmy Hoffa Jr., head of the Teamsters at the time and son of the legendary Teamsters leader, “worked diligently to rally to save Yellow,” Fuller said. “He really brought the Teamsters in on this process of saving the company. They actually took it on the chin because they gave up a lot to really help the company out and have done so over the last decade.” The end result, however, is “resentment” that its members at Yellow are facing yet another crisis, one that might be existential.But Fuller also was critical of the Teamsters. He said the union has frustrated Yellow management’s so far unsuccessful efforts to consolidate Yellow, Roadway, USF Corp. and other acquired carriers into one integrated LTL carrier. “So there’s really a lot of arguments on both sides of the table,” Fuller said.The end result is that the union structure — in part but not completely — has helped stick Yellow with a cost basis “that is much higher than its competitors.” Yellow also is not viewed as a high-quality carrier, he said.Story continuesThe Teamsters have bigger fish to fryAs it is increasingly apparent that the Teamsters seem prepared to see Yellow disappear, the question becomes why, given that 30,000 jobs in total — not all of them unionized — will be lost.Fuller noted that when the Teamsters came to Yellow’s rescue in 2009, economic conditions faced by a worker impacted by the collapse of the company were far harsher than they are today. “The Teamsters knew that there were no alternatives for them if Yellow shut down,” he said. But today, if the Yellow jobs disappeared, “while unfortunate, the majority of those folks will be able to find alternative employment, and that’s just because of the really tight employment market that exists.”But alongside that is the desire of Teamsters President Sean O’Brien to be a transformative figure, like Hoffa Sr., and “the grand prize is Amazon,” where the Teamsters so far have been unsuccessful in unionization efforts. Also in debate is what will happen with current Teamsters negotiations on a new contract with UPS (NYSE: UPS), which is far bigger than Yellow and where the Teamsters is the largest private-sector union in the country. “If O’Brien can prove out that he has won concessions from UPS and that he is willing to let a company go under, that is costing me something, but I gave this up to achieve a higher goal, then that’s a different standard that he has in future negotiations.” With UPS and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) at the top of the Teamsters’ priority list, “you really don’t want this laggard [Yellow], who is bringing you down,” Fuller said. “And that unfortunate reality is that they’ve written it off.”The exodus of Yellow customers is in full swing“Anyone who has ever been in a trucking shutdown knows the last thing you want is your freight on a truck or a dock,” Fuller said, explaining the dilemma that a Yellow customer faces.When there’s a shutdown, the facilities are unmanned and the end result, according to Fuller, is that a shipper might see its freight show up on eBay, resold by people who stole it out of a shutdown network.Various shippers and TMS systems have cut off Yellow this week, Fuller said. Bills of lading handled by Yellow totaled about 50,000 per day not all that long ago, he said; it’s below that now and might be in the high teens soon. If Yellow is struck by the Teamsters over the company’s failure to make contributions into the Central States pension fund, that is likely to be the end of the company, according to Fuller.So while a looming strike at a company that is likely to survive might not result in customer exits, because there’s life at the other end of the walkout, getting freight stuck at a carrier that isn’t coming back is a completely different scenario.As to why that shutdown hasn’t happened yet, Fuller said Yellow management still has its fiduciary responsibilities, “and your only goal as a fiduciary is to survive. So they are hoping that some white knight shows up.”The market would mostly handle a shutdown of Yellow …Fuller said Yellow’s share of the LTL market is about 10%. “What I understand in talking to other LTL carriers is they believe that there’s sufficient capacity right now in this market, across the freight economy, to handle the volume,” he added.He cited one exception: cross-country freight for retail customers, which he said has been a “bread and butter” business at Yellow. That freight might end up moving in a contract truckload arrangement “or a national carrier like XPO (NYSE: XPO) or FedEx (NYSE: FDX) that combined with incremental purchased transportation services from the truckload market” will be able to fill the hole. Fuller did say he expects that short-term LTL rates could shoot up 9% to 12% quickly.“Some of the stuff being thrown around now is shippers’ revenge,” Fuller said of the current market. “But if you’re an LTL carrier, there’s opportunity. I’m sure they will get it. The question is, how long will this happen?” Freight will be able to move, he said: “The fact that the freight market is incredibly soft means there should be ample capacity,” Fuller said, adding one caveat:… Unless the Teamsters strike UPSMeasuring the impact of a UPS strike is challenging, Fuller said. The company is a $100 billion business, and about $70 billion of that is in the U.S. Regardless of the specific size, Fuller harkened back to the UPS strike of 1997. “Anyone who lived in trucking those days talks about just how chaotic it was,” he said. The strike was a “massive, massive gift” to trucking because it drove “volume and disruption.” And since e-commerce barely existed then — Amazon was just a fledgling company — the impact of a UPS strike this time would be far greater, Fuller said.His projection of how a UPS strike would play out foresees that LTL carriers would be “flooded with freight opportunities.” Volume also would “show up” at FedEx, the U.S. Postal Service and parts of the DHL network. But the problem is that “they simply aren’t going to have the capacity” to handle the freight moving out of the UPS network.These companies that would be the first choice of diverted UPS freight “are going to be buying a lot of linehaul capacity, and they won’t have the capacity on their docks to handle it.” The result: Some freight that would normally move on LTL carriers is going to get moved over to truckload carriers. In an odd twist, Fuller said, independent truckers might be rooting for the Teamsters now, because if there’s a UPS strike, there might be “unprecedented” volumes coming into the truckload market.How does that impact capacity? The national Outbound Tender Reject Index (OTRI), a measurement of capacity, has lingered below 4% most of the year, reflecting a loose truckload market with plenty of capacity.If there’s a UPS strike, OTRI will accelerate “across the board,” Fuller said. Tender rejections will rise and companies will be forced to “pay up” for capacity, he predicted. “The ballpark is going to be electric.”More articles by John KingstonState of Freight for June: Few signs of upturn from historic lowsState of Freight for March: Bullish signs amid mostly bearish newsPort of Cleveland attempts to punch above its weightThe post The State of Freight: 5 takeaways on Yellow’s fate and a UPS strike appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

(NYSE: FDX) may find it difficult to arrange for FedEx to handle their shipments in the event the Teamsters union strikes UPS Inc. (NYSE: UPS) starting Aug. 1, a consultant said Wednesday.Adi Karamcheti, senior consultant for Shipware LLC and who spent nearly two decades in sales and pricing positions at FedEx, said in a webinar that FedEx will focus on UPS accounts that do business with both carriers. The main reason, Karamcheti said, is that FedEx already services locations that ship with both.“If you don’t have any capacity or volume with FedEx now, it’s more problematic,” Karamcheti said. “That’s one of those places FedEx is not going to provide a lot of support.” FedEx will dedicate most of its capacity to its existing shippers, he said.On-demand pickups, especially in the late afternoon, will go by the boards. Many of those shippers will resort to using drop-off points, which are likely to be clogged as a result, he said.So far, FedEx has not told eligible customers how much volume it will take, Karamcheti said. It had said previously that the amount of diverted volume agreed to this week would determine the capacity allocations should a strike occur. Capacity allocations will be made station by station and be terminal-specific. “There will be more capacity in some parts of the country than others,” he said.“FedEx has to start bringing this on as soon as possible,” said Karamcheti. “Waiting until Aug. 1 is somewhat more problematic.”FedEx is asking for three-year contracts, with penalties for early termination. Karamcheti speculated that the first-year penalty will be $300,000, dropping to $200,000 in the second year and $100,000 in the third and final year. The penalties are negotiable, he said.UPS and the Teamsters, which have not met since July 5 when talks stalled out, will return to the bargaining table as early as Monday. The current contract expires July 31.The post Non-FedEx shippers may lose out if strike occurs at UPS, consultant says appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

Parcel delivery drivers are credited with saving the economy during the pandemic, but now many fear a labor strike could undo it. Newsweek Editor-at-Large Tom Rogers, who was also the founder of CNBC and the first president of NBC Cable, is viewing the situation from all angles, stating a strike would have an ""hugely damaging effect"" on the retail sector and adjacent e-commerce companies. Rogers finds that the Biden administration will have to ""insert itself"" in the middle of these negotiations, much to the dismay of the Teamster union's wishes, without an acting labor secretaryVideo Transcript- The fight between UPS and the Teamsters Union is still ongoing, with the contract set to expire on July 31, giving the two sides 12 days to negotiate a new deal. If a contract is not signed, our next guest says the impending strike could leave the economy in a quote, ""disastrous direction."" Let's bring in CNBC founder, TRget Media chairman and CEO, and Newsweek Editor-at-Large Tom Rogers to discuss more. Thank you so much for joining us this morning, Tom. So talk about the tipping point that's really at stake here with this standoff between UPS and the Teamsters Union.TOM RODGERS: Well, this is a very touchy issue because we are teetering now in terms of the economy. Are we going to go into recession, or are we going to have a soft landing? Chances for the soft landing have clearly improved. Inflation seems to be being tamed decently. But the big thing that the Fed obviously has its eyes on is wage increases. And the pace of wage increases at 4.2% last is something that is still considered too high and the thing that is most likely to trigger more rate increases.So now we have this thorny labor dispute where the Teamsters and the UPS. Teamsters probably being the most powerful labor union in the country, and about a third of their members working at UPS. UPS is a huge backbone of the economy. They deliver about 20 million ground packages a day, 25% of all of that ground package delivery, something of the scale that FedEx and Amazon just aren't going to be able to absorb if that goes away. Obviously, that's going to have a hugely damaging effect on the retail sector and the high growth sector of e-commerce only companies obviously being totally reliant on this kind of delivery.Story continuesSo all of that is pretty high-stakes stuff in terms of consumer impact. But beyond the impact on the economy and beyond the impact on consumers, this is really something that, in terms of the Biden re-election and Bidenomics, is a very, very touchy issue, but this is just not a typical labor dispute. The UPS workers at Teamsters Union are very highly paid. The average full-time driver makes about $95,000 a year. The more senior tractor-trailer drivers make about $165,000 a year. That's with no-cost health insurance and about $50,000 a year of pension and other benefits.So the real issue comes down to the part-time workers at UPS. And this is where the Union is focused. These are $20 an hour workers. There's been a substantial increase through COVID in the number of part-time workers. These are people who choose to work 15, 20 hours a week, and the Union is seeking something like a 35% increase in their hourly wage.Now with a Fed focused at a 4.2% wage increase still being too much by way of inflationary pressure, that is really a knock-the-socks-off issue and could really contribute significantly to pressures on the economy, particularly if it's a precedent for other Union negotiations. And those part-time workers, I might add, get also no-cost health benefits. And actually, as part-time workers, which is very, very rare, get pension contributions as well. So that's the backdrop against which this is playing out, but the politics are very intense.First of all, the administration has no Labor Secretary right now because the nominee for Labor Secretary can't get a hearing in the Senate. And you need a behind-the-scenes hand here, no doubt. And the Teamsters don't really want the White House to get involved here, and the Teamsters is extremely supportive of President Biden, and very likely that they'll come out and fully endorse them even though they've been very supportive of him, and his re-election without a formal endorsement.But the Teamsters have their own politics. They're getting pushed from the left to call a strike, and that's creating a very, very difficult political situation.- So Tom, is there a viable path through this then, especially given the delicate position that President Biden would be in?TOM RODGERS: Well, one would certainly hope so. I think cooler heads are going to have to prevail. Somehow, the parties are going to have to get back to the bargaining table. What's very peculiar here is if the Union strikes. They are going to send some of that $170 million a day of UPS business that goes up in the air to FedEx and Amazon, both of which are non-Union shops. So the Union would be sending all kinds of business to non-Union shops.This isn't like the writers strike or the actor's strike where the entire industry is hurt by what is going on here. Here if there is a strike, the other major industry players benefit, which is to the detriment of the Union. I have no doubt that UPS will give some form of meaningful wage increase here. The issue is the push by the Union for something that really would contribute to major inflationary pressures.And the White House is going to have to in some way insert itself even against the Union wishes that it not get involved because if this does go to a strike and it really is a push for those kind of wage increases, not to mention the strike impact on consumers, this is just not good for the Biden economy and for the Biden perception of strength among consumers going into an election year.- So for investors and private companies also that are looking at this situation and thinking, what are the opportunities here to either perhaps push talks forward or have more of a say when you look at this, especially things like wage increases, what role could some of them play?TOM RODGERS: Well, I think that you have to have everybody beginning to think through what makes the most sense for Union members. A Biden re-election certainly makes sense, and jeopardizing that would be silly. Throwing business to non-Union companies doesn't make a lot of sense for a Union job action as well. I think the idea of lowering the perception of workers by striking in terms of the amount of disruption throughout the retail sector and e-commerce and the $20 million a day of packages.So I think all the forces that the Teamsters interacts with in the political landscape that can understand what a reasonable settlement is here that avoids a strike which just isn't good for the Union at all because of all those reasons, those forces need to, behind the scenes, help push this along to a more reasonable settlement.- And suddenly, economically, a lot at stake as you broke down there for us. A big thank you there to Tom Rogers, CNBC founder, TRget Media chairman and CEO, and Newsweek Editor-at-Large. Thank you for your time this morning.TOM RODGERS: Thanks for having me.]"

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 27, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis seller of granite, limestone, sand and gravel is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.77 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +20.5%.Revenues are expected to be $1.82 billion, up 19.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.37% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Martin Marietta?For Martin Marietta, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.71%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #1.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Martin Marietta will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Martin Marietta would post earnings of $0.99 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.16, delivering a surprise of +118.18%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Martin Marietta doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $4.39.Abbott projects full-year 2023 organic sales growth, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, in the low double digits (from the earlier projection of at least high single digits) and COVID-19 testing-related sales of around $1.3 billion (earlier $1.5 billion).Our TakeAbbott exited the second quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. However, the quarter’s earnings and revenues declined year over year. On a positive note, the company delivered strong growth across its underlying base business.The Diabetes Care business continued to benefit from the growing sales of its flagship, sensor-based continuous glucose monitoring system, FreeStyle Libre. Last month, Abbott’s FreeStyle Libre 2 system marked the first and only continuous glucose monitoring system to receive expanded national reimbursement in France, which will now include all people with diabetes who use insulin.Within Medical Device, the company registered double-digit organic growth in Diabetes Care, Electrophysiology, Structural Heart and Neuromodulation in the reported quarter. Abbott’s highly-productive pipeline is likely to position well for its growth in the future.Meanwhile, a significant year-over-year decline in COVID-19 testing-related sales negatively impacted the quarter’s top line.Zacks Rank and Other Key PicksAbbott currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Penumbra PEN, Zimmer Biomet ZBH and McKesson MCK.Penumbra, carrying a Zacks Rank #2, reported a first-quarter 2023 adjusted EPS of 23 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 109.1%.

If you’re in sweats thinking about financial risk, and your concern rests with capital preservation, you might want to avoid high-flying growth stocks.To be fair, growth stocks should hold a pivotal spot in your portfolio. That’s because these stocks typically provide the potential for higher-than-average long-term returns. However, for the risk-averse among us, or those seeking to shield their existing capital, the roller-coaster ride linked to growth stocks might not be worth the adrenaline rush.Accordingly, that’s where safe haven stocks come into play. These companies serve as a lighthouse in a storm. So, I’ve curated the seven safe stocks to buy now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLet’s dive in!Mondelez International (MDLZ)The Mondelez website magnified by a magnifying glassSource: ShutterstockMondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ) has established its position as a powerhouse in the food and beverage space. Notably, Mondelez serves as a robust inflation hedge in the investment realm.That’s in part because the company stands on a sturdy financial footing. However, the company also offers reasonable growth, with anticipated year-over-year earnings growth of almost 10%. Moreover, Mondelez delivered a sterling performance in the first quarter of 2023. The company posted impressive beats across both the top- and bottom-lines, leading many market pundits to revise their price targets for MDLZ upward.These upward revisions underscore the strength of Mondelez’s diverse and powerful product lineup. Notably, with rising input costs, the company has shown the ability to deftly pass on the additional financial burden to consumers, who remain invested in its product offerings. Currently, the stock remains a strong performer, and offers notable upside. Accordingly, for those concerned about inflation, this is a top pick.Story continuesPayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo overlays daylight photo of corporate buildingSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comIt’s imperative not to lose faith in PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). Despite the headwinds encountered in the post-pandemic era and the slowdown in e-commerce and online transactions affecting its performances, this leading digital payments platform has resilience built into its core.Now, the company’s user growth in the first quarter was rather tepid, clocking in at a mere 0.9% year-over-year increase. Nevertheless, it’s impossible to overlook the potency of its network effects. The company has robust revenue growth still a part of its narrative, coupled with powerful profits. Thus, PayPal has embarked on an aggressive share buyback spree, expecting to repurchase a whopping $5 billion in shares this year.Granted, PayPal faces competitive pressure in a continually evolving, highly competitive sector. That said, analysts at Tipranks project a whopping 29% upside from current price levels.Sea Limited (SE)SEA Limited - Shopee app on mobile phoneSource: Muh.Imron / Shutterstock.comRiding high on the wave of the digital revolution is Sea Limited (NYSE:SE), which runs a leading internet platform running three main divisions: digital entertainment, eCommerce, and digital financial services.The firm operates in Southeast Asia, Latin America, and other fast-evolving markets. Additionally, Sea’s digital entertainment foray, Garena, has left a mark as a leading online game developer and publisher with smash hits such as Free Fire. Simultaneously, its e-commerce venture, Shopee, has made a resounding market splash in high-potential areas such as Southeast Asia and Taiwan.Despite triple-digit revenue expansion from 2018 to 2021, Sea’s growth has reached a plateau, with year-over-year growth tapering to 13.5%. However, with pandemic-fueled boosts beginning to cool off, analysts project an exciting re-acceleration in its top line. Hence, its gigantic growth potential presents a compelling opportunity for long-term gains.Exxon Mobil (XOM)XOM Stock Is on the Way Back, but It Will Take Some TimeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), the oil titan, has maintained its robust position with impressive financial muscle, boasting hefty free cash flows north of $45 billion. Over the years, it’s proven to be a top-tier income investment, offering rising dividends that continue to attract investors. It has grown its payouts in the past 20 consecutive quarters, with its dividend now yielding more than 3.4%.Now, 2022 brought about an unexpected surge for big oil firms, driven by unpredictable market elements. Investors swarmed into oil stocks as earnings surged through the roof. But as we step into 2023, the pendulum has swung the other way, with oil prices declining. Thus, Exxon Mobil finds itself at a crossroads, wrestling with a transition in energy production to curb carbon emissions.In response, the company is pushing into lithium production, acquiring drilling rights in Arkansas’ Smackover formation. Yet, the relevance of oil in the global market remains undeniable. Furthermore, with its vast resources, Exxon Mobil stands ready to adapt and evolve, maintaining an unwavering commitment to secure its future profits.Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comVisa (NYSE:V) is arguably one of the best high-potential stock picks, sparkling as a solid contender amidst an economic upswing. It’s arguably one of the best defensive stock primed for extensive expansion, as the world transitions to a cashless society.In its recent quarter, the firm showcased a commendable performance with a 15% jump in revenue growth year-over-year, reporting sales of $7.98 billion and $2.09 of earnings per share. Poised to benefit from the ‘revenge travel’ phenomena, Visa could deliver even better figures in the subsequent quarter. A recent feather in its cap is the billion-dollar cash acquisition of Pismo, a Brazilian fintech firm. This strategic move avails Visa of a cloud-native API platform, bolstering its banking and card services.Moreover, Visa’s engagement with the development of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) positions it at the vanguard of the digital space, reinforcing its position as the world’s largest card network. Given accelerated digitization, Visa can be touted as a long-term victor in its niche.PepsiCo (PEP)Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.comPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) emerges as a standout contender for investors chasing high-profit stocks. A glance at the fizzy drink giant reveals a mighty positive trend, with the company projected to produce a remarkable 8% increase in year-over-year earnings. That’s not to mention a first quarter that comfortably sped past expectations on both the top- and bottom-lines.More than just a renowned beverage brand, PepsiCo differentiates itself with its powerful snack food division. This diversification allows the firm to pass its rising input costs onto customers effortlessly. It’s worth mentioning that the stock has seen a surge of more than 50% in the past five years. But that’s not all. The company’s dividend payouts have witnessed a remarkable uptick for 50 consecutive years. Recently, Pepsi’s management raised its dividend by a healthy 10% in May.As we move forward, analysts estimate mid-single-digit revenue growth this year and the next, along with high-single-digit earnings growth over the same time frame.Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A,BRK-B)The logo for Berkshire Hathaway displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comWarren Buffet’s powerhouse, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, BRK-B), has been a shining beacon in the investing landscape. The company boasts impressive long-term growth and solid fundamentals, alongside a colossal market capitalization of more than $740 billion. Hence, it’s not far-fetched to envision how it could surpass the $1 trillion mark. Yet, achieving such an extraordinary feat would mean massive growth for an entity perched at the zenith of market value.The appeal of Berkshire Hathaway lies not only in its rock-solid track record but also in its diverse holdings. The company’s portfolio offers stability amidst the stormy seas of market volatility. While market predictions may fall short in pinpointing when Berkshire might join the prestigious $1 trillion club, its journey toward this remarkable milestone is already well underway.

BSX’s bottom line beat estimates in two of the trailing four quarters and missed on two occasions. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 1.88%, on average.Factors at PlayIn the post-pandemic era, given the improved scenario in terms of hospital visits and elective medical procedures, along with an innovative pipeline, expansion into faster growth markets, globalization efforts and enhanced digital capabilities, BSX is well-positioned to register decent second-quarter 2023 results.Boston Scientific expects second-quarter 2023 reported revenue growth to be in the range of 6.5-8.5% year over year. Excluding an approximate 100 basis points headwind from foreign exchange and contribution from closed acquisitions and divestitures, the company expects second-quarter 2023 organic revenue growth to be in the range of 7% to 9%.However, the rate of growth is expected to have remained sluggish amid a challenging macroeconomic environment in the form of limitations in supply through the months of the second quarter. Further, given the ongoing inflationary situation, the business is expected to have faced the hurdle of surging labor and raw material cost, which might have weighed on BSX’s bottom line in the second quarter. Overall, our model estimate for reported and organic revenue growth is 7.4% and 8%, respectively for the second quarter.Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseBoston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseBoston Scientific Corporation price-eps-surprise | Boston Scientific Corporation QuoteOn a geographic basis, despite all macroeconomic headwinds, in the last reported quarter, the company registered strong growth in every geographic region with most of the business units gaining or maintaining market share. With global staffing issues and inflationary situation gradually improving, the international business of BSX is expected to have improved further in the second quarter.Story continuesThe company is expected to have registered strong growth in EMEA within structural heart, including Transcatheter aortic valve replacement, WATCHMAN and other interventional cardiology therapies, as well as electrophysiology divisions, fueled by ongoing investments in emerging markets, new and ongoing product launches across the portfolio, pricing discipline and strong commercial execution.Boston Scientific is particularly optimistic about 2023 given the ongoing momentum across EMEA, particularly in the company’s advanced portfolio of Electrophysiology and further opportunity with Baylis in the Access Solutions franchise. This momentum is likely to be reflected in the second-quarter results.Going by our model, the Rest of the World Medical Device arm of Boston Scientific is projected to show a strong 11.1% improvement in the second quarter.The newly-formed WATCHMAN subsegment within the Cardiovascular division, according to the company, is on track to deliver full-year double-digit growth on sustained momentum from the second-generation WATCHMAN FLX, ongoing clinical evidence, globalization and commercial execution. Demand remained strong for WATCHMAN FLX till the first-quarter earnings call and the company, by that time, treated more than 300,000 patients globally. This trend is expected to have continued through the second quarter as well.In terms of innovation, recently, Boston Scientific launched Trusteer, its new steerable sheath, and also highlighted the next-generation FLX device, WATCHMAN FLX PRO, at the TCT investor event. These developments are expected to have enhanced WATCHMAN sales in the quarter to be reported.Our model estimates the Watchman business to register $260.4 million in revenues, up 7.5% year over year.The Interventional Cardiology business is expected to have registered year-over-year growth in the Coronary Therapies' franchise, including drug-eluting stents and complex PCI, banking on strong performance in international regions and imaging franchise.Structural Heart Valves, Complex PCI and Imaging franchises too are expected to have recorded strong growth. In the United States, the second-quarter performance is likely to have been driven by the coronary therapies franchise, driven by the company’s differentiated imaging franchise. Internationally, growth is expected to have continued, backed by solid performance in Europe with the ACURATE neo2 TAVR platform.Our model estimates this business to register $621 million of revenues, implying 8.2% growth year over year.Within the Peripheral Interventions business, second-quarter sales are expected to have been driven by the strong performance of the drug-eluting franchise, supported by ongoing clinical evidence and the company’s category leadership portfolio.Our model estimates this business to register $546.7 million of revenues, indicating 14.4% growth year over year.Interventional Oncology is expected to have gained from strong momentum in the company’s advanced cancer therapies, TheraSphere and ICEfx, as well as the robust set of embolization access and delivery tools.Within Urology/ Pelvic Health, sales of Stone, Prostate Health and Pelvic Health franchises are expected to have recorded strong growth, banking on strong performances of LithoVue, Rezum and SpaceOAR in key countries. The growth momentum is expected to have continued with the recent limited market release for LithoVue Elite.Within Endoscopy, broad-based recovery across regions and growing strength in infection prevention are expected to have driven second-quarter revenues. The company is expected to report strong momentum in biliary hemostasis and single-use imaging franchise. Further, the recent launch of the company’s third generation EXALT D and the latest acquisition of Apollo Endosurgery are expected to have contributed to the second-quarter sales number.Within Neuromodulation, the company is likely to have registered balanced procedure recovery across RF (radiofrequency), Vertiflex and Spinal Cord Stimulation on strong execution of category leadership strategy in pain. Contributions from WaveWriter Alpha, FASTand Vercise Genus are expected to have boosted the top line.Q2 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter total revenues is pegged at $3.49 billion, suggesting an improvement of 7.7% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number.The consensus mark for adjusted earnings stands at 49 cents per share, implying a 11.4% rise from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.What Our Quantitative Model PredictsPer our proven model, a stock with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates.

AVTR recently announced its plans to relocate and significantly expand its Innovation Center in Bridgewater, NJ. The expanded Innovation Center, expected to open in August 2024, will be at a nearby location in Bridgewater, NJ.The latest expansion plans are expected to significantly solidify Avantor’s foothold in the cell and gene therapy and mRNA space, among others, and boost its Research &amp; Development and Innovation wing.Significance of the RelocationThe Bridgewater Innovation Center currently serves as a technology-driven research and collaboration environment where Avantor works with customers to develop and enhance their offerings. The new location is expected to have a significantly expanded space compared to the present available lab and pilot space.The new site will likely support customers' pipelines across all modalities, including monoclonals, cell and gene therapy and mRNA, and feature a development and application area, including a viral vector laboratory.

386,7c422b68-4965-3c92-bb76-350e69c25187,BSX,2023-07-21,Boston Scientific (BSX) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boston-scientific-bsx-reports-next-140236605.html,1689861756,STORY,['BSX'],"[The market expects Boston Scientific (BSX) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 27. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis medical device manufacturer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.49 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +11.4%.Revenues are expected to be $3.49 billion, up 7.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.21% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Boston Scientific?For Boston Scientific, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.47%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Boston Scientific will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Boston Scientific would post earnings of $0.43 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.47, delivering a surprise of +9.30%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Boston Scientific appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With that, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Young. Andrew?Story continuesAndrew M. YoungThanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start on Slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the second quarter, Capital One earned $1.4 billion or $3.52 per diluted common share. Pre-provision earnings of $4.2 billion were up 7% compared to the first quarter and 16% compared to the year ago quarter. Both period end and average loans held for investment increased 1% relative to the prior quarter, driven by growth in our Domestic Card business. Period-end deposits declined 2% in the quarter, largely driven by tax-related outflows. Our percentage of FDIC insured deposits grew 1% and to end the quarter at 79% of total deposits. We have provided additional details on deposit trends on Slide 18 in the appendix. Revenue in the linked quarter increased 1% driven by noninterest income. Noninterest expense decreased 3% in the quarter driven by declines in both operating and marketing expenses. Provision expense was $2.5 billion, with $2.2 billion of net charge-offs and an allowance build of $318 million. Turning to Slide 4. I will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail. The $318 million increase in allowance brings our total company allowance balance up to $14.6 billion as of June 30. The total company coverage ratio is now 4.7%, up 6 basis points from the prior quarter. I'll cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on Slide 5. In our Domestic Card business, the allowance balance increased by $544 million, increasing our coverage ratio by 12 basis points to 7.78%. 3 factors impacted the allowance in the quarter. The predominant factor was growth as ending domestic card loans grew about $5 billion in the quarter. The second factor was the impact of removing the relatively lower loss content from the second quarter of 2023 and replacing it with higher forecasted loss content for the second quarter of 2024, and as part of our 12-month reasonable and supportable period. These 2 factors were partially offset by an improvement in our economic outlook, which still assumes worsening from today's level. but less so than our outlook a quarter ago. In our Consumer Banking segment, the allowance balance declined by $20 million, mostly driven by the decline in loans. The coverage ratio was essentially flat at 2.83%. And finally, in our Commercial Banking business, the allowance decreased by $218 million. In the quarter, we moved approximately $900 million of loans from our commercial office portfolio to held for sale as we pursue the potential sale of a portion of the portfolio to reduce future risk. With that move, we recognized charge-offs that were already largely reflected in our allowance, which was the primary factor driving this quarter's decrease. The decrease in allowance from moving these loans to HFS was partially offset by a build for our remaining commercial office portfolio. We have provided additional details on our commercial office portfolio in the appendix of tonight's presentation. The coverage ratio in the Commercial business decreased by 20 basis points and now stands at 1.62%. Turning to Page 6. I'll now discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the second quarter was 150%, up from 148% last quarter and 144% a year ago. Total liquidity reserves in the quarter decreased by about $9 billion to $118 billion, driven by modest declines in both cash and the investment portfolio. Our cash position ended the quarter at $42 billion, down about $5 billion from the prior quarter. We are also disclosing our net stable funding ratio for the first time this quarter. The preliminary average quarterly NSFR for both the first and second quarters was 134%, well above the 100% regulatory minimum. Turning to Page 7. I'll cover our net interest margin. Our second quarter net interest margin was 6.48%, 12 basis points lower than last quarter, and 6 basis points lower than a year ago quarter. The quarter-over-quarter decline in NIM was driven by deposit and wholesale funding costs increasing more than asset yields. That impact was partially offset by a continued mix shift towards card loans and 1 additional day in the quarter. Turning to Slide 8. I will end by discussing our capital position. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at 12.7%, approximately 20 basis points higher than the prior quarter. Net income in the quarter was partially offset by changes in risk-weighted assets, common and preferred dividends and the $150 million of share repurchases we completed in the quarter. At the end of the second quarter, the unrealized losses in AOCI from our AFS investment portfolio were $7.6 billion. If we were to include the full impact of these unrealized losses in our regulatory capital, our CET1 ratio would have ended the quarter at 10.4%. During the quarter, the Federal Reserve released the results of their stress test. Our preliminary stress capital buffer requirement, which will be effective on October 1 of this year, is 4.8%, and resulting in a total Fed capital requirement of 9.3%. We continue to estimate that our longer-term CET1 capital need is around 11%. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich?Richard D. FairbankThank you, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. The Domestic Card business posted another quarter of strong year-over-year top line growth. Purchase volume for the second quarter was up 7% from the second quarter of last year. Ending loan balances increased $21 billion or about 18% year-over-year. And second quarter revenue was also up 18% year-over-year, driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans. Revenue margin declined 40 basis points from the prior year quarter and remained strong at 17.76%. The decline was driven by 2 factors: first, loans grew faster than purchase volume and net interchange revenue in the quarter. This dynamic is a tailwind to revenue dollars, but a headwind to revenue margin. And second, charge-offs increased, so we reversed more finance charge and fee revenue. These factors were partially offset by an increase in the revolve rate. The Domestic Card charge-off rate for the quarter was up 212 basis points year-over-year to 4.38%. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end increased 139 basis points from the prior year to 3.74% and is now above its June 2019 level. The charge-off rate hasn't quite caught up yet. But based on what we see in our delinquencies, we expect the monthly charge-off rate will reach 2019 levels in the third quarter. Noninterest expense was up 8% from the second quarter of 2022, driven by higher operating expense, partially offset by a modest year-over-year decline in marketing. Total company marketing expense was down about 12% year-over-year in the second quarter to $886 million. In most years, marketing is lower in the first half of the year and higher in the second half. In 2022, that pattern was less pronounced. In 2023, our marketing is following a more typical historical pattern. Our choices in Domestic Card are the biggest driver of total company marketing, and we continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our Domestic Card business. Our opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation. We continue to lean into marketing to drive resilient growth and enhance our Domestic Card franchise. And as always, we're keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks. We're seeing the success of our marketing and strong growth in Domestic Card new accounts, purchase volume and loans across our card business. And strong momentum in our decade-long focus on building a franchise with heavy spenders at the top of the marketplace continues. Slide 12 shows second quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. In the second quarter, auto originations declined 31% year-over-year. driven by the decline in auto originations, Consumer Banking ending loans decreased about $4.3 billion or 5% year-over-year. On a linked-quarter basis, ending loans were down 1%. We posted another quarter of strong year-over-year retail deposit growth. Second quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up about $30 billion or 12% year-over-year. Compared to the sequential quarter, ending deposits were down about 2%, largely as a result of typical seasonal tax outflows. Average deposits were up 12% year-over-year and up 2% from the sequential quarter. Powered by our modern technology and leading digital capabilities, our digital-first national direct banking strategy continues to deliver strong results. Consumer Banking revenue was up 8% year-over-year driven by deposit growth. Noninterest expense was down about 4% compared to the second quarter of 2022 driven by the timing of marketing to support our national digital bank. The auto charge-off rate for the quarter was 1.40%, up 79 basis points year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 5.38%, up 91 basis points year-over-year. Compared to the linked quarter, the charge-off rate was down 13 basis points while the 30-plus delinquency rate was up 38 basis points. Slide 13 shows second quarter results for our Commercial Banking business. Compared to the linked quarter, ending loan balances were down 2%. Average loans were down 1%. The decline is largely the result of choices we made earlier in the year to tighten credit as well as the movement of loans to held for sale that Andrew discussed. Ending deposits were down 4% from the linked quarter. Average deposits declined 5%. We saw normal outflows throughout the second quarter as clients use their cash for payroll, tax payments and other business as usual disbursements. And consistent with the general trend we've seen for several quarters, we also continued to manage down selective, less attractive commercial deposit balances. Second quarter revenue was up 3% from the linked quarter while noninterest expense was down about 9% from the linked quarter. Second quarter commercial credit trends were largely driven by the commercial office portfolio, inclusive of the movement of loans to held for sale. The commercial banking annualized charge-off rate increased to 1.62% in the second quarter. The criticized performing loan rate was 6.73%, down 58 basis points compared to the linked quarter and the criticized nonperforming loan rate increased 10 basis points to 0.89%. In closing, we continued to deliver top line growth in Domestic Card revenue, purchase volume and loans in the second quarter. We continue to lean into marketing to drive resilient Domestic Card growth that can deliver sustained revenue annuities and build our franchise and to drive growth in our national digital bank. And we continue to expect that the full year 2023 annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments will be roughly flat to modestly down compared to 2022. Pulling way up, Capital One is at the vanguard of a very small number of players who are investing to build and leverage a modern technology infrastructure from the bottom of the tech stack up to put themselves in an advantaged position to win as banking goes digital. Our modern technology capabilities are generating an expanding set of opportunities across our business. We are driving improvements in underwriting, modeling and marketing as we increasingly leverage machine learning at scale and our tech engine drives growth, efficiency improvement and enduring value creation over the long term. Our investments to transform our technology and to drive resilient growth, put us in a strong position to deliver compelling long-term shareholder value and thrive in a broad range of possible economic scenarios. And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?Question and Answer SessionJeff NorrisThank you, Rich. We'll now start the Q&amp;A session. And as a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question, please limit yourself to 1 question plus a single follow-up. If you have follow-up questions after the Q&amp;A session, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Amy, please start the Q&amp;A.Operator(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.Ryan Matthew NashMaybe to start on the margin, Andrew, where we saw some pressure. Can you maybe just talk about how to think about the margin from here, you talked about card loan run faster, which is a tailwind. But there's obviously rising deposit cost has been headwind. So when you put it all together, what do you see the trajectory of the margin shaking out? And embedded within that, what are your most updated expectations for deposit betas at this point? And I have a follow-up question.Andrew M. YoungSure. So why don't I start with the deposit beta, Ryan, since that will feed into the NIM, as we talked about last quarter and you see playing out in the marketplace at this point, there's just a number of factors that are impacting beta between product mix and the competitive dynamics on pricing, just how quickly the Fed has moved over the last 5 quarters. All of this happening under the backdrop of QT. And so we put that on top of our view for deposits all of the needs that we have, our desire to grow customer relationships and the like. And so those forces, coupled with the fact that at this point, in the cycle, deposit pricing just tends to lag yields. And so you've seen our betas continue to rise over the last few quarters. I talked about the last cycle us being in the low 40s. And a quarter ago, I said you should expect us to kind of move up from where we were. We are now in the 52% range. I wouldn't be surprised if there continues to be upward pressure on beta from here given all of the factors that I just described. So why don't I then start on your question about NIM with headwinds That, of course, would be one, the beta lag as well as what we're seeing in the wholesale funding market spreads are a little bit wider. So just overall funding costs, I think, would probably be a headwind. And then we're also seeing credit continue to normalize. Rich touched in his talking points around card margin. So revenue suppression would be another headwind all else equal. But we do see at least a few tailwinds, one being the level of revolve rate in card in the second quarter, it tends to be seasonally lower. And just on a longer-term basis, the current run rate has been lower over the last couple of years. So both of those factors could be driving card margin up. I also think that when you look at our cash position, cash is likely to remain elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels. This quarter, we saw ending cash come down. Average cash was largely flat since we had built up, cash over the course of the first quarter. But I think you should expect that cash will remain elevated relative to pre-pandemic but over time, it probably will come down at least modestly from here. And then the last thing is in the back half of the year, we'll have an extra day in the quarter. So as we move into Q3, that will be a definitive tailwind. So those are what I would enumerate as the primary forces at play. And so one of the big ones that's going to drive the trajectory is really what ends up happening to beta.Ryan Matthew NashGot it. And then Rich, maybe as my follow-up, maybe just an update on what you're seeing with the consumer. When I look in the credit -- in the card book, delinquencies in the past 4 months have been rising, let's call it, 130, 140 basis points per year. And given all the growth that has come on to the books in the past 24 months, can you give us a sense for how to think about how far past 2024 level -- 2019 levels, we could be going on losses and maybe, Andrew tie in, what this all can mean for the allowance over time?Richard D. FairbankOkay. Thanks, Ryan. So just to put some numbers behind your comments. So the Domestic Card delinquencies in the second quarter were about 10% higher than the same quarter of 2019. Our charge-offs are still a bit below their 2019 levels. But based on what we see in our delinquencies, we think they'll get back there in the next few months. So when you interpret our credit metrics, there are a couple of things to keep in mind. There is one effect that is increasing our loss rate that is probably more pronounced for Capital One, at least for a time, which is related to our recovery. Past charge-offs are the raw material for future recoveries and we just lived through 3 years of very low charge-offs. So our recoveries will be unusually low in the short to medium term. This is a larger headwind for us than for most others because we tend to have meaningfully higher recovery rates than the industry average and because we tend to work our own recoveries, so they tend to come in over time, not all at once, which happens in a debt sale. Also, we have to remember that the credit performance we saw over the past 3 years was unprecedented. So we believe there's some catching up that happens on the other side of that, especially for consumers who might otherwise have charged off over the past 3 years. So we call this sort of the deferred charge-off effect. It's something that really can't be measured. We won't even be able to measure it in hindsight, how big this effect is, but it's intuitively sort of the reverse of the effect we saw in the global financial crisis, which in many ways, just pulled forward charge-offs for lots of folks that were in a vulnerable position. And then what we saw in the aftermath of that for those that -- weather that, we just saw strikingly low charge-offs. So I think really what -- kind of what's going on with this whole sort of normalization in the context of such extraordinarily low unemployment rates, I think an important part here is sort of this deferred charge-off effect. And so that's the dynamic we see going on in our business. We continue to feel very good about the credit performance. We're not giving guidance on predicting the level, but we continue to lean into our growth opportunities because the metrics we see are very solid.Andrew M. YoungAnd then with respect to the allowance, Ryan, I know I've talked a lot about the mechanics in recent calls, so I'll spare all of you the tutorial. But the first thing with respect to the allowance will obviously be allowing for future growth is an obvious contributor to where the allowance goes from here. But then it's really all about the outlook for losses and in particular, what we're projecting for loss rates a year out. So Rich just described a lot of the dynamics that are at play with our outlook for quarter losses. So depending on how all those factors play out, that's really going to have the biggest impact, especially as you look out well into '24.OperatorOur next question comes from Richard Shane with JPMorgan.Richard Barry ShaneRich, I would describe that I think one of the hallmarks of Capital One over the decades is almost a strategic optimism. When you look at opportunities right now and where your peers are deploying capital, where is your greatest strategic optimism?Richard D. FairbankMy greatest strategic optimism, Richard, is in the card business. We've -- first of all, we've always been a big fan of the card business starting from the beginning of the company, it's not an accident that we chose the card business because we love the industry structure. We love the opportunity to leverage kind of strategies that we wanted to put in place, the information-based, technology-based strategies. And while that is something one can apply across all of financial services, it certainly has tremendous leverage in a business like the card business. So we've always loved the business. As you know, kind of, you've followed us for a long time, Richard, we -- just because we love a business, doesn't mean we constantly have our foot on the accelerator. So we very much look at the industry structure and then look at the marketplace and make our choices. We, often, we end up zigging while others zag, as you have seen in the past. We feel very good about the opportunities in the card business for several reasons. I think, well, first of all, just the health of the consumer, just consumer credit is in a very good place. The consumer is in an exceptionally strong place. And I think that gives a foundation of strength even in the context of an economy that's got some concerning aspects to it. Then we look at the competitive environment, I think the competition is intense in card, but it is rational. We see people making credit choices. And just when we look at the competition, and this isn't always true in banking, but I think we see a rational industry making rational choices. And so I think the credit that is being delivered to the consumer is balance to the appetite, and so we feel good about the competitive environment. We look at margins and where they are. They are strong. The credit environment, as we talked about in my answer to Ryan Nash, credit losses are increasing. I think there's a catch-up sort of delayed charge-off effect. But when we look at the metrics, the metrics on recent originations, the metrics on our back book with respect to performance of existing accounts, credit line increases, we just see strength across the board. So we feel very good about that and we look at our marketing programs, and they continue to generate a lot of new accounts. And so pulling way up on that, we like the metrics, we like the results of our programs, and we like the marketplace in credit. And if I cross-calibrate to other parts of the marketplace. The auto business, even while we've been leaning into card, we have been -- had more of our foot on the brake over the last 18 months in the auto business for a number of factors, but probably the biggest one being what was happening on the pricing side and the difficulty in passing through increases in cost of funds. That aspect has normalized mostly in the market. The auto business has still some unique aspects to it that we got to keep an eye on used car prices, and they've been elevated. They're likely to fall over time. And so -- but all in all, we see opportunity maybe expanding a little bit in the auto space, but we'll have to keep an eye on that. But in the very recent sort of months, we've seen the opportunity to lean in a little bit more. And then on the commercial side of the business, obviously, our biggest focus has been on the office portfolio and Capital One, again, tends to take a different path than a lot of companies do. But we -- I think for a lot of banks, they tend to when they look at the credit environment when they see credit that is worsening in a particular sector. They tend to pull back on originations, which makes a lot of sense. We often see one more notch on the continuum, which is to look at the assets that we have and look from time to time at, in fact, selling those. We have -- over the last few years, we have actually unloaded something like -- this is -- well, something like $6 billion of loans. That's not an official, Andrew is the one who gives the precise numbers. What I'm saying is several billion dollars of sort of exiting that we have done. Now in this particular case, we look at the market and see a lot of sustained stress in that market and feel that when we have an opportunity to relieve some of the higher stress aspects of that business, we took that opportunity. So pulling way up, you see at Capital One, we -- for some of our business, we have our foot on the brake and for other parts of the company, our foot is on the gas. But where I would leave you, the net impression I would lead you it is really on the card side, that we're really leaning in the hardest.OperatorOur next question comes from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America.Mihir BhatiaI wanted to start maybe with expenses. These come in a little bit better than I think what we were expecting, they were down quarter-over-quarter. You mentioned -- you talked a little bit about returning to normal in your prepared remarks. And I was just wondering if you could expand on that a little bit. Was there a decision like to slow down on growth investments, pullback? Like, I guess, what changed just in terms of the expenses or the cadence of expenses through the year?Andrew M. YoungTypically, Mihir, I'll take that one if you're talking just Q1 to Q2. In the first quarter, we typically have seasonal effects to compensation when bonuses are paid, payroll tax issues. You see that in the ST&amp;B, Salary Tax and Benefit line there. So that's really the largest single factor, not necessarily a fundamental shift in any trajectory.Mihir BhatiaOkay. And then maybe just going back to the NIM conversation. I think you talked about some of the puts and takes in the near term. But I was curious just about company-wide NIM or compared to historical, right, I mean, it wasn't atypical for Capital One's NIM to be closer to 7%, high 6s. Do you expect you'll get back there? Or has something fundamentally changed in the business, whether it's the growth in the high balance transactors or something else where you wouldn't get back there?Andrew M. YoungWell, I don't think there's anything fundamentally different in the business, Mihir. I think there's a lot of question around what happens to consumer behavior when we talked about revolve rate in card and other things. And then also on the funding side, partially dependent on what the Fed ends up doing over an extended period of time where rates eventually settle out. I think those are all factors that could ultimately impact where the final resting place is for NIM, but there's nothing that is really fundamentally different across our book from where it was years ago.OperatorOur next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.Betsy Lynn GraseckSo I know, Rich, you mentioned marketing following the typical seasonality this year, and so expecting it to ramp up in the back half, which makes a lot of sense. And I'm just wondering, when you think about where you want to spend those dollars, is it more on new account acquisition, spurring outstanding lawn utilization, is travel a relatively easier one to pull at this stage? And I guess what I'm just wondering is, is there an opportunity to even get more return for your marketing dollars now versus maybe what you've had over the past couple of quarters given the need for people to borrow perhaps more than they had to a year ago? So just those are some of the questions that I had.Richard D. FairbankThanks, Betsy. Let me talk about the marketing, yes, thanks for commenting about the seasonality. I mean every year is different in terms of the quarterly patterns. But we pointed out this year is, it seems like a more normal year with the back half, with the more common back half, higher back half than we've had in some of the anomalous times during the pandemic. The marketing was flat compared -- in this quarter, was flat compared to the prior quarter and down 12% year-over-year. But I wouldn't draw really strong conclusions from that because as I already talked about, we're leaning into the marketing. It's just from a timing point of view of some of our marketing, it was just didn't happen to fall as much in this quarter. And let me talk about the opportunities that we see and why we're investing heavily in marketing, really, first of all, we just see attractive growth opportunities across our business, particularly in the card business. We've continued to expand our products and our marketing channels. We're seeing very good traction. These opportunities are significantly enhanced by our technology transformation that enabled us to leverage more data, access more channels, leverage machine learning models and provide customized solutions that continues to just generate very good performance, and we're leaning in to capitalize on that. So sort of category 1 is just the good opportunities that we see. The second thing that's behind our marketing levels is something we've been talking about for a long time, which is our ongoing focus on heavy spenders. And it was really back in 2010 that we declared a strategic push for heavy spenders. And we knew in looking at the business that, that's not a thing that we can go lean in 1 year, pull back another year. This is a whole part of the marketplace, which is about commitment. It's about building exceptional experiences, great products and the brand. So starting really with the venture launch way back in 2010, we've been leaning in hard there. But of course, it hasn't just been about flagship cards. It's been about working backwards from what it takes to win with heavy spenders and investing across really the digital experience, the servicing experience, the lifestyle and product experiences as well. And what's been nice about this is that we've and you've seen in our purchase volume growth, a lot of growth of purchase volume, but another strong manifestation of this is the rate of growth year after year has been higher at the higher end than the average. So we continue to get increased traction going up and up in the pursuit of heavy spenders. Now, of course, heavy spenders have much higher upfront cost of marketing, promotions, brand building. And hence, it's a big factor in why the marketing levels at Capital One, if you compare back to many years ago, they're sort of structurally higher but that's in pursuit of this really, I think, company transforming benefits that we're getting there. A third factor driving our marketing levels, Betsy, is our continuing investment in building our national retail bank. As you know, we have only a modest presence in terms of physical distribution. And so to get there, we lean heavily on our modern technology and a compelling digital experience and along with that, a sustained investment in marketing. So that's a bit about what's behind our marketing levels that you're seeing and the opportunities we see. And if we really look across those 3 sort of buckets, just the growth opportunities we see, the opportunities in building the heavy spender franchise and then the building of the national bank being sort of the one bank that's building a full-service bank without trying to do it via a branch on every corner. All of this marketing is the engine behind this, and we continue to lean into it and be very pleased with the performance.Betsy Lynn GraseckAnd the growth rate expectations should be following similar patterns to the pre-COVID environment?Richard D. FairbankWell, let me comment for a second. Well, let me first say, we're not really giving growth outlook. The thing I really want to say about marketing is marketing drives the origination of accounts. The real growth of our card business comes really from balanced growth and also from purchase volume growth, of course. But those are not one-for-one things. But what we have been focused on since the founding of the company is building a company that has an organic growth engine focused on originations and leveraging the technology and analytical capabilities that we built. And so our -- when you see our leaning in hard to marketing. Think about that is the engine that's driving new accounts. And over time, those accounts really are, to your point, even though the timing is not one-for-one. Those accounts are really the foundation for the continued outstandings and revenue growth of the company.OperatorOur next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.Sanjay Harkishin SakhraniAndrew, I hate to do this, but I want to go back to the allowance coverage trends going forward. If we zoom into that complex calculation of removing previous and adding future quarters of net charge-offs. In your current forecast, do you have losses sort of rising through the end of next year? And maybe you could just touch on the new macro baseline and what the unemployment rate assumption is?Andrew M. YoungYes. So the baseline assumption and our outlook focusing, I imagine you're looking mostly for unemployment rate. So we have it increasing from the 3. 6% it is today to 4.3% at the end of this year and then moving higher in the 4s, but staying in the 4s through 2024. That compares to our assumption last quarter of, I believe, it was 5.1%. But remember that our models tend to use the change in unemployment rates or the rate of job creation, which we're forecasting to come down to nearly 0. Rather than the level of unemployment. And so it's not just about those factors, too, in our allowance, we're also considering downside scenarios that are much more severe than that baseline. So when you take that into account to your first question around what are we assuming? I'm not going to give specific forecast, Rich listed out kind of the factors that we believe will create upward pressure on our loss rates in the near term, at least. And so we did assume that there's higher losses in the second quarter of next year than the quarter that we just left sort of mechanically, as I described this quarter's allowance. But where that goes from here is just so heavily assumption-laden focused on the back half of the year, I'd really focus your attention much more to delinquencies as the leading indicator to charge-off, especially in the near term because that's where the economics ultimately are felt as opposed to the allowance that is going to move quarter-to-quarter based on assumptions looking many quarters into the future.Sanjay Harkishin SakhraniOkay. Rich, I asked this question to one of your competitors earlier. But can you just pinpoint what's exactly attractive about the growth you're seeing in card today versus in the past? They are also growing at a pretty rapid rate. And obviously, you guys have been very successful at growing this business over time, but the market remains competitive. You talked about the credit normalization. There's obviously a potential for economic challenges. I'm just trying to think through the risks.Richard D. FairbankSo Sanjay, there certainly are things to be worried about. The economy is unusual and has aspects of a lot of strength and a lot of concern. The credit normalization, we all see it. And so I'm going to make the worry case just slightly here for a second, the credit normalization has -- credit is still at very attractive levels, but it still has an upward slope to it, and nobody -- well, we certainly don't feel in a position to predict exactly where that settles out. And so we'll have to keep that very much front and center. And the market is very competitive, absolutely. So at a time like this, we -- so -- well, on the strong side, I start with the health of the consumer. So let's just think about this because the U.S. consumer is a real source of relative strength in this uncertain economy. The labor market has proven strikingly resilient over the past year. And there are signs of cooling, but so far, they're playing out gradually without abrupt or severe job losses that we see in severe downturns. Another striking thing, the debt servicing burdens remain low by historical standards despite rising interest rates. Home prices have started to tick back up after falling for a while and we've talked a lot about consumers and their excess savings that they built up through the pandemic. And they still have some excess savings, although that buffer is shrinking. And for many consumers, I think it's been fully consumed by higher prices. The big negative, back to negatives, the big negative out there has been inflation and real wages have been pushed down since really over the last couple of years and consumer confidence that's been pretty shaky. But on the whole, I'd say consumers are in reasonably good shape. So then we also believe when the -- we have believed for quite a while, you remember in our conversations, even as the losses are rising these days, because we do believe that the deferred charge-off phenomenon is something that is very natural to occur. We're not alarmed to buy where losses are going. Then we look at our own metrics and if we -- obviously, we've talked about delinquencies. We've talked about charge-offs. We also look at payment rates and revolve rates. And I just want to make a comment about payment rates. I'm struck by the strength in payment rates throughout the course of the pandemic, payment rates increase, not only for us but across the industry. And more recently, very naturally, payment rates have drifted down from pandemic highs. And you can see in our trust metrics, the pretty whopping payment rates that's still there. I guess what I'm struck by is that payment rates not only overall for Capital One, which could definitely has a mix shift toward heavy spenders as potentially driving that. But even when we look by segment, we're struck by the continuing relative strength in payment rates. So that's a good guy. And probably the biggest factor that we look at is the recent originations, the vintage curve performance. And the overall level of risk that we're seeing so far in our new originations is consistent with -- certainly consistent with our expectations, but also on a comparative basis. When we look at the earliest delinquencies on our newest monthly vintages of originations, we see performance that is consistent with pre-pandemic risk levels in each of our major segments. And vintage over vintage, we're also seeing relatively stable risk levels over time. Now one thing I want to say, and Sanjay, you remember, we've talked about this. There's 2 ways you can -- this can happen. One is the sort of unmanaged and the other is the managed way. My favorite way is when vintage performance with the same credit policies as several years ago, when that is on top of the old things, the old originations from years ago, that's actually not the case on what we call a like-for-like basis. The recent originations have worse credit than they had years ago. Again, not surprising at all to us. We all along the way, have been managing reactively and proactively around the edges where we either see or would expect maybe performance to be not as good. And the -- and so we have trimmed around the edges in our originations. And so on a net basis, it is sort of just happens to be that originations these days are on top of where they were several years ago. So pulling way up and based on, for me, more than 3 decades of experience of doing this in the card business, the opportunities that we see and enhanced by a lot of technology innovations and things like that. We see it as a good time to keep leaning in. We have a very watchful eye on all those negatives that you and I talked about. But on a calibration basis, I would -- I like the opportunity. I just want to say one more thing, which you are right. A lot of times, we have leaned in when others are pulling back. As a general observation, most of the industry is leaning in. That gets our attention. It's not as sustainable often when that's the case. So we're going to watch it carefully. But that gave you a little window into how we're looking at this and the optimism that we feel at this moment.OperatorOur next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.Donald James FandettiYes. Rich, can you talk about what you're seeing on credit card spend growth rates recently in terms of the like-for-like account basis, I know it was sort of flat to down last quarter. And do you think that we'll continue to see moderation?Richard D. FairbankSo let's pull up, first of all, our Domestic Card purchase volume was up 7% year-over-year. But that's -- to your question, Don, that's really powered by the growth in our customer base. When you look at spend per customer, this has moderated and is now generally flat from a year ago. And the moderation in spending appears to be broad-based. We've observed it across income bands and card segments. We've also seen it across both discretionary and nondiscretionary categories. By the way, it's not surprising at all that this would sort of level out. The consumer pulled way back in the pandemic, just an unprecedented amount of pullback and now -- and sort of has come roaring back on the other side. But I think for the individual customer, things are sort of settling out. So I think when we ask what would we wish for. I think this is a sensible -- like so often, I always say that's the most sensible constituency in all of the marketplace tends to yet again be the consumer. But overall, we think that spend moderation is the sign of a rational and healthy behavior on the part of the consumer. And then we match it with the payment rates, and those are, look, those are normalizing somewhat. The revolve rates are normalizing somewhat, but both the payment rate and the revolve rates on a segment-by-segment basis are still not there. They're not at the pre-pandemic levels yet, which indicates an underlying strength, at least on average, even when maybe at the margin, you're seeing some of these deferred charge-offs that are driving up credit losses.OperatorOur next question comes from Aaron Sigonavich with Citi. Our last question comes from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer.Dominick Joseph GabrieleRich, I was just thinking about turns in the credit cycle. What are some of the mistakes that you think card issuers make and even lenders in general? And where do you look for the weakness in the overall space of lending to give you caution when you start to see that turns in the credit cycle. And I also have a follow-up.Richard D. FairbankYes, it's -- I really appreciate the question, Dominick, because I've often said, we're not in a position, I wouldn't have any of you put any more stock or stake. I guess you investors put stock in, but I wouldn't put any particular stake in our ability to predict the economy. But the credit cycle and the economy are not the same thing. They're correlated, but I think that the credit cycle is the thing that we really focus a lot on because I think a lot of elements of it are pretty predictable. Obviously, it is influenced by and influences the economy. So let's sort of pull way up. We were in this extraordinary period no one has ever seen before in terms of the credit quality during the pandemic. And we enjoyed and our investors enjoyed the high returns that we made in that time. But some of you may remember my saying, be careful what you wish for, because with every passing month that this cycle is abnormally good, we will pay the price later on the other side of that causally because what -- and so if you get into the behavior, and it really links not so much at all to the behavior of consumers, it's really about kind of to your question, what happens to lenders, providers of credit in -- at this part of the cycle, especially in an extreme thing. And we saw alarming things happening during the most extreme periods during the pandemic. The most striking one to me was the absolute surge in FinTech lending, how much of it there was, who knows, because most of them aren't reporting to the credit bureaus. So it's just a matter of trying to infer what's going on. But -- so there was a big surge in supply, particularly to subprime, which is where almost all FinTechs go after. And that was alarming to us. And we felt with every month that, that supply keeps coming, as I said earlier, there's a price to be paid. Then you look -- then we look at the context of overlay on top of that, the -- to your question about the common mistakes, what the FinTechs almost by definition, we're doing because I'm not sure what else they would do, is they were leveraging technology building models in a lot of cases, but the rearview mirror that they were looking into the data set their models had were the greatest credit economy in the history of lending. So that's a dangerous kind of data set for the models. It was exacerbated by credit scores that had drifted dramatically more a lot of subprime customers moving into prime just by sort of the way scoring works and what was happening as a result of the savings rates going up for consumers. So the -- so with FinTechs, particularly but for all the players in the business, the danger of the rearview mirror, the danger of the misreading the credit risk of customers because they were artificially, their scores would be artificially good. By the way, in our case, we pretty much just intervened in our own modeling and created a way to assume worse than the data says. We also, in our case, put heavy reliance on data and modeling from way back in the last few decades that allows us to sort of get past that. So that -- it's primarily the overexuberance of lenders in the environment of a combination of a great rearview mirror and frankly, a lot of extra earnings, and feeling the ability to deploy a bunch of that into marketing. Now what's happened since then? I think this sort of great normalization has been a very healthy thing. It would be shocking if it didn't happen. But from a health of the industry point of view, I think it's a very good thing. Obviously, the FinTech lending has gone way. Most of it is retreated significantly. I am struck -- my earlier comment as we watch very carefully the credit card industry, I think the major players seem to be pretty rational about the credit choices they make. And now for everybody with charge-offs rising and without leveling necessarily manifesting itself, I think it's bringing back the appropriate cautions in time for a softer landing here than might otherwise have been there. So those are some of the thoughts that we have and those are things to keep an eye on. One other thing that I just sort of see a moment here on things that are on our mind because I always try -- to my goal here is to always give you a window into how we're thinking and what net impression do I want folks to come away with, as we look at opportunities and a thing that's very much on our mind is the CFPB efforts on late fees. And I just want to just comment on that because that it's a very important thing that's going on. The CFPB late fee proposal effectively reduces late fees by approximately 75%. And the CFPB is going after the fee that we believe is the most important fee in consumer credit business. Late fees provide a direct and clear incentive for customers to pay on time and avoid becoming delinquent and damaging their credit records. And a small late fee may not have that deterrent effect. Late fees are also a way that issuers can partially price for risk, and this enables greater access for consumers, greater access to credit and a lower cost of credit on average. A reduction in late fees is almost certain to reduce credit access to certain parts of the population. And the CFPB proposal is, of course, not yet finalized, and it could be subject to delays or changes due to litigation. But we have to plan for the potential of this becoming law early next year. And Capital One has pursued a strategy of offering very simple credit card products with limited fees and complexity. And ironically, the late fee has been an important part of our product structure because of the reasons that I cited earlier. If the proposed rule is implemented, there will be a significant impact to our revenue, gradually resolving over time. And there are ways to mitigate the impact, but as a practical matter, those solutions will take several years to work their way through the portfolio. So as we pull up and I share with you how we're thinking of the business, we really like the opportunities in the card marketplace. For all the reasons that I've talked about, but we also need to really stare at this proposal that may become the rule of the land and I just wanted to share with you how we're thinking about that. And that's an important focus of Capital One. And our solutions to that will be very focused on finding solutions that are consistent with maintaining a winning customer franchise, and that's a thing that takes time to work its way in. Do you have another question, Dominick? You wanted to ask.Dominick Joseph GabrieleYeah. Thanks, Rich. I can't agree with you more on the late fee comments as well, especially access to credit, makes perfect sense. This one is not as interesting. I guess I was just looking for some help on the model. When you look at professional fees or professional service expense, it was down pretty big year-over-year while the salaries were maybe a little elevated versus seasonality. I was wondering if you brought some of those folks in-house or how to think about the professional services given that is some of the debt collection fees, I believe. And then was there a gain in the other noninterest income from the sold portfolio? Any help there would be great. And thanks for everything and the comments.Andrew M. YoungSure. So I think you've got it right in terms of looking at salaries and benefits in professional services in conjunction with one another as we were making substantial investments in technology we were supplementing that with some third-party resources. We brought that down as we've been able to use our brand -- our recruiting brand to bring incredible talent into the organization. And so it's really looking in some ways at those 2 lines in conjunction with one another to get a sense for the kind of underlying overall labor trend. And then in other noninterest income, no, it's -- well, not specifically a sale, one of the biggest things in that creates some quarter-to-quarter fluctuation is agency income in our commercial business. So it's a little bit lumpy, but we saw some real strength in the quarter, and so that's what drove the quarter-over-quarter increase there.Jeff NorrisWell, that concludes our Q&amp;A session and our call for this evening. I want to thank everybody for joining us on the conference call today, and thank you for your continuing interest in Capital One.

The Dow gained +163 points on the session, +0.47% — for the ninth-straight trading day higher — while the S&amp;P slipped -0.68%. The Nasdaq pulled up the rear, -294 points or -2.05% — its worst single-day performance since early March — while the Russell finally took a breather, -0.89%.Tesla TSLA and Netflix NFLX, both which reported earnings after the close yesterday, helped sink the Nasdaq and S&amp;P as investors apparently gave a valuation re-think to two of the top-performing stocks of 2023, year to date. Both companies beat earnings expectations and only Netflix came in a tad light on the top line, but by today’s close, Tesla was -9.7% and Netflix -8.4%. In one session, both are headed back to the share prices of a month ago.Earlier today, Existing Home Sales for June came in beneath expectations to 4.16 million seasonally adjusted, annualized units, -3.3%, to its lowest print since January of this year. Total house inventory was unched month over month to 1.08 million units, -13.6% year over year. By region, only the Northeast put up positive numbers, +2%, while the West was down -5.1% and the South -5.4% (the Midwest was flat). Low inventories remain the story, although the average selling price reached the second-highest ever: $410,200.Leading Economic Indicators were down for the 15th straight month — yeesh! — on a weakening consumer outlook and increasing unemployment claims (this is June data; the weekly jobless claims for July have been coming down). The headline number came down -0.7%, 10 basis points below the previous month and June expectations, to 106.1. As we’ve seen in other economic metrics, most everything not directly tied to the labor force is pointing to a shrinking economy. Perhaps this is yet another morsel atop the pile suggesting the Fed not raise interest rates again next week.Railroad major CSX Corp. CSX reported in-line Q2 earnings after the closing bell today, to 49 cents per share. Revenues were slightly below expectations: $3.70 billion versus $3.73 billion. Operating income came down -13% to $1.48 billion. Intermodal and Chinese goods deliveries were down, while merchandise and coal deliveries made significant gains in the quarter. Shares are down -5.5% in late trading.Capital One COF broke a four-quarter string of earnings estimate misses today by beating consensus on its bottom line: $3.52 per share easily surpassed the $3.31 analysts were expecting (though still down -20% year over year), on revenues in the quarter that were below the Zacks consensus — $9.01 billion versus $9.17 billion anticipated.

Let's take a look at some of the movers here after-hours. Three stocks for you. Let's start off with Intuitive Surgical. This is the robotic surgical company here, provider of equipment. That's under pressure in after-hours trading, off just about 5% when it comes to the numbers for its most recent quarter, actually beating the Street's estimates on revenue. Procedure growth was up 22%. The company saying that more surgeries helping its results.But we got to remember that this stock has certainly been on fire since the start of the year. We've seen a massive run-up as of late, up just about-- this is Sirius. Let's go over to Intuitive Surgical. Here we go. A massive run-up as of late, up just about 31% year-to-date. So it's giving back some of those losses there. We mentioned the fact that for some of these companies, the bar is very, very high, especially when we see gains over the last couple of months. That's why we're giving back some of that excitement. At least right now, off just about 5%.Flipping over to CSX Corporation, the railroad operator. That's also moving lower, off nearly 5%. The company missed on revenue. It was down about 3% from just about a year ago, falling coal fuel prices, hurting sales, also weaker shipping volumes, something that we have talked about industrywide. That is weighing on CSX's results here for its latest quarter. Year-to-date, the stock is still in the green, up just about 8%. Over the past year, up about 13%. But again, the fact that it fell just a bit short of analyst expectations. That's what's putting pressure on shares right now.Rounding out with Capital One, a look here at the consumer, credit card spending trends, auto delinquencies. We're actually seeing a rise of just about a half of a percent. Deposits did slightly miss expectations. Also, the company reporting higher auto and car-- and credit card delinquencies, something that we have really been closely tracking here as we get a number of results here from the credit card companies from the banks. That's offering us a closer glimpse, a closer look into what exactly the spending behavior is right now. Over the last three months, looking at Capital One, up just about 18%. Since the start of the year, up about 23%.]"

This compares to earnings of $4.96 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 6.34%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this credit card issuer and bank would post earnings of $3.80 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.31, delivering a surprise of -39.21%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.Capital One , which belongs to the Zacks Financial - Consumer Loans industry, posted revenues of $9.01 billion for the quarter ended June 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.76%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $8.23 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Capital One shares have added about 26.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 18.9%.What's Next for Capital One?While Capital One has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Capital One: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. Long term Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 106% in five years. In the last week the share price is up 3.7%.After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals. Check out our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Vertex Pharmaceuticals managed to grow its earnings per share at 70% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 16% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Vertex Pharmaceuticals has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue?

Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 16% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 27. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis maker of Cessna small planes and Bell helicopters is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.20 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +20%.Revenues are expected to be $3.39 billion, up 7.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Textron?For Textron, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -4.01%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Textron will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Textron would post earnings of $0.95 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.05, delivering a surprise of +10.53%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Textron doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, L3Harris (LHX), is soon expected to post earnings of $2.91 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -9.9%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $4.34 billion, up 4.9% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for L3Harris has been revised 0.1% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 1.67%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that L3Harris will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, the story may be different in the June-end quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2023 bottom line has been revised 3.1% downward over the past 60 days.Let’s have a look at the factors likely to have affected NSC’s performance in the quarter under review.Norfolk Southern Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Norfolk Southern Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseNorfolk Southern Corporation price-eps-surprise | Norfolk Southern Corporation Quote We expect high operating expenses (our estimate indicates a 0.5% increase from second-quarter 2022 actuals) to have dented NSC’s bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter. High fuel costs are also likely to affect results. Even though fuel price has come down from the highs witnessed earlier, it still remains at an elevated level. The Zacks consensus estimate for quarterly earnings indicates an 8.7% decline year over year.Due to high costs, the operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues) is likely to have deteriorated year over year. Our second-quarter 2023 estimate for the metric is currently pegged at 64.3% compared with 60.9% reported in second-quarter 2022. A lower value of the metric is preferable.Supply-chain disruptions and slower network velocity are expected to have weighed on volumes in the quarter to be reported.  Our estimate indicates a 7% decline from second-quarter 2022 actuals.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Norfolk Southern this time around.

Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma breaks down what analysts and investors will be watching for.Video TranscriptALEXANDRA CANAL: We have some big food names reporting. Who's up first?BROOKE DIPALMA: Absolutely. Well, Domino's kicks off next week, earnings block of fast food and fast casual companies, followed by Chipotle out on Wednesday, McDonald's out before the bell on Thursday, and Sweetgreen after the bell. Now, taking a closer look at what exactly analysts are expecting in terms of these big players.Domino's expects low same-store sales growth. But ultimately, this is just a low hurdle for Domino's to get over many on the street, waiting to hear more about the Uber Eats partnership that many think will benefit same-store sales growth later on this year or rather in 2024 and beyond. Chipotle, in addition to that, of course, as we noted before, they're set to report on Wednesday after the bell. Same-store sales up there expected to be nearly up 8%. They're expected to regain market share as they kept prices below peers in 2023. So ultimately, benefiting from that value advantage that they now have over their competitors.But food inflation continues to weigh in the company. Beef, right now, makes up about 20% of their food basket. Avocado makes up about 9%. Both are seeing higher prices. But in the call, we're also hoping to hear more color on the expansion into Middle East.And moving right along, McDonald's continues to gain foot traffic because of that lower income audience, in addition to a tighter consumer wallet. We expect same-store sales to be up more than 9% there, led by international same-store sales growth. Of course, menu pricing and market share gain continues to be a play for them. And we're just waiting to hear more on that grimace shake and how that blew off absolute expectations of how it performed in the month of June. Also, that's expected to carry on into early July.Story continuesAnd we're set to close out the week with Sweetgreen. They're set to report Thursday after the bell. Of course, this past quarter, they launched that chicken and Chipotle bowl. In addition to that, they did take an additional 1% pricing at the beginning of the quarter. They also launched a loyalty program. But tomato and chicken costs, they're lowering now. So that's something Wall Street is looking out for.SEANA SMITH: The grimace milkshake, have you tried it yet?ALEXANDRA CANAL: I have not. And I think it's gone already.BROOKE DIPALMA: I haven't.SEANA SMITH: It's gone already? I know it looks so good.ALEXANDRA CANAL: It was all plain vanilla. I like plain vanilla.SEANA SMITH: You are?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, I know--BROOKE DIPALMA: They're also coming out with a Peanut Butter McFlurry, rumor has it. So--SEANA SMITH: I saw your tweet about that. That looks so good. And that's right up my alley. All right. Brooke, you're also keeping an eye across the consumer staple sector. We heard Pepsi, they reported last week, got off to a pretty strong start. Coca-Cola's on deck next week, right?BROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah. Coca-Cola, Keurig, Dr. Pepper, as well as Mondelez, all on deck for next week. And what we're really looking to gain further insight to is really pricing power that these companies have over consumers. All these companies continue to increase prices. And now, they're seeing volumes. For example, PepsiCo last week saw volumes decline for the past, I believe, three quarters.And so really what we're seeing here is ultimately how they continue to raise prices and how exactly volumes continue to remain to slow down or rather lower in these upcoming quarters. Of course, Coca-Cola, their price makes up nearly 7.5%. Keurig, Dr. Pepper, price is up nearly 7% year-over-year. But volumes occurring Dr. Pepper expected to drop nearly 3%. And so really, when will the consumer stop putting up with these higher prices? And when can we expect prices to drop year-over-year, if at all?]"

The major banks started the season with better-than-expected results, helping drive positive sentiment.And next week, we’ll hear from The Coca-Cola Co. KO on Wednesday, July 26th, before the market’s open.We’re all familiar with the consumer staples titan, whose strong brand equity, marketing, research, and innovation have helped it to garner a market share of more than 40% in the non-alcoholic beverage industry.But how does it stack up heading into its quarterly release? We can use results from a peer who has already reported, PepsiCo PEP, as a small gauge. Let’s take a closer look.PepsiCo Q2PepsiCo posted better-than-expected Q2 results thanks to strong consumer demand trends, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate by more than 7%. Quarterly revenue totaled $22.3 billion, 3% above expectations and improving by a solid 10% year-over-year.Undoubtedly worth highlighting, the better-than-expected results represented the company’s 6th consecutive double-beat.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company’s diversified portfolio remained a source of strength throughout the quarter; global beverages and convenience foods businesses saw 11% and 15% organic revenue growth, respectively. And to top it off, PEP’s core gross profit grew 13% on the back of a 130-bp expansion within its core gross margin.CEO Ramon Laguarta said, “We are very pleased with our performance for the second quarter as our business momentum remains strong. As a result, we now expect our full-year organic revenue to increase 10 percent (previously 8 percent) and our core constant currency EPS to increase 12 percent (previously 9 percent).” The full-year guidance upgrade is certainly a major positive, reflecting the favorable position that the company currently resides in.The results impressed the market, with PEP shares seeing a nice boost post-earnings. This is illustrated in the chart below.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNow, let’s take a look at how estimates stack up for Coca-ColaCoca-Cola Q2Analysts have taken their expectations marginally higher over the last several months, with the $0.72 per share estimate up 1.4% and suggesting year-over-year growth of a modest 3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, our consensus revenue estimate presently stands at $11.7 billion, 3.6% higher than year-ago quarterly sales of $11.3 billion. It’s worth noting that the quarterly estimate has been revised a tick higher over the last several months, reflecting optimism.Coca-Cola has consistently delivered better-than-expected results, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate by an average of 4.2% across its last four quarters. Just in its most recent release, the beverage titan delivered an upbeat 4.6% bottom line surprise and reported sales modestly above expectations.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCoca-Cola shares haven’t seen much action in 2023, up a slight 2%.

The company is likely to report top and bottom-line declines when it reports the second-quarter 2023 results.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.59 per share, which suggests a decline of 26.1% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. However, the consensus mark has moved up by a penny in the past seven days. For second-quarter 2023 revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $24.9 billion, suggesting an 8.7% decline from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 22.2%. Its earnings outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 23.4%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.Archer Daniels Midland Company Price and EPS Surprise Archer Daniels Midland Company Price and EPS SurpriseArcher Daniels Midland Company price-eps-surprise | Archer Daniels Midland Company QuoteKey Factors to NoteArcher Daniels has been exposed to headwinds, including higher performance-related compensation, project-related costs and shifting costs from business segments into the centralized centers of excellence in the supply chain and operations. These are likely to have led to a continued rise in SG&amp;A expenses in the to-be-reported quarter. As a percentage of sales, we expect SG&amp;A expenses to increase 30 basis points to 3.3% in the second quarter.The company has also been reeling under the global impacts of inflation. It expects corporate costs for 2023 to be $1.5 billion, driven primarily by inflation and higher interest expenses. This is likely to get reflected in the company’s second-quarter cost performance, impacting margins.Our model predicts the cost of products sold, as a percentage of sales, to expand 100 bps year over year to 93.3% in the second quarter. Lower sales and higher cost of products sold rate are likely to result in a soft gross margin in the quarter. We estimate the gross margin to contract 100 bps to 6.7% in the to-be-reported quarter. On a dollar basis, gross profit is expected to decline 24.2% year over year in the second quarter.The overall Nutrition segment’s results in second-quarter 2023 are expected to be impacted by continued declines in Animal Nutrition performance because of weaker margins in amino acids. The decline is, however, likely to have been partially offset by Human Nutrition delivering almost flat year-over-year results on strong Flavors and SI growth.Nevertheless, Archer Daniels has been gaining from solid demand, improved productivity, product innovations and persistent growth. On its last reported quarter’s earnings call, management revealed its expectations of strong demand for vegetable oil and ethanol, driven largely by robust demand for biodiesel and renewable diesel.ADM expects resilient food demand to drive higher volumes and margins in starches, sweeteners and wheat milling. It expects positive contributions from productivity and innovation initiatives across the company, driving value throughout 2023. Gains from these efforts are also likely to have contributed to the company’s second-quarter performance.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Archer Daniels this season.

407,9f68727d-19e0-3418-9cde-560d8ae926a9,MHK,2023-07-21,Analysts Estimate Mohawk Industries (MHK) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-mohawk-industries-mhk-140201025.html,1689861721,STORY,['MHK'],"[Mohawk Industries (MHK) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 27. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis flooring maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.65 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -39.9%.Revenues are expected to be $2.94 billion, down 6.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.06% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Mohawk Industries?For Mohawk Industries, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.11%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Mohawk Industries will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Mohawk Industries would post earnings of $1.28 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.75, delivering a surprise of +36.72%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Mohawk Industries doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It is believed that the efficiency ratio is positively correlated with the price performance of a company. In fact, efficiency level, which measures a company’s capability to transform available input into output, is often considered an important parameter for gauging its potential to make profits.However, at times, it becomes difficult to measure the efficiency level of a company. This is why one must consider popular efficiency ratios while selecting stocks.These efficiency ratios are:Receivables Turnover:  This is the ratio of 12-month sales to four-quarter average receivables. It shows a company’s potential to extend its credit and collect debt in terms of that credit. A high receivables turnover ratio or the “accounts receivable turnover ratio” or “debtor’s turnover ratio” is desirable as it shows that the company is capable of collecting its accounts receivables or that it has quality customers.Asset Utilization: This ratio indicates a company’s capability to convert assets into output and is thus a widely known measure of efficiency level. It is calculated by dividing total sales over the past 12 months by the last four-quarter average of total assets. Like the above ratios, high asset utilization may indicate that a company is efficient.Inventory Turnover: The ratio of the 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a four-quarter average inventory is considered one of the most popular efficiency ratios. It indicates a company’s ability to maintain a suitable inventory position. While a high value indicates that the company has a relatively low level of inventory compared to COGS, a low value indicates that the company is facing declining sales, which has resulted in excess inventory.Story continuesOperating Margin: This efficiency measure is the ratio of operating income over the past 12 months to sales over the same period. It measures a company’s ability to control operating expenses. Hence, a high value of the ratio may indicate that the company manages its operating expenses more efficiently than its peers.Here are the top four stocks that made it through the screen:Thermon is engaged in providing engineered thermal solutions, known as heat tracing, for various process industries. Thermon has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 75.8%.TIM is a holding company in Brazil that offers mobile cellular service throughout the territory. TIM has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 31.0%.Weyerhaeuser is one of the leading U.S. forest product companies. Weyerhaeuser has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 28.7%.Timken Steel engages in manufacturing alloy steel, as well as carbon and micro-alloy steel.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Currently, DaVita HealthCare has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Chemed has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that DVA likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than CHE has recently. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.DVA currently has a forward P/E ratio of 15.62, while CHE has a forward P/E of 26.33. We also note that DVA has a PEG ratio of 1.07. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. CHE currently has a PEG ratio of 2.99.Another notable valuation metric for DVA is its P/B ratio of 9.31. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, CHE has a P/B of 9.33.Story continuesThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to DVA's Value grade of A and CHE's Value grade of C.DVA sticks out from CHE in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that DVA is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

How will the People and Culture organization help to achieve it?A: As employees, we spend a lot of our time at work, so it is important to have a place that is safe, free from discrimination and where people feel like they can bring their whole selves to work. People want to work for purpose-driven companies they can be proud of and that offer an enticing employee value proposition. Finally, how the company gives back to communities is critical. I love the fact that our Advancing Good corporate citizenship program is committed to using our global reach to positively impact the world and that our actions help fulfill community needs. Millions of people around the world use our products every day, so we have the potential and responsibility to use this scale and reach for positive change.Q: How do you believe DEI can help organizations thrive?A: DEI is absolutely vital to business. After all, the most successful companies mirror the communities in which they operate. Few companies publicly commit to achieve parity goals. Our company's pledge to achieve parity within ten years is impressive and signals our commitment and leadership in DEI. Our DEI goals and programs are about opening doors for everyone and reducing bias. We believe DEI is a strength, helping us achieve our business goals and ensuring our future success. While we have made progress, we still have work to do. As we go forward, we are mindful that we have to continually evaluate our processes and procedures to ensure we do not become complacent. People want to work in a place where they feel welcome, wanted and valued for their input. Organizations that focus on DEI create an environment where people want to stay and thrive. Inevitably, these companies are among the most successful.Story continuesQ: What are some key areas of focus for your team in the near and long term?A: Our People and Culture team plays a critical role as a strategic partner to all parts of the business. At the end of the day, people are the heart of our company. Our focus, both now and in the future, is on transforming our culture, enhancing our DEI programs, growing our leaders and improving our HR operations and service delivery. To get there, we need to listen to and learn from employees across our organization about how we can attract, retain, develop and motivate our most important assets. We have the opportunity every day to positively impact people's lives. In turn, this improves our culture and our business success. It's all linked, and I look forward to leading the team that can help make this all happen.OUR GOAL: BY 2032, ACHIEVE GENDER PARITY IN SENIOR LEADERSHIP GLOBALLY AND ENSURE OUR U.S. SENIOR LEADERSHIP REFLECTS THE RATIO OF UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS IN THE GENERAL POPULATIONIn 2022, women represented 22% of global senior leadership roles, which is a 1% increase compared with 2021. In the U.S., 18% of senior leaders were from underrepresented groups in 2022, which is a 1% decrease from the prior year. We are continuing to develop and improve our internal talent programs and, through these efforts, we promoted 16% more women in 2022 than in 2021. Increased promotions of women were the main reason the number of women in senior leadership globally increased in 2022. Additionally, the percentage of diverse employees on our Executive Committee, which reports directly to the CEO, increased from 18% in 2021 to 33% in 2022, and as of February 2023, increased to 40%. Of the 10 members on our Executive Committee, four are women, and together, our CEO and Executive Committee represent six different nationalities.While we are making significant efforts, our progress in 2022 was negatively impacted by increased attrition of women leaders and leaders from underrepresented groups, primarily due to the competitive talent market. We regularly analyze retention to understand attrition drivers and to enhance our employee engagement efforts.We will continue to focus on enhancing our hiring, promotion and retention practices. With respect to hiring, we expanded our existing senior-level hiring practices to a larger group of positions. These practices include broader recruiting efforts, diverse interview panels and candidate slates, standardized interview questions and hiring-manager training.We recognize that building talent pipelines and transforming culture takes time. We believe with the programs we have implemented, we are on track to achieve our interim goals of increasing the number of female senior leaders globally and the number of underrepresented senior leaders in the U.S. by 50% by 2027, relative to a 2022 baseline.GLOBAL EMPLOYEE GENDER REPRESENTATIONIN SENIOR LEADER AND PROFESSIONAL POSITIONS2022MenWomenTotal global employees81%19%Senior leaders78%22%Professionals67%33%U.S. EMPLOYEE ETHNICITY REPRESENTATION IN SENIOR LEADER AND PROFESSIONAL POSITIONS2022Non-UnderrepresentedUnderrepresentedTotal U.S employees67%33%Senior leaders82%18%Professionals65%35%Data is as of December 31, 2022 and excludes temporary workers.

LYB has announced to acquire 50% share in Stiphout Industries, which operates a facility in Montfort, the Netherlands. Stiphout has an annual processing capacity equivalent to the total amount of plastic packaging waste generated by more than 500,000 Dutch citizens.This buyout is in line with LYB’s strategy of investing in recycling and plastic waste processing companies to supplement its existing assets in the Netherlands and Germany as well as with its integrated hub model. In addition, LyondellBasell can utilize local logistics and operational benefits with its Quality Circular Polymers business through this alliance. It also opens up opportunities for LyondellBasell to further expand its CirculenRecover portfolio, delivering solutions for customers and brand owners in support of their circular and low-carbon goals.Stiphout has solidified itself as an innovative player in the Netherlands by converting plastic household waste into clean flakes of recycled polypropylene and high-density polyethylene materials. The collaboration with LyondellBasell will enable it to improve its commercial and operational excellence.Shares of LYB have gained 4.9% over the past year compared with 12% growth of its industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company anticipates a slight increase in global demand driven by usual seasonal trends.  The demand for transportation fuels is expected to increase over the summer, supporting oxyfuels and refining margins.  Delays at the beginning of industry-wide capacity expansions for polyethylene in North America are likely to lower new market supply and support polyethylene margins.  In order to keep pace with the market expectation, LyondellBasell estimates operating Intermediates &amp; Derivatives assets at 80% and modestly raise global olefins and polyolefins operating rates to 85%.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Taylor Morrison Home (TMHC) earns a Zacks Rank #2 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.70 a share, just six days from its upcoming earnings release on July 26, 2023.Taylor Morrison Home's Earnings ESP sits at 2.41%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.70 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.66.TMHC is one of just a large database of Construction stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Vulcan Materials (VMC).Slated to report earnings on August 3, 2023, Vulcan Materials holds a #2 (Buy) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $2.03 a share 14 days from its next quarterly update.Story continuesFor Vulcan Materials, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.92 is 5.94%.TMHC and VMC's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

416,a8f3c919-72f4-3be4-889a-9bdca32c7007,CINF,2023-07-21,Cincinnati Financial (CINF) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cincinnati-financial-cinf-reports-next-140239015.html,1689861759,STORY,"['CINF', 'ACGL']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Cincinnati Financial (CINF) reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 27, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.72 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +10.8%.Revenues are expected to be $2.19 billion, up 10.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.25% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Cincinnati Financial?For Cincinnati Financial, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -18.97%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Cincinnati Financial will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Cincinnati Financial would post earnings of $0.68 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.89, delivering a surprise of +30.88%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Cincinnati Financial doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerArch Capital Group (ACGL), another stock in the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.65 for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +23.1%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $3.14 billion, up 29.7% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Arch Capital has been revised 19.9% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 1.57%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Arch Capital will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Welcome to the Richardson Electronics earnings call for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised today's conference is being recorded.I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ed Richardson. Please go ahead.Edward J. RichardsonGood morning and welcome to Richardson Electronics conference call for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. Joining me today are Robert Ben, Chief Financial Officer; Wendy Diddell, Chief Operating Officer and General Manager for Richardson Healthcare; Greg Peloquin, General Manager of our Power and Microwave Technologies group and our newest business unit, Green Energy Solutions; and Jens Ruppert, General Manager of Canvys. As a reminder, this call is being recorded and will be available for playback.I would also like to remind you that we'll be making forward-looking statements. They're based on current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties. Therefore, our actual results could be materially different. Please refer to our press release and SEC filings for an explanation of our risk factors.Fiscal year 2023 was one of the best years in our 76-year history. Operating income increased year-over-year by nearly 57% on a 16.9% increase in net sales, reflecting the power of our financial model. This growth demonstrates the success of our long-term growth strategy, especially considering a fluid global economic environment, supply chain challenges, and significant product and wage inflation. Over the past 3 years, we pursued organic growth strategies, focused on expanding our product lines and leveraging the deep relationships we have with 20,000 customers all over the world. We've also greatly enhanced our engineering and manufacturing resources and capabilities. The success of these strategies has transformed our business by increasing our scale and significantly improving our profitability.Since fiscal 2020, annual sales have increased from $155.9 million to $262.7 million, representing a compound annual growth of 19%. We've also significantly enhanced the profitability of our business. Our gross margin has remained stable. We've controlled expenses. SG&amp;A as a percentage of annual revenue was 32.9% for the year ended May 30, 2020, compared to 22.4% at May 27, 2023, the year we just finished.Positive operating leverage has transformed the profitability as we've grown from an operating loss of [$1.7 million] in fiscal 2020 to an operating income of nearly $25 million in fiscal 2023. Most importantly, the growth we've achieved over the last 3 fiscal years and more recently in fiscal 2023 has been driven by new products and applications development, new customer growth, and expanded relationships with our global customer base. The launch of our Green Energy Solutions business this year is a notable example of our successful strategies as GES sales in fiscal 2023 grew by 110%. Not only did this support our performance in fiscal 2023, but our GES segment has further diversified our business and it's helping us insulate from the challenging semiconductor wafer fab market. While we expect the semiconductor wafer fab market to remain challenging over the next several quarters, we're excited by the significant opportunities we're pursuing all over our business units. We continue to develop new products and expand our global customer base. These products include power management systems for wind turbines, electric locomotives, hydrogen power, and synthetic diamonds. We believe our continued growth of our GES business will help offset the expected 2024 decrease in the semiconductor wafer fab equipment business.Today, nearly 60% of our revenue comes from products we manufacture or have manufactured exclusively for us. Ultracapacitors and lithium iron phosphate battery modules, magnetrons, CT tubes and many other tubes and related products are manufactured by us in LaFox, Illinois. We engineer and manufacture custom display solutions for medical applications in Boston and Germany. To accommodate this growth, we continue to hire talented engineers with a focus on new product development.We're also adding manufacturing capacity through our LaFox facility renovation, which is expected to be completed this week. Recently, we had key OEM customers joined by their end users visit our operations here in LaFox. Each walked away with a list of products and opportunities they want us to explore in addition to the products they purchased from us today. We're excited to show off our completely renovated building at our upcoming Investor Open House scheduled for August 22.Now, Greg, Wendy and Jens will provide more details on the quarter and fiscal year, including these key growth initiatives. First, Bob Ben, our Chief Financial Officer, will review our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 financial performance in more detail.Story continuesRobert J. BenThank you, Ed, and good morning. I will review our financial results for our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023, followed by a review of our cash position. In addition, please note that I will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures. I refer you to our fourth quarter fiscal year 2023 press release for a reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the comparable GAAP measures.Net sales for the fourth quarter fiscal 2023 were down 4.5% to $58.8 million, compared to net sales of $61.6 million in the prior year's fourth quarter due to lower net sales in our PMT, Canvys and Healthcare business units, partially offset by higher sales in our GES business unit.Net sales for GES increased $5.8 million, or 61.7%, from last year's fourth quarter. GES combines our key technology partners and engineered solution capabilities to design and manufacture products for the fast-growing green energy market and power management applications. PMT sales decreased by $8.3 million, or 20.8%, from last year's fourth quarter, driven by primarily a decline from manufactured products for our semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment customers. Canvys sales decreased slightly by $0.3 million, or 3.2%, due to the timing of shipments in North America. Richardson Healthcare sales also decreased slightly by $0.1 million, or 2.7%, due to decreases in parts and equipment sales, partially offset by higher CT tube sales.Total company backlog was $160.4 million at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 versus $175.1 million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 27.9% of net sales, compared to 32.7% in last year's fourth quarter. PMT's margin decreased to 29.0% from 35.2%, primarily due to product mix. GES's margin decreased in the fourth quarter fiscal 2023 to 23.4% from 31.1% in the prior year's fourth quarter, also due to product mix. Canvys gross margin increased in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 to 32.9% from 30.7% in the prior year's fourth quarter because of product mix and lower freight costs. Healthcare's gross margin increased to 23.7% in the fourth quarter fiscal 2023, compared to 10.8% in the prior year's fourth quarter due to improved manufacturing absorption, partially offset by increased scrap expense.Operating expenses were $15.0 million for the fourth quarter fiscal 2023 compared to $15.2 million in the fourth quarter fiscal 2022. The decrease in operating expenses resulted from tight expense control and lower incentive expenses from significantly lower operating income, partially offset by higher salaries expense, which included wage inflation.The company reported operating income of $1.4 million, or 2.4% of net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, versus operating income of $5.0 million, or 8.1% of net sales in the fourth quarter of last year. Other income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, including interest income and foreign exchange, was $0.1 million compared to other expense of $0.2 million in the fourth quarter fiscal 2022.Income tax benefit was $2.6 million and non-GAAP income tax benefit was $0.2 million for the fourth quarter fiscal 2023 versus an income tax benefit of $3.5 million and non-GAAP income tax expense of $0.5 million in the prior year's fourth quarter. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 included $0.4 million for an R&amp;D tax credit for the current fiscal year and a one-time total credit of $0.6 million for fiscal years 2020 through 2022. In addition, the fourth quarter fiscal 2023 included a one-time $1.8 million income tax benefit for the reversal of the foreign tax credit valuation allowance.Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 was $4.1 million and non-GAAP net income was $1.8 million compared to net income of $8.3 million and non-GAAP net income of $4.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Earnings per common share diluted were $0.27 and non-GAAP earnings per common share diluted were $0.11 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to earnings per common share diluted of $0.59 and non-GAAP earnings per common share diluted of $0.31 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.Turning to a review of the results for fiscal year 2023. Net sales for fiscal year 2023 were $262.7 million, an increase of 16.9% from $224.6 million in fiscal year 2022. Net sales increased by $8.9 million, or 5.7% for PMT, $25 million, or 110.5% for GES, $4.1 million, or 11.8% for Canvys, and $0.1 million, or 0.5% for Richardson Healthcare.Gross margin for fiscal 2023 was 31.9% of net sales, the same as during fiscal 2022. Operating expenses were $58.7 million for the fiscal year, which represented an increase of $3.0 million from last fiscal year. The increase in operating expenses resulted from higher employee compensation and travel expenses, including additional incentives expense due to strong profitability. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to 22.4% during fiscal 2023 as compared to 24.8% during fiscal 2022.Operating income for fiscal year 2023 was $25.0 million, or 9.5% of net sales, as compared to an operating income of $16.0 million, or 7.1% of net sales for fiscal year 2022. Other income for fiscal 2023, including interest income and foreign exchange, was less than $0.1 million as compared to other expense of $0.2 million for fiscal 2022. Income tax expense was $2.7 million and non-GAAP income tax expense was $5.0 million for fiscal 2023. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 included $0.4 million for an R&amp;D tax credit for the current fiscal year and a one-time total credit of $0.6 million for fiscal years 2020 through 2022. In addition, the fourth quarter fiscal 2023 included a one-time $1.8 million income tax benefit for the reversal of the foreign tax credit valuation allowance. The income tax benefit of $2.2 million for fiscal 2022 resulted from the $4.0 million partial reversal of the tax valuation allowance due to evidence of profitability for realizing a portion of the deferred tax assets in the future. The non-GAAP income tax expense for fiscal 2022 was $1.8 million.The company reported net income for fiscal 2023 of $22.3 million and non-GAAP net income of $20.0 million versus net income of $17.9 million and non-GAAP net income of $13.9 million during fiscal 2022. Earnings per common share diluted were $1.55 and non-GAAP earnings per common share diluted were $1.39 for fiscal 2023 compared to earnings per common share diluted of $1.31 and non-GAAP earnings per common share diluted of $1.02 for fiscal 2022.Moving to a review of our cash position. Cash and investments at the end of fiscal 2023 were $25.0 million compared to $24.6 million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and $40.5 million at the end of fiscal 2022. Cash generated of $0.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable, partially offset by an increase in inventory. The use of cash during the fiscal year related to higher working capital to support significant sales growth. U.S. cash and investments were $7.6 million at the end of fiscal 2023 versus $8.9 million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and $25.5 million at the end of fiscal 2022. Capital expenditures were $2.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 versus $1.0 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Approximately $2.2 million related to investments in manufacturing, including facility expansion and included the renovation of our office space.Total capital expenditures were $7.4 million in fiscal 2023 as compared to $3.1 million in fiscal 2022. We paid $0.8 million in cash dividends in the fourth quarter and a total of $3.3 million in fiscal year 2023. In addition, based on our current financial position, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per common share, which will be paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. As of the end of fiscal 2023, the company had not made any draws on its $30 million revolving line of credit with PNC Bank.Now I will turn the call over to Greg, who will discuss the results for our PMT and GES business groups.Gregory J. PeloquinThank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. In fiscal year 2023, Power and Microwave Technologies or PMT, and Green Energy Solutions, or GES, performed well with excellent growth in all aspects of the business. PMT revenue grew 5.7%, while GES revenue increased 110.5%. The major highlight in the fourth quarter was our GES Group as it continues to drive strong growth with addition of new products, new programs and new customers. Our GES Group had exceptional growth throughout the quarter as the demand for green energy applications such as wind energy, electric locomotives, energy storage and power management greatly increased. We continue to apply focus and resources to this extremely important strategic business unit and the growth opportunity it represents for Richardson Electronics.GES sales were up 61.7% in Q4 FY '23 at $15.3 million versus $9.5 million last fiscal year. Our backlog is strong at $42.9 million. Revenues in GES include numerous successful products such as the ULTRA3000, EV locomotive battery modules, ULTRAGEN3000 and products used in synthetic diamond manufacturing and other green advancements such as hydrogen production and electric vehicles. In addition, we have numerous products in design, prototype and beta testing.In the quarter, we continued to sign global technology partners and announced new patents and programs. We continually evaluate technologies to ensure we offer our customers the best, most up-to-date solutions for their applications. In Q4, we announced the ULTRAPEM multi-brand module for several non-GE wind turbine platforms. We received a third patent on ULTRA3000, and we announced that GE Vernova has selected the ULTRA3000 as the exclusive pitch energy module for the GE marketplace, increasing our served available market.We also announced the ULTRAUPS3000 used in wind turbines and other power management applications. This strategy of developing niche products and technologies is key to our long-term success. The growth of customers and products in GES continues as our design teams are in discussions with several major OEMs weekly regarding the development of energy storage products and other green energy applications.PMT sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 decreased 20.8%, reaching $31.5 million versus $39.8 million in Q4 of last fiscal year. This decline was mainly due to the major slowdown in our semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment business. The team has been supporting this semiconductor wafer fabrication business and its customers for well over 25 years. This business has always been cyclical, and we expected to see a slowdown in 2023. However, in talking to our customers, they expect the business to start recovering in the first half of calendar year 2024.Our engineered solutions strategy is led by our global technology partners such as Qorvo, MACOM, Nokia Wave, LS Materials, AMOGREENTECH, Navitas Semiconductor and Fuji Semiconductor. Key tube manufacturers and partners include CPI, Thales, the Nisshinbo Micro Devices and Photonis. Each of our global partners help us meet and manage customers' requirements. Our team has done an excellent job identifying and cultivating these relationships. We will continue to add partners who fill technology gaps in our offering and support our growth. In Q4, we added ConductRF, a leader in RF cable assemblies. These key technology partners not only fill technology gaps in our component and engineered solutions offering, but they also give us continued source of supply of new technologies to support all these new opportunities. Often through these partnerships, we identify opportunities for new products that we design to manufacture in-house, increasing the value we provide customers and allowing us to capture more market share and revenue.We also continue to invest in our infrastructure to support our growth. We are bringing on talented design and field engineers and making investments to enhance our manufacturing capabilities. Our growing in-house design engineering and manufacturing teams are doing a great job supporting increased demand for current products and new product designs. I am pleased with the progress we are making. With this team, we will continue to identify, develop and introduce new products and technologies for green energy and other power management applications.Our growth strategy has been proven successful over the years, and we will continue to develop new products as well as increase our customer base, revenue and profits by capitalizing on our existing demand creation infrastructure. Our belief in our future based on customer forecast and inputs requires us to strategically invest in inventory that positions us in order to fill the pipeline and ensure we can meet our customers' needs through close collaboration with both our customers and suppliers. There are always headwinds, but we carefully manage these. We are prudently aligning with the business for a slowdown in the semiconductor wafer fab market over the near term, while maintaining our core competencies to support our wafer fab customers, where the market is expected to recover in calendar year 2024.Much of the green energy business is project-based and rollouts are dependent on our customers as well as our customers' CapEx requirements. For example, we shipped over $18 million in products in FY '23 to our electric locomotive customers, which they are using to build their prototypes. These trains will be finished and shipped to their customers in Q2 FY '24. New production orders are expected until Q4 FY '24. Also finding enough design and field engineering talent to support this growth continues to be a challenge. However, with Richardson's unique global model, continued growth and with our technology partners and our focused strategy, we will subsidize the project-based business with products we engineer and manufacture to a very diverse customer base to have a more consistent improved profitability with top line annual growth.We also continue to grow by gaining market share, introducing new products and technology partners and expanding the value we provide to our customers worldwide. I cannot stress enough the value of this electronics model to our customers and suppliers. Our unparalleled capability and global go-to-market strategy are unique to the power and energy, RF and microwave and green energy markets. We have developed a strong business model, including legacy products and new technology partners that fit with our engineered solutions capabilities. Through our steadfast and greater focus on customers, we will continue to excel by taking advantage of opportunities when they arise. The execution of this strategy has never been better. There is no question that our customers and technology partners need Richardson's products and support more than ever. We continue to be very excited about the future as opportunities and our market share for PMT and GES continue to grow.And with that, I'll turn it over to Wendy Diddell to discuss Richardson Healthcare.Wendy S. DiddellThanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter sales for healthcare were $2.8 million, slightly lower than fourth quarter sales last year of $2.9 million. CT tube sales were higher in the quarter versus the same quarter last year. Parts and system sales were both down. On a full year basis, healthcare sales were $11.4 million, just slightly above the prior year. System sales exceeded the prior year where part sales were down. CT tube sales were down less than 5% compared to last year.Gross margin in the fourth quarter improved significantly to 23.7% versus 10.8% in Q4 of last year, primarily reflecting better factory utilization. Last year, we were forced to stop production for a period due to supplier quality issues. On a full year basis, gross margin was 30.7% and meaningful improvement over 21.2% last year. Much of the growth in gross margin was again due to positive production variances in FY '23, stemming from enhanced operations.Scrap, while still high for the year, also decreased over prior year. We are pleased with the improvement in gross margin as an indicator that we've ironed out many of the production challenges we've had in the past. We also want to point out that healthcare's SG&amp;A for the year was significantly below prior year. These savings, combined with the improved margin, resulted in reduced operating loss for healthcare compared to both our planned loss and our performance last year.We continue to make excellent progress on the Siemens repaired tube program. This is a series of 4 tube types, including the Straton Z, MX, MXP and MX P46. The Siemens installed base is considerably larger than Canon's and there are no third-party replacement options for these tube types. The repaired Straton Z is now in full production and performing well in the field. We expect sales to rise gradually in the coming quarters based on early discussions with key customers. We are making excellent progress as well on the repaired Siemens MX series with a high degree of confidence that these will launch in the 2023 calendar year. We know demand is strong based on discussions we've had with our customers. As noted in prior calls, the Siemens program is a critical element for our healthcare business unit to reach its goal of providing a positive operating contribution to the company by Q4 of FY '24.Several new programs that will further improve CT tube sales and factory utilization are still underway. These programs include reloading tubes in Brazil. We continue to work our way through the local registration process. We are also partnering with an international company to reload and sell several other types in the Americas. We anticipate these programs may have a small yet positive impact on our revenue in FY '24, depending on how quickly we can validate and achieve regulatory approvals.I will now turn the call over to Jens Ruppert to discuss the results for Canvys.Jens RuppertThanks, Wendy, and good morning, everyone. Canvys engineers, manufactures and sells custom displays to original equipment manufacturers in industrial and medical markets throughout the world. Canvys's performance remains excellent with sales of $9.2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. This reflects continued strong customer demand globally.Sales grew by 11.8% to $39.4 million in fiscal year 2023, the highest revenue since fiscal year 2012 due to increased demand globally and the continued addition of new customers and programs. This was a remarkable accomplishment considering ongoing supply chain and global economic challenges.Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 32.9% during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, compared to 30.7% during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. The increase in gross margin was primarily related to the more favorable mix of higher margin products. Our fiscal year 2023 gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased slightly to 31.5% from 32.0% in fiscal year 2022. The decrease in gross margin was related to product mix and higher component costs, which impacted many companies around the globe, including Canvys.Our backlog remains extremely healthy, which we expect to support strong sales throughout fiscal 2024. Given the number of projects currently in the engineering stage, we are well positioned for continued growth. Our expectations assume no impact from current supply chain obstacles, and demand is not negatively impacted by any potential recessionary pressures.During the quarter, we received several new orders from both existing and first time medical OEM customers. Some of these applications include ocular biometry, corneal crosslinking, refractive surgery, HMI to control medical devices within the operating theater, prostate biopsy, [isotrepsy], dental treatment chairs, surgical navigation and laparoscopy. In the nonmedical space, our products are used in a variety of commercial and industrial applications. These include flight simulators, displays used in control rooms, human machine interfaces for ticketing machines and teleprompting, talent monitors and clocks.I'm immensely proud of our teams around the world, and I am extremely pleased with their exceptional operating performance. Our strong and growing customer relationships, along with the backlog, position us for future growth in fiscal 2024 and beyond. From the variety of customers and applications, as well as the value of orders from existing and new customers, it is clear we offer our global customers outstanding products and localized service. While our sales organizations stay focused on new opportunities, I stay focused on improving the operating performance of the division. Maximizing cash flow and improving Canvys's profitability is an ongoing priority, and we continue to work closely with our partners to meet the demands of our customers.I will now turn the call back over to Ed.Edward J. RichardsonCongratulations, Jens, you and your team on setting another new sales record for Canvys and our custom display solutions. You and your team have aggressively attacked the medical OEM market and provided them with solutions they can't find anywhere else.As you've heard from Bob, Ben and the business unit leaders, FY '23 was phenomenal. While the semiconductor wafer fab cycle is expected to impact near-term PMT sales, we believe we're well positioned to navigate the challenging market cycle. We continue to pursue organic growth strategies that leverage our global customer and supplier relationships, provide our customers with more engineered solutions, and expand our manufacturing resources and capabilities. As a result, we're excited about the opportunities we have in front us to significantly grow sales over the next 3 years and beyond. In addition, with our talented team and compelling products, I'm more confident about the direction we're headed than at any time as CEO of Richardson Electronics, which, by the way, has been 61 years.We continue to manage expenses and carefully evaluate every dollar we spend to ensure we're protecting our cash and maximizing our return. Our intent in FY '24 is to use our cash to fund our key growth initiatives while taking advantage of the money we've deployed so far. We firmly believe that developing solutions in a responsible manner alongside our suppliers and our customers is the key to our future success. We're scrutinizing inventory purchases. We review every capital expenditure and approve every add to staff. We'll continue to explore and benefit from our favorable tax programs that support our green energy solutions.At this time, we'll be happy to answer some questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Michael Hughes with SGF Capital Management.Michael E. HughesEd, can you talk about the revenue generated from the semi cap equipment business in the just completed fiscal year and what your expectation is for the coming year?Edward J. RichardsonYes, it was approximately $40 million, which included Lam Research, Applied Materials, Tokyo Electron, MKS, Thales, a number of firms. If you had heard the press release from Lam, because of the CHIPS Act that Congress passed, they said their business would be down about 30% in the coming year, primarily because they couldn't ship high-tech equipment to China. Since that time, they've come out with a much more optimistic forecast, saying that by the end of 2024, that their business will even be stronger than where it's been in the past. And they've even gone so far to tell their vendors, we'll help support you financially to make sure you have the resources to supply our products when we need them.Michael E. HughesSo $40 million in the just completed year. Do you have a ballpark number that we can think about for the coming year?Edward J. RichardsonYes, we're forecasting about $20 million. And that may [not true] but right now that's what it looks like.Michael E. HughesSo that's about a $20 million headwind. And just my follow-up, at a recent conference I think you talked about a $290 million number potentially for the coming year. That's a pretty stout headwind. That $20 million coupled with -- it doesn't sound like they're going to be in rail orders, additional rail orders until the fourth quarter. Is that what Greg said? So just kind of maybe talk about the top line number for the coming year.Edward J. RichardsonWe think that there's enough business and various projects that we're working on in green energy that will more than compensate for the loss of business in the semi fab area. We have projects going not only for wind turbines, was originally GE wind turbines, now Siemens wind turbines. We've been an approved source for GE for all of their customers. They tell us they have 800 on their electronic systems. In addition, we're making energy storage systems and we're working in the cellular field.As you know, we're working on the electric locomotives both for Progress Rail and Wabtec, which is the old General Electric facility. Each one of the diesel locomotives has what's called a battery start, and those are lead acid batteries, like 50x what you'd have in a car. And we've developed either an ultra capacitor module or a lithium iron phosphate battery pack to replace those that gives them from 7 to 10 years life. And we're in a prototype beta system on those and project that that could be very substantial in the future.There's something like 30 million to 40 million diesel engines in use in the United States. So the replacement for those units is $3,000 to $5,000 apiece. You can just imagine what the potential is.Wendy S. DiddellWe should just clarify [$1,000 million]. We wish there were $30 million or $40 million.Edward J. Richardson(inaudible)Wendy S. Diddell(inaudible)Michael E. HughesOur next question comes from Anja Soderstrom with Sidoti.Anja Marie Theresa SoderstromCan you just talk about the gross margin opportunity and how we should think about that in the coming years?Robert J. BenI think overall our gross margin will run about 32%, somewhere in that area. And that's a mix with all of our businesses. Certainly the semi fab business, which is very profitable, reduces our margin, but we pick it up on the Green Energy Solutions where the business, particularly for wind turbines and energy storage systems and also the battery starts, is quite profitable.Wendy S. DiddellTo add on to that, Anja, I think in the FY '24, as Ed mentioned, the semiconductor market has always been very profitable for us. So we'd be looking at a gross margin more in the 30% range for the (inaudible) to recover back into the range that Ed was pointing out.Anja Marie Theresa SoderstromOkay. But since the GES is a little bit lumpy, right, that could pressure the margin in the near term as well. But as that revenue comes in, that should help the margins, right?Edward J. RichardsonThe issue is not a matter of if, it's obvious these programs are all in progress, it's a matter of when and how quickly they'll be rolled out.Anja Marie Theresa SoderstromAnd that will also help the gross margin.Edward J. RichardsonThat's right.Anja Marie Theresa SoderstromSo it should be improving sequentially. Okay. And then in terms of the inventory, is there any way you -- is there any risk to that inventory or can you get help from your customers in terms of financing that?Edward J. RichardsonWell, we've worked out programs with our suppliers. Greg, you might mention the 1 program you have where we have 180-day terms.Gregory J. PeloquinYes. With all of our technology partners, we have zero liability. We have complete stock rotation of the product for the components. On the engineered solutions side, we've developed great payment terms because as we're all dealing with, it's project based, and due to leadx, we're collecting inventory. But there might be 1 or 2 parts that have, to this day, 30-week lead times. And so they've been very good in working with us because we are designing disruptive technology for them. And so we've gotten good payment terms. So even though the inventory might be up in a certain situation, if it is, we usually have signed either special terms or some sort of stock rotation capability if the product does not move at a certain date.OperatorOur next question comes from P Ross Taylor with ARS Investment Partners.Porter Ross TaylorA couple of quick questions, 1, you talked about the idea of seeing semi cap equipment revenues drop from $40 million to $20 million. We own, in our larger cap products, a number of the semi cap equipment companies, and pretty universally they see the quarter we're currently in as the trough revenue quarter. So would you explain to me why we should see revenues dropping meaningfully over coming quarters when they actually see revenues, or they're expecting revenues to ramp over the next 3, 4 quarters pretty sequentially?Edward J. RichardsonWell, we based that on the first 2 quarters. And you're right. We've heard that they think the trough is in the next quarter or 2, and if that happens, then it'll turn up much faster. But we'd rather under promise and over perform than to tell you that it's going to be $30 million, $40 million and it comes in at $20 million.Porter Ross TaylorYes. I think the Street is a little nervous about that number. And I think it does make -- and part of what I want to highlight is that you have a pretty tight correlation between how AMAT and Lam and the like do. Historically, they've had a pretty close tracking, and so that one would expect that they turn up if this is the nature of their performance, that this quarter that we're in currently should be the nature of yours. Away from that, can you talk to us about green energy? You saw a 60-plus percent, 62% rise in revenues, but only about a 22% increase in operating profit from that business it appears. That's a pretty wide margin spread. Can you give us an idea of which margin? Is this a 30-plus percent margin business, or is this a low mid 20s margin business?Edward J. RichardsonYes, the products altogether in our green energy group is 30-plus percent margin overall. What you saw in the fourth quarter was large shipments of the battery management systems that we shipped to our largest electric locomotive customer. And again, this is prototype build. So this is prototype quantities, prototype products. And that was shipped at a lower margin until we get to economies and scale when we get into the production.And so what we do is, in support of these large customers making us exclusive, we'll give them the production pricing for the, in essence, prototype shipments with a letter of intent. So what we saw was huge shipments to our electric locomotive customers in the fourth quarter, which was a little more, less margin than our overall margin (inaudible).Porter Ross TaylorBut we should expect that margin then to kick back up into the low 30s as we push forward. And you're seeing substantial growth overall in the GES space in the coming year as well, correct?Edward J. RichardsonYes, correct. The balance of the business is in the mid 30s.Porter Ross TaylorOkay. So basically, this is kind of an aberrational quarter. So the hit we saw this current quarter is really kind of a confluence of events, but it should self-correct it going forward.Edward J. RichardsonWe believe so, absolutely.Porter Ross TaylorOkay. And can you talk about backlog? Has the drop in backlog been tied in heavily to semi cap equipment?Edward J. RichardsonYes. We were running with a backlog in the semi equipment business, over $40 million. And as the downturn -- 2 things have happened. Lam, for instance, they took everything they had on order, everything we were manufacturing for them. So we filled their supply chain. And so now you get [a last] in that. But as we did that, our backlog went down and we don't have new orders to replace it.Porter Ross TaylorBut at the same time, they're indicating to you to be prepared to ship everything you can ship.Edward J. RichardsonIn the second 6 months, right?Porter Ross TaylorYes. And they're covering costs. They're doing a lot of -- they see a substantial ramp as we push over the next 12, 18 months in a bigger business -- a bigger business than you saw last year, you think, from them out 18 months.Edward J. RichardsonThat's what they're telling us. That's correct. Lam, in particular, has a vendor conference call once a month. In the last conference call, they had over 300 vendors and they were very optimistic about the second half of calendar 2024 being very strong, even stronger than what they've seen in the past. We've also seen indications from the automotive industry that they still have a shortage on chips. And so that tells you that this semi fab business has to pick up.Porter Ross TaylorIt seems like this has been a tough year, particularly a tough year for shareholders in RELL, but it seems like this is pretty much we're at a (inaudible) in that in fact, if what you see happening happens, if we get the profitability that the upside here should be explosive and quite honestly, probably justifies better than the 12 PE.Edward J. RichardsonAbsolutely.Porter Ross TaylorSo I know you won't do it, but I'm going to ask for it. Can you guys buy back stock? I mean, can you -- you got cash. I understand that you have cash needs outside the US. But I myself might argue that it would make sense to have a net zero cash position or something of that nature and use that as a chance to do a Dutch auction in this market and buy back 1 million, 1.5 million shares. I don't think you'd get it bluntly.I just don't see -- I think once you highlight and people start to actually think about where you're going to be in 12 or 18 months on an earnings power basis, it seems that you should get back on track with where we thought you were going to be at the beginning of this year, which should be enough even to 12x earnings to make the stock 50%, 60% higher than it was but -- at a higher than 12 multiple. It seems that this is a great place to buy stock.Edward J. RichardsonWell, every Board meeting we consider it. As a matter of fact, when we sold RFPD in 2011, we bought $65 million worth of stock back at about $8.Porter Ross TaylorYes. And this strikes me as another opportunity of that nature that you've got a total -- the market is punishing you, equity market is punishing you for things that are self-correcting. And the next 2 years should be a real home run for you guys. So I'll pass that to the Board and I will --Edward J. Richardson(inaudible) price of the stock. We'll see.Porter Ross TaylorWell, today it's down. So when you have your Board meeting, you can.Edward J. RichardsonYes.Porter Ross TaylorOkay.OperatorOur next question comes from Barry Mendel with Mendel Money Management.Barry M. MendelHow are you guys doing?Edward J. RichardsonWell, we'd be better if the price of the stock was higher.Barry M. MendelYes, I hear you. There was no mention of magnetron. I know you guys are increasing capacity substantially at magnetron. Can you talk a little bit about the capacity expansion and what you're seeing there?Edward J. RichardsonYes, the demand for the YJ1600 for synthetic diamonds is far in excess of how many we can manufacture. We have improved our manufacturing process substantially and our yields are back up to normal. And we think as we go along, we can ship. I think we were still back order done like 5000 of those. Of course, that's all dependent upon the quality of the product, which we think we've improved, but the demand is certainly there.Barry M. MendelWhat's your backlog? Do you have a dollar amount that looks in your backlog for that?Edward J. RichardsonI don't know. Wendy, do you know the total backlog for magnetron?Wendy S. DiddellI don't have that handy.Edward J. RichardsonIt used to run about $15 million to $20 million. I'm not sure where it is today, but the YJ1600 sells for average price of about $3,000. And there's roughly 5000 of those in backlog.Barry M. MendelOkay. And what kind of gross margins on that product?Edward J. RichardsonIt runs about 35%.Barry M. MendelSo I would expect to see a substantial increase then in shipments this fiscal year in the magatron versus last year.Edward J. RichardsonYes. That's correct, yes. As long as we don't lose the formula. There's a lot of black magic in tubesBarry M. MendelAnd I assume, Wendy, in healthcare, that you still expect break even by the fourth quarter.Wendy S. DiddellWe see the path to that. We're really excited about the progress we're seeing with the repaired Siemens program, not only from our own internal development perspective, which is going very well, but from the customer response. We've talked to a large number of some of the larger companies that aren't even necessarily buying the Canon tubes from us because they don't service Canon equipment and those can be, obviously, game changers for us. So, lots of interest, making really good progress on the development of the repaired program. So, yes, we still feel good about Q4 at a break-even level.Barry M. MendelOkay. Great.OperatorOur next question comes from [David Schneider] who's a private investor.Unidentified AnalystJust a comment or 2, then a question. Regarding semiconductor demand, there was a news release from Stellantis automotive OEM a day or 2 ago. They're scrambling to ensure supply of semiconductors globally for the next several years. So, just to put a little thought in people's heads is that as vehicles go from internal combustion engine to electric, the semiconductor content increases dramatically. So that's a tailwind for you. Maybe not today, but it's there. And then on a potential buyback, because you do have a small dividend, when you buy back a share, obviously you don't have to pay from after tax cash flow dividend on the buyback shares. So I'm trying to give a little push for that.And wondering on the move towards silicon carbide for automotive for high voltage applications, if what you do with semi cap equipment has anything special with that? And then on the Siemens wind turbines, it's common knowledge that they've been having some problems with a decent percentage of their installed base because they have some real crappy parts in there. So does that actually make them more interested in putting you in as, let's say, an OEM supplier, as opposed to pulling out the lead acid batteries? That's about it for me.Edward J. RichardsonAll right, David, I'll touch on the Siemens question. It has no effect on our discussions with them so far with their network of wind turbines. They also service various wind farms that have different platforms, but we're full speed ahead with them on both the ULTRA UPS, the new product we announced in the fourth quarter, and also the ULTRA3000, our variation of that for their turbines to replace what they currently have in there. So their issues are the same issues as all the owner operators and wind turbine manufacturers have had in terms of replacement costs of batteries that fail every 18 months to 2 years, both in the PEM system and the UPS. And that's what we're focused on. And just today, we shipped over 40,000 ULTRA3000s, and those numbers will be similar as we roll out the UPS to those same customers.Unidentified AnalystOkay. And then the other question was on silicon carbide. Any special impact of that migration on your semiconductor equipment business?Edward J. RichardsonNo, in terms of delivery and parts being available, our technology partners -- and as you know, we have numerous silicon carbide technology partners, we've been fine. We have a major win in the electric vehicle market with VinFast out of Vietnam for their electric car. So we haven't seen, David, anything that would slow down or subdue our opportunities for growth.Unidentified AnalystOkay. All right, that's all I've got for right now.OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Hughes with SGF Capital Management.Michael E. HughesYou don't get a lot of questions on the legacy tube business, but I think it's roughly 40% of revenue. So how did it perform in the just completed fiscal year, and what's the outlook for the coming fiscal year?Edward J. RichardsonWell, including the semiconductor wafer fab, which has tubes in it, and wave guides and microwave devices, it went from $100 million to about $120 million last year, so it was up substantially. And the core tube business is very strong. They told me 25 years ago we wouldn't sell tubes in 5 years, and it was up over 20% this year. And we own about half the commercial market. So we wish there were more businesses like the tube business, but we sell 20,000 customers all over the world. Probably 80% of those products are in aftermarket. So it's a very predictable business.Michael E. HughesSo the core business continues to perform well. And I think what's happened over time is maybe volume is in decline, but you take enough price each year to offset that. Is that how it works?Edward J. RichardsonYes, that's correct.Michael E. HughesOkay. And then on the Green Energy Solutions business, Greg, did you say that the backlog was $43 million? Is that correct?Gregory J. PeloquinYes, the backlog is [$43.-something million]. Yes, correct.Michael E. HughesOkay. I understand that.Edward J. Richardson$43 million.Michael E. HughesOkay. I understand that business is rich with opportunities, but that number was down from, I think, $54 million in the prior quarter. Is that just burning through some of the locomotive revenue? And should we expect a little bit of a pullback in the revenue for that division over the next couple of quarters and then a ramp in the back half?Gregory J. PeloquinThat's exactly what it was. Again, that business, including most of the engineered solutions products in the green energy group is project based. So our bookings were through the roof, as you remember, in the first half of the year and then we designed and built it and shipped it. And so we had huge shipments in Q4 to meet our customers' requirements so they could build their full electric locomotive.So I don't think we'll see production orders, as I mentioned, until Q3, Q4 of next year, large production orders. But we have some other products, I think, as Ed touched on, with other electric locomotive manufacturers that should keep that top line growth going. But that's exactly it. It's project based. You're going to have that. You're going to have huge bookings 1 quarter and then huge shipments a few quarters after that, and then wait for the production. It's all part of the new product introduction process. And these are all, as you know, new products that didn't exist 2 years ago.Michael E. HughesDo you think the backlog that this was a low point and it can grow from here, meaning the book to bill would be north of 1 over the next few quarters for that division?Edward J. RichardsonYes, I think our bookings will be strong in Q1 and Q2 of this fiscal year. And then our top line, I think, will be stronger than any quarter we've seen in the last couple of years in Q3 and Q4.Michael E. HughesOkay. And then last housekeeping question for you. Do you have the backlog for PMT and then Canvys?Jens RuppertThe Canvys is about $40 million.Robert J. Ben$47 million for Canvys? Yes.Michael E. HughesOkay.Jens Ruppert$47 million. Okay.Wendy S. DiddellYes. $47 million for Canvys, PMT in total, but that includes Green Energy Solutions was $111.9 million that we don't have -- I don't have it broken out here on my sheet. And healthcare was $1.7 million.Michael E. HughesOkay. I appreciate it.Edward J. RichardsonYes, actually, I do have the backlog for PMT. It was $69 million and then $42.8 million for a total of both groups of $111 million.Michael E. HughesOkay. Great.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, that's conclude the Q&amp;A portion of today's conference. I'd like to turn the call back over to Ed for any closing remarks.Edward J. RichardsonThanks, Kevin. We appreciate your investment and interest in Richardson Electronics and I'm really pleased with the performance of our teams throughout the entire last year and remain confident we're on the right track for long term growth. We look forward to our ongoing discussions and sharing our fiscal 2024 first quarter with you in October. Please don't hesitate to call us anytime. We're always available to talk to you. Thank you.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, that's conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.]"

421,a0f82109-9ff3-328d-94a1-ca442a6672ce,VLO,2023-07-21,Analysts Estimate Valero Energy (VLO) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-valero-energy-vlo-140241452.html,1689861761,STORY,['VLO'],"[Valero Energy (VLO) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 27. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis oil refiner is expected to post quarterly earnings of $5.08 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -55.3%.Revenues are expected to be $35.24 billion, down 31.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.54% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Valero Energy?For Valero Energy, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Valero Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Valero Energy would post earnings of $7.24 per share when it actually produced earnings of $8.27, delivering a surprise of +14.23%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Valero Energy doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings per share and revenues is pegged at $1.06 and $3.41 billion, respectively.For the second quarter, the consensus estimate for LKQ’s earnings per share has moved down by 3 cents in the past 90 days. Its bottom-line estimates imply a decline of 2.75% from the year-ago reported number.But the Zacks Consensus Estimate for LKQ’s quarterly revenues suggests a 2.06% year-over-year rise. Over the trailing four quarters, LKQ surpassed earnings estimates on three occasions and missed once, the average surprise being 2.54%. This is depicted in the graph below:LKQ Corporation Price and EPS Surprise LKQ Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseLKQ Corporation price-eps-surprise | LKQ Corporation QuoteQ1 HighlightsIn first-quarter 2023, LKQ’s adjusted earnings per share of $1.04 surpassed the consensus mark of 96 cents, owing to higher year-over-year revenues from the Wholesale North American and Europe segment. The bottom line also rose 4% year over year. The company reported net sales of $3,349 million, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,262 million. The top line remained unchanged from the year-ago level.Factors at PlayLKQ’s North America and Europe segments have been performing well. The North America segment continues to benefit from pricing initiatives. The company’s 1 LKQ Europe program continues to aid results in the Europe segment with robust revenues and EBITDA growth. Moreover, strength in LKQ’s Specialty unit on the back of strong demand for recreational vehicles is buoying revenues.Here's a sneak peek at the firm’s key revenue projections for the to-be-reported quarter.Our estimate for quarterly revenues from parts and services in Europe, which has the highest contribution to the company’s revenues, is pegged at $1,500 million, suggesting a rise from $1,470 million recorded in the prior-year quarter.We expect revenues from parts and services in North America unit for the second quarter to be around $1,103.7 million, indicating a rise from $1,050 million recorded in the prior-year period.However, we expect quarterly revenues from parts and services in the Specialty segment to be around $447.5 million, implying a decline from $512 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Declining prices of metal resulted in a gross margin headwind in the first quarter of 2023. The company expects low metal prices to continue to have a negative impact on the results of the quarter under review.The development of technically enhanced components has escalated manufacturing and research and development costs. Restructuring and acquisition-related expenses are other headwinds.Story continuesEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for the automotive replacement parts supplier for the quarter to be reported, as it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients. A positive Earnings ESP combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat..Earnings ESP: LKQ has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), which belongs to the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This world's largest consumer products maker has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 2.21%.For the last reported quarter, P&amp;G came out with earnings of $1.37 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.32 per share, representing a surprise of 3.79%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.58 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.59 per share, delivering a surprise of 0.63%.With this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for P&amp;G. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.P&amp;G currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.09%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on July 28, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead, Marc.Story continuesMarc HollidayThank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to SL Green's earnings call. I want to thank all of you for joining us today as we review the second quarter's results and discuss our progress on our 2023 business plan.I want to begin by commending the entire SL Green team on a very strong half of year, this first half, particularly as we were confronted by the dual challenges of a partially remote workforce and increasing interest rates, but headwinds notwithstanding, our team added to the year's accomplishments in meaningful ways during the second quarter. No one in the business works harder for shareholders than the men and women of SL Green, who lead by example and show what can be achieved by a 300-person corporate workforce that is present, productive and positive every single day of the week.By the numbers, it was a solid quarter as our FFO was above expectations. We leased another 410,000 square feet of office space. Our same-store NOI increased by 3.6% and our same-store office occupancy at quarter's end was slightly ahead of our original projections back in December. These performance stats are in stark contrast with the negative drumbeat of media coverage proclaiming the demise of office space. We continue to see demand building as businesses who hit the pause button during the prior 3 years, are more and more frequently acting on plans for future growth particularly in the finance sector, which accounted for about 38% of market leasing during the second quarter as well as business services, healthcare and education sectors, all of which continue to be active and all of which helped to mitigate the pause in the tech sector.While overall leasing in the market in the first half of the year was below historical average, SL Green has garnered more than its fair share and has now entered into year-to-date leases totaling 950,000 square feet of space leased. And we are trading paper with a lot more tenants, evidenced by our 1.1 million square foot leasing pipeline more than 2/3 of which represents new leasing activity. Midtown continues to outperform with the lowest availability rate and the highest leasing volume among all Manhattan submarkets. This affirms our core property strategy and should enable us to gain occupancy during the second half of the year from what we believe to be our current low point. However, the financial stats only tell part of the story as significant progress was also made on the property front.Of course, the highlight for the quarter was the completion of our joint venture partnership with Mori Trust. The transaction culminates years of relationship building, affirms the global law of investing in trophy assets in prime corridors and now fully resets ownership and capital stack in what is a case study of opportunistic investment, enforcement and recapitalization of an important asset on Park Avenue. We continue to evaluate and refine different redevelopment scenarios and hope to commence physical work towards the end of this year.I want to acknowledge the extraordinary efforts of our Chief Investment Officer, Harrison Sitomer, who was backed up by Young Hahn, our SVP of Investments. They literally work day and night for months on end to ensure the successful completion of an important component of our business plan. This is our first partnership with Mori Trust, and they have already proven themselves to be excellent parts. We are making great progress on other fronts as well. At One Madison, I now believe we can obtain a TCO for the project in September of this year, a full 3 months ahead of schedule and opened our doors to tenants in the second quarter of 2024. The ability for us once again to deliver ahead of schedule and under budget is a testament to the efforts of Robert Schiffer, Robert DeWitt, our amazing Head of Construction and John Krush, our project executive, along with our partners at Hines. Additionally, it accelerates the receipt of $577 million from our partners on the project, which is triggered upon the TCO of the project later this next quarter. I'm also pleased to report that during the second quarter, we topped out 760 Madison and began marketing that project. The project is absolutely spectacular, excited to show it to shareholders who have not yet seen it, please walk by, check it out. It's already impacted the Skyline in the historical District of Upper East Side Madison Avenue in a very positive way. It's been extremely well received by the market. And we're proud to have initiated this project and fostered along with our partners at Giorgio Armani.We already have several units under contract with significant interest on the balance of the units at prices which will be market-leading for Upper Eastside condos, a testament to the power of the SL Green and Giorgio Armani brands and vision. We expect to turn over the retail to Armani by end of September and rent would start right away. First, closings on residential units will commence in June of next year, with all net proceeds of sale available for use by us as there is no indebtedness against the project.We'll have more commentary on the sales effort and pricing metrics on our earnings -- on our next earnings call which I guess is in October. Finally, we received our TCO for 15 Beekman this month and plan to turn over the project fully to Pace University in August. The props here go to the SL Green team of Peter Flynt, John Hefferon and Jason Pastuzyn. And if that weren't enough, a reminder that in April, just after our last earnings call, we closed the refinancing of 919 Third Avenue, proof that the credit markets are still available for the highest quality office assets and reputable sponsors.So the first half of the year is now in the books, but no rest for the team. We're going to continue to forge ahead through the rest of the summer to set the table for a successful second half of the year. Management is completely aligned with our shareholders, and we will work hard to create value, generate earnings and protect the dividend.Thank you. Operator, we can take some questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from Michael Lewis of Truist Securities.Michael Robert LewisMy first question is for Matt. I want to ask about your debt coverage ratios, particularly the fixed charge coverage ratio relative to your covenants because it keeps coming up in conversations. Your fixed charge coverage fell to 1.7x this quarter, the covenant is 1.4x. Can you just maybe discuss the mechanics and how close do you expect that ratio to get to the covenant over the next 2 quarters?Matthew J. DiLibertoYes, sure. I've read some of the commentary about it. I'm somewhat surprised that it gets that much attention. It's a pretty simple calc, it's consolidated only calc is just the covenant. And it's been impacted, one, by rates. Rates are up, but also been impacted by 245 Park being a wholly owned consolidated asset for about 3 quarters now. Now that, that is an JV, it rolls out of that calculation, and that in and of itself improves the calc. And we obviously watch all of our covenants and our metrics very, very closely and are not as fussed about that one as people seem to be out in the market.Michael Robert LewisGreat. So notwithstanding a big move in rates, I guess, I mean, should we expect the coverage ratio to improve from here? Is it troughing or do you think it gets a little tighter before it goes back up?Matthew J. DiLibertoIt will get tighter before it gets better because the effect of 245 has to work its way through to a trailing 12 calc. So it goes lower before it gets better. But just by having 245 in the -- as a JV that alone improves it because that was a sub-1 coverage asset.Michael Robert LewisOkay. Got it. My second question about portfolio occupancy. So you could correct me if I'm wrong. I think you said at your Investor Day in December, you troughed around 90% in 2Q and rebound to about 92% in the second half of the year. I think what we're talking about is your lease percentage, which was 89.8%, so just about exactly what you predicted. So my question is, do you still expect to reach that 92% this year? Or has that expectation changed? And maybe you could tie in kind of how -- I know the leasing pipeline had been building in the early part of the year, what are you seeing on kind of conversion in turning that into leases?Marc HollidayYes. I just want to make sure I understand the question. I mean I think we were 89.8% something for the quarter. We expect that to be a low point. I think I said in my commentary. And we expect to gain occupancy from here, regardless of which direction the market goes, just based on our pipeline and visibility. I mean our -- all the -- we set out 21 goals a year they're all stretch goals. We never make all, but we generally make most or certainly more than half. And we're going to do everything possible, like forget the exact metric on the occupancy stat for the year was...Matthew J. DiLiberto92.4%.Marc Holliday92.4%. So we're going to try and end the year certainly there as closely as possible. We've got a big pipeline, if everything falls into place, then I think we have a chance of doing it. And if it doesn't, we'll be damn close. So I mean that's why we call it stretch goals, we don't make them easy. To be anywhere above 90% in a market that's 18% vacant, I think, is enormous testament to Steve Durels and his team.OperatorAnd our next question will come from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI.Stephen Thomas SakwaMarc, maybe you could just touch on the dispositions and what your expectations are for either further sales at One Vanderbilt? What your plans are potentially for additional sales of 245 and maybe other assets that you've got on the market today?Marc HollidayWell, I think our big focus now is on One Vanderbilt. And the reception there is very good, as you would expect. I consider One Vanderbilt just objectively, although it's hard not to be biased, One of the best office buildings of its ilk in the city, and it's got an amazing blue-chip rent roll. It's got great embedded financing, low rate financing in place. it's just a wonderful asset. And as you would expect, the reception in the investment community has been a high level of interest. And I'd say that, that's going to get a lot of our attention now through the end of the year. So that's that.On the One Madison front -- I'm sorry, on the 245 Park front, which I think is the other asset you mentioned, I don't know. I think there, the redevelopment program that we are designing and working through is so good. And I think now with the leading being probably ahead of where we expect to be at this point, both in terms of Steve, the leases we signed with -- give me the leases -- EQT...Steven M. Durels245. And then we expanded by 10,000 square feet...Marc Holliday(inaudible) Okay. And we have others pending, we're trading papers.Steven M. Durels6 Proposals out.Marc Holliday6 proposals out. So not unlike One Vanderbilt, where we initially went out to sell, I think it was down by up to 40%. We round up selling 30%, now we're going out for additional 10%. We may do the other 25% towards the end of this year, we may hold back and get some more leasing done. We'll see.Stephen Thomas SakwaOkay. And I'm just wondering if you can provide any color on the 625 Madison situation. I know there's been a lot of back and forth with different defaults and the ground leases and the land position. Is there anything you can sort of provide us on that front today?Marc HollidayWell, it's always -- until there's some ongoing litigation surrounding this asset. You know that there was a rent reset, I think we talked about on the last call or no, was that...Matthew J. DiLibertoIt happened after the last call, but we disclosed in our Q (inaudible).Marc HollidayIn the Q. okay. So there was a rent reset. It was somewhat higher than we had anticipated, although far far below, I think, what the fee owner had been putting into the market at that point, which was actually very deleterious to our position because there were discussions of rent levels of double or more, which were really never to be the case. And we took a write-down on the leasehold portion of the asset in this quarter. And on the other side, you know from previous commentary that we have a mezzanine position on the fee, which has come due, and we'll see how things shake out there. There is a foreclosure date scheduled for August 8 on that asset. So we'll know quite soon how things will shake out there.OperatorAnd our next question will be coming from Alexander Goldfarb of Piper Sandler.Alexander David GoldfarbGreat. Marc, in your end of your commentary -- at the start, you said that you guys are working hard and to protect the dividend is -- so I just want to explore that a bit more. I know, Matt, you always say, hey, dividend gets reassessed at the end of the year, and you'll probably tell me the same thing right now. But you guys seem to be on the plan for this year, you've done the 245 sale, seems like 245 leasing is going well. One Vandy is next step for disposition. It doesn't seem like anything is out of whack. Should we take your comment, Marc, about the dividend that we should think about the current level being maintained into next year? Or was the comment more just a holistic point that, hey, you guys are in charge of shareholders' capital. You husband it to the best that you can. You do everything to preserve the dividend. But obviously, things could change. I'm just trying to understand which way to read the comment.Marc HollidayOkay. Well, that's -- there's a lot of ways I guess, you can read it. The way I meant it to be because it's the way we approach it and believe in the dividend is, I guess, akin to what you just said, Alex, which is that we think when people invest in SL Green buyer stock, it's a blended play. People want current return, and they want evidence of our ability to be able to generate cash flow either through ordinary operations or gain on assets and be able to reward shareholders throughout the year with the dividend in addition to doing our redevelopments and developments and creating growth and driving share value. And in most years, that's reflected in some years, like we have today, where the market sentiment is very negative, we just work our way through that. But I think what I wanted to state is that we believe that a dividend is an important component of the overall investment thesis for anybody to invest in the stock.We all own the stock at the managerial level. For most of us, it is the largest, if not almost the exclusive source of our net worth is the stock that we own. And we want to create value, and we want to create cash flow and see distributions in the form of dividends. So we are very comfortable with where the dividend is today, given the earnings that we're generating and the gains that we're generating on some of these very important sales, we'll do next year's business plan next year. We'll have a sit down in November, December, and we'll roll that entire plan out with our objectives and our earnings levels, et cetera. But suffice it to say, which is what I said earlier is, we take all of those points very seriously. And our goal is as best as possible to maintain the levels as much as we can.Alexander David GoldfarbOkay. The next question is on compensation. Every year, for whatever reason, it seems to always be a big topic ahead of the shareholder meeting. This year, you guys put out some really interesting data just showing the fact that like Marc your comp was 40% lower than the stated value, the rest of the team, 30% lower. But here's the rub is that shareholders are sort of disserviced because you guys expense 100%, you realize 30% or 40% less than your expensing, people obviously don't get paid at sort of disrewarding. So is there something better that like the consultants or people can put in place that better ties you guys to performance, but something that actually is more directly correlates not only to you guys being paid for results delivered, but also to the P&amp;L because right now, FFO is being penalized because the -- it's not paying. It just seems like the current system doesn't seem to be an ideal one. So just -- I don't know if you guys have thoughts around that, but I thought I'd ask.Marc HollidayGot it. Let me -- I'm going to let Matt address the accounting issues with respect to that. I'll just give you the -- the philosophy is at the top levels of the company, our EVPs and even down into the SVP ranks for sure. We're big believers in creating the alignment and having a large portion of total compensation in the form of stock. In some cases, it's a very, very high percentage. I don't have them on my fingertips, but in some of our cases, it might be 75%, 80%, 85% of our total compensation and in other cases, maybe half, but in all cases, material.And I think that makes sense. I mean if I were -- I am a shareholder and as a shareholder and as -- in all my different hats, I wear, I think that it is the best at creating the alignment I referred to earlier. And I don't see us moving away from what I would call proportionately more stock compensation as you move up the ranks as a component of total compensation. Now how those plans are structured and the charges that are taken upfront versus charges that could be taken later, ,fixed charges, variable charges, I'd leave to Matt.Matthew J. DiLibertoYes, you make a good point, Alex. I mean the challenge with the accounting for these plans is once the charges or the cost of the plans from an accounting perspective are established, day 1, they do not change. The plans are valued. We were talking stock plans or outperformance plans, which have multiyear measurement periods, investing periods, the accounting rules say you value that plan day 1. And if it's worth full value to the recipient at the end, the accounting charge is what it is. If it's worth 0 or close to 0 to the recipients, the charge is still the same. And of late, these plans have not been paying anywhere near what they're expected to, so they're not a retention tool, but the charge is still flowing through G&amp;A. And more than 50% of our G&amp;A is noncash, primarily related to stock-based compensation because we do believe it's an important part of the program. The challenge is finding the right form of stock-based compensation so that the expense to the company is mitigated and actually more closely mirrors the benefit to the recipient because these plans, I'll say, again, largely hit expense in a disproportionate way in this environment than they benefit the recipient.OperatorAnd our next question will come from Tom Catherwood of BTIG.William Thomas CatherwoodExcellent. Maybe one for Steve to start out. Nice uptick in leasing -- percent leased to a number of your buildings. One that jumped out to us was Graybar. And this probably reflects the pickup in small tenant demand that you've referenced over the last few quarters. But on the other side of that, what's the market like for large block demand right now? And are there specific submarkets or buildings in your portfolio that are garnering more of that large block demand?Steven M. DurelsYes, it's a great question because what we saw in the first half of the year, and particularly, if you read a lot of the market reports and some of the brokerage houses that are out there, is that leasing overall velocity in the marketplace has been very modest year-to-date despite the success that we've had within our portfolio. And a lot of the leasing -- leases that have been signed this year have really been on the smaller side of the market. There was -- we started off the year with very few larger-sized requirements active in the market. But having said that, in the past 30, 45 days we've seen a lot of increase both in tenant tours and in proposals that we've received for larger-sized tenants. So that's the good news.Just to put a little meat on the bone. We've got 16 active proposals that we're trading paper with right now that range between 45,000 and 300,000 square feet. 8 of those proposals came across our door only within the past 2 weeks. And only 3 of those 16 proposals of good-sized tenant requirements, are in our 1.1 million square foot pipeline. So it shows you there's a growing wave of larger tenants that have reentered the market. And hopefully, that's going to pay off for better leasing success for the overall marketplace and certainly within our portfolio as we go into the second half of the year.William Thomas CatherwoodGot it. Appreciate that, Steve. Then kind of second one for me, maybe Marc, over on One Madison, you mentioned the early completion and how that gets you access to your JV partners' contribution sooner rather than later. Kind of 2-parter there. First, when is the new expected TCO date? And second, when -- in the press release, you mentioned restructuring the loan so that you could invest more in amenities and invest some of the savings, what's envisioned amenity wise and kind of what more does that building need from an investment standpoint?Marc HollidayOkay. So first question, I think the original completion date was December of 2023. That was for TCO. We moved that forward in a later -- when we kicked off and got our GMP under our belt a few years ago to November of 2023 and then we internally kind of felt like we can maybe hit October. And now the team is pushing hard for September, middle-ish to end of September. So when do we expect it? We expect it as soon as possible. I don't know we're aiming for middle to end of September. I hope we get there. We should get there, but you got weather and all sorts of other issues. But we should get there. But regardless, the bigger point is we ran a great project, we're at the final whatever, 2, 3, 4-yard line, almost done, property looks great, we're way, way ahead of schedule, thanks to the good work of the people I mentioned and hundreds or thousands of others who work very hard to get the building to this point. And the primary mission is get the job done right, but the secondary mission is get it done expediently so we can button it up and get tenants moved in and open the building and have it be a great addition to the neighborhood.In terms of the amenities, I think we had something on the order of $60 million of construction cost savings. That was the ultimate cost of the project that we are now projecting relative to the original GMP, a lot of safe contingency and other components which is great. Some of that, obviously, is being retained. Some will go to defray higher interest expense, but we took a very significant amount of that and we are constructing an amazing rooftop, indoor-outdoor rooftop venue that I think will rival some of the great rooftops in and around the city that will be there as both a tenant amenity and also as some very attractive and exclusive event space that can be activated evenings and weekends as well as, I mentioned earlier, being, I think, a world-class amenity for the building.The amount of investment we're making in One Madison amenities overall, that which was planned and that which we added exceeds that of what we did at One Vanderbilt. And I think One Vanderbilt is recognized as having an amazing amenity program. So this -- at its completion with the market and the Daniel Boulud stake, place and an exclusive tenant commons and the Chelsea peers, 4-level fitness center and upstairs this kind of pièce de résistance, this Rockwell, David Rockwell Group-designed rooftop amenity in the aggregate is going to make One Madison just an amazing destination and experience.William Thomas CatherwoodGot it. Can wait to see it.Marc HollidayNext summer.OperatorAnd our next question will come from John Kim of BMO Capital Markets.John P. KimI suppose you had your mic drop moment with the 245 Park sale. But now that that's done, and you're expecting proceeds on One Madison, potentially JV sales at One Vanderbilt. In your view, is that enough to avoid a credit rating downgrade from Moody's?Matthew J. DiLibertoIt's a question I can't answer definitively because they have moved somewhat as a result of the market, not just as a result of us. I'll say this as it relates to the ratings. I mean, we're focused on a business plan that puts us in a financial position that we feel is prudent and we want to be in. It is not a stated objective to satisfy Moody's or any one of the other rating agencies. Our ratings are important, but the fixed income market has not been a reliable source of funding for us. And the ratings will come back as a byproduct of an execution of the business plan, but not the goal of the business plan. If Moody's makes a move, that's fine. If they don't, that's fine as well. We think we're actually on a prudent business plan for our business and for the shareholder base.Marc HollidayI would add to the mic drop moments, not just capital transaction, but leasing of space. I mean, we're at these levels with increased interest costs and a vacancy rate as I said before, was our low point. We now think we're going to be able to turn the tide and start building occupancy again. And as we do, that has as much more effect, if you will, on an improving ratio as any of the other things you mentioned. So I would say, stay tuned. We've got a big pipeline, and we think the market is starting to come around and we're believers in this market and that will be as big a help as anything.John P. KimAnother asset that you've had some leasing success with, I think, with GIC was at 280 Park, but there are still some tenant departures scheduled and the debt maturity next year. How confident are you that you'll be able to refinance that asset on economically viable term fee?Marc HollidayAndrew, do you want to address -- I know you've been involved with 280 in the refinancing.Andrew W. MathiasFortunately, 280 sits in the hottest submarket in Manhattan Park Avenue corridor. We have strong interest in the space that's coming available, and we are constantly in discussions with the existing lenders on the property, the -- obviously, other lenders around the world, like we accessed for 919 Third Avenue. And we're -- we think we have a great business plan with Vornado on that asset. Steve and [Glenn Weiser] working on it day in and day out. And I think there is some very positive developments that are possible given the buildings location and it's -- the renovation we did there. And it's getting a lot of attention because of the profile of the asset. And I think we're confident that there's a good future for us at that asset.OperatorAnd our next question will come from Blaine Heck of Wells Fargo.Blaine Matthew HeckCan you talk in general about asset pricing in the market? What sort of cap rates and IRRs are potential investors targeting? And how large is the bifurcation between well-positioned assets like 245 Park versus more commodity type buildings?Marc HollidayAndrew?Andrew W. MathiasWell, I think we've probably never seen a gap as high as currently in terms of well-located and amenitized buildings versus more, call it, Class B and C buildings which, fortunately, we really have rotated the SL Green portfolio out of. So we still have submarkets that are struggling in the financial district for sure. Third Avenue, just a lot of inventory, but investors are very attuned to that. And I think you saw that with the 245 Park transaction. You'll see it in further transactions where they're willing to pay up for the stability of improved monetized assets and if you have an off-the-beaten path asset or an asset that not been invested in and amenitized, it's honestly -- there's not a lot of comps out there. Most of the comps are lenders -- lender and loan related rather than owners selling. So it's a huge gap in answer to your question, but we do feel investor demand for the former, for well-located, amenitized and improved continues to be there in New York City.Blaine Matthew HeckOkay. Great. And then for my second question, kind of related to that, it seems like we're still seeing the flight to quality trend play out with most net absorption and leasing activity taking place at higher rent buildings. But just curious if you're seeing any better activity at the lower rent buildings within your portfolio? Or is it still relatively soft in that segment?Steven M. DurelsNo. It's -- we've -- I think as we've commented in maybe the last call and certainly over the last several months, we've seen an increase in activity in the more price-sensitive buildings, Graybar being a good barometer of that part of the marketplace where our vacancy in that building right now is around 12%, and that's from a high of we were up around 15%, 16%. So we've had good velocity in that building. We're starting to see more deal flow in the other -- in similar type buildings. A very good example of that is 1185 Sixth, which was very slow to lease -- getting leasing traction last year as a lot of the market attention was on the best-in-class buildings.And right now, 1185 has got plus 6, 7 active proposals that are in negotiation for the building. And that's a price-sensitive, rent-sensitive type of building, but it also sits in one of the best submarkets in Manhattan right now, Park Avenue and the (inaudible) being the 2 best. Another stat worth knowing is that 62% of the leasing year-to-date in Manhattan has been done in what is termed as commodity type buildings. So clearly, you've seen kind of a reawakening of that part of the market has got a long way to go before where it's in a healthy place, but the good news is it's starting to happen.OperatorAnd our next question will come from Anthony Paolone of JPMorgan.Anthony PaoloneFirst question is just, I think your guidance or at the Investor Day, I think your disposition guidance was $2 billion. And so I just wanted to understand like make sure 245, are you treating that as $1 billion or the 174. And then also things like the 570 and change you'll get from your M&amp;A partners and then any cash from the DPE book maybe over the rest of the year as some of those mature, like does that all roll into the $2 billion? I just want to try to clarify like what's coming in the second half?Matthew J. DiLibertoThe $2 billion -- just use 245 as an example, it would be $1 billion. So 50% of $2 billion. That's what would feed the goal. The 577 in proceeds on One Madison from our partners is not part of that. DPE is not part of that. It is pro rata share of sold assets that feed the calc. And getting to that goal, will be a function of the assets we have in the market currently as well as where we end up with One Vanderbilt, which we said is an opportunistic sale that we've had out there for the last couple of years. We're marketing an interest and would hope to get one done, but we want to be opportunistic about it. And with regard to another interest sale in 245 Park, there's likely upside to where we sold the first interest. So we may play that out a bit and watch the redevelopment and lease-up -- leasing has been strong, as you mentioned that earlier, watch the redevelopment and lease-up take place before we bring another interest to market.Marc HollidayWell, so with that being said, Matt, the goal was $2 billion, and that's just what I'm hearing from Anthony. If we were to defer the second -- the 25%.Matthew J. DiLibertoWe would not be able...Marc HollidayThat would be $500 million? So there is -- I mean, -- that doesn't mean we won't identify other assets to solve for that. But that one -- like I said, we're doing it out of a position of strength. I feel very good about 245 our capitation there, our partner. And while it was -- we got the big part done this year, there's a smaller part to go this isn't about -- this is about making money for shareholders. So if we -- we're going to do a lot better next year after we get a lot more leasing traction then we may defer. But that doesn't necessarily mean we couldn't get there if we decided to go forward with it now. It just means we have to do what we think is best to optimize returns.Anthony PaoloneOkay. Understand. Then even with that being said, that sounds like between the OMA partner capital and maybe some amount of sales, you'll have cash coming in over the second half of the year that's pretty meaningful. And so my second question just maybe remind us of the priorities of where you see that cash going, whether it's line of credit, buyback, other asset, acquisitions like whatever.Matthew J. DiLibertoPriority is debt repayment. We've earmarked the entire 577 coming in from our partners towards debt repayment. All of the proceeds from 245 went to debt repayment. We have still paused share buybacks since the middle of last year. That was largely a function of the rate environment and where leverage levels were, where we have a goal to be more on offense as we get into later '23, particularly '24. That was the purpose of our business plan in '23, execute sales, increase liquidity, reduce leverage and go back on offense we are still on that program. But for the time being, we need to get through the remainder of the '23 business plan.OperatorAnd our next question will come from Ronald Kamdem of Morgan Stanley.Ronald KamdemGreat. A couple of quick ones. So just go back to the DPE book. I think you talked about $289 million of investments on nonaccrual. I appreciate $225 million of that is 625 Madison. I think you said on August 8, there will be a resolution. So is -- should we be expecting you to take over that asset? Or what are some of the other scenarios there? And then the follow-up to that is the remaining sort of $65 million or $55 million, plus or minus on nonaccrual. Can you just comment on what the situation there and what the plan is?Matthew J. DiLibertoSo on 625, we'll stick to what we said earlier. We have to be sensitive to what's going on with the asset. But I need to say, there is a foreclosure proceeding on August 8, and if that went in a certain direction, then that effect -- and then the remainder of the assets, I think your question was what happens with those?Ronald KamdemYes, exactly. What's the plan on those that are nonaccrual, are you taking over? Just curious.Marc HollidayNo, I don't think we can generalize, Ronald. Every asset is -- could be extended, could be restructured, modified, could be turned into equity. I don't want to generalize and we're not going to go through asset by asset. It's not what we do. But suffice it to say that the remaining book is quite small at this point in terms of number of assets. It's not small in terms of dollars. But I think like more than 1/3 of it is represented by 625. And for that, you'll just have to like all of us wait and see what the outcome is after August 8. We've already said that. For the balance, most of it is performing, but for how much is nonperforming this 625.Unidentified Company Representative$50 million, $60 million.Marc HollidaySo I mean for $50 million to $60 million, we'll see how it goes. I mean we're going to do whatever we can to optimize either restructure, extend or possibly foreclose.Ronald KamdemHelpful. If I could just sneak one in for my follow-up. Just going back to the 545 guide at midpoint, you had some other income come in this quarter. The forward curve has moved. Just -- can you talk through how are you thinking about sort of that -- the guidance for the year and some of the puts and takes and where it's trending?Matthew J. DiLibertoTrending within the range. If we were outside the range, we would have moved it. But given rates and the balance of business plan to execute for the back half of the year, we feel good with the range where it is.OperatorAnd our next question will come from Anthony Powell of Barclays.Anthony Franklin PowellJust a question on the dividend going back to the prior question. I noticed that the payout ratio of FAD went above 90%. So maybe if you can go over, I guess, what your medium-term dividend policy is? And is that a comfortable ratio for you?Matthew J. DiLibertoSo if you recall, we set a dividend level that's as every year, dividend level is based on taxable income. So the popular measure other than taxable income is FAD. We said our dividend at what was at the time, 100% of FAD, FAD is slightly better than we projected. So maybe we're slightly under 100%. But it all comes back to taxable income. And as I think we alluded to earlier, our program is in line with what we expected it to be, and therefore, the dividend is exactly where we expected it to be.Anthony Franklin PowellSo maybe 1 more if you can comment. I guess there were some reports about an asset in Chicago that may be turned over to an office building. If that's the case, would that be a potential sale? Or is that -- can't comment on that at all?Marc HollidaySo Harry Sitomer has been handling the part of the 245 claim that doesn't really relate to the asset, but it relates to the guarantees and the judgments we've received against the prior owner HNA. If you recall, I think we discussed in prior calls and certainly, it's been publicized that we received a $185 million judgment, which has grown far higher since with interest in passage of time, et cetera, additional claims. And as a component of that claim, we've exercised against some assets and Harry can shed some light on it.Harrison SitomerSure. So there's 2 assets that we currently have a line of sight to right now as we continue to pursue additional assets under that $185 million judgment, the one that you referenced in Chicago, that asset is currently working through a bankruptcy process, and we're trying to monetize the position that we have there. The second asset is an asset in Orangetown, New York. That asset has no debt against it, and we're working with stakeholders in the town to monetize that position as well. And just to be clear, we have no basis in either in those positions and no liabilities that we've taken on at the corporate level.OperatorOur next question is going to come from Michael Griffin of Citi.Michael Anderson GriffinMaybe just going to the leasing pipeline, the comments and prepared remarks about the 1.1 million square feet, about 2/3 of those are new leases. Can you give us some more color on these? Are these expansions? Is it tenants looking to keep the same size? And then Durels, I think you mentioned in a previous question, you have a lot of large tenants that are in the pipeline. How likely are some of these to close? And any color on that would be appreciated.Steven M. DurelsWell, start with the last part. Anything that's in the pipeline is a deal which we think has a high probability of either closing or if it's a proposal that's being negotiated, being converted over to a lease negotiation. So beyond the 1.1 million square feet, there is a significant number of proposals that are being negotiated with prospective tenants, but it's early days in discussion with those tenants, and they are premature for us to then make it part of the pipeline. What composes the pipeline 2/3 of it is financial service tenants, the balance being law firms and professional services, a little bit of education, a little bit of medical beyond that. But by and large financial services is driving the train right now. And then of our biggest proposals, when I referred to earlier, the 16 largest proposals that were actively trading paper back and forth with 7 of those tenants are from the fire sector and 4 from legal.So as far as whether the expansions or not, it's a little bit everything. I'd say a lot of the financial service guys are driven by expansion. A lot of the law firms are driven by either consolidations or lease expirations. And the balance of the tenancy is -- it's a mixed bag. Some are downsizing, some are upsizing, some are just being replacing (inaudible) with no discernible trend one way or the other.Michael Anderson GriffinThat's helpful. And then maybe just a question on the balance sheet for Matt. I know you've got about $300 million of notional swaps burning off this month. Is the plan to leave that as floating? I know you've done a good job of managing our floating rate exposure, call over the past year, but would you plan to swap that back for (inaudible). And if you are, what kind of rate do you think you'd get on that?Matthew J. DiLibertoThere's actually a schedule of our derivatives now in the supplemental, we added it last quarter. You'll see there that maturing swaps are replaced already with forward starting swaps we put those in place a while ago. So we have no near-term swap maturities at all.OperatorAnd our next question will come from Caitlin Burrows of Goldman Sachs.Caitlin BurrowsMaybe just back to the fixed charge coverage ratio and the expected trend going forward. Matt, you mentioned that it would go down before up, given that you now expect the One Madison JV partner proceeds during 3Q, I guess what makes it get worse before or better?Matthew J. DiLibertoWell, I'm still being conservative. We get the TCO in late September. Those proceeds wouldn't come in until fourth quarter. So obviously, those proceeds help it. It's a function of whether we get it in the third quarter or early fourth. And that could be a matter of days.Caitlin BurrowsGot it. Okay. So once it's in, that should make the trough and then it improves.Matthew J. DiLibertoExactly. .Caitlin BurrowsOkay. And then just on dispositions. You mentioned earlier how your goals are generally a stretch, and it sounds like further sales at 245 Park and One Vanderbilt could be somewhat opportunistic. So I guess as we think about the $2 billion goal, how important is it to you that you reach or get pretty close to that target and...Marc HollidayI just want to make a correction because if I don't, I don't want to get into the narrative. I did not say One Vanderbilt was an opportunistic sale. I was asked the question earlier, and my commentary was that there is a lot of interest in One Vanderbilt. It's got primary amount of our focus right now, and we're going to do everything to get that deal done this year. So I'm not -- I think that's inconsistent with what I just heard is I want to make that clarification. So if you could reask me the question.Caitlin BurrowsYes. I guess I was just thinking with the $2 billion goal, kind of what is the focus? And obviously, if One Vanderbilt gets done, that could be a decent piece of it. And whether that gets done or not, how does that kind of impact your focus on potential smaller assets?Marc HollidayStill not getting. Let me just -- what we pushed -- a lot of this was previously said, 245 is $1 billion of it. The $500 million on One Mad, we may choose to defer -- 245, we may choose to defer. And One Vanderbilt, we're moving ahead on, and there's a lot of interest. So that's where we are.Caitlin BurrowsAnd then there were a couple of other properties that you guys had pointed out 750 Third for 7 days.Marc HollidayWell, there's other deals we're working on, but those are -- I don't want to say they're not -- I mean, they're material, but they're not mean I keep my eye on 245, One Vanderbilt, the $577 million that's triggered to come in, the condo proceeds we're going to be getting next year. The rent on Armani that's going to be triggered on turnover on September 30. I mean these are the big things. And then there's other -- we're always in the -- I mean there's a retail deal we're working on right now. I don't .Unidentified Company RepresentativeI don't know what you want to say anything in script that we've been.There's been significant interest on some of the retail assets we own at Madison Avenue and there's 1 transaction that's in the works (inaudible)Marc HollidayBut Caitlin, I mean we do that every quarter. That's not a -- I'm trying to just highlight the big things on this call.OperatorAnd our last question will come from Nick Yulico of Scotiabank.Nicholas Philip YulicoJust a clarification question on Page 19 of the supp, where you give the NOI breakdown of the portfolio. It went down sequentially. Was that all due to the onetime [L Brands] payment in the first quarter?Marc HollidayCorrect. Is that it, operator?OperatorI'm showing no further questions. I would now like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks.Marc HollidayOkay. 2:59. So we did our job well, and we appreciate all the questions. And we thank you for listening in. We thank you for being shareholders. And for those of you that aren't, we hope you'll become so. And we'll look forward to speaking again in 3 months' time.OperatorAnd ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.]"

Investors scrutinize year-over-year changes in earnings — or funds from operations for REITs — and revenue. But stocks can experience significant fluctuations depending on whether they beat or fall short of analyst estimates. And companies that lower forward guidance from previous forecasts can get crushed.Take a look at some of the initial second-quarter operating results from various REITs and how Wall Street has been reacting to them.Equity LifeStyle Properties Inc. (NYSE:ELS) is a residential REIT that owns and operates manufactured home communities, RV resorts and campgrounds. It owns 450 investment properties throughout North America, including 225 RV resorts, 202 mobile home communities and 23 marinas.After the bell on July 17, Equity LifeStyle Properties announced its second-quarter operating results. Funds from operations (FFO) of $0.66 was in line with analyst estimates but 2 cents higher than FFO of $0.64 in the second quarter of 2022. Revenue of $370 million missed estimates for $376.33 million but was 1.29% above revenue of $365.31 million in the second quarter of 2022.Equity LifeStyle Properties also released full-year 2023 guidance on FFO with a range of $2.80 to $2.90 per share. The average analyst's estimate was $2.85.The day after the release, Equity LifeStyle shares were down about $2 but have bounced back nicely over the past few days.Equity LifeStyle Properties’ most recent dividend payout was $0.45 per share, putting the REIT’s dividend yield at 2.5%.Check out:This REIT just teamed up with the company that built Elon Musk's tiny house to develop affordable housing communities. Here's how you can be among the first to buy shares.Story continuesPrologis Inc. (NYSE:PLD) is a San Francisco-based industrial REIT founded in 1983. Prologis has long been a stalwart in the ownership and management of approximately 1.2 billion square feet in 5,500 industrial logistics properties throughout the U.S. and 18 other countries.Its occupancy rate at the end of May was 97.5%.On July 18, Prologis announced its second-quarter operating results. FFO of $1.83 was $0.16 better than estimates and up 64.86% from FFO of $1.11 in the second quarter of 2022. Revenue of $1.65 billion missed the estimate of $1.69 billion but was 50.73% higher than revenue of $110 billion in the second quarter of 2022. Prologis also increased its 2023 full-year guidance from $5.42-$5.50 to $5.56-$5.60.Despite the year-over-year improvements, Wall Street was not happy with the revenue miss and took the stock down about 6% in the first two days following the report. Prior to the earnings announcement, Prologis had run up from $117 to just under $130, so it wasn't that surprising to see a ""buy on the rumor, sell on the news"" reaction, despite some fairly good FFO and revenue numbers.Prologis’ most recent dividend was $0.87 per share, putting its yield at 2.83%.SL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE:SLG) is a New York City-based office REIT and the largest office building landlord in New York. As of June 30, SL Green Realty held interests in 60 buildings, totaling 33.1 million square feet. Many income-oriented investors like owning SL Green Realty for its monthly paying dividend.After the closing bell on July 19, SL Green Realty reported second-quarter operating results. FFO of $1.43 was down 23.53% from FFO of $1.87 in the second quarter of 2022 but beat the estimates by $0.09. Rental revenue of $165.65 million was better than rental revenue of $136.5 million in the second quarter of 2022. Total revenue of $221.07 million was above estimates for $205.97 million.After running up over 5% the day before earnings were announced, SL Green Realty was down 8% the morning after its results were announced.SL Green Realty currently has a 9.04% dividend yield. Its most recent dividend payment was $0.27 per share.Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI) is a Houston-based specialized REIT focused on owning, operating and long-term leasing of cell towers.

It has a market cap of $50.84 billion, making it one of the largest REITs in the U.S.On July 19, Crown Castle reported its second-quarter operating results after the closing bell. FFO of $2.05 was up from $1.80 in the second quarter of 2022 and $0.04 better than analyst estimates. Revenue of $1.87 billion was ahead of estimates for $1.86 billion and was 7.67% higher than revenue of $1.73 billion in the second quarter of 2022.Crown Castle's full-year 2023 guidance on adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) was a midpoint of $7.54, below its previous guidance of $7.63. Crown Castle also cut its outlook for adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) by $50 million.Wall Street focused on the lower guidance numbers and sent Crown Castle down almost 6% in premarket trading.Crown Castle has a dividend yield of 5.52% with its most recent payout being $1.57 per share.Based on the preliminary results, it appears that any REIT that falls short of revenue estimates or provides weaker guidance is likely to experience a decline in share price, regardless of whether FFO exceeds expectations or compares favorably to its second-quarter 2022 figures.Weekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it's too late.

UDR, a premier multifamily real estate investment trust (REIT), is set to announce its second-quarter 2023 earnings results on Jul 26 after market close. The company, known for owning, operating, acquiring and developing high-quality apartment communities across the United States, has been a solid choice for investors seeking exposure to the multifamily real estate sector.In the last reported quarter, this Denver, CO-based residential REIT came up with funds from operations (FFO) as adjusted per share of 60 cents, a cent lower than the consensus mark. The quarterly results reflected lower-than-anticipated revenues.In the last four quarters, UDR’s FFO as adjusted per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on one occasion, met the same on the other two and missed in another period, the average surprise being 0.01%. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company:United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseUnited Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseUnited Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. price-eps-surprise | United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.US Residential Real Estate Market in Q2Despite cooling rent growth, apartment demand is showing signs of a solid rebound, with net absorption in the second quarter of 2023 nearing surging new supply levels. This stabilizes occupancy rates after a steep decline in 2022.Per RealPage data, in the second quarter, net demand registered at 83,449 units, and this marked a five-quarter high. While this is still below the record numbers seen during the 2021 boom, it indicates a normalization of apartment demand. What is interesting is that this demand rebound coincides with a 50-year high in apartment construction starting to convert into peak completions, with more than 107,000 units completed in the second quarter of this year itself.However, despite the supply surge, this solid demand is aiding in the mitigation of vacancy spikes in most markets, with U.S. apartment occupancy coming at 94.7% as of June, marking only a 0.1 percentage point decline since January. It marks a notable improvement compared to the occupancy fall of 1.2 percentage points in the first half of 2022 and then an additional 1.4 percentage points in the second half of the year.However, rent growth remains below normal in 2023, with year-over-year effective asking rent growth at just 1.5%. This is due to apartment operators prioritizing occupancy rates over rents, leading to more options for renters and putting downward pressure on rent growth. Same-store effective asking rents increased only 0.46% between May and June 2023.Story continuesQ2 2023 Expectations for UDRUDR is likely to have capitalized on positive trends to deliver a healthy performance in the second quarter of 2023. The rebound in apartment demand is likely to have resulted in healthy occupancy rates for the multifamily REIT.In its May Investor Presentation, UDR noted that market rent growth has continued toaccelerate sequentially every month through May, supporting mid-3% blended lease rate growth since the beginning of the second quarter through May 11, 2023.We estimate same-store physical occupancy at 96.7%. Moreover, our estimate for same-store net operating income growth is currently pegged at 9%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is currently pegged at $407.64 million. This indicates a 10.85% year-over-year rise.Additionally, UDR enjoys a decent balance sheet position and banks on technological moves and process enhancements to fuel growth. This residential REIT focuses on enhancing cost control through its Next Generation Operating Platform. UDR projected second-quarter 2023 FFO as adjusted per share in the range of 60-62 cents.Before the second-quarter earnings release, the company’s activities were not adequate to gain analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly FFO as adjusted per share has remained unchanged at 62 cents in the past month. However, this suggests year-over-year growth of 8.8%.Despite the optimistic outlook, UDR faces certain risks and challenges that could impact its second-quarter 2023 performance. These include potential headwinds from interest rate hikes, which could increase borrowing costs and affect the company's ability to refinance existing debt.We expect interest expenses to grow 16.6% year over year in the second quarter. Further, the multifamily real estate sector could face oversupply concerns, leading to increased competition and lower rent growth.Here Is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively predict a surprise in terms of FFO per share for UDR this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an FFO beat, which is not the case here.UDR currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

As always, we appreciate your interest in Forestar and taking the time to discuss our third quarter results. In addition to Katie, I'm joined on the call today by Jim Allen, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Walker, our Chief Operating Officer. Our solid third quarter results were driven by stronger market conditions. Our strategy of continuing to develop lots during the market transition positions us well to capitalize on the increased demand for finished lots from builders. Our third quarter net income increased 18% in the prior year quarter to $46.8 million or $0.93 per diluted share. Pretax income increased 18% to $62.4 million and our pretax profit margin was 16.9%. Consolidated revenues increased 20% to $368.9 million, while lot deliveries increased 10% to 3,812 lots. We evaluate each project in local market conditions to determine the appropriate pricing and sales pace to maximize returns. We have demonstrated that our unique and flexible business model can quickly pivot based on changing homebuilder demand and market conditions. None of that can happen without an incredible team. Their dedication, passion and expertise allow us to continue putting our long-term value creation goals at the center of every decision we make. Thank you to all of our valued team members for your efforts. Jim will now discuss our third quarter financial results in more detail.James D. AllenThank you, Dan. In the third quarter, net income increased 18% to $46.8 million or $0.93 per diluted share compared to $39.7 million or $0.80 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Consolidated revenues for the quarter increased 20% to $368.9 million compared to $308.5 million in the prior year quarter. The current quarter included $10.2 million in revenue from deferred development projects and $23.8 million in tract sales and other revenue. Lots sold in our third fiscal quarter increased 10% to 3,812 lots with an average sales price of $87,700. We expect continued quarterly fluctuations in our average sales price based on the geographic location and lot size mix of our deliveries. Our pretax income increased 18% to $62.4 million compared to $52.7 million in the third quarter of last year, and our pretax profit margin this quarter was 16.9% compared to 17.1% in the prior year quarter. Our gross profit margin this quarter was 23%, up 450 basis points sequentially and down 100 basis points from a year ago. In the third quarter, SG&amp;A expense was $26.4 million. As a percentage of revenue, SG&amp;A expense improved 60 basis points to 7.2% from 7.8% in the prior year quarter. We will continue to focus on controlling our SG&amp;A costs while ensuring that our infrastructure supports our business. Mark?Mark Stephen WalkerAs for current market conditions, the supply of new and existing homes at affordable price points remains limited. The demographic supporting housing demand remained favorable despite higher mortgage rates and inflationary pressures. Builder incentives have helped raise the affordability gap for many homebuyers. And low resale supply is a driver of buyers choosing new construction. Buyers are increasing housing starts and many are focused on buying finished lots. Forestar is a key supplier to many homebuilders and is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the shortage of finished lots for the homebuilding industry. During the third quarter, we sold lots to 16 customers, which was a new quarterly high. The supply of vacant developed lots, particularly at affordable price points, continues to be constrained across our footprint. Forestar is focused on developing lots for homes at affordable price points, demonstrated by our average sales price of roughly $88,000. While contract availability and materials are still challenging to procure in certain markets, the availability continues to improve. The cost to develop a residential lot has not declined, and we currently do not expect development costs to decrease given the strengthening demand from builders in the overall inflationary environment. We will continue to be proactive and work with our trade partners to control development costs. Homebuilders are returning to the land market to secure lots for future growth, and home prices have generally stabilized. As a result, land prices have not fallen as many expected at the beginning of this year. However, land sellers have been adjusting back to normal contract terms, resulting in more customary due diligence time lines and take-down structures. Jim?James D. AllenD.R. Horton is our largest and most important customer. However, we look to continue expanding our relationships with other homebuilders and still have an intermediate-term goal of selling 30% of our lots to customers other than D.R. Horton. 16% of our third quarter deliveries or 625 lots were sold to other customers, which includes 105 lots that were sold to a lot banker who expects to sell those lots to D.R. Horton at a future date. 13% of our deliveries in the prior year quarter or 435 lots were sold to third-party customers. In addition to growing by expanding our customer base, we have significant runway to grow our market share within D.R. Horton. Our mutually stated goal is for one out of every 3 homes that D.R. Horton sells to be built on a lot developed by Forestar. Katie?Katie SmithForestar's underwriting criteria for new development projects includes a minimum 15% pretax return on average inventory and a return of the initial cash investment within 36 months. During the third quarter, we invested approximately $215 million in land and land development, of which $190 million was for land development and $25 million was for land.  While our investments this quarter were down compared to the prior year quarter, they were up 17% sequentially. We expect our investments in land acquisition and development to increase in the coming quarters. Our lot position at June 30 was 73,000 lots, of which 53,700 lots are owned and 19,300 lots are controlled through purchase contracts. The majority of our own lots were placed under contract to purchase from land sellers before 2021, resulting in an attractive cost basis. At quarter end, we have 7,800 finished lots on hand. We generally expect to maintain a higher inventory of finished lots to meet builder demand. When we agree to a lot take-down schedule, there's typically a price escalator built in to compensate us for carrying the asset. We remain intensely focused on managing our development in phases as we strive to deliver finished lots at a pace that matches market demand consistent with our emphasis on capital efficiency. We are continuing to target a 3- to 4-year owned inventory of land and lots. 28% of our owned lots are under contracted sales, representing approximately $1.4 billion of future revenue. These contracts have $124 million of hard earnest money deposits associated with them. Another 31% of our owned lots are subject to a right of first offer to D.R. Horton based on executed purchase and sale agreements. Jim?James D. AllenWe are retaining significant liquidity and using modest leverage to keep our balance sheet strong, while maintaining our disciplined approach when investing capital. We ended the quarter with approximately $780 million of liquidity, including an unrestricted cash balance of $400 million and $380 million of available capacity on our undrawn revolving credit facility. Total debt at June 30 was $707 million, with no senior note maturities until fiscal 2026. And our net debt-to-capital ratio was 19.1%, down from 32.8% in the prior year period. We ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of stockholders' equity, and our book value per share increased to $25.96, up 13% from a year ago. According to the National Association of Homebuilders, project-level land acquisition and development loans continue to become more expensive, which directly impacts the majority of our competitors. Forestar's capital structure is one of our biggest competitive advantages, and it sets us apart from other land developers. Other developers generally use project-level development loans, which are typically more restrictive, have floating rates, and create administrative complexity, particularly in a rising rate environment. Our bonds provide us with operational flexibility and fixed-cost debt, while our strong liquidity allows us to take advantage of attractive opportunities when they arise. Dan, I will hand it back to you for closing remarks.Daniel C. BartokThanks, Jim. I'm pleased with the Forestar team's execution during our third fiscal quarter. They delivered growth and strong profitability, allowing Forestar to maintain double-digit returns. I'm even more pleased with how well we are positioned and the strength of our balance sheet. Our strong balance sheet and ample liquidity give us the flexibility to invest in land opportunities that will drive our future growth and maintain an appropriate level of finished lots and inventory to meet builder demand. We are the market leader in a highly fragmented and undercapitalized industry. And we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of the strong demand for finished lots by homebuilders. We will continue to aggregate significant market share over the next few years while maintaining our disciplined approach on investing capital to enhance the long-term value of Forestar. Builder incentives have been impactful in bridging the affordability gap for buyers. Forecasts now expect 2023 U.S. single-family housing starts to decline approximately 10% to 20% compared to 2022, an improvement from a decline between 15% and 30% forecasted just 3 months ago. While new home starts and sales have been stronger than expected in 2023, mortgage rates are back to peak levels reached in late 2022, which could impact demand as buyers adjust. We cannot control the macroeconomic backdrop or directly influence the demand for housing. However, we can and will stay focused on strengthening our platform and increasing operational efficiencies to drive future growth. We are closely monitoring each market, submarket and project, as we strive to balance pace and price to maximize returns. Our goals have not changed. We still intend to double our market share to 5% over the intermediate term. Looking forward, we believe that D.R. Horton and many other homebuilders will continue to shift their focus towards buying finished lots from third-party developers, instead of self-developing. We believe our market share gains will accelerate as financing remains expensive and less available for the majority of our competitors. We have a track record of solid execution and are focused on the long-term opportunity before us. As appropriate, we will utilize our platform and strong balance sheet to capitalize on opportunities that build shareholder value. With our experienced team that has successfully managed through prior market cycles, we are well equipped to navigate this dynamic environment while investing wisely for our future growth and further strengthening our industry-leading position. Paul, at this time, we will open up the line for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator[Operator Instruction] And the first question today is coming from Truman Patterson from Wolfe Research.Truman Andrew PattersonFirst, your largest customer just suggested that they're positioning for growing potentially kind of 10% in 2024. Your all net debt to total capital ratio, really healthy at 19%. I'm just trying to understand where that metric might need to go if you all are targeting to potentially support that type of growth as well.Daniel C. BartokWell, I think our capital structure as it sits today, we are well positioned to meet that growth without additional capital. I think as we said before, we believe we can actually grow our volume at about a 20% annual rate without raising additional capital, although it would require potentially leveraging some additional debt when appropriate.Truman Andrew PattersonGot you. Fair enough. So kind of maybe, the net debt to total cap to hit a 20% growth rate might creep up to the 30%, maybe 40% range. On your lot ASP, it was up about 3.5%, both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. And I realize that there's a lot that can impact that metric geographically, lot size, et cetera. I'm just trying to understand how kind of core finished lot pricing has been trending recently, given the strong rebound in demand by builders bumping up incentives to move some of the homes.James D. AllenWell, obviously, you can't draw too many conclusions on prices from our ASP. There's so much impact from mix, right, in there so due to lot sizes and geography. So that's always going to be changing. But I think as far as pricing goes, with per front-foot basis, I mean we really haven't seen reductions in pricing. So we've seen pricing hold consistent, probably reflected more in our margins than our ASP.OperatorThe next question is coming from Carl Reichardt from BTIG.Carl Edwin ReichardtI did want to follow up, I think, on part of what Truman was asking really on margin variability in the $1.4 billion you've got in backlog. As you look out the next few quarters or maybe even just the full year of '24, are you expecting the gross margin to be somewhat less variable than it has been either due to mix or just strengthened conditions? And do you think you've reached in the past sort of a peak gross margin that you can achieve in the future? Or do you expect it to go above your last prior peak?Daniel C. BartokThat's a tough one. We always talk about returns more than margins, I guess, really about maintaining the appropriate pace and meeting the builders' demand. What's really been interesting over the last several quarters is this is a really -- as we dialed in on a project-by-project basis, the same as the builders do, there's been some cases where we've had to make price adjustments and reduce margins. There's also been occasions where we've been able to increase price and increase margins. So I think it's going to be lumpy. Hopefully, we haven't peaked. Hopefully, there's some better margins ahead. But development costs aren't -- don't look to be coming down. Land costs don't look to be coming down. I think there's going to be pricing pressure. We're just going to have to see how that plays out on a project-by-project basis.Carl Edwin ReichardtAnd then can you talk a little bit about any regional trends really over the last 2 quarters, I think? Obviously, in '22, we had relative strength in the Southeast, Florida, big for you, Carolina is big for you, Texas. With a lot of weakness in parts of the West, does that begin to reverse at all in terms of builder demand for lots in '23?Daniel C. BartokI would say that Phoenix and Denver, 2 of our markets where we were seeing kind of late to come back to the market, have both rebounded nicely. And we're definitely seeing demand for lots in those markets return as we had hoped for. We didn't sell a lot during the last several quarters in those markets because of really lack of demand and lack of home starts. And it really goes back to the builders' inventories, where were they long, where do they need to kind of right-size their inventories. And it seems like their starts' paces have leveled off, and that's kind of at a level, an increasing basis again. So hopefully, that gives us the opportunity to continue to be strategic in each of the markets.OperatorThe next question is coming from Anthony Pettinari from Citigroup.Asher Melech SohnenThis is Asher Sohnen for Anthony. So just thinking back to 2022, you saw builder demand kind of pull back on the surge in interest rates. And obviously, housing demand fell. But I was wondering just sort of over the course of this quarter and maybe quarter-to-date, how responsive has like builder interest in lots been kind of relative to mortgage rates? As mortgage rates have risen over the past couple of months, have you seen a corresponding cooling of inbound builder demand? And then even more finely, chopping it more finely, when mortgage rates start to level off for a couple of weeks, do you see builder interest kind of pick up?Mark Stephen WalkerYes. We're seeing the builders' appetite increase, especially for finished lots. I mean they're all looking for the option lots. They're all looking for finished lots. And so today, we're seeing the appetite increase across the board for the builders, so not just our #1 customer with D.R. Horton but also with the other builder clients that we have. So we're receiving more calls. So we have not seen a falloff. Actually, we've seen the opposite. We've seen an increase in demand.Asher Melech SohnenAll right. No, that's helpful. And then I guess, I think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that your lots are a kind of an attractive cost basis. So I was wondering if you're able to kind of size that roughly at all. I think maybe in terms of timing, like how long before you move through that land? And if so, once that happens, is there kind of a meaningful step-down in margin kind of baked in?Mark Stephen WalkerYes. Typically, we underwrite to a 12-month development time frame. Again, it goes to market-to-market, project-by-project. It's been interesting in terms of if we elongate that time line, we've able to hold some pricing power just because the demand for finished lots has been there. We're kind of riding those tailwinds at the moment. But again, we look at the market every time we price lots. We don't price our lots upfront, so that's been helpful for us. If we see something in the first, let say, 4 months or so of development that is a concern, we can consider that when we're pricing our lots. We can't always get back to pricing power to offset the cost increases. But as Dan said, we're not focused primarily on margin but protecting our return, maximizing our returns.Operator(Operator Instructions) The next question is coming from Mike Rehaut from JPMorgan.Douglas Samuel WardlawDoug Wardlaw on for Mike. Taking a step back to the end of last quarter with your comments on the banking volatility, I just want to know if you had any further color and if there's been any change since that last conversation on the banking volatility's impact on other land developers. If so, towards the beginning of the previous quarter, did you see any type of material benefit?Katie SmithWere you asking about banking volatility? Sorry, you were kind of breaking up.Douglas Samuel WardlawSorry. Yes, yes. Just if there is any update on banking volatility's impact on your competitors and if there was, did you guys see any type of benefit?Daniel C. BartokIt's more anecdotes that we hear than anything that we have experienced because we don't use project-level financing. But we have definitely heard that other developers, the terms at which they're being quoted to do deals, have gotten more stringent. Interest rates have clearly risen to do acquisitions, development loans for developers. And so again, the anecdotes are they are having a more difficult time. In some cases, not being able to get the loans that they would have, needing more equity to balance out, and paying higher interest rates.Douglas Samuel WardlawGot it. So nothing material or nothing outside of the inventory (inaudible)?Daniel C. BartokYes. Yes, I would say nothing in addition to that.OperatorThank you. And there are no other questions at this time. I would now like to hand the call back to Dan Bartok for closing remarks.Daniel C. BartokThank you, Paul. And thank you to everyone on the Forestar team for your focus and hard work. I'm proud of the results the team achieved this quarter. We will stay disciplined, flexible and opportunistic as we continue to consolidate market share. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again in November to share our fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 results. Thank you.OperatorThank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a wonderful day.]"

Now I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO.Story continuesDavid V. AuldThank you, Jessica. And good morning. I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray and Paul Romanowski, our Executive Vice Presidents and Co-Chief Operating Officers; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. For the third quarter, the D.R. Horton team delivered solid results, highlighted by earnings of $3.90 per diluted share. Our consolidated pretax income was $1.8 billion on an 11% increase in revenues to $9.7 billion, with a pretax profit margin of 18.3%. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended June 30 was 31.8%, and our return on equity for the same period was 24.3%. And despite continued high mortgage rates and inflationary pressures, our net sales orders increased 37% from the prior year quarter as the supply of both new home and existing homes at affordable price points is limited and demographics supporting housing demand remain favorable. We are focused on consolidating market share by supplying more homes to meet homebuyer demand while maximizing the returns and capital efficiency in each of our communities. With improvements in both labor capacity and availability of materials, our cycle times are decreasing, positioning us to release homes for sale earlier in the construction cycle. We are pleased that we were able to increase our homebuilding starts to 22,900 homes this quarter, which was supported by a 6% sequential increase in our active selling communities. Our homebuilding operating margins are lower than the record high margins we reported last year due to cost inflation and pricing adjustments and incentives we implemented to address homebuyer affordability challenges caused by higher mortgage rates. However, our margins improved sequentially from the March to June quarter as home prices and incentives have stabilized and some reductions in construction costs are now being realized in our homes closed.We are well positioned with our experienced operators, diverse product offerings, flexible lot supply and strong capital and liquidity positions to produce and sustain consistent returns, growth and cash flow. We will maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of our company, including returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Paul?Paul J. RomanowskiEarnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 decreased 16% to $3.90 per diluted share compared to $4.67 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter decreased 19% to $1.3 billion on consolidated revenues of $9.7 million. Our third quarter home sales revenues were $8.7 billion on 22,985 homes closed compared to $8.3 billion on 21,308 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $378,600, flat sequentially and down 3% from the prior year quarter. Mike?Michael J. MurrayOur net sales orders in the third quarter increased 37% to 22,879 homes and order value increased 26% from the prior year to $8.7 million. Our cancellation rate for the quarter was 18%, flat sequentially and down from 24% in the prior year quarter. Our average number of active selling communities was up 6% sequentially and up 8% year-over-year. The average price of net sales orders in the third quarter was $381,100, up 2% sequentially and down 8% from the prior year quarter. To adjust to changing market conditions and higher mortgage rates over the past year, we increased our use of incentives and reduced the sizes of our homes to provide better affordability to homebuyers. Although home prices and incentives have begun to stabilize, we expect to continue utilizing a higher level of incentives as compared to last year. Our sales volumes can be significantly affected by changes in mortgage rates and other economic factors. However, we will continue to start homes and maintain sufficient inventory to meet sales demand and aggregate market share. Bill?Bill W. WheatOur gross profit margin on home sales revenues in the third quarter was 23.3%, up 170 basis points sequentially from the March quarter. The decrease in our gross margin from March to June reflects a decrease in incentive costs and lower stick and brick costs on homes closed during the quarter. On a per square foot basis, home sales revenues and lot costs were both flat sequentially, while stick and brick cost per square foot decreased 4%. As Mike mentioned, we continue to continue -- we expect to continue offering a higher level of incentives as compared to 2022. But due to the recent stabilization in home prices and some reductions in both incentives and construction costs, we expect our homebuilding gross margins to be slightly higher in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Jessica?Jessica HansenIn the third quarter, our homebuilding in SG&amp;A expenses increased by 6% from last year and homebuilding SG&amp;A expenses as a percentage of revenue was 6.7%, up 10 basis points from the same quarter in the prior year. Fiscal year-to-date home building SG&amp;A was 7.2% of revenues, up 30 basis points from the same period last year as we maintained the capacity of our platform to grow market share. Paul?Paul J. RomanowskiWe started 22,900 homes in the June quarter, up 15% from the March quarter. We ended the quarter with 43,800 homes in inventory, down 22% from a year ago and flat sequentially. 25,000 of our homes at June 30 were unsold, of which 5,700 were completed. For homes we closed in the third quarter, our construction cycle time decreased by over a month from the second quarter, reflecting improvements in the supply chain. We expect to see a further decrease in our cycle time for homes closed in the fourth quarter. We will continue to ingest our homes in inventory and starts pace based on market conditions. Mike?Michael J. MurrayOur homebuilding lot position at June 30 consisted of approximately 555,000 lots of which 25% were owned and 75% were controlled through purchase contracts. 34% of our total owned lots are finished and 53% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our capital efficient and flexible lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position. Our third quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land and development totaled $2.2 billion, up 25% from the prior year quarter and 27% sequentially. Our current quarter investments consisted of $1.2 billion for finished lots, $700 million for land development and $290 million for land acquisition. Paul?Paul J. RomanowskiDuring the quarter, our rental operations generated $162 million of pretax income on $667 million of revenues. From the sale of 1,754 single-family rental homes and 230 multifamily rental units. Our rental property inventory at June 30 was $3.3 billion, which consisted of $1.9 billion of single-family rental properties and $1.4 billion of multifamily rental properties. Our rental operations are generating significant increases in both revenues and profits this year as our platform expands across more markets. For the fourth quarter, we expect our rental revenues to be greater than our third quarter and our rental profit margin to be lower than our third quarter. Bill?Bill W. WheatForestar, our majority-owned residential lot development company reported total revenues of $369 million for the third quarter on 3,812 lots sold with pretax income of $62 million. Forestar's owned and controlled lot position at June 30 was 73,000 lots. 57% of Forestar's owned lots are under contract with or subject to a right of first offer to D.R. Horton. $270 million of our finished lots purchased in the third quarter were from Forestar. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and had more than $780 million of liquidity at quarter end with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 19.1%. Forestar is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the shortage of finished lots in the homebuilding industry and to aggregate significant market share over the next few years with its strong balance sheet, lot supply and relationship with D.R. Horton. Mike?Michael J. MurrayFinancial Services earned $94 million of pretax income in the third quarter on $229 million of revenues, resulting in a pretax profit margin of 41.2%. During the quarter, 99% of our mortgage company's loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations, and our mortgage company handled the financing for 74% of our buyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 51% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI mortgage this quarter had an average FICO Score of 723 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 88%. First-time homebuyers represented 56% of the closings handled by our mortgage company this quarter, Bill?Bill W. WheatOur balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic to support and to sustain an operating platform that produces consistent returns, growth and cash flow. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with low leverage and significant liquidity which provides us with flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions. During the first 9 months of the year, our cash provided by homebuilding operations was $2.1 billion, and our consolidated cash provided by operations was $2.3 billion. At June 30, we had $4.6 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $2.6 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $2 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility. Homebuilding debt at June 30 totaled $2.7 billion, which includes $400 million of senior notes that we redeemed early in July. Our homebuilding leverage was 11.1% at the end of June, and homebuilding leverage net of cash was 0.7%. Our consolidated leverage at June 30 was 22% and consolidated leverage net of cash was 11.2%. At June 30, our stockholders' equity was $21.7 billion, and book value per share was $64.3, up 23% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months ended June, our return on equity was 24.3%. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $85 million and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in August. We repurchased 3.1 million shares of common stock for $343 million during the quarter. For a total of 7.7 million shares repurchased fiscal year-to-date or $764 million. Jessica?Jessica HansenAs we look forward, we expect current market conditions to continue with uncertainty regarding mortgage rates, the capital markets and general economic conditions that may significantly impact our business. For the full year, we currently expect to close between 82,800 and 83,300 homes in our homebuilding operations and between 6,500 and 7,000 homes and units in our rental operations. We expect our consolidated revenues for fiscal 2023 to be in a range of $34.7 million to $35.1 billion. We expect to generate greater than $3 billion of cash flow from operations in fiscal 2023, primarily from our homebuilding operations. We also expect our fiscal 2023 share repurchases to be approximately $1.1 billion similar to last year. For the fourth quarter, we currently expect to generate consolidated revenues of $9.7 billion to $10.1 billion and homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in the range of 22,800 to 23,300 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the fourth quarter to be approximately 23.5% to 24% and homebuilding SG&amp;A as a percentage of revenues in the fourth quarter to be in the range of 6.7% to 6.8%. We anticipate a financial services pretax profit margin of around 30% to 35% and we expect our income tax rate to be approximately 24.5% in the fourth quarter. We will continue to balance our cash flow utilization priorities among our core homebuilding operations, our rental operations, maintaining conservative homebuilding leverage and strong liquidity, paying an increased dividend and consistently repurchasing shares. David?David V. AuldIn closing, our results and position reflect our experienced teams, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings. All of these are key components of our operating platform to sustain our ability to produce consistent returns, growth and cash flow, while continuing to aggregate market share. We will maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your continued focus and hard work. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) The first question today is coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI.Stephen KimImpressive quarter once again. So congratulations on that. I wanted to talk about your construction -- your pace of construction and your goals going forward. You talked about growing your starts this quarter versus last quarter. But when we just look back maybe a year, 1.5 years ago, there were a couple of quarters where you started even more, you started about 25,000 units a quarter. I wanted to get a sense from you as to whether or not you feel like that's a level that you could achieve in the near term? And if not, why not? And then also, if you could talk about whether seasonality is going to be a factor we should be thinking about with respect to your starts cadence?Paul J. RomanowskiYes, Stephen. We have seen, as we talked about a 30-day reduction in our cycle time and you can see consistency and improvement as we travel throughout our divisions and seeing pretty good balance with our trades and all the supplies that we need to continue with improvement in cycle time. If you look at our starts pace, it did tick up some and stayed pretty consistent with our closings, which is a cadence that we expect to see as we look towards the fourth quarter based on our sales pace and the strength of the market and where we have the lots and the ability to push that up a little bit, we will. But not looking to outpace the market and continue to keep in that cadence and position ourselves for continued growth.Stephen KimOkay. So it sounds like I didn't really get a sense for whether 25,000 is a significant figure in your mind? And why is that a level that we couldn't achieve or revisit simply because it wasn't that long ago where you actually did that for, like I said, 2 quarters in a row. Then also, if I could tack on a second question about your rental platform. You did give some guidance regarding revs being higher, but margins being lower relative to -- in 4Q relative to 3Q. But could you talk about your plans for rental inventory in dollars carried on the balance sheet. Where should we be thinking you're going to take that level of investment, which I think is $3.3 billion, if I'm not mistaken, right now. Is that going to grow meaningfully as we look into 2024 and beyond? Or is that a level that you feel comfortable with maybe even begin to harvest some of that?David V. AuldSteve, as to the 25,000 starts per quarter, we are very focused on increasing -- incrementally increasing starts quarter to quarter to quarter. And we believe that as we continue this process, we will consolidate the labor availability, capacity and with labor and material consolidation, our ability to program out our starts and then continue to build the houses and gain efficiency in that process. It's just -- it's an ongoing effort. So do we have a target out there of -- we got to get to this number? No. Our target is market-by-market, flag-by-flag, how do we consolidate these markets and increase our market share. And just by the nature of doing that, we're going to get bigger and bigger and bigger. And I'll let Mike reply to the rental question.Michael J. MurrayStephen. So we expect that the margin on the fourth quarter closings and the rental segment will probably have a lower profit margin, largely on the basis of mix of projects that are delivering between Q3 and then into Q4. A lot of it's on a cost basis difference between those homes that were built at different times and when they're delivering.Bill W. WheatAnd then in terms of our forward investment level, we're at a total of about $3.3 billion of inventory today. We've seen a significant growth ramp in that over the last 2 years. We do expect to continue to grow that platform and we will see our inventory levels continue to grow over the next couple of years, but we do expect that growth pace to moderate from what it's been in the last 2 years.OperatorThe next question is coming from Joe Ahlersmeyer from Deutsche Bank.Joseph David AhlersmeyerGood quarter, guys. I wanted to follow up on the community count. That's up about 9% year-to-date -- calendar year-to-date, that is. And I'm just wondering, is there anything in there that we should consider that's more temporary in nature? I'm not going to straight line that release or anything or that sequential number, but -- should we expect that to go down into the back half? Or are we going to sustain those levels? And then I have a follow-up.Jessica HansenSure Joe. We've been really focused on our flag count. I mean we clearly have the lot position to open new communities and to grow our community count, whereas the last couple of years has not moved more than a low single-digit percentage. We feel like we're positioned to be closer to the mid-single digits going forward. So not necessarily 9% going forward but around the mid-single digits quarter-to-quarter. There can be some choppiness just determining when we close out of communities and ultimately bring them online. But our lot position is there and our operators are focused on growing their flag count.Joseph David AhlersmeyerMakes sense. And just thinking about the homes and inventory number, that was actually sequentially flattish the last couple of quarters even as you did grow those communities. So is it right to think that maybe this is part of returning to higher levels of inventory unit turnover? Or should we expect that the total homes in inventory will sort of catch up on a lag as you continue to grow starts?Bill W. WheatVery focused on improving our inventory turn as our construction cycle times have improved, that's facilitating that. You look historically, we typically -- when we go into a year with our number of homes in inventory, we've been able to turn that 2x in the following year. The last couple of years has been slower than that. And so we're looking to get back to that more historic inventory turn level as we look to fiscal '24.David V. AuldThat is going back to the star question. That is a factor on our start pace is making sure that we have the capacity to continue to deliver these houses in a more -- in a faster and more efficient way. So it all flows together so that we can actually deliver more houses with fewer homes and inventory quarter-to-quarter, quarter-to-quarter.OperatorThe next question is coming from John Lovallo John from UBS.John LovalloThe first one is, it looks like the sequential improvement or the sequential cadence of orders from the second quarter to third quarter was better than normal seasonality by a bit. I mean, I think normal seasonality would suggest down about 5%. It looks like they were down about 1%. As we move into the fourth quarter, how should we sort of think about seasonality, which looks like it's typically down, call it, 15% to 20% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Is that a reasonable way to think about the fourth quarter or the dynamics getting a little bit better out there where you might be able to do a bit better than that?Bill W. WheatThanks, John. I think we are seeing more normal seasonality this year in terms of just demand traffic patterns. And so I think our base expectations would be that orders would show a bit closer to normal seasonality going forward. But to our approach in trying to be as consistent as we can in providing a starts pace and a consistent level of inventory with still a short supply of inventory out there in the existing home market and in the new home market, we are going to make sure we've got enough homes out there to capture whatever demand there may be. And so our hope would be over the longer term, we can see a bit more consistency there. But there still is a natural seasonality in an ebb and flow to consumer demand that I think is getting back to a more normal level.David V. AuldAnd I do believe that we're going to have a lot more houses to sell this year given the shortened cycle time and our ability to give people a state certain to close. So we were limited in the number of homes last year. So the comparison this quarter to last quarter, a year ago quarter, is probably going to -- it's going to look better than typical seasonality.John LovalloThat makes sense. Okay. And then maybe just a bigger picture question. If we look at 2019, D.R. Horton delivered 57,000 homes in that ballpark versus the close to 83,000 homes expected this year. Industry-wide single-family starts were pretty similar in 2019 to what's expected today. Obviously, Horton and the public have been gaining share for years, but this is close to 45%, 50% jump since 2019. So I guess the question is, how sustainable are these gains, how important is your build strategy to this performance? And maybe how important is the lack of existing home inventory just to overall homebuilder success today.David V. AuldI think yes, yes and yes. We've been focused for years now on simplifying this business and creating a level of consistency that didn't exist in the '80s, '90s or early 2000s and jokingly, I call it, building a real business. And I believe we have and are doing that. And coming out of the downturn, there was tremendous opportunity to consolidate market. But we didn't have the liquidity or balance sheet to do it. So as we have grown through this last 15, 20 years that were 15 years, I guess. Our goal has been to create a company with a balance sheet and the liquidity to take advantage of any disruptions in the market. And since 2019, it just seems like at least quarterly, you're either coming out of it or going into it, another disruption. So it's the power of the platform. And when we talk a lot about it, I think you're seeing it play out. It's people. It's location product. It's just trying to simplify the business and create affordability to a level nobody else can achieve. And that's going to consolidate these markets.OperatorThe next question is coming from Carl Reichardt from BTIG.Carl Edwin ReichardtBill, you mentioned stick and brick down 4% per foot, I think, year-on-year. Could you break that out in terms of what materials are helping most obviously, lumber and then labor and the reason I ask is I'm assuming that we're starting to see some leverage from the single-family and multifamily rental platform. Part of the reason you're trying to grow that business is to add scale in your markets to lower overall construction costs. So I'm wondering if that's starting to help there.Bill W. WheatRight now, as we look at the components of the home across the materials, it is primarily lumber right now. There's some minor moves in both directions really across the other components of the homes is primarily lumber there. I think we are on the front edge of starting to realize some improvement in labor as the homes that we have been starting over the last quarter or 2 have been at a lower cost than what we had there for a while. But I think we still expect a bit more improvement there with lumber. And then really, the forward cost structure really depends on what the capacity of the industry is and what all builders are doing. So a bit more improvement there. But as we continue to add scale, which does include our rental platform as well, we definitely have advantages and opportunities to continue to leverage that to drive our cost structure going down, especially relative to the rest of the industry.Carl Edwin ReichardtOkay. And then David, the private builders we're talking to have seen sort of you mentioned normal seasonality to a slower market maybe than they had expected start in the summer. I don't know if that's just a particular vagaries of being small and private. Can't harder to do buydowns, more capital constraints to do higher end. But you purchased a private during the quarter, and you've got presence in a lot of markets where the smaller privates really make up the bulk of your competitors, in some cases, all of them. Has there been much movement in terms of interest willingness or need to sell among the privates right now just given what they're facing relative to what the publics have advantage-wise.David V. AuldCarl, we talk about it a lot. It seems like in the last couple of years, but it is really hard to put a lot on the ground. It is really hard to build houses. And these private guys, now they've got to struggle with capital from either private or banks increasing on cost. So do we have the opportunity to talk to a lot of these guys? Yes, we do. But it's going to take unique opportunities for us to invite them into the family because we do have a special culture here, and we're not going to screw it up trying to force a square peg in a round hole.Jessica HansenExcited about the most recent (inaudible) in terms of already and having been one of our largest lot developers in our Gulf Coast region. And so we picked up Truland's homebuilding operations, but Nathan Cox and his team will continue to be a key component in terms of developing lots to us and -- for us in the Gulf Coast.David V. AuldAnd I will say, I've had a personal relationship with Nathan Cox for 15-plus years, and he is an example of somebody that absolutely mirrors our culture. He's a super quality guy, he has built a good company. And somebody we're going to be in business with for a long, long time.OperatorThe next question is coming from Mike Rehaut from JPMorgan.Michael Jason RehautGreat. Appreciate it. Wanted to circle back to an earlier answer that you gave around -- thoughts around your 4Q demand and order trends. Last month, you had Lennar talk about their third quarter orders being a little bit above 2Q and KB talking about normal seasonality being muted in the third -- in their third quarter, all based on not only strong demand but also kind of filling a void for the lack of supply that's out there and the strong demand that new homebuilders can provide as a result. So just going back to your comments, I think, Bill, you kind of said perhaps normal seasonality, David, I think I heard you say perhaps better than normal seasonality. I was hoping to kind of get a finer-tuned answer there in terms of what you think your capacity is to meet demand? Again, is there an ability to take orders that is similar to your third quarter level if you see the demand there? And I would assume you'd be just as interested in taking as much share as you can or going back to an earlier question as well, is there any type of production constraints that might hold you back there a little bit?Jessica HansenSure, Mike. So I mean, we're not in this for quarterly results. We're in this for the long term and to build as much shareholder value as we can over the long term. So quarter to quarter to quarter, as you've heard David say over and over, we're focused on being consistent. And as we talked about, it's all tied to our start pace. So we're not managing to a sales number in Q4. If the market is there and our cycle times continue to improve, we might be able to see a little bit better than normal seasonality. If the market were to weaken for some reason or we don't get as many homes started, ultimately, it could be less than normal seasonality. Right now, we feel like we're positioned to increase our start slightly from where we were in Q3 and also, as we've talked about, our construction cycle times have continued to improve, and our flag count has grown. So we feel like we're very well positioned. But frankly, we're more focused on positioning for '24 at this point than we are worried about Q4. I mean we're going to finish out the year very strong and generate strong returns and continue to add to book value and position ourselves to go do the same in 2024.Michael Jason RehautOkay. I appreciate that. I guess maybe then turning to '24. When you look at your backlog conversion at the beginning of the year, relative to what you deliver. At best, you kind of hit a 4x maybe low 4x turnover. In other words, your backlog turned over 4x in terms of the amount of closings we were able to achieve. The height was in 2020 at 4.8. It looks like on a rough basis, you'd probably be closer to 5x or above maybe even 6x given where potentially your backlog could be at the end of this fiscal year. So given the fact that you're looking for community count growth, is it still reasonable to expect kind of a high single or even low double-digit closings growth number for next year? Or again, just given the physical constraints of turnover and other -- the fact that cycle times are improving, but not back to where they were, any other items to consider?Bill W. WheatSure, Mike. As we're looking to fiscal '24, we talked about this before. We always try to position ourselves with our lot position, with our homes and inventory so that we're in a position to deliver close to a double-digit growth, high single, 10% type growth. And so that's what we're doing again, is positioning our inventory so that we're in a position there in the market that we see today. I think it's there for us if we can get our lot positions and our homes and inventory ready for that. And with improved cycle times, that helps us improve our inventory turnover. And I think we focus a lot more on our inventory turn, our inventory conversion than we do backlog. Backlog is just really just a factor of when we choose to sign a sales contract on a home. We focus on our start pace, what homes we have in inventory and then we adjust when we're going to release those for sale based on when we have confidence that we can deliver that home. So every home we start, we will close. And if we're turning those faster, then that will improve the inventory turnover and honestly improves your visibility to see what our closings are going to be as well. So it's really about our start pace, our inventory positioning and then how efficiently can we turn that.Jessica HansenAnd as a reminder, we sell and close generally 35% to 40% of our homes intra-quarter so you never see those in our backlog that we're reporting at a quarter end anyway, which is why Bill is alluding to home starts and our homes and inventory being a better driver and an indicator of what we're going to close in a forward period.OperatorThe next question is coming from Matthew Bouley from Barclays.Matthew Adrien BouleyI wanted to ask about lot costs. I think you said lots on a per square foot basis were actually flat sequentially, which is maybe a little surprising given the shortage of lots out there, as you alluded to. Could you speak to a little around what's implied near term in your margin guidance around lot costs? And then just sort of more broadly, how are you thinking about managing inflation and lots going forward?Michael J. MurrayWhat we're seeing today in the closings are lots that were contracted and acquired quite some time ago in coming through. So we're not seeing a lot of cost pressure coming through. Going forward, along with the lot scarcity, we're expecting to see a lot costs coming through in forward margins at a higher level. There has certainly been inflation in land and lot development costs and in finished lot prices. So we expect to see that, but that's factored into our guidance and the way we're planning for the business next year.Matthew Adrien BouleyOkay. Got it. And then secondly, just on the topic of mortgage rate buydowns. I'm curious if you can kind of educate us a little around how that dynamic may change depending where prevailing mortgage rates go. So if we were to see a rise in mortgage rates from here, for example, what level or what ability do you have to -- what's kind of the maximum level of rate buydown, I guess you could do? And conversely, if rates were to come down, would you continue to buy down rates by the same amount? Or would you actually reduce kind of the size of your mortgage rate buydowns. Just curious around how all that may play out.David V. AuldYes. The rate buydown for us has been an effective incentive and to help us provide as we've improved our cycle time as well, a certainty of close date and a certainty of home payment. And we have stayed roughly a point below the market, and we'll have to measure that as we move forward, depending on where rates move, whether that be up or down. But we have found it to be our -- one of our most effective incentives, and we have been consistent in that execution, and we'll continue to explore that as the interest rates move and on a go-forward basis.OperatorThe next question is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research Company.Eric BosshardThe gross margin progress in the quarter was notable and you talked about, I guess, a bit more progress in 4Q. I'm curious if you could help us get a sense of how we should be thinking about the path of gross margins from here? You've done a good job historically outlining ranges. But in the world, which seems like it's stabilizing for you now, how should we think about the range of path of gross margin?Bill W. WheatYes, Eric, what we have visibility to is basically what's in our backlog and what's been in our recent sales and then we certainly have visibility to what our recent cost levels have been. So we've been seeing the costs on our more recent starts be lower. So we've got some visibility to what that could produce. So right now, as we look at our recent backlog in sales, we see a sequential modest improvement in margin up to kind of the high 23s to 24 range in Q4. You used the word stabilization. Last quarter, we used that word quite a bit. And so we -- and we're still seeing that. And so I think we are kind of settling into a more stable period here in terms of our costs and demand has been pretty steady as well. So I think we certainly don't see a trajectory and margin forever upward, but the modest improvement into the coming quarter looks like a pretty sustainable level here in the near to medium term.Michael J. MurrayA lot of tailwind from limited inventory supply at affordable price points are helpful to margins. And then interest rates are the biggest risk to margins, significant increases in interest rates will compress our margins.Eric BosshardWithin this, you mentioned a moment ago, buying rates down a point below market has been a silver bullet or something that's been a catalyst for consumers to go ahead and sign a contract. I'm curious if you're seeing that's just the way it's going to be or if you're seeing consumers becoming more comfortable with the reality in the days of a 3% mortgage or long gone. I guess what I'm trying to figure out is can you get away with buying down rates less now? Are you seeing consumers a bit less sensitive? Or is this a medium-term reality that we should expect?Paul J. RomanowskiThe interest rate buydown is an incentive like many that we use. And we have a lot of different levers that we may pull market by market or community by community based on the needs of the buyers walking in the door. There's certainly been a hot button today because of the meteoric rise in rates and people's adjustment to that as that adjusts, it will just ebb and flow with different incentives, whether that's closing costs or price or included features. It's been a good tool for us today. We will adjust to the market as it comes at us.Jessica HansenIt was still on a majority of the homes we closed in the third quarter, but it was at a lower percentage than it was in Q2 in terms of the number of buyers utilizing that incentive.OperatorThe next question is coming from Ken Zener from Seaport Research Partners.Kenneth Robinson ZenerWell, 2 questions here. One, I just want to kind of focus on capital and cash flow and the other is going to be about just where we are on kind of the level of business by community versus the past. So your ability to match EPS to cash flow has been improving, I think, $3 billion of cash flow, think about $4 billion in net income. So about 75% obviously, multifamily plays into that. But could you specifically talk to the 53% of option lots that you expect to be finished? What limits this from going higher perhaps? And what kind of factors determine whether you're taking down finished or raw land in those auction structures? And just refresh us on what that raw first developed lot cost is so we can understand the inflation inherent in those raw lots.Jessica HansenSure. I'll start, Ken, and then I'm sure Mike or someone is going to chime in on the true ops piece of it. But in terms of the 53% that we said in our scripted remarks of our option lots that we expect to be purchase finished, that's just at a point in time. So that's where we've already determined who's going to develop those lots for us and we know we're going to take them down as a finished lot. That's by no means is a ceiling. We're now closing 60-plus percent of our houses quarter-to-quarter on a lot purchased from a third-party developer. And so we -- in the normal course of business, we'll contract with a land seller as D.R. Horton put the option under contract and then we'll go find a land developer. So the 53% is more before than necessarily a ceiling.Michael J. MurrayI think you said it very well. We're going to take a piece of dirt and title it and then in that process, look to work with a third-party developer in some cases, to assign that contract to, they'll acquire the land parcels and then they'll complete the lot development and sell us finished lots that will then start constructing homes on over time. So that 53% expected would go up, but we will choose in some cases, to develop the neighborhood ourselves. In every one of our markets, we have great teams in place that are capable of developing their own lots as well as negotiating to buy finished lots from third-party developers.Bill W. WheatAnd Ken, to circle back to your initial comment about capital and cash flow and percentage of cash flows relative to our earnings. We are seeing a big improvement in that this year, and that's what we're expecting to see this year, I would tell you that, that big move is being driven primarily by the improvement in our cycle time by our construction cycle times. We don't have as much capital tied up per home in our homes and inventory because we're turning those faster. Definitely, our land shift over many years has been a component of that over time. But this year specifically, it's more about our homes and inventory turnover improving.Kenneth Robinson ZenerGreat. And so I guess, just a follow-up to that, why would you want to develop land as opposed to like other builders or 1 specifically that as of that? And then the other question, which I'm still struggling with when I just try to normalize housing is your start pace or your pace per community is about 4.6% this year. It used to be about 3.6%. Why is that the new normal basically? I mean I don't want to push down sales pace for no reason. But like why are we so far above where we used to be as in the industry. It's not just you guys. If you could explain that.Paul J. RomanowskiYes. I think on the lot development question, we have talented teams across our platform. And there are instances where important to us in our start pace is we have to have a lot on the ground. And so controlling that process and being good at producing that lot is a talent that we're going to retain, and we have to continue to exercise that in order to do so. And some deals just make more sense for us to develop from a timing perspective and/or structure and/or size. And so we're going to make that decision community by community across the platform. In terms of our absorption per community, I just -- I think that you've seen some larger communities that may be a portion of that impacting sales and positioning of those communities to drive more efficient activity. Both on the construction and sales side.Bill W. WheatYes, I'm not sure I've got an answer for you for sure, Ken. If you don't know the answer, I'm sure we don't either in terms of why the industry has improved. The only thing I could come up with is you have seen a shift in this industry to focus more on returns. And as we focused on returns, that really comes down to being more efficient with every asset you have. And so if you can improve your absorption, improve your turns in each community, your returns on capital are improving. And so perhaps you're seeing a little bit of that come through. And your observation of looking at higher pace, higher absorptions over time across the industry.OperatorThe next question is coming from Mike Dahl from RBC Capital.Michael Glaser DahlA couple of follow-ups on the rental side. So there was a pretty well-publicized deal between yourselves and a large SFR company within the quarter and the guide, any color you can provide on how much of that deal already closed in 3Q and whether or not the increase in the guide for the year reflects the full closing of that or if there's going to be some carryover into fiscal '24?Jessica HansenSure. Our guide on rental does and will continue to just incorporate the homes that we've closed and our leasing pace and when those projects are available to be sold and marketed and so we've sold projects on a one-off basis. But as we continue to scale that business, it's opening up additional interested investors who -- there's institutional money that doesn't necessarily want to buy just one project at a time. They're interested in buying a portfolio of projects. The deal you're talking about was press speculation. We haven't publicly commented on any specifics of that transaction. But when we look at our rental communities, whether we're selling multiple projects to one investor or not, they are all individual real estate transactions. And so we would continue to point to our disclosures on a unit basis in terms of the number of completed homes we have and rental units in terms of what that forward pace to sales looks like, and we'll continue to do sales of individual projects, and I'm sure we'll continue to do packages of the sales going forward.Michael Glaser DahlOkay. Got it. And I guess a follow-up there. So without the specifics. Given the total units you're now guiding to and the inventory that you've outlined, you will close a significant portion of your existing inventory in 4Q. And so I fully understand that this is a growth part of your business for the next couple of years, but just circling back to a question thing earlier on the call around specifics on '24. Should we be thinking that you've kind of pulled forward the timing of when some of that inventory you might have expected to close in terms of closing in '23 versus '24 so maybe it's a little lower in '24? Or are you really in a position where even with this increased guide, you can keep growing in '24 offset?Jessica HansenWe've generally been talking about our rental platform combined. But in our 10-Q, you can see a breakdown, and we do give our unit breakdown separately. So '24 is going to be a pretty big growth year from a multifamily perspective and we're going to continue to scale the single family. But as we scale both sides of the business, it could still be choppy quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year with ultimate overall growth on an annual basis expected.OperatorThe next question is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman &amp; Associates.Alan S. RatnerSo very impressive progress on the cycle times and the cost front. I'm guessing what we're seeing now is probably somewhat of a lagged effect of the big pullback in starts the industry saw late last year and the negotiating power you had over the trades at that time and of course, the pullback in lumber. You're not the only ones ramping your start pace now. I think we're hearing similar messages from most of your larger competitors. Maybe some of that's at the expense of the smaller private, but I think it's clear the industry start pace is going to be accelerating here for the next handful of quarters at least. So what are your thoughts on the sustainability of the progress you've made on cycle times and costs heading into '24? And more specifically, what are you seeing from your trades? Are they ramping their headcount in anticipation of an accelerating start pace going forward? Are they -- are you seeing more capacity out there that would support this type of growth without cost inflation following?David V. AuldYes, something we work on every day, aggregating market share involves aggregating trade base and materials within those communities. And we've been talking about a consistent start base when we've been talking about simplifying the process and making it easier for our trades to get to and from the job with the right materials, with a complete understanding of what they're doing. That is allowing us to aggregate these trades. Our goal, our communication is we want to be the builder they want to work for. And we do a lot of things to try to make their job easier and more profitable without coming in and trying to renegotiate price every quarter. So is it sustainable? Yes. I think that we are going to continue to focus on that. And as time goes on, we'll get better and basically build capacity month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter on a continual basis.Alan S. RatnerGot it. Appreciate the thoughts there. Second, Jessica, you mentioned earlier that while you're still offering mortgage rate buydowns on the majority of closings, it did tick a little bit lower quarter-over-quarter. In terms of the share of closings that had those buydowns. I was curious if you -- a, if you had that specific data you could share with us. But b, are you seeing any sensitivity to demand in the communities, maybe where you are dialing back those buy-downs on one hand, the buydowns are probably putting you guys in such a strong competitive advantage versus the resale market. But on the other hand, with inventory as tight as it is and demand seemingly pretty strong, it would seem like you should have some ability to pull back on those without impacting demand too much. So I'm just curious the interplay between that.Paul J. RomanowskiThe use of the rate buydowns is about 10% less than it has been as we look over the last few quarters. And that sensitivity is a community by community and buyer by buyer process. We have great sales agents in each of our communities that go through that experience with every buyer that walks in and finding what's important to them is what they do very well. And so we'll continue as we mentioned, to utilize that. And certainly, that reduction shows some stability in rates, although they've moved up, they've remained in a similar range, and I think people getting comfortable with their purchasing power has allowed some of the relief of that use and/or them not being as concerned about it as the thing that is important to them in their purchase.OperatorThe next question is coming from Truman Patterson from Wolfe Research.Truman Andrew PattersonFirst, just -- this has been touched on a little bit earlier in the call, but just trying to get a big picture overview of the banking environment and what it means for Horton. Has the banking environment currently negatively impacted your developer partners kind of outside of Forestar, their ability to access capital for future projects for smaller private builders? Are you actually seeing them kind of pull back on spec construction, land deals, et cetera.Michael J. MurrayI think with a lot of the third-party developers we work with, we have a long relationship with them. And in a lot of cases, their banking or financing sources are kind of looking through their developer looking through to the land contract and working with us, and they take great comfort in that. And we've been able to continue to sign up new deals over the past quarter have secured new financing commitments for the third-party developers through the process. Is it as easy as it was or is inexpensive as it was? Certainly not. It is more challenging. I do think that the banking industry is being more selective in who and at what levels they're choosing to support third-party developers. On the private builder side, we've probably seen a little more opportunity to step into some positions and help those builders with some liquidity and opportunities by taking some of their lots or stepping into different positions. So it has been, if anything, a bit accretive to the business, and we're just here to help.Truman Andrew PattersonPerfect. And then you all have discussed previously about rotating the smaller square footage offerings to combat affordability. Any way you can help us think about -- are you seeing consumers actually prefer these smaller square footage homes over the past 6 months? Or based on the offerings that you have out there are consumers still kind of preferring the larger square footage homes.Jessica HansenThey prefer what they can afford. So what we generally see is that buyers continues to want as much square footage as they can get, but they're constrained by what they can afford, which is why we continue to start more and more of our smaller floor plans. We did see a slight tick down on a year-over-year basis again by about 2% in the terms of square footage on our homes closed. It was flat sequentially. So we would expect just continued very gradual moves down in our average square footage today.OperatorAnd the next question is coming from Rafe Jadrosich from Bank of America.Rafe Jason JadrosichYou mentioned the build cycles have come down 30 days from peak levels, and you expect them to continue in the fourth quarter. Can you just talk about where they are now versus historical levels? And then beyond the fourth quarter, as you look into next year, how should we think about further potential improvement like what that could do for your asset turns?Paul J. RomanowskiYes. We are today down that 30 days puts us at about 5.5 months in our current cycle time, which is still slightly above our historical averages. And so we see a trend towards -- more towards our normalized and consistent cycle times. That's going to depend on labor availability and our ability to continue to aggregate that labor. As you see start pace increase across the country, we could certainly see some pressure on that but feel comfortable in our position and with the trade capacity that we have in labor out in markets.Michael J. MurrayOur build time of that at 5.5 months has come down about a month, and we probably have another month, 1.5 months to go to get back to where we have been historically when we're operating at a more efficient level. And then there's probably another 45 days to 60 days after that, what we call construction completion until we hit the home closing date. So on average, we're looking to get into a 2x or a little better than 2x turn of inventory units, implies a 6 to slightly less than a 6-month start to closing cycle time.Rafe Jason JadrosichThat's helpful. So there's still more opportunity. And then just on the rental profit outlook for the fourth quarter, the guidance is units will be up quite a bit, but you're thinking about rental profits being down, should we think about gross margins there being lower than kind of core homebuilding longer term? Is there any dynamic that's driving that margin kind of cadence short term? Or is this something we should be thinking about it longer term?Bill W. WheatYes. It's really a short-term thing, as Mike mentioned earlier, part of it is the mix of the projects that we see coming through and the time in which those homes were constructed was the time when we were seeing higher construction costs as well. So we really see that as a Q4 event. And as we look longer term from a gross margin perspective and really pretax margin perspective, we would expect the rental to still be higher than our homebuilding margins overall, maybe a little bit of an anomaly here in Q4, but not a long-term phenomenon.OperatorThat's all the questions we have time for today. I would now like to hand the call back to David Auld for closing remarks.David V. AuldThank you, Paul. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again to share our fourth quarter results in November. And finally, congratulations to the entire D.R. Horton family, on producing a solid third quarter, continue to compete, win every day. Thank you.OperatorThank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

The summer is well underway, and the American Airlines team is firing on all cylinders. We continue to build on the strong foundation we have laid over the past year and remain focused on reliability, profitability, accountability and strengthening our balance sheet. That focus is showing up in our results. Everything we have said we would do at the start of the year, we have done. Our operation is performing at historically strong levels. And this morning, we reported adjusted pretax earnings of approximately $1.8 billion for the second quarter. These earnings were well above the high end of our latest EPS guidance range, marking our fifth consecutive quarterly profit. At the start of the recovery, we told you that returning to profitability hinged on running a reliable airline. American continues to run a strong operation in an evolving environment in which we are very well positioned because of the hard work our team has done in recent years. Our sustained profitability is tied to our leading network rewards program and operation. We have a tremendous network and we operate in a reliable and efficient way, and we reward our customers for using it. Now let's talk more about our financial results. We produced total revenue of $14.1 billion in the second quarter, the highest quarterly revenue in our company's history. This was driven by broad-based demand across all entities with a particular strength in demand for international travel leading into the summer. Throughout the recovery, we have made structural changes to enhance our customers' travel experiences and position the airline for success. We have simplified and harmonized our fleet to create a more nimble and more flexible network that is focused on our most profitable flying. American strength is our network, which is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the demographic changes in the U.S. More people have moved to the Sunbelt region, which is where some of our largest hubs are located. DFW, Charlotte, Miami and Phoenix are very well positioned now and for the future. Our strong regional network provides service to smaller accounts and connects them with our hubs across the country, and our global partnerships are a great complement to our own flying. As a result, we are able to offer customers the most comprehensive network of any U.S. carrier. We continue to adapt our offerings to our customers' evolving preferences. We are taking customers to where they want to go and meeting them where they want to do business. We are servicing more of our customers through our direct channels and driving engagement in our advantage program and credit card portfolio. Our Travel Rewards program is the largest among the U.S. network carriers, and it continues to grow. We are making terrific progress in training our pilots and improving the utilization of both our mainline and regional fleet. Our young fleet and low near-term CapEx requirements enable us to generate free cash flow to reinvest in the business and strengthen our balance sheet. Now turning to the operations. The American Airlines team has delivered strong operational results over the past year, and it continued as we achieved record second quarter completion factor. We operated nearly 0.5 million flights in the quarter with an average load factor of approximately 86%. In the second quarter, we also delivered 11 more combined 0 canceled days in the same period of a year ago. The summer peak started strong with our team delivering our record Memorial Day weekend mainline completion factor while operating our largest mainline Memorial Day weekend schedule ever. The momentum has continued into July. We delivered the best Independence Day holiday operation in our history, with traffic levels we haven't seen since July of 2019. At American, we're focused on taking care of what we can control. Our purposeful approach to planning, along with our investments in our team, fleet and technology has set us up for success during the busy summer travel season and beyond. And now I'll hand it over to Devon who will share more about our second quarter results and the outlook for the remainder of the year.Devon E. MayThank you, Robert. The focus and dedication of the American Airlines team has resulted in strong operational performance which is helping to produce solid financial results. Once again, we delivered on our guidance for the second quarter. Excluding net special items, we reported second quarter net income of $1.4 billion or adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.92. Our strong operational performance resulted in slightly higher capacity production for the quarter and CASMx performance better than the midpoint of our forecast. Unit revenues remained strong, resulting in an operating margin and EPS that outperformed the high end of our guidance provided in May. As Robert mentioned, American produced record revenue of $14.1 billion in the second quarter, up nearly 5% year-over-year. This revenue performance led to our highest ever adjusted operating income of $2.2 billion resulting in a second quarter adjusted operating margin of 15.4%. Unit revenue in the quarter was down just 0.5% versus a historically strong 2022 on 5.3% more capacity. Domestic unit revenue was down 1.9%, while international unit revenue was up 18.3% year-over-year. Our unit cost for the quarter, excluding net special items and fuel, was up 3.7% year-over-year. That's better than the midpoint of our initial guidance range due to slightly higher than planned capacity production driven by our strong operational performance. I want to spend a few minutes updating you on our fleet. Our young and simplified fleet differentiates American from our U.S. network peers and provides network flexibility, enhanced efficiency and an improved customer experience. These benefits are the result of the refleeting we pursued from 2014 to 2019 and accelerated during the pandemic. We are pleased we built our fleet in a low interest rate environment and at a time when the supply chain wasn't as challenged as it is today. In 2023, we expect to take delivery of 23 new mainline aircraft which are all now financed. We took 13 deliveries in the first half of the year and expect 10 more aircraft to be delivered by year-end. For our regional fleet, this quarter, we entered into agreements to purchase 7 new Embraer 175 aircraft and 7 used Bombardier CRJ 900 aircraft that will be delivered starting in the fourth quarter of this year. We're excited to have these aircraft into service and to further bolster our regional connectivity. Based on the latest delivery guidance from Boeing and Airbus, along with our new and used regional aircraft purchase commitments, our 2023 aircraft CapEx is now expected to be approximately $1.7 billion. Our non-aircraft CapEx is still expected to be approximately $800 million. We anticipate our 2024 total CapEx to be between $3 billion and $3.5 billion. Looking beyond 2024, we continually review our medium- and long-term fleet plans. Due to the young age of our aircraft, our fleet replacement needs are very limited. Therefore, we expect aircraft CapEx for the next several years and likely through the end of the decade to average approximately $3.5 billion per year. Moving to the balance sheet. Yesterday, Fitch upgraded Americans credit rating. This is the first step towards our goal of BB credit metrics by the end of 2025, and it's nice to see our progress being recognized. We continue to maintain strong liquidity. In the second quarter, we generated operating cash flow of nearly $1.8 billion. Our adjusted net investing cash flow was approximately $550 million, resulting in quarterly free cash flow of $1.2 billion. We have produced $4.3 billion of free cash flow in the first 6 months of the year and expect full year free cash flow to be approximately $3 billion. We ended the second quarter with approximately $14.9 billion of total available liquidity. We continue to make progress on strengthening our balance sheet in the second quarter by reducing total debt by $387 million. This debt reduction, combined with the improvement in liquidity, resulted in a decrease in net debt of approximately $955 million during the second quarter. We have now reduced total debt by approximately $9.4 billion from peak debt levels in 2021, which is significant progress towards our goal of reducing total debt by $15 billion by the end of 2025. By the end of 2023, we expect our total debt to be approximately $11 billion lower than peak debt levels in 2021. Importantly, we ended the second quarter with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.8x, which is lower than it was at the end of 2019. Now turning to our guidance. Bookings remain strong, and we continue to see a constructive demand environment. We saw record revenue for the fourth of July holiday period and booked load factors for the third quarter are in line with what we saw in 2022. International entities continue to lead the way in terms of year-over-year performance, and we are encouraged by domestic business demand, notably from small- and medium-sized enterprises. As the recovery continues to unfold, the strong unit revenue environment in 2022 represents an increasingly difficult comparison. As a result, we expect third quarter TRASM to be down 4.5% to 6.5% year-over-year on 5% to 7% more capacity. We expect third quarter CASMx to be up 2% to 4% year-over-year. Our current forecast for the third quarter assumes a fuel price between $2.55 and $2.65 per gallon. Based on our current demand and fuel price forecast, we expect to produce an adjusted operating margin between 8% and 10% in the third quarter and adjusted earnings per diluted share between $0.85 and $0.95, excluding special items. For the full year, we continue to expect to produce capacity that is 5% to 8% higher than 2022. Our full year forecast for unit revenue continues to be up low single digits year-over-year. We now expect our full year CASMx to be up 2% to 4% versus 2022. Notably, our expectations for capacity TRASM and CASMx are all consistent with the initial guidance we provided on our January earnings call. That said, our estimate for full year fuel expense has changed. We now expect to pay between $2.70 and $2.80 per gallon, a reduction from our initial guidance. The full year update further highlights the positive environment we are operating in. Based on our demand and fuel cost assumptions, we expect to produce a full year adjusted operating margin of between 8% and 10% and adjusted EPS of between $3 and $3.75. We are very proud of the progress the American Airlines team has made, but we believe there is more opportunity ahead of us. We will continue to focus on delivering in 2023 and unlocking even more value in 2024 and beyond. I'll now turn it back to Robert for closing remarks.Robert D. IsomThanks, Devon. The American Airlines team is delivering on our commitments. We're on track to deliver on the full year guidance we provided back in January, driving earnings growth, record free cash flow, meaningful debt reduction and importantly, a strong and reliable operation. We are executing on that plan. We are reliable, profitable and making tremendous progress strengthening our balance sheet and I know that our team will continue to deliver. We're excited to share more about our long-term strategy at an Investor Day later this year on our Fort Worth campus. We look forward to updating you on the business and sharing more about our longer-term strategic priorities at that time. We're incredibly excited about the future of American and can't wait to tell you more. Operator, please open the line for analyst questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Jamie Baker of JPMorgan.Jamie Nathaniel BakerSo, Vasu, you spoke enthusiastically last year about the EMEA. You admitted New York had been a challenge for decades. But you were finally seeing New York RASM outpaced the system. And now it appears that, that all reverses. I'll admit my earnings model doesn't model you by hub. But if it did, why shouldn't I assume New York reverts to being a meaningful margin drag from this point forward?Vasu RajaJamie, thanks for the question. First, I would say that we don't anticipate it being a margin drag. And for full clarity, though it's unfortunate the NEA is terminated. Our commitment to the customers in the Northeast and New York specific hasn't changed. However, the circumstances that gave rise to the NEA have changed. At one point in time, we struggled with really 2 major things. One, our slot holding didn't match with the demand one that is the majority of demand in New York was for short-haul day trip business market. Our slot portfolio is better matched Mid-Continental, Transcontinental and Transatlantic market. Well, that's changed. Short-haul business demand hasn't recovered to its historical level, but those other markets are much greater. And so that's a material change from before. But also our expense base, especially in New York Kennedy has changed. Through co-locating partners and any number of fleet changes, our employment expenses in JFK are materially advantaged to what any other carrier is in New York. So what that means for us is though it's unfortunate that customers don't get the experience of having a much broader network than what was there before, it was a practical matter for American Airlines. We very much expect preserve the continued margin trajectory that we've been on. And as we go forward, we'll certainly share more, but it's very much our plan and our intention that we continue to go see more New York City originating customers flying with us. And so far, since the NEA has been announced, we've seen that. NEA enrollments in the Advantage program continue to rise. Credit card acquisitions continue to rise, spending continues to rise. So though -- this chapter is closed, another one might open, but we don't expect any material change to our financial outlook.Jamie Nathaniel BakerOkay. Very helpful. And then, Devon, on the cost side, recognizing there are lots of moving pieces in the full year CASM guide. Can you tell us the last time you adjusted the labor accruals that you're assuming? And also does your full year cash flow guide include retro pay for the pilots.Devon E. MayYes. So on the cash flow, it does include the retro pay that was part of our -- that is part of our tentative agreement that we have with the pilots today. As we talked about last quarter, what we have for an accrual is, we are accruing wages that were agreed to in May as part of the agreement in principle starting on May 1, and we expect the agreement -- or hope the agreement will ratify here in August, at which time, we'll go to the new rates and the benefits associated with that kind of agreement.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein.David Scott VernonSo Robert and Devon, first question for you on the guidance framework you kind of laying out for us here for the back half of the year. It does sort of imply a pretty material deceleration from your earnings level in 2Q to 3Q. And we're hearing from you guys that the demand is good. The team is executing, you're delivering on your cost performance. Can you talk a little bit about the thinking behind how you're laying out the guidance here. You just had a huge beat to your 2Q guide. You haven't missed in a couple of quarters. I'm trying to understand like are you guys just kind of keeping the bar here where you said it in the beginning of the year, or is there something that's really kind of decelerating here in the back half?Robert D. IsomDavid, thanks for the question. Look, we've set out clearly focused on producing profitability and our reliability is -- our operating reliability has actually really facilitated that. As we take a look at it over the course of the year, you'll see that we actually raised the midpoint of our full year guide by a quarter. It's indicative of our belief that the economy is strong, demand is strong. And for us, look, there's seasonality certainly involved. But at the same time, we're looking at this over the course of the year, and we're going to stay the course, and we feel really positive about the results that we reported and what's coming. And Devon, do you want to add anything to that?Devon E. MayNo, I think same points. We started the year and set our objectives for the capacity we're going to produce, the unit costs we're going to produce it at and our earnings levels. We're really happy with what we've accomplished in the first half of the year. The guide we have in place did increase our full year EPS to $3 to $3.75, and we feel really good about upping that number.David Scott VernonOkay. And then maybe if you could talk a little bit about sort of the domestic outlook here in the 3Q. You've got, I think, 34% capacity growth in domestic and short-haul international. How are fare trends kind of moving sequentially. There's a lot of concern, I think, in the market about deceleration in the domestic travel market. Can you kind of elaborate a little bit more on kind of what you're seeing and what you're embedding into the 3Q guide for domestic?Vasu RajaSure thing. This is Vasu. First, look, I'll say at large. We continue to remain encouraged by the overall level of demand we see, especially in domestic and short haul. If you look at air travel spend as a percentage of GDP, certainly (inaudible) retained its relationship revenue, even domestic revenue as a percentage of GDP continue to regain their former relationship to demand. But for us, it's really important to note is this recovery is continuing to unfold. And as we look out there in domestic, a lot of the sequential change that you see is really due to some pretty unique things. About a point on the 2Q to 3Q changes just due to calendar shift. And another point is due to our operational outperformance in the second quarter. Everything else is really a return to normal seasonality. As far as a deceleration of demand or things like that, we don't yet see it now. And in fact, when you look at it for us, like versus 2019 or some base where you lose, just the strange comparisons to how recoveries have unfolded. For us, as we get into the fall, and we will be flying an airline (inaudible) bigger than 2019 airline but producing short-haul RASMs that are 15% to 20% higher. So there's still -- we're still in a world where demand is very strong. The year-over-year comps are a little bit strange, owing more to just the vagaries of the recovery than anything underlying the business.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research.Scott H. GroupSorry, I lost my voice. But hopefully, you can hear me. I just want to go back to the third quarter guide. So we've just never seen margins go from 15% to 8% to 10%, down 5 to 7 points from Q2 to Q3, just any more color to help us think about what's driving that?Robert D. IsomScott, again, I'll tack on to both Vasu's comments and Devon's as well. We're looking at our results over the course of the year. The recovery, as we've seen it has been not exactly smooth on a quarter-to-quarter comparison basis. As we take a look at the year, you can depend on us to produce those results. We're really proud of those. And it's indicated by us, again, moving our EPS guide up as we did this morning.Scott H. GroupOkay. And then just to clarify, is there -- are we assuming any earnings impact from losing the NEA, which is I know it sounds like you don't think we go back to where we were. But is there any earnings impact going forward from losing NEA?Robert D. IsomScott, we're not anticipating any earnings impact.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Conor Cunningham of Melius Research.Conor T. CunninghamNot a lot of talk on blended travelers or blended itineraries this quarter. Just curious on -- is that just because it's in your base now? And maybe you could just level set us on how you're thinking about large corporate in the back half of '23.Vasu RajaThis is Vasu and thanks for the question. And you're exactly right. It's less of a novelty now. This is just part of our base, how the business runs for several quarters now. We've seen a mix of 35% leisure style travel, 35% blended style travel, 30% (technical difficulty) And furthermore, within the 30% business, there's roughly a 2:1 split between unmanaged travel and managed travel that's there. That's been pretty consistent for several quarters now. It looks to be pretty consistent going into the future. Certainly, that's what our forward book says. So that's why no commentary. This is actually how the business operates now.Conor T. CunninghamAnd just what you're thinking about corporate, sorry?Vasu RajaLook, we've seen corporate -- first of all, I'll clarify this. When we talk about business, we talk about people on business style trips. And within that, there's 2 groups, there's individuals and companies that fly, they don't manage or buy their travel centrally. And then there's large corporations that tend to manage by their travel centrally. We've seen that those customers who were managed, they buy their travel centrally has -- it's recovered to 80% of historical levels. That's been pretty much plateaued for several quarters now. However, unmanaged demand continues to grow in our system. And indeed, total business revenues have really regained their 2019 composition in the system. So we remain encouraged on business demand. Should things change, we're prepared to go and adjust accordingly. But no forward change to outlook is any different than the stuff we've been experiencing.Conor T. CunninghamOkay. And then just on the competitive environment in the domestic market, the ULCCs and LCCs have been ramping capacity in the back half and a lot of that's hit in your hubs. I'm just curious on how you view the competitive landscape right now as you think about the back half of '23.Vasu RajaAnd look, we actually view the competitive landscape very favorably. Our network proposition to our customers is creating more origin and destination markets and more unique origin and destination markets than any other airline network. And we have done that really well. We continue to do that really well. That's really been the (technical difficulty) financial progress that we've seen. And to Robert's comments with roughly 70% of the airline network is located in the Sun Belt in our Latin America network and London Heathrow in places where we really deliver a lot of outsized value for customers. And there, while we do see competitors come in, we remain encouraged. Take any number of those markets in our short-haul Latin American markets. We've seen something like 20%, 25% industry capacity growth, but the trends are favorable enough where this fall and winter will fly our largest schedule there, not because we're out to chase market share, but because of the marginal performance of those routes.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Helane Becker of TD Cowen.Helane Renee BeckerRobert, I thought I heard you say on CNBC this morning that you're meeting with your pilots to talk about matching the United contract. Did I hear that correctly, A? And B, do you have to let them vote and reject the contract that they're voting on now? Or can you adjust it and they vote on any changes you might want to make?Robert D. IsomHelane, thanks for the question. Look, in terms of how we actually are able to deliver to our products, that's going to be something that we have to work on with them, and we're in discussions with the APA right now, as a matter of fact. What I said this morning is something I'm really proud of and that we're committed to. Look, we're going to match the wages that United is proposing. We've got to sit down and (technical difficulty) to figure out whether or not that is something that they can fit into their TA that can still be voted on, on a timely basis or if it's something that's going to take more time to figure out. But we're committed to matching those wages.Helane Renee BeckerAnd then just shifting gears for a minute. You guys have been delivering a really great operation for the past, I don't know, at least 3 quarters, right, as somebody who's shifted from New York to Philadelphia. I can see it in my flying. And I'm just kind of wondering, are you seeing that also in your Net Promoter Scores? Can you talk about what customers are seeing? And are you seeing any share shift from any of your competitors to yourselves?Robert D. IsomWell, Helane, thanks for bringing it up. We're really proud of the work that we've done over the last year. It's just a tremendous and relentless focus. It's led by David Seymour, our Chief Operating Officer. And every day, our team is out there, including today, in this ridiculous heat and weather, they're just performing. We've done everything from training to adding new (technical difficulty) And when things go awry, we have been really quick to make sure that we have the tools necessary to put things back in place, whether that be aircraft or our crews. And that's going to continue. I anticipate that we're going to get better and better. Of course, that translates into likelihood to recommend scores, in Net Promoter Scores that are the best that we have ever seen. And I have great confidence that is something that we will continue to play out. That relationship between reliability and what customers really want is super evident.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays.Brandon Robert OglenskiVasu, I want to come back to the unwind of the NEA because it does look like you have quite a bit of international capacity you've added at JFK. But not a lot of domestic connectivity on your own network. And I think JetBlue was part of that answer historically. So can you talk to what the long-haul strategy looks like out of JFK going forward?Vasu RajaYes. Thanks for the question, Brandon. Look, there were really 2 issues that we had in New York. One was the amount of connectivity support that we had for our long haul and the other was just the huge expenses we had operating out of New York Kennedy. As I mentioned earlier, we've done a lot of things to go and reduce our expense base to where, it's not just more in line with our other low-cost hubs but it's materially lower than what any other operator has in New York City. But also -- and this is meaningful to it. Look, the NEA was a great outcome for customers who got to go and experience our product who weren't there before. But actually, when you look at those international flights, roughly, as things have settled out and markets recover, roughly 35 to 40 points of the load factor that's on them is actually being generated by international partners. Our partnership within the NEA was actually a very small amount of the onboard load factor that's there. That's why when we couple both the expense reduction that's there and some changes that we can make ourselves, we believe that we can go and really replace a lot of the demand, especially now that we've got such a larger New York City originating customer base than what we had before.Brandon Robert OglenskiI appreciate that response. And I guess maybe a quick one for Devon because I think you mentioned aircraft purchases out in the future could be around $3 billion to $3.5 billion annually, if I heard it correctly. Do you think strategically, that's the right level of reinvestment in the business, especially given that some of your competitors might be spending a bit more than that?Devon E. MayBrandon, yes. So the comment was we think we'll have somewhere around $3.5 billion on average of aircraft capital beyond 2024 and probably for a good part of the decade. And where we are different than our competitors is we don't have any fleet replacement needs between now and the end of the decade, so when we are investing in an aircraft, that is an investment to grow the network and to grow the airline. What you're seeing from some of our other competitors who just have older airplanes, there's a lot of fleet replacement CapEx required for them. And again, for us, it is just growth aircraft requirements.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore ISI.Duane Thomas PfennigwerthI'm really tempted to ask another NEA wind-down question, but we'll leave that for off-line. Maybe just on fleet. Where do you think your biggest gap or constraint is at the moment? Like where do you wish you could be bigger today? And can you talk a little bit about -- I think you mentioned some regional fleet adds. What are the kind of staffing circumstances you see that are allowing you to invest there?Robert D. IsomThanks, Duane. Just a couple of things. Look, I think as you take a look at the industry and especially our needs at American, we're going to need larger narrow-bodies in a number of places. It just fits with how our hub structure works and all the kind of things that Vasu wants to do. I would add to that, though, that probably our biggest and most interesting opportunity right away is getting our regional fleet fully back up in the air. And those aircraft only further our commercial proposition by adding more small markets to what is a great hub-and-spoke system already. So as we take a look out into the future, you'll see us make sure that we protect ourselves and that we are able to not only replace an upgauge from a narrow body perspective but also have an eye to be able to grow at a rate appropriate for demand levels.Duane Thomas PfennigwerthAnd then just for my follow-up, could you just remind us maybe some of the differences in your Transatlantic geography versus peers? And maybe it's too fine of a point, but could you contrast kind of your Southern Europe exposure relative to Delta and United?Vasu RajaThanks for asking them. Look, and for us, so much of our Transatlantic and I'll just speak to the European content at this point, not other things that sometimes get lumped into reporting such as Middle East or India. But for us, a lot of our concentration is, first and foremost, in London, probably much more so than what other airlines are. And that which is in Southern Europe is really heavily seasonal style flying or as we call it, the large city or the large capital market, things like Rome and Athens, Barcelona and Madrid. So we've done a lot over the last several years to actually -- further to Devon's earlier point, to really restructure our international network. We used to fly a lot of really marginal flights to really marginal markets. They work for 3 months of the year and we had nothing to do with the airplane for the other 9 months of the year. So we've used the last 3 years to go and rebuild the foundation, the bottom 5% of our capacity is gone, the fleet that goes with it is gone and the losses that we took from it are gone. And so now what we're building back to Devon's point of just moderate growth is adding things that really make sense and are a good use of full year aircraft capital.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Andrew Didora of Bank of America.Andrew George DidoraFirst question, Devon, I just wanted to make sure I was clear in terms of what is in your CASM outlook for this year. Does it just include the step-up in pay rates beginning May 1 from the TA? Or do you also factor in a step-up in profit share and work rules? Just want to be clear on what's included there.Devon E. MayYes. So right now, what's included in our guide is pay rates from May 1 through the end of July. And then starting in August, we hope to have ratification of the tentative agreement. And at that point, we'll have pay rates and all the benefits that go along with it, including the higher profit sharing.Andrew George DidoraGot it. And then Robert, I know it's early on, but just when you think about 2024, any initial thoughts on how you're thinking about capacity and the way you kind of -- the continued build-out of both your domestic and international networks. Just curious which entity you think could -- between domestic and international could be growing the most next year and just how you think about growth.Robert D. IsomThanks, Andrew. Right now, it's -- we're in the planning stages. But what I'd tell you is that based on the kind of fleet that we have, we would have anticipated mid-single-digit growth for next year. Now there's a lot of dependencies on that. So first off, we have to be able to get our regional fleet back up fully that requires pilots. We've -- to be able to achieve that kind of level of flying we would have to also get a little bit more out of the aircraft we have in terms of utilization as a whole. And the final thing is we're dependent on the airframe manufacturers to actually deliver. They're getting better, their track record hasn't been great. So we'll see how that shakes out. And if it all comes to fruition, that's probably a pretty good guess at this point.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank.Michael John LinenbergCongrats on the 2-notch upgrade from Fitch. I guess 2 questions here. I guess Vasu, just with the rollout of your new distribution strategy, any early learnings direct versus indirect. I sort of caught the 2:1 unmanaged versus managed on your corporate piece. I think if we go back historically, they were probably more evenly divided. So it seems like there's a bit of a shift there. Whatever you can tell us and then I have a follow-up.Vasu RajaThanks, Mike. It's an excellent question. I was wondering when it might be asked. Look, first of all, all of our selling and distribution changes are done with a really simple lens, relative to which Robert talked about in his opening remarks. We want to make it as easy as possible for our best customers to be able to shop by and self-service their experience with American Airlines. And everything has been oriented around that. It has indeed been very eye-opening and has performed probably above what our expectations are. The simplest way to get (inaudible) is like this. If you take all of our customers, the actual human, you can divide them into 2 groups, those who are not members of the Advantage program and those who are members of the Advantage program. In the quarter, for those customers who are not members of the Advantage program, indeed, their total travel fell 5%, but revenue from that cohort grew by 5%. And amongst the customers who are advantaged customers, we actually grew their transactions by 8% and their revenues by 13%. That is certainly above what we had expected, but also what we're really encouraged by our 3 things: first, for every -- there's a high level of attachment for all of our advantage customers. For every dollar of flight revenue they bring in, they bring in about $0.10 of other revenue primarily on a branded credit card. Two, the cost of sale is materially lower amongst our advantage customers. It's not just that we're paying less in booking fees and commissions and things like that. But what we've found is something like 25% to 30% of our calls to reservations are actually bookings at a travel agency originated and is, for some reason, unable to go in service. So there's a lot of implicit savings that we see from it. And last and maybe most importantly, we're encouraged by what we see is really the durability of these customers' demand. These are customers who tend to use our network where it's most unique. They fly more times in a year. They already have bookings out into the fall. They tend to sell themselves up. And importantly, they prefer coming to us direct. So we're currently in taking roughly 70% to 75% of our revenues going through our direct channels. We anticipate that will grow. We're encouraged by this, and we're actually going to continue to accelerate the changes. By the end of the year, 100% of what we sell, customers will be able to service online through our app or our dot-com. We'll roll out those features also over time for new distribution technology. But as this happens, we'll make increasingly less and less of our fare content available through traditional technology where customers aren't able to get that quality experience they're looking for from us.Michael John LinenbergGreat, awesome response. And then just my second question, I guess, is to you as well, when I sort of look at it in the forward schedules, it does look like even up to summer of next year, that JetBlue is still maintaining a significant presence in LaGuardia. And so presumably, you will still continue to lease those slots to them and maybe maintain a smaller presence in LaGuardia than what you had pre-NEA? Or is that just -- are those placeholder schedules and that's TBD?Vasu RajaYes, Mike. A lot of that is TBD right now. And in fact, Priya Aiyar, is here our General Counsel. We're still in a process of determining how to wind down the NEA, most notably how we transfer back all of the slots to American Airlines as soon as we can.OperatorThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now move to media questions and answers. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Alison Sider of Wall Street Journal.Alison SiderDo you have a sense yet of how much more costly the pilot deal could be if you have to go back and boost the pay rates and other adjustments to match the United deal?Robert D. IsomI'm looking at Devon. We're working on that right now. Look, one of the things I do know is that in our TA, there was significant quality of life and compensation improvements. The vast majority are very close to what United has supposedly in their TA. And while there may be some adjustments that would be required for wages, it's not inordinate amount. Devon, do you have any idea on that?Devon E. MayYes. We're working through the numbers right now. Obviously, the wages are close, but a couple of percent higher than what we have in our tentative agreement. And we're trying to get more detail on other items that we think might be material. But what we have with our tentative agreement is really significant improvements for our pilots. And as Robert mentioned earlier, the wages is some we're focused on right now to see if we can work with the APA to get some done where we match what United's put forth.Alison SiderAnd I guess, Robert, you talked a little bit about this earlier this morning, but just curious if there's any kind of impact you're seeing from this crazy heat we're seeing in parts of the country, if that requires any operational changes or different ways of thinking about things for crew and for customers and how you're dealing with that?Robert D. IsomAli, and I have David Seymour here to help me. Look, the heat that we're facing this year in the country, I mean, these are records, and it is something that impacts certainly, the aircraft, any machinery, they're more (inaudible) and run harder and longer. And it's also really hard on our people. Fortunately, we have great experience in dealing with hot weather hubs, places like Phoenix and Miami and even DFW and Charlotte as well. So we're employing all those practices that we put in place. We're just having to use them more often and longer throughout the year. I'll give you just a couple of examples of things that we've done on a precautionary basis just because of the trends that we've seen. We put a heck of lot more work into making sure that we're prepared for the summer on things like conditioned air at our jet bridges. So as soon as an aircraft pulls up to a gate, we want to make sure that we can get air to those aircraft to keep them as cool as possible. Our APUs, those little engines that are able to power all the systems when the big engines are off. Those are things that are prone to break during times like right now, but we're seeing really good results because of the preventative work that our maintenance team has done. And you'll see us as well, whether it's making sure that we only board when aircraft are -- have air conditioning that is appropriate or out on the ramp with our team members, making sure that they get a break from the sun and the heat that there are things like ice carts and electrolyte drinks available to our team members, we're really taking this seriously, and we're going to have to as we go forward.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Mary Schlangenstein of Bloomberg News.Mary SchlangensteinI had just 2 quick questions. Vasu, on the LaGuardia slots, are you prohibited from leasing those slots to JetBlue for just their own use for their own flight? So do you have to take those slots back? You can't lease them to them under any circumstances. And my second question is on the pilot talks, are you reopening the whole contract to discussion? Or are you limiting it to changes in pay?Robert D. IsomSo I'll handle the -- I can handle both. First off, in regard to anything that relates to slots or gates or routes or things like that. Look, we're going to figure that out over time. So I'll leave it at that. And then in regard to our pilots, as I mentioned, we're sitting down with our pilots. We have a real interest in making sure that they're taken care of. That's been how we viewed all discussions. And so we'll see how that goes. My hope is that we can get something done pretty quickly. And no matter what, over the long run, we're going to make sure that our pilots were taken care of.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Leslie Josephs of CNBC.Leslie JosephsJust on the pilot contract. I just want to make sure that I understand correctly, you are committing to matching the United rates. I just want to make sure we're clear on that. And then just a second question on buy-ups to premium cabins. We didn't hear a ton of that from you guys. And just kind of curious what you're seeing, especially for premium leisure and international, are you seeing higher paid loads in premium economy and then in business class.Robert D. IsomI'll handle the first one, Leslie, and Vasu can handle the second one. Just, look, again, in regard to your question, we're working with the APA and our pilots. Our intent is to match the wages that we're aware of in the tentative agreement that United has signed.Vasu RajaYes. And Leslie, we do -- we've noted it all through the recovery, but we've continued to see strength in premium cabin style fares. Our total premium seats across the system are up about 5% year-over-year. Our total premium revenues were up about 15% year-over-year. And notably, it's pretty consistent across all of our markets in London, for example. We've grown our premium seats about 20% or so. Our premium revenues are up over 25%. And that's at a time when so much of the industry is adding back into London. But we are encouraged, and we're uniquely encouraged by the trajectory that we're on different from others. For the first time in our history, our unit revenue performance in Transatlantic will outperform any of our joint venture partners, both for the quarter and for the full year. So we do see that strength. It's complemented by our distribution strategies, and we see more opportunity ahead.Leslie JosephsAnd just one quick follow-up. When you get out of the summer season, are you seeing any kind of falloff in either fares or bookings with the TRASM coming down and then the inflation report showing that airfares are coming down in the U.S.Vasu RajaNothing beyond historical seasonality, Leslie.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of David Koenig of the Associated Press.David KoenigRobert, you've talked about matching the United deal, which APA had valued their previous TA at $8.3 billion, and this is going to add a couple of percentage points. Do you plan or do you need to raise fares to cover the contracts with the APA, the APFA or other contracts and still remain profitable, should people expect higher fares?Robert D. IsomDavid, thanks for the question. Look, over time, we're going to run a profitable business. So we have to offer a really compelling product offering to our customers. We're going to try to find ways to make sure that we can do that in a way that customers will benefit and ultimately, it will take more revenue to pay for higher cost (technical difficulty) going to do everything that we can to be as efficient as possible, take care of our team members, but also offer a very compelling and worthwhile product to our customers.David KoenigOkay. Any other revenues for revenue besides fares?Vasu RajaNone beyond what we've already spoken about in the call.Robert D. IsomDavid, we're really proud of our incredible network that we're flying reliably, and we've got an industry-leading rewards program. We're going to tap into those and make sure that our customers are really able to benefit from everything that we can do on that front.OperatorThank you. That concludes the Q&amp;A portion of this call. I would now like to turn the conference back to Robert Isom for closing remarks. Sir?Robert D. IsomThank you, [Atif.] Thanks so much. And I'll just close out this way. Look, you can continue to hold us accountable for relentless focus on reliability, profitability and strengthening our balance sheet. And I'll just point to the second quarter results. In terms of reliability, no one has been better than American Airlines over the last year. In terms of profitability, this second quarter beat by -- of all analyst's expectations is just proof that our commercial offerings are really registering with our customers. You run reliably, you produce profits, you can strengthen your balance sheet. This 2-notch upgrade from Fitch today is, again, indicative that we're doing the right things, and we would anticipate further strengthening on that front. All of it together, this outstanding second quarter for us is proof positive that our efforts are working. We're going to get back at it. Thank you very much.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.]"

Raymond James Managing Director Savi Syth reviews the outlook for airline stocks as they face travel demand tailwinds and headwinds in the form of pricing pressures and operational issues.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: We're watching shares of airlines, American and United, on the heels of earnings. Both airlines beating the expectations from the street and also raising their guidance. But the stock's today moving in opposite directions. American Airlines under pressure, off just about 6.5%, as Wall Street had even higher expectations going into the quarter.Joining us now for more, Savi Syth, Raymond James Managing Director. Savi, it's great to speak with you. So that modest outlook from American, that's one of the big reasons why we're seeing that stock under pressure today. Was American Airlines, was that report almost a reality check here for the industry on the heels of the extremely strong results that we got from United and Delta last week?SAVI SYTH: Yeah. I think for American, the issue is, I mean, it was a really good outlook and guide. The revenue-- the top line outlook for the 3Q '23 was a little softer than what we were expecting and what the Street was expecting. And so I think that is just adding to fears of pent-up demand going away or a recession around the corner. And so it's not giving people confidence in the domestic market. And they're talking up the good guys at United and Delta to the strength in international. So I think that's what's weighing on American and the shares in part today.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And it's an interesting story, too. If you look over long-term share price action, because despite the demand that we've seen, the positive data, if you take a look at a five-year of United, Delta, and American, they're all significantly down. American is actually down more than 50%. So what do you think it will take to get investors back on board to the levels that they once were at?Story continuesSAVI SYTH: Yeah. I think partly, you know, with United and American, the one thing we have to keep in mind is there was some share dilution there. But beyond that, I think, what is important is confidence of the sustainability of the current earnings projections. And again, if there's a fear that you're heading into a recession, I think people aren't just willing to give the same multiples as they did before.And so I think we just need to show that, you know, there isn't this kind of demand or a cliff that's going to happen with especially the domestic consumer. And I think as you gain more confidence in that, I think you'll start to see the shares improving as well, because from a profitability of 2023 guide, I think they're already showing good resumption of profitability.SEANA SMITH: Savi, how much pricing power do airlines still have? Because, yes, we have seen airfares cool a bit on a year-over-year basis. But still, air travel, air tickets are much higher than they were pre-pandemic.SAVI SYTH: Look, I think, one, I think a lot of things are more expensive versus pre-pandemic. And so I think that's what you're seeing on the airline fare side, too. Even the jet fuel, it's not as high as it was last year. Last we went double, 2019. Now, you're about 20% above 2019. But you're still at prices that are above 2019.So I think part of this is just the inflation that you've seen globally. And the other part of it is you did have a lot of fleets that were retired. You had Boeing and Airbus that are having difficulty delivering new aircraft. And so there is a real supply shortfall relative to demand that has come back very strong and, you know, back to kind of trend line level. So for that reason, I think there is pricing power here. And then you have a lot of costs that are going up that will, I think, keep those fares relatively high, which is what you're seeing today.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And speaking of some of those costs, on the earnings call this morning, American did say it was committed to matching United when it comes to those pilot wages. How do you see those negotiations going? And what could that mean from a margin perspective?SAVI SYTH: Yeah. The American pilots are already getting about a 21 pay increase with this new contract. It's really making up for the fact that, you know, during-- you're supposed to have a contracts, you know, early 2020 and the pandemic got in the way. So you're making up for a few years of not getting pay increases.If they do match United, it's another 1% to 2%. So relative to what you are matching today, I don't think it's a significantly higher increase. So I think their 2023 guide isn't going to be significantly impacted by anything that they're matching with the United contract.SEANA SMITH: Savi, one of the themes that we've heard from a number of airlines this quarter and also we started to hear about it last quarter was the pent-up demand for international travel. And international really being a standout, especially in this quarter's results. Do you see that accelerating into 2024?SAVI SYTH: I think what you're seeing this year, you know, if you remember internationally the testing requirements really only came off in the June time frame. And so what you're seeing this year is last year, a lot of people were still taking domestic or near International trips, because that's where they could go easily and conveniently. And so this year, you're finally starting to see both on the leisure and business side more of those trips being taken internationally.So-- so it is a little bit pent-up, in that you're catching up for some of that. But it's also kind of diverse, you know. You're getting some of the trips that was in the domestic market shifting to international. And I think you'll see-- you know, so we start to really kind of lap that maybe late this year, because, even though kind of the things were lifted, I think you really only started to see international comeback in a big way and kind of that late-- late 2022 time frame. So I think we still have another quarter or a couple of quarters of good international momentum.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And on that international side, we're seeing extreme heat in Europe right now. Summer is usually a time where everyone wants to flock to Europe. So do you think those temperatures and what's happening overseas, could that potentially impact any earnings heading into next season?SAVI SYTH: Yeah. I mean, it's definitely-- there are a lot of things going against operating a good airline. You know, the heat being one of them. There is air traffic control issues everywhere. And in Europe, you do have a lot of industrial action as well. And so I think airlines are taking that in stride and making the adjustments, because they do want to run a good operation, because that's the worst thing that can happen from a demand perspective is if passengers don't appreciate or don't have a good experience, they're not going to continue flying.So you are seeing them, you know, tactically and strategically responding to some of these challenges. And it's not something that-- some of this will get better. ATC staffing should improve as time goes on. But some of it like weather, it's something that's here to stay. And that they'll have to continue to adapt.ALEXANDRA CANAL: I'm trying to plan a trip to Europe in the fall. So hopefully, things are good then. But Savi Syth from Raymond James, thanks so much for joining us today.]"

It has also announced additional price increases in most of its businesses worldwide.However, in the first quarter of 2023, apparel inventory reductions were widespread across all segments, which led to a decline in volumes.

The advantages for REITs to have tenants pay their expenses are obvious, but there are also advantages for tenants, such as the freedom to alter and customize their space without having to purchase a property outright. In some cases, the tenant can also negotiate lower rent, and the property expenses may be tax deductible.The one disadvantage for the REIT is that some of the leases contain earning caps, which prevent the REIT from increasing rents beyond a certain point. But even with that, the lowered risks and reliable income gained make it very worthwhile for the landlord.Take a look at three triple-net REITs that defy the headwinds to continue to provide safe and reliable dividend income quarter after quarter.Realty Income Corp. (NYSE:O) is a San Diego-based, triple-net lease retail REIT with over 12,400 properties around the world. The ""Monthly Dividend Company,"" as it's widely known, is a member of the S&amp;P 500 and an S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrat, with 637 consecutive monthly dividends paid and 121 dividend increases since 1994.Realty Income is one of the most widely held REITs among investors today because of its stability and growth.  Since its initial public offering (IPO) in 1994, Realty Income has had a 14.6% compound annual total return. Its beta versus the S&amp;P 500 is only 0.5, so bear markets are less apt to destroy share prices like some other REITs, such as hotels or offices.Realty Income's median adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) per share growth since 1996 is 5%. And since the IPO, its monthly paying dividend has a compound annual dividend growth rate of 4.4%.Story continuesAs for tenant stability, Realty Income's historical median for its portfolio occupancy is 98.3%. Its largest tenants include Walgreens, Dollar Tree, 7-Eleven, FedEx, CVS, Walmart and LA Fitness. As of the end of the first quarter, its occupancy rate was 99%.On June 13, Realty Income announced an increase in its monthly dividend from $0.255 to $0.2555 per share. On July 11, Realty Income again announced a dividend of $0.2555 per share, payable Aug. 15 to shareholders of record on Aug. 1. The ex-dividend date is July 31.On July 13, UBS Investment Bank analyst Brent Dilts maintained a Buy rating on Realty Income and raised the price target from $70 to $74. This is noteworthy because over the past five years, $72.78 was the highest price reached by Realty Income.Get the real estate market insights you need, without the fluff you don’t.

Its well-known, diversified tenant portfolio includes CVS, The GAP, TJX, Albertsons, Ross Dress for Less and The Home Depot.In the first quarter, Federal Realty Investment Trust declared FFO of $1.59, a 6% increase over FFO of $1.49 in the first quarter of 2022.Federal Realty Investment Trust holds the REIT record for annual dividend increases of 55 years and counting. Last September, it increased its quarterly dividend from $1.07 to $1.08, and the $4.32 annual dividend yields 4.3%. The dividend is well covered by annual FFO of $6.28, with a moderate payout ratio of 68.7%On July 13, UBS analyst Michael Goldsmith maintained a Neutral rating on Federal Realty Investment and raised the price target from $100 to $109.NNN REIT Inc. (NYSE:NNN) is an Orlando, Florida-based triple net-lease REIT that owns a diversified group of stand-alone retail outlets across the U.S. NNN REIT also has a stable tenant base, with names like 7-Eleven, Sunoco, Best Buy, Camping World, BJ's Wholesale Club and Chuck E. Cheese.Some recent events have been quite positive for NNN REIT.As of May 1, National Retail Properties officially changed its name to NNN REIT. The New York Stock Exchange stock symbol remains NNN. CEOSteve Horn noted, ""The name change does not signal any change in our investment strategy or balance sheet management. This simplified name is easier to remember and is distinctive in our space.""On May 2, NNN REIT announced the first-quarter operating results.  FFO of $0.80 per share was a penny above estimates and up from $0.77 in the first quarter of 2022. Revenue of $204.1 million was $4 million above estimates and $13.8 million above first-quarter 2022 revenue. In addition, NNN REIT reaffirmed full-year guidance for FFO per share between $3.14 and $3.20. Analysts have been estimating $3.19 per share.On June 28, Janney Montgomery Scott analyst Robert Stevenson upgraded NNN REIT from Neutral to Buy.On July 14, NNN REIT increased its quarterly dividend 2.7% from $0.55 to $0.565 per share. The present yield on its $2.26 annualized dividend is 5.3%.This is the fifth time that NNN REIT has increased its dividend since July 2020. When a company continually raises its dividend, it's often a sign of improving earnings and revenue, along with continued faith in its future.In short, these triple net-lease REITs are among the most reliable and stable dividend-paying stocks in the market today.Weekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it's too late.

Earlier this morning, we reported our second quarter 2023 operating and financial results, and a copy of the press release and slides are available on our website at fcx.com.Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call.

I'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings.On the call with me today are Richard Adkerson, our Chairman of the Board and CEO; Maree Robertson, our Chief Financial Officer; Josh Olmsted, who leads our Americas operations; Mark Johnson, who leads our Indonesian operations; Cory Stevens, who heads up our Engineering &amp; Construction and Technical Services Group; Mike Kendrick, who leads our Molybdenum business; and Steve Higgins, our Chief Administrative Officer.We'll start the call. Richard will make some opening remarks, and then I'll go through the prepared materials, our slide materials and then we'll open the call to take your questions. So I'd like to turn the call over to Richard.Story continuesRichard C. AdkersonThanks, Kathleen. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us. The positive second quarter results and outlook we're reporting today reflect that our operational performance has been in line with our plans and our prior guidance. Our teams and Freeport's global operations are executing with focus, drive and enthusiasm, all hallmarks of the Freeport culture.Fundamentals in the global copper market remained positive, despite the frequently expressed concerns about a global economic slowdown and issues in China. Electrification is expanding with ongoing advances in alternative energy, electric vehicles, connectivity and supporting infrastructure.Global copper inventories remain remarkably low, and this is notable in the context of the concerns about the global economy in China. The current demand for copper is much stronger than headline economic data. While market experts have significantly varying views about the short-term outlook for the economy and for the price of copper, there is a growing positive consensus on the medium- and longer-term outlook based on projected demand growing faster than supply development.Freeport is extraordinarily well situated in these circumstances. With our large-scale currently producing assets, which we're focused on executing the ongoing positive performance, an attractive pipeline for future growth from the large-scale undeveloped reserves and resources already in our current asset base.Kathleen will now summarize the quarter and our outlook, and then I'll be back along with our team to answer any questions you may have.Kathleen Lynne QuirkThank you, Richard. And I'll start on Slide 3, where we summarize our key operating and financial highlights for the second quarter. Production results across the portfolio were strong in the second quarter approaching 1.1 billion pounds of copper and nearly 500,000 ounces of gold.Our copper sales were about 3% below our guidance as a result of administrative delays in obtaining PT-FI's export license approval. We expect that PT-FI will receive approval to resume concentrate exports over the next several days.Our unit net cash cost during the quarter averaged $1.47 per pound, and that was a little better than our guidance of $1.51 per pound. With average copper prices realized of $3.84 per pound in the quarter, we generated strong margins and EBITDA of $2.14 billion.Our operating cash flows totaled $1.7 billion, and that was substantially above our mining capital expenditures, which totaled $700 million roughly, and that excludes the smelter capital of approximately $500 million in the quarter, which is being funded from proceeds that we raised last year.The balance sheet, liquidity, financial flexibility remain in great shape. Excluding net debt associated with the smelter, we ended the quarter with under $1 billion of net debt. You'll see that we completed and we conducted some additional open market purchases of our public debt in the quarter at prices below par.As we look forward, we're well positioned for strong results in the second half of the year as second half copper volumes are projected to be over 15% higher than the first half and second half gold sales are projected to be over 25% than what we sold in the first half of the year.I'm going to move to Slide 4, where we showcase a few of the operational highlights that we're particularly proud of in the second quarter. At Cerro Verde, where we operate one of the largest concentrate sites in the world, the mill averaged 425,000 tonnes of ore throughput per day during the quarter. This was a site that was designed several years ago at 360,000 tonnes per day. And over time, our team has found ways to improve efficiencies, and we'll continue to do that in the future.At Grasberg, mill rates averaged over 200,000 tonnes per day, was 207,000 tonnes per day in the quarter, and that was processing very high grades of both copper and gold ore that was significantly above the first quarter level and actually the highest average quarterly throughput in over a decade. All this ore is coming from our large-scale, modern and efficient underground mines now.Notably, the large-scale operation at Grasberg produced copper during the quarter at a net cash credit of $0.09 per pound, and it was just extraordinary performance. We're making steady progress on the smelter in Indonesia. This is an important initiative, and we're now at 75% compared with 60% progress 3 months ago.Our project execution is going well, and our team is very focused on completing the project efficiently over the next several months. We expect to complete construction by the second quarter of 2024 and begin commissioning and ramp up over the balance of 2024.We're also happy to report ongoing progress with our Leach initiative, and that's particularly helping our sites in the U.S. During the second quarter, this effort yielded incremental copper of 29 million pounds, and that was over 2x the level in last year's second quarter.We're about 60% of our targeted annual run rate at this level, and we're well on our way to getting to our target of roughly 200 million pounds of copper per year incremental from this initiative. We're going to talk later more -- about it later in the presentation. But our confidence is increasing in meeting the initial target and on a significant upside for this highly valuable initiative.Turning to Slide 5, and you've seen a lot of press reports over the last several weeks about the regulatory situation in Indonesia, and we're providing an update on recent regulatory changes in the country. As many of you know, Indonesia is highly focused on downstream resource development that's been evolving over many years, and that reflects the country's national strategic priorities.The evolution of this ultimately led to our agreement in 2018 to expand our domestic smelting and refining capacity in the country. In 2020, Indonesia passed the law restricting exports of certain minerals, weren't all defined, but that was beginning in June 2023. Given our IUPK license and rights and progress on the smelter, we continue to work with the government to allow time for us to complete our projects, which were delayed by the pandemic.As we mentioned, the projects are well advanced and nearing completion, and we were really honored to host Indonesia's President, Joko Widodo, at our smelter site in June.Beginning in June and July of this year, various ministries completed regulatory process to enable ongoing exports of copper concentrates through May 2024 for exporters with more than 50% smelter progress, and we're over 70%.Last week, the Trade Ministry enacted legislation to allow the exports. And now just the administrative process, we expect to receive formal approval to resume exports over the next several days. We're going to continue to work with the government to enable exports to continue in 2024 until the new smelter is fully ramped up and operational.The Ministry of Finance also passed regulations last week to increase the duties on exports for various products, including copper concentrates. For companies with progress of more than 70%, the duty -- the new duty rate is 7.5% for the second half of this year.Under our IUPK, which provides stabilized terms for taxes, royalties and duties, duties are phased out after 50% progress. And so we're currently reviewing the IUPK provisions with the ministry and are engaged in discussions on this matter.To date, the production impacts on our operations from the shipping delays have been limited, and this has been more of a timing consideration between production and sales. We currently have a sizable volume of copper concentrate at our port site, ready for shipment, and we expect to work down inventories over the next several months.Moving to the copper markets on Slide 6, and Richard touched on this in his comments. Copper is the metal when it comes to electrification. And Freeport is really well positioned as a leader in the global copper industry. The short-term market situation is characterized by, on the 1 hand, favorable demand drivers from growing intensity in autos, renewables and data centers, and that's partly offset by slowing manufacturing growth.China remains the world's largest consumer of copper and even with the country's current economic challenges and the weakness in the property sector, copper consumption continues to grow and that's been bolstered by large investments in copper-intensive electrical grid and strong growth in electric vehicle production. Richard referenced the inventories, which are very low levels by historical standards, they're now lower than they were at the start of this year, and we see this as evidence of a tightly balanced market.As we look forward over the next several years, demand is expected to accelerate with third-party projections for demand to double by 2035. Investments in low carbon renewable power, electrification will lead to massive growth in demand. And in addition to that, the initiatives by many countries for major infrastructure programs and the uses of copper for connectivity, data, AI, those are also growing demand drivers.At the same time, the ability of the copper industry to meet this rising demand is a major challenge, and we are working very hard to increase our supplies as we look forward. We believe prices will need to rise to incentivize new supplies of copper. At Freeport, we benefit from a large reserve position and even greater resource position to be able to grow our business in the future.As I mentioned, we're really focused on continuing to support the growing demand, producing responsibly and we're pursuing several initiatives to enhance our production going forward.Moving to Slide 7. We provide an update of our 3-year outlook for sales volumes. This is largely unchanged from our prior forecast. We've reduced our 2023 copper sales volumes by about 40 million pounds, that's about 1%, to take into account the shipping schedules in the balance of the year.The guidance for 2024 and 2025 is unchanged. And we do -- we are focused on continued success in our leach efforts, which we believe have the potential to provide some upside to these estimates.Moving to the regional information on Slide 8. We show our projected 2023 volumes and unit net cash costs by region. Our business in the Americas, including the U.S. and in South America, comprise about 2/3 of our 2023 copper sales and all of our molybdenum sales, and Indonesia represents about 1/3 of the copper sales and all of our gold sales.On a consolidated basis from a cost standpoint, our unit net cash cost forecast of $1.55 per pound for the year 2023 is consistent with our prior estimate. We've had some small offsetting changes between the regions. But in total, we're continuing to project cash cost of $1.55 for the year.As we move through the year, we're continuing to experience improving cost trends for several of our commodity-based input costs, and we're seeing more stability in labor, services and equipment component costs. We remain focused on cost management and all of our ongoing initiatives to improve productivity to offset the cost increases that we've experienced in recent years. The estimates that were provided on Slide 8 assume that the export duties in Indonesia are unchanged from our existing duties.As I mentioned previously, the new regulations imposed higher duties than our stabilized rates under the IUPK and we're engaged in the discussions with the government to review this. We provided some sensitivities on potential impacts of the higher duty rates on this page, which you can see at the bottom would have a $0.07 per pound impact on consolidated unit net cash cost for the year take into account the impact in Indonesia of $0.19 per pound for the year with the duty starting in the second half.On Slide 9, we updated our outlook for our margins and cash flows. And if we put together our projected volumes and cost projections, we show the modeled results for our EBITDA and cash flow at various copper prices ranging from $4 to $5 copper. These results on the slide are modeled using the average of our 2024 and 2025 volume and cost estimates, and we hold gold flat in these scenarios at $1,950 per ounce and molybdenum flat at $20 per pound; both of those commodities are slightly above that today.Annual EBITDA under these assumptions would range from about $11 billion per annum to $15 billion per annum at $5. The $11 billion was at $4. And our operating cash flows before working capital would range from nearly $8 billion per year at $4 copper and $11 billion per year at $5 copper.We've got some sensitivities to the various commodities both the sales commodities as well as our input costs on the right of the chart. We're well positioned with our long life reserves, large-scale production to benefit from future metals intensive growth trends, and we've got prospects as we look forward for increasing cash returns under our performance-based financial policy payout framework.Return to capital expenditures next on Slide 10, where we show our current forecast for capital expenditures in 2023 and 2024. These include the capital the we're investing in the Indonesian smelter project and those amounts are being funded from a debt offering we did last year, and we've got cash on the balance sheet and availability to support those investments and the detail of those expenditures are on Page 25 of the slide deck.But all in all, on the nonsmelter related investments, the -- we've had some timing adjustments moving some spending from '23 to '24. But the current forecast for the 2 years is pretty similar to what we had before. It's about 3% higher for the 2-year period, and that reflects some updated estimates principally for projects at Grasberg.We've highlighted, here on the slide, discretionary projects, and these are the projects that are being funded with 50% of available cash that's not distributed. Those total $2 billion over '23 and '24, and these are value-enhancing initiatives, we've got some details on Slide 24 in our reference material, but value-enhancing initiatives to improve our position as we look forward.We'll talk on development options and our growth on Slide 11. We're really focused, as we said, on looking at the outlook for growing copper demand and looking at our brownfield strategy given the risk and actionability of greenfield projects, our strategy of developing our resources within our portfolio. We're focused on extensions of our existing operations and our broad portfolio of brownfield opportunities.We've categorized the growth on Slide 11. And in near-term, medium-term and longer-term development operation -- options and you can see in the near term, the best options for us for growth are achieving our initial leach targets and the actions that we have, particularly in our U.S. operations to enhance productivity and reliability by increasing our mining rates in the U.S., through workforce additions, automation and achieving higher targets for asset efficiency and reliability in our equipment and processing facilities, we believe we have the opportunity to add 200 million pounds of copper a year with very limited capital investment.We're very focused on the details of the reliability and asset efficiency that we're pursuing and see that potential as we look forward.We also outlined the potential of our leach opportunity beyond the initial target of 200 million pounds for annum. We talked extensively about this on our last call. We've got very large areas under leach. We've got new approaches and operating practices that we are deploying on this effort. And the more we work on it, the more optimistic we are about this opportunity is much larger than the initial 200 million pounds.We continue to see the clear opportunity of expanding the initial 200 million pounds of copper per annum to 800 million pounds per annum over the next 3 to 5 years. We're continuing initiatives to increase heat to our stockpiles. We're continuing to enhance our ability to identify and deploy solution to areas of the stockpiles which aren't getting adequate solution, and we're continuing our work on additives through internal testing as well as looking at technology that others have with respect to additives.This is a major value opportunity, a major catalyst for us, and Freeport is one of the best-placed companies in the industry to capture value from it. And that's because of our large existing stockpiles with billions of pounds of copper still in them, our technical know-how and the ability of our team to deploy learnings quickly across the portfolio through our operational control of all the mines we have interest in.In addition to the leach opportunity, we've got more traditional sources of growth that we're pursuing. We're continuing to evaluate the expansion of our Bagdad mine in Arizona. We're completing the feasibility studies on that expansion. We've got the major El Abra opportunity in Chile, where we have an existing operation and very large reserves, resources that support future expansion.And of course, we're developing, making progress with the 90,000 tonne per day Kucing Liar Block Cave in Indonesia, and that's expected to commence production by the end of the decade.At Bagdad, we're making some investments to advance tailings and other infrastructure to enhance our optionality for the project. And we're doing the same at El Abra looking at some investments in water infrastructure, not only that would support the current operation but provide optionality for the large mill project in the future.After those 2 projects, we've got big opportunity in our Safford Lone Star District in Eastern Arizona. We've got current production there and have identified a significant resource that would allow us to make that district another cornerstone asset for Freeport as we look into the 2030 timeframe. We've got a series of U.S. brownfield projects that we're also looking at. A big opportunity for us is in Indonesia where an extension of our operating rights beyond 2041, which we're continuing to advance, would open the door for long-term, large-scale mining beyond 2041 and potential reserve expansion and additional development options in one of the world's largest and highest grade copper and gold mining districts.With these projects, we're in a position to continue our leadership role, supplying copper to a world with growing requirements. We're going to continue to be disciplined in our approach but focused on executing the projects where we can create value for shareholders.On the last slide, we -- on Slide 12, we reiterate the financial policy priorities. Those are really centered on our strong balance sheet, which we have, our cash returns to shareholders and investments in our value-enhancing growth projects. The balance sheet is solid. We've got very strong credit metrics and flexibility within our debt targets to execute on projects.At the same time, we've distributed over $3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share purchases since commencing this performance-based policy and have an attractive future long-term portfolio that will allow us to use a portion of our cash flow to build long-term value for shareholders.Richard mentioned the team is energized, motivated and we're focused on continuing to drive value in our business in executing these plans responsibly, safely and efficiently.Thanks for your attention, your participation and operator, we'll now open the call for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions)Our first question comes from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi.Alexander Nicholas HackingSo I guess, I only have 1 question. I saw a press release this morning about a strike at Cerro Verde 72 hours. Could you maybe give us some context on that?Richard C. AdkersonSure. Josh, you're on the line, why don't you respond to that? I was just at Cerro Verde and I got to tell you I was so proud of what the team has done down there.Joshua Frederick OlmstedOne of the thing we really pride ourselves on our open and ongoing conversations with all of our employees and the union, there's -- we have 2 unions at Cerro Verde and this is one of the original unions, which accounts for roughly 28% of our total workforce.And there's just been some ongoing conversation that we've generated dialogue for. We have some -- a meeting with the Labor Department tomorrow to try and continue to foster the conversation and avoid potential strike there. But we're in -- we'll continue to have those dialogues, and we're working through and being as open and transparent as we can at the union to work through and addressing any of the issues.Richard C. AdkersonWell, we have a long history in Peru at Cerro Verde of being able to deal. Sometimes we get affected by -- strike is not related to our operations and so forth, but our team is prepared for it. And we're hopeful that this thing gets resolved. It's not really a major subset issue in my observation on it. And our team will be able to manage our way through it, if, in fact, we have to deal with it.Joshua Frederick OlmstedYes.Richard C. AdkersonOkay. Thanks, Josh.OperatorYour next question will come from the line of Christopher LaFemina with Jefferies.Christopher LaFeminaI actually have quite a few questions about the situation in Indonesia, but I'll limit it to just 2 for now. So the first question is, our understanding at the beginning of July is that the concentrate storage areas were nearly filled and you would likely have to shut down the operations if you did not have an export license imminently.And I'm wondering first of all, whether you've been able to continue to operate at Grasberg or if the mines are shut down for now? And the second question is just related to the export -- sorry you want to answer that one first?Richard C. AdkersonLet's answer your first question. Yes, let's go ahead to answer that. One of the complications we had with this is that the domestic smelter [Grasberg] that PT smelting owns which is not affected by any sort of export issues was undergoing a maintenance -- a planned maintenance turnaround.So there was limited concentrates we could ship domestically. That has been completed, and now we've begun returning to shipping to Grasberg . We haven't shut down at all. We've -- our team has adjusted to the situation by advancing some planned maintenance activities that we had for the second half of the year. And while the storage facilities were approaching their limits, meeting their limits. We have not had a significant -- we've had some impact but not a significant impact on operations. We anticipate resuming exports very shortly. And we have a lot of concentrate that's been produced, its own site, it's ready to sell, and we'll be moving that to market.Christopher LaFeminaOkay. That's helpful. The second question is regarding -- I think Kathleen said the export license is days away. And obviously, as per the IUPK, smelter construction passed 50% means no more export duties for you. But under this new regulation, there will be an export duty. And I'm wondering if the export license will be granted to you even if you are disputing having to pay the new higher export duty because you potentially are protected via the IUPK?Kathleen Lynne QuirkWell, in order to...Richard C. AdkersonAll indications are and expectations are is that we will be able to export. We're continuing discussions right now to present our case. And if we can resolve it, that would be the best outcome. If we can't, we begin exports and then pursue our legal rights separately. Kathleen, you have something to add?Kathleen Lynne QuirkNo. That's great. Thank you, Richard.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley.Carlos De AlbaSo my first question is on Cerro Verde. You are operating quite well there. And the company, if I understand correctly, it doesn't really have a significant debt anymore. So with the cash flow generation there, what are your plans? Do you expect to continue to pay dividends? You already announced, I think, twice payments in the second quarter, you pay more in the third quarter. You typically in the past did pay in the second and fourth quarters, should we expect another payment in the fourth quarter, so 3 in 2023? Just overall, what can you tell on Cerro Verde? And I'll come back with the second question.Kathleen Lynne QuirkWe're -- I think, Carlos, you characterized it correctly. We're essentially distributing cash flow out of Cerro Verde. We've done very well on the debt side. And from time to time, we reserve cash for items that we know about, obligations that we need to pay or items that we know about. But we expect to continue to generate cash flow at Cerro Verde and to the extent we don't have obligations to pay that out to shareholders. I don't have -- we don't have a decision at this point exactly what the cash flow and dividends will be quarter-by-quarter at this point. We're going to -- but we do expect to continue to distribute cash out of Cerro Verde.Carlos De AlbaAnd then the second question is regarding CapEx. Overall CapEx is not changing much, as you already mentioned. But when I looked at the individual projects, I did notice that the PMR in Indonesia as well as the Grasberg mill recovery project increased CapEx 10% to 20% higher than in the last update. So I wonder if you can provide some comments as to what is driving that?Kathleen Lynne QuirkYes. We did have an increase in our precious metals refinery, an updated estimate for this precious metals refinery. It is an operation that is relatively small compared to the overall capital. But as we've gone through more engineering, the cost estimates have increased. A little different than the big project, the Manyar project, where a lot of things were ordered, a lot of things were put in place prior to the big rise in inflation.And so to date, we've been on that project. We've been pretty good at maintaining the cost estimates. So the bigger project we had we had better terms on components, et cetera, but we are getting hit with some increases related to the precious metals refinery. The copper cleaner, with all the projects going on at Grasberg, the mill project, the project we're doing for power, the filter plant we're doing at port site, the availability of experts and contractors has been slower than what was originally projected and the project has taken a little longer which is impacting the cost.But there's nothing materially different about what we're doing there. Just in this environment, things are taking a bit longer and adding to the cost. But I do want to have a shout out to our team managing the bigger smelter, the bigger spend is -- they're doing a great job in managing that project.Richard C. AdkersonAnd Carlos, you know this industry well enough to see what's been going on with project costs around the globe. And I join Kathleen in complementing our smelter team, but our overall operations team, our supply chain management, you see what our cost performance is in a world that still affected by inflation. I mean commodity-related costs are down. But overall, we're taking that and running it through with all of our suppliers and when you look at our operating costs and our project cost, I'm really proud of our operating and supply management teams for the good work they're doing.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research.Timna Beth TannersI want to again too, but just one is really high level. And I know we've talked a lot about Indonesia in the short term, but there's also the broader issue of the additional 10% stake they're asking for and the renegotiation of IUPK further out. But I just sense that compared to 5, 6 years ago when you seemed a bit more concerned about the relationship with Indonesia, it seems like you're not as concerned this time. So I just wanted to see if you could add some more color to that? Is that indeed the case? And maybe why? And how much time do we have, I guess, before we really need to think about and settlement or a decision on this in the near -- is it near term or is it medium term?Richard C. AdkersonSo Timna, let me correct one thing you said. There's no renegotiation of the IUPK. Our current IUPK runs to 2041 and we have no rights beyond that and that was negotiated after a lengthy period and settled in 2018. And the settlement in 2018 has proved to be extraordinary positive for all stakeholders, the government of Indonesia, which acquired Rio Tinto's interest during that process, achieved its goal of getting a 51% equity ownership interest.And together with taxes, royalties and other fees has essentially a 70% interest in the economics of the project. Through that, FCX retained its interest because it was already burdened by the Rio Tinto joint venture interest. And then since that date, we've successfully completed the conversion from the open pit to this underground mine, and you can just see the track record that our team is achieving with that.And over that period of time, copper prices have been good. All stakeholders have benefited. Now we -- when the President, and you talk about the relationships, a key factor in that was when President, Joko Widodo, visited our job site in Papua at the end of August, early September, the first Indonesian President to do that since Suharto did in the early '70s, he was very positive about what he saw there about the progress we're making, about the extent of progress we made in increasing Indonesian management, Indonesian employees, the Papuans that are working in our operations.It's -- that was a key point in helping to build on the 2018 deal and making relationship so much more positive. Now we all -- we have a mutual understanding that this operation needs to be run in a way that maximizes the resources that are available there and having a drop dead date for an operation like this of 2041 is not beneficial to anyone because the exploration, delineation long-term capital planning needs to be factored taking into account the resources that are available there.So we had no rights to provide a basis for going forward beyond 2041, we've had items for discussion, including an additional ownership interest for our Indonesian government to deal with, and we've agreed to support Papuan businesses to do things of that nature. So it's much different than the nature of the discussions we had going into 2018, where there was really contentious views and opposing views on various subjects that were all settled.Now we're in a mode of where there's a mutual recognition of the benefit for all stakeholders for us to plan this operation beyond 2041, and I have a lot of confidence we'll be able to achieve it. Is that -- do you have any follow-up on that, Timna?Kathleen Lynne QuirkTimna, I was just going to add that a big change from maybe historically when you were thinking about it is the alignment we have, better alignment we have with the government of the state-owned enterprise, they own 51% of the shares. And of course, we pay taxes and royalties so the economic interest of the government in this operation is much greater than it was. And so the alignment is very positive as we look forward to create this value that Richard is talking about beyond 2041.And when we talk about beyond 2041 and the opportunity, this allows us really to think about the asset and opens the door for development much greater than what we were planning before because as Richard said, the reserves don't end in 2041. We see a lot of opportunity in using the infrastructure that we already have to further development. And the 10% -- the share thing that you read about what we are engaged in is looking at preserving what we have through 2041, but compensating the government in some way for that extension beyond 2041. So again, like we did in 2018, this would be only done if we could find the right win-win for both Freeport and the government, which we think we can.Richard C. AdkersonThe 10% would only come into play after 2041. And a key factor is under the 2018 agreement, Freeport-McMoran manages -- controls the management of the operations. And everybody is happy with that. There's widespread recognition in the government of just how complicated this business is and they're very complementary and pleased with our -- the way we're running the business. So it's really a good partnership.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research Partners.Michael Stephan DudasKathleen, you mentioned you bought some debt back at a discount, I guess, during the quarter, and certainly, the dividend plan is in place. But as you look into the second half of the year and the CapEx and with anticipated cash flows might be, how do you -- how is the Board thinking about share repurchases since appears you refrained from that in the first half? Is it valuation, opportunistic, balance, maybe you could shed a little bit more light on that as we move into the second half of the year, especially if copper prices begin to sharply recover?Kathleen Lynne QuirkYes. Well, if copper prices sharply to recover, we're going to be generating a lot of free cash flow. Under the policy, we're distributing 50%. And if you go back cumulatively to where -- when we started it in the second half of 2021, we've distributed over 50% between the dividends and the share buybacks. With improved market conditions, that's going to give us a lot of leverage to free cash flow and give us the ability to consider how we deploy that, whether it be share buybacks dividends, et cetera.And so we're following the policy. We're keeping our debt very, very low. The cash flow that we've generated since the policy started, over 50% has gone to shareholders, but the other 50% is -- some of it is still on our balance sheet because we've got projects earmarked to fund. So we're following the policy. We think it's a great balance between balance sheet, capital returns to shareholders and investing in our long-term growth, and we're going to continue to follow that.Richard C. AdkersonI just want to say, Mike, we believe the shares are a good value at today's levels.OperatorYour next question will come from the line of Brian MacArthur with Raymond James.Brian MacArthurI just want to follow up on Timna's question. But when you convert it from underground or from an open pit to underground, I mean we started building that, I think, in 2005, and it took 15 years. So under this long-term planning for 2041, when do you actually to efficiently develop the ore body post KL? Are we talking you need to have this all figured out 15 years in advance like before, so you have to start in 2026? So what sort of time horizon are you looking at to be efficient going forward?Kathleen Lynne QuirkBrian, that's exactly the point that we're making. And I think as we talked about earlier, with the government now owning a big piece of PT-FI and participating in our business and our operating committee they understand that this has to be planned with long-term horizons. And so there's not a drop dead date, but the sooner the better, because the closer we get to 2041, the more difficult it would be to change the outcome. So that's a point, a really important point, and the government has recognized this more so now than they ever have, and that gives us the opportunity to have this discussion about moving forward with the extension.The smelter is a big part of that. We -- with the smelter completion, the regulations in Indonesia now allow for companies with refined processing facilities to be able to apply for longer-term horizons. And so the regulatory environment is recognizing that, and that's all part of what we're trying to achieve. It's not a specific date, but the sooner the better in terms of long-term planning.Richard C. AdkersonAnd Brian, just let me say because of the IUPK term, we only report reserves through 2041, but with our work to develop our mine plans to 2041, we've already identified production that would extend -- production of significance that would extend beyond that.And Mark Johnson and our PT-FI team are already started the process of looking at delineating these orebodies to see what opportunities are there. And so we would -- as we did, as you said, in the early 2000s for this underground conversion, we will begin immediately in developing the plans long term for extending production to Kucing Liar. We know goes far beyond that, and we haven't defined the limits of the Grasberg Block Cave or the other orebody, Kathleen...Kathleen Lynne QuirkDeep MLZ.Richard C. AdkersonDeep MLZ, that's the same ore system that Freeport began mining in the early 1980s and it just continued to go further and further at depth. So we're really excited about it and I've been involved in this orebody for so many years and one continual thing has been it's always gotten bigger than anybody anticipated that it would and so it's really an exciting opportunity for us and for the government.Brian MacArthurSo can I just ask a follow-up on that? Because that's what I was trying to figure out. Is the additional ore 2041 is it depth that you said DMLZ, KL bigger? Or is it the another whole area where you have to put in another whole, say, common infrastructure project or something else out there? Because originally, the original drilling in the area was all cut off and whatever. Is this depth or is it just more development underground? Or is there another whole like, if I call it the whole like original common infrastructure that would have to be put in?Kathleen Lynne QuirkWell, initially...Richard C. AdkersonNo, you wouldn't have to do a whole common infrastructure. I mean it would be something that would utilize what we have there and extend beyond that. But the truth is, we have a lot of indications of things, but we're really to do more active delineation drilling to see what's there and develop our plans around that.Kathleen Lynne QuirkAnd Brian, if you look at our resource statement in the 10-K, you'll see there's a lot of resource there that's not in reserves. And some of that material that comes after 2041, some of it would require some additional processing-type handling because some of it has high pyrite content and that could be a challenge and an opportunity for us.But initially, the opportunity really is at the Deep MLZ. We're already starting to conduct some exploration below Deep MLZ. So really from what we know about, we think there's a lot of opportunity. And then with a life-of-mine extension, we'll have incentive to go do more exploration because we haven't done exploration for, I don't know, 20-plus years given we already had enough reserves to get us through 2041. So it's a great opportunity for, as Richard said, both the government and for Freeport. And this is an asset that's really needed in the global copper industry, really, really important.Richard C. AdkersonYou'll remember this, Brian, because you were around in the -- when we first started developing these underground operations that 20 years ago, we were shooting for 120,000 tonnes a day through our mill. Look what we did in this quarter. 240,000 tonnes a day. So that's just the nature of this great orebody.Brian MacArthurTotally agree, as you said, it takes a lot of long-term planning, too.Richard C. AdkersonThat's the nature of our business.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Cleve Rueckert with UBS.Cleveland Dodge RueckertJust one quick follow-up for me, and it's a little bit more near-term focused on the discussion we've been having. But in Indonesia, can you just help frame the next 18 months the approval that you expect to get in the next several days, how much of an extension does that get you on your ability to export concentrate? And then based on sort of the smelter construction time line and the ramp, when would you expect to see shipping concentrate from Indonesia, such that this concentrate export license isn't really an issue anymore?Kathleen Lynne QuirkThe regulation that's just been adjusted goes through May 2024. And we have export quotas that the government approves in connection with their review of our annual work plans, so our current quota that we'll be shipping under goes through the year-end this year of 2023. We'll have to update that work plan, which we -- it's just an ordinary course thing, which we do in the fall, and that will allow us to increase the -- what we -- the quota to get us through May.And then in connection with that, and we've already been discussing this with the government, while the smelter, we expect will be mechanically complete in the second quarter of next year, you still have a multi-month period throughout 2024, and it will be reducing over time, but a period of time where the smelter needs to be ramped up. And so that part, we will continue to review with the government.The big thing is to get mechanical completion done, and we believe the government will continue to work with us to allow for some exports beyond that, but we'll have to work that through with the government. But really, by the end of next year, we're expecting that the -- essentially, we'll have enough capacity to deal with our production out of PT-FI and that's what we're focused on doing.We talked about this earlier. The project team is doing a really good job. We're very pleased with our EPC contractor there. We've got thousands of people on the ground. And if you see the pictures, it's really, really developing. We know and recognize that smelter operations can be complex, and we're doing a lot of work and planning around operational readiness. But our target is to get the full ramp-up done as we -- by the end of next year.OperatorAnd I'll now hand the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.Kathleen Lynne QuirkWell, thanks, everyone, for your participation. If you have any follow-ups, feel free to contact David, and we look forward to continuing to report to you on our progress.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, thank you on our call for today. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.]"

EPS came in at $0.35, compared to $0.58 in the year-ago quarter.The reported revenue represents a surprise of +1.59% over the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.65 billion. With the consensus EPS estimate being $0.28, the EPS surprise was +25.00%.While investors scrutinize revenue and earnings changes year-over-year and how they compare with Wall Street expectations to determine their next move, some key metrics always offer a more accurate picture of a company's financial health.As these metrics influence top- and bottom-line performance, comparing them to the year-ago numbers and what analysts estimated helps investors project a stock's price performance more accurately.Here is how Freeport-McMoRan performed in the just reported quarter in terms of the metrics most widely monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts:Production in millions of pounds - Copper - Total South America: 307 Mlbs compared to the 305.3 Mlbs average estimate based on three analysts.Production in millions of pounds - Copper - Total North America: 354 Mlbs versus the three-analyst average estimate of 355.43 Mlbs.Production in Ounces - Gold - Consolidated: 483 Koz compared to the 493.32 Koz average estimate based on three analysts.Production in millions of pounds - Molybdenum - By-product - North America: 9 Mlbs versus the three-analyst average estimate of 7.52 Mlbs.Production in millions of pounds - Molybdenum - Consolidated: 21 Mlbs versus 20.84 Mlbs estimated by three analysts on average.Revenues- Indonesia: $2.24 billion versus the six-analyst average estimate of $2.29 billion. The reported number represents a year-over-year change of +13.1%.Revenues- North America copper mines: $1.59 billion compared to the $1.51 billion average estimate based on five analysts. The reported number represents a change of -14.3% year over year.Revenues- South America copper mines: $1.15 billion versus the five-analyst average estimate of $1.28 billion. The reported number represents a year-over-year change of +13%.Revenues- Corporate, other &amp; eliminations: -$1.61 billion versus the five-analyst average estimate of -$1.67 billion.Revenues- Atlantic Copper Smelting &amp; Refining: $748 million versus $678.64 million estimated by five analysts on average.

DUK recently signed a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with Ranger Power to buy up to 199 megawatts (MW) of solar energy from the latter’s Speedway Solar plant. This initiative, which can serve almost 35,000 households in Indiana, will increase DUK’s solar energy capacity in Hoosier State.  The PPA request is currently awaiting regulatory approval from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, with electricity generation expected to commence by September 2025 from the solar project.DUK’s Indiana Integrated Resource PlanThe Integrated Resource Plan is a 20-year forecast on outlines to serve existing and future customers in a reliable and economical manner.Under this plan, Duke Energy plans to reduce carbon emissions from its Indiana fleet by 60% in 2030 and 90% by 2040 from the 2005 levels. It will increase wind generation by 6,200 MW, solar power by 2,218 MW and solar power with energy storage by 450 MW.Such renewable energy initiatives, including the latest PPA signed with Ranger Power, will enable DUK to duly meet its clean energy target in Indiana state.Growth ProspectsWith the United States being one of the major forerunners in the global transition toward clean energy, solar power continues to constitute a significant portion of the rapidly expanding U.S. renewables market.

Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma breaks down what analysts and investors will be watching for.Video TranscriptALEXANDRA CANAL: We have some big food names reporting. Who's up first?BROOKE DIPALMA: Absolutely. Well, Domino's kicks off next week, earnings block of fast food and fast casual companies, followed by Chipotle out on Wednesday, McDonald's out before the bell on Thursday, and Sweetgreen after the bell. Now, taking a closer look at what exactly analysts are expecting in terms of these big players.Domino's expects low same-store sales growth. But ultimately, this is just a low hurdle for Domino's to get over many on the street, waiting to hear more about the Uber Eats partnership that many think will benefit same-store sales growth later on this year or rather in 2024 and beyond. Chipotle, in addition to that, of course, as we noted before, they're set to report on Wednesday after the bell. Same-store sales up there expected to be nearly up 8%. They're expected to regain market share as they kept prices below peers in 2023. So ultimately, benefiting from that value advantage that they now have over their competitors.But food inflation continues to weigh in the company. Beef, right now, makes up about 20% of their food basket. Avocado makes up about 9%. Both are seeing higher prices. But in the call, we're also hoping to hear more color on the expansion into Middle East.And moving right along, McDonald's continues to gain foot traffic because of that lower income audience, in addition to a tighter consumer wallet. We expect same-store sales to be up more than 9% there, led by international same-store sales growth. Of course, menu pricing and market share gain continues to be a play for them. And we're just waiting to hear more on that grimace shake and how that blew off absolute expectations of how it performed in the month of June. Also, that's expected to carry on into early July.Story continuesAnd we're set to close out the week with Sweetgreen. They're set to report Thursday after the bell. Of course, this past quarter, they launched that chicken and Chipotle bowl. In addition to that, they did take an additional 1% pricing at the beginning of the quarter. They also launched a loyalty program. But tomato and chicken costs, they're lowering now. So that's something Wall Street is looking out for.SEANA SMITH: The grimace milkshake, have you tried it yet?ALEXANDRA CANAL: I have not. And I think it's gone already.BROOKE DIPALMA: I haven't.SEANA SMITH: It's gone already? I know it looks so good.ALEXANDRA CANAL: It was all plain vanilla. I like plain vanilla.SEANA SMITH: You are?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, I know--BROOKE DIPALMA: They're also coming out with a Peanut Butter McFlurry, rumor has it. So--SEANA SMITH: I saw your tweet about that. That looks so good. And that's right up my alley. All right. Brooke, you're also keeping an eye across the consumer staple sector. We heard Pepsi, they reported last week, got off to a pretty strong start. Coca-Cola's on deck next week, right?BROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah. Coca-Cola, Keurig, Dr. Pepper, as well as Mondelez, all on deck for next week. And what we're really looking to gain further insight to is really pricing power that these companies have over consumers. All these companies continue to increase prices. And now, they're seeing volumes. For example, PepsiCo last week saw volumes decline for the past, I believe, three quarters.And so really what we're seeing here is ultimately how they continue to raise prices and how exactly volumes continue to remain to slow down or rather lower in these upcoming quarters. Of course, Coca-Cola, their price makes up nearly 7.5%. Keurig, Dr. Pepper, price is up nearly 7% year-over-year. But volumes occurring Dr. Pepper expected to drop nearly 3%. And so really, when will the consumer stop putting up with these higher prices? And when can we expect prices to drop year-over-year, if at all?]"

Let’s take a closer look.PepsiCo Q2PepsiCo posted better-than-expected Q2 results thanks to strong consumer demand trends, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate by more than 7%. Quarterly revenue totaled $22.3 billion, 3% above expectations and improving by a solid 10% year-over-year.Undoubtedly worth highlighting, the better-than-expected results represented the company’s 6th consecutive double-beat.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company’s diversified portfolio remained a source of strength throughout the quarter; global beverages and convenience foods businesses saw 11% and 15% organic revenue growth, respectively. And to top it off, PEP’s core gross profit grew 13% on the back of a 130-bp expansion within its core gross margin.CEO Ramon Laguarta said, “We are very pleased with our performance for the second quarter as our business momentum remains strong. As a result, we now expect our full-year organic revenue to increase 10 percent (previously 8 percent) and our core constant currency EPS to increase 12 percent (previously 9 percent).” The full-year guidance upgrade is certainly a major positive, reflecting the favorable position that the company currently resides in.The results impressed the market, with PEP shares seeing a nice boost post-earnings. This is illustrated in the chart below.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNow, let’s take a look at how estimates stack up for Coca-ColaCoca-Cola Q2Analysts have taken their expectations marginally higher over the last several months, with the $0.72 per share estimate up 1.4% and suggesting year-over-year growth of a modest 3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, our consensus revenue estimate presently stands at $11.7 billion, 3.6% higher than year-ago quarterly sales of $11.3 billion. It’s worth noting that the quarterly estimate has been revised a tick higher over the last several months, reflecting optimism.Coca-Cola has consistently delivered better-than-expected results, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate by an average of 4.2% across its last four quarters. Just in its most recent release, the beverage titan delivered an upbeat 4.6% bottom line surprise and reported sales modestly above expectations.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCoca-Cola shares haven’t seen much action in 2023, up a slight 2%. Still, shares have recently reclaimed their 200-day moving average, reflecting favorable market momentum in the near term.Bottom LineWith earnings season picking up serious momentum, investors will have plenty of quarterly results to sort through daily.And next week, on Wednesday, July 26th, we’ll hear from consumer staples titan Coca-Cola KO.A peer, PepsiCo PEP, has already unveiled its quarterly results, with the company posting better-than-expected numbers and raising its full-year guidance thanks to strong consumer demand.Analysts have been primarily optimistic for KO’s quarter to be reported, with top and bottom line expectations creeping higher over the last several months.Heading into the print, Coca-Cola is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with an Earnings ESP Score of 2%.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

""The more amazing women Cracker Jill can help elevate, the more likely it is that a young girl will be able to see and imagine themselves accomplishing their own dreams.""To reach more girls with the encouraging stories of its I Am Cracker Jill Award recipients, Swanson will introduce the winners as the next generation of athletes changing the game during a new Cracker Jack :30 commercial that will air on FOX throughout the duration of the FIFA Women's World Cup Australia &amp; New Zealand 2023™.

474,cff39d3b-5dcf-3450-a98e-32c393a844ed,UNP,2023-07-21,Analysts Estimate Canadian Pacific Kansas City (CP) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-canadian-pacific-kansas-140211208.html,1689861731,STORY,"['CP', 'UNP']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Canadian Pacific Kansas City (CP) reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 27. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis railroad is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.69 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -6.8%.Revenues are expected to be $2.47 billion, up 43% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 7.22% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Canadian Pacific Kansas City?For Canadian Pacific Kansas City, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Canadian Pacific Kansas City will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Canadian Pacific Kansas City would post earnings of $0.70 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.63, delivering a surprise of -10%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Canadian Pacific Kansas City doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry, Union Pacific (UNP) is soon expected to post earnings of $2.75 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -6.1%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $6.12 billion, down 2.4% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Union Pacific has been revised 2.3% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.16%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Union Pacific will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

This multidisciplinary program will offer no-cost testing to patients in Southern California who are low-income, uninsured, and underinsured and who have rare erosive and blistering diseases, to enable more timely diagnosis of these conditions.Pemphigus and pemphigoid are rare autoimmune diseases that are potentially fatal if undiagnosed or untreated. People with these diseases must often see multiple healthcare providers before seeing a specialist and receiving a diagnosis. People of color are more likely to be misdiagnosed or experience delays in diagnosis because differences in pigmentation can affect the appearance of dermatologic diseases.""The time it takes to get a correct diagnosis can be critical for people who are working-class or living in poverty. Compounding this, people of color are more likely to have delays in diagnosis because pathologic conditions can manifest differently on dark skin and mucosa, and healthcare professionals are trained mostly to diagnose them on white patients,"" said WesternU Health Oral Pathology Laboratory Director Mark Mintline, DDS. ""We are grateful for the support from Quest and its Quest for Health Equity initiative, as it will help eliminate a barrier to diagnosis and enable us to expedite the treatment of patients suffering from these diseases.""The collaboration between Q4HE and WesternU, with additional support from the International Pemphigus and Pemphigoid Foundation (IPPF) and the University of California Irvine (UCI) Health Dermatology Immunobullous Clinic, aims to accelerate diagnosis times and help reduce the number of doctors needed to get a diagnosis. Local healthcare providers will be able to refer patients for intraoral biopsies and serum testing without worrying about the cost of laboratory tests thanks to no-cost diagnostic testing provided through the Q4HE initiative.Story continues""We believe good healthcare should be in reach for everyone, and we are proud to support this important program to give access to lab testing that will help provide care to underserved patients in Southern California suffering from these rare autoimmune diseases,"" said Michael Floyd, Senior Director and Leader, Q4HE. ""We are hopeful that we can help break down some of the barriers to healthcare access that these patients are experiencing by making diagnostic testing more accessible.""Biopsies Save Lives also connects patients to the IPPF, which offers peer coaching, patient education webinars, support groups, publications, and a network of doctors who are experienced in treating pemphigus and pemphigoid patients. This includes expert dermatologists from UCI Health Dermatology, which specializes in the diagnosis, treatment, and management of acquired autoimmune blistering diseases.

The products of technology companies may be subject to severe competition and rapid obsolescence, and technology stocks may be subject to greater price fluctuations. Investments in small- and mid-cap companies involve risks and volatility greater than investments in larger, more established companies. Foreign investments subject the fund to risks, including political, economic, market, social and others within a particular country, as well as to currency instabilities and less stringent financial and accounting standards generally applicable to U.S. issuers. As a non-diversified fund, fewer investments could have a greater effect on performance.Morningstar Percentile Rankings are based on the average annual total returns of the funds in the category for the periods stated. They do not include sales charges or redemption fees but do include operating expenses and the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions. Share class rankings vary due to different expenses. If sales charges or redemption fees were included, total returns would be lower.For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ used to rank the fund against other funds in the same category. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly excess performance, without any adjustments for loads (front-end, deferred, or redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.©2023 Morningstar, Inc.
