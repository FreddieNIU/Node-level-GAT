SICNX holds a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.', 'History of Fund/Manager', 'SICNX is a part of the Schwab Funds family of funds, a company based out of San Francisco, CA. The Schwab International Core Equity made its debut in May of 2008 and SICNX has managed to accumulate roughly $546.67 million in assets, as of the most recently available information. The fund is currently managed by Wei Li who has been in charge of the fund since June of 2013.', 'Performance', 'Of course, investors look for strong performance in funds. This fund carries a 5-year annualized total return of 7.05%, and it sits in the bottom third among its category peers. Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3-year annualized total return of 4.09%, which places it in the middle third during this time-frame.', ""It is important to note that the product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sale charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower."", ""When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. SICNX's standard deviation over the past three years is 16.61% compared to the category average of 18.59%. Looking at the past 5 years, the fund's standard deviation is 17.88% compared to the category average of 18.35%. This makes the fund less volatile than its peers over the past half-decade."", 'Risk Factors', ""Investors should note that the fund has a 5-year beta of 0.87, so it is likely going to be less volatile than the market at large. Alpha is an additional metric to take into consideration, since it represents a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark, which in this case, is the S&P 500. Over the past 5 years, the fund has a negative alpha of -5.86. This means that managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns."", 'Expenses', 'Costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing, and particularly as competition heats up in this market. And all things being equal, a lower cost product will outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, so taking a closer look at these metrics is key for investors. In terms of fees, SICNX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.86% compared to the category average of 0.83%. From a cost perspective, SICNX is actually more expensive than its peers.', 'This fund requires a minimum initial investment of $0, while there is no minimum for each subsequent investment.', 'Fees charged by investment advisors have not been taken into considiration. Returns would be less if those were included.', 'Bottom Line', 'Overall, even with its comparatively weak performance, average downside risk, and higher fees, Schwab International Core Equity ( SICNX ) has a high Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and therefore looks a good potential choice for investors right now.', ""Your research on the Mutual Fund Equity Report segment doesn't have to stop here.

Our results reflect increasing weakness in industrial and a sequential decline in automotive as customers work to reduce their inventory levels. Similar to last quarter, I'll focus on sequential performance as it's more informative at this time. First, the industrial market was down mid-teens as we saw that increasing weakness. The automotive market was down mid-single digits after 3.5 years of very strong growth. Personal electronics was about flat. And next, communications equipment was down low single digits. And lastly, Enterprise Systems grew low single digits. In addition, as we do at the end of each calendar year, I'll describe our revenue by end market. As a percentage of revenue for 2023, Industrial was 40%, automotive was 34%, Personal Electronics 15%, Communications Equipment 5%, Enterprise Systems 4% and other was 2%. In 2023, industrial and automotive combined made up 74% of TI's revenue, up about 9 percentage points from 2022 and up from 42% in 2013. We see good opportunities in all of our markets but we place additional strategic emphasis on industrial and automotive. Our industrial and automotive customers are increasingly turning to Analog and Embedded technologies to make their end products more reliable, more affordable and lower empower. These trends have resulted and will continue to result in growing chip content per application which will drive faster growth compared to our other markets. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook."", 'Rafael R. Lizardi', ""Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, fourth quarter revenue was $4.1 billion. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.4 billion or 60% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue higher manufacturing costs associated with planned capacity expansions and reduced factory loadings. Gross profit margin decreased 650 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $898 million, up 4% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.7 billion or 21% of revenue. Operating profit was $1.5 billion in the quarter or 38% of revenue. Operating profit was down 30% from the year ago quarter. Net income in the fourth quarter was $1.4 billion or $1.49 per share. Earnings per share included a $0.03 benefit for items that were not in our original guidance. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.9 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $1.1 billion in the quarter. In the quarter, we paid $1.2 billion in dividends and repurchased $65 million of our stock. We also increased our dividend per share by 5% in the fourth quarter. marking our 20th consecutive year of dividend increases. In total, we have returned $4.9 billion in the past 12 months to owners. Our balance sheet remains strong with $8.6 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the fourth quarter. Total debt outstanding was $11.3 billion with a weighted average coupon of 3.5%. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $4 billion, up $91 million from the prior quarter, and days were 219, up 14 days sequentially. Now let's look at some of these results for the year. In 2023, cash flow from operations was $6.4 billion. Capital expenditures were $5.1 billion. Free cash flow for 2023 was $1.3 billion or 8% of revenue. Our free cash flow reflects the strength of our business model as well as our decisions to invest in 300-millimeter manufacturing assets and inventory to support our overall objective to maximize long-term free cash flow per share, which we believe is the primary driver of long-term value. Turning to our outlook, for the first quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.45 billion to $3.75 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.96 to $1.16. We now expect our 2024 effective tax rate to be about 13%. In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term. With that, let me turn it back to Dave."", 'Dave Pahl', ""Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open the lines for questions. in order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator?"", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.', 'Toshiya Hari', ""My first is on your Q1 outlook. I think at the midpoint, you're guiding revenue down 12% or so, which is clearly well below what we consider to be typical seasonality. Any end markets or regions or device types that you can call out that's driving that view? Or is it broad-based weakness across all applications."", 'Dave Pahl', ""Yes, I'll take that, Toshiya. Thanks for the question. In fourth quarter, we did see weakness in industrial increasing weakness there. We saw the sequential decline in automotive. And as the guide would suggest we believe that we'll just continue to operate in a weak environment and one where customers are continuing to rebalance their inventories overall. So -- but nothing specific to comment on. Do you have a follow-up?"", 'Toshiya Hari', ""I do. Just on gross margins, I think you guys did a good job in explaining what's driving it. Still, I'm a little bit surprised with the year-over-year kind of drop through, if you will, gross margin dollars essentially dropping as much as your revenue. I understand the underutilization, the increase in depreciation. But what are you seeing from a pricing perspective? Is it more pricing than volume that's driving the revenue decline and the decline in gross margins? Or if you can kind of speak to your strategy from a pricing perspective, what you're seeing in the marketplace, that would be helpful."", 'Dave Pahl', ""Yes. Toshiya, and I'll remind everyone else, I know you know the industry well. But pricing just doesn't move quickly in our markets overall. And nor is it the primary reason why a customer chooses our products. So -- and as we've mentioned before, our pricing strategy hasn't changed. And of course, we're always regularly monitoring the market and pricing our products appropriately. And as we've talked about now for, I think, a couple of quarters, as we expected supply and demand to come more in balance that we would expect pricing to revert back to how it's behaved over the last 10 or 20 years. And over the last 6 months or so, that's what we've seen. So somewhat of a low single-digit decline is what we're expecting out in time and I wouldn't describe that as unusual."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.', 'Timothy Michael Arcuri', ""I wanted to ask about factory loadings. Dave, gross margin was down maybe 250 basis points. It's kind of implied to be down 250 basis points. Even if I strip out depreciation, it's down about 100 basis points from March. So it seems like utilization is coming down a bit. And CapEx also came in a little bit lower, too, for December. So the first question on that is, can you talk about loadings. Is March going to be the bottom in loadings and we should see inventory begin to come down also in March? And then I had a follow-up on that, too."", 'Rafael R. Lizardi', ""Yes. So thanks for the question. So step back in third quarter, at the end of the third quarter, we talked about this as we have near our inventory levels, then we have adjusted our factory loadings accordingly. So in third quarter, we did some of that, and that had an impact on gross margins and underutilization. Fourth quarter adjustment was bigger than third quarter. And now going into first quarter, we're taking that adjustment further. So the first quarter adjustment on the utilization will be will be bigger. But we continue to have an upward bias on inventory as we continue to build the right buffers for the right parts to be ready on the other side of the cycle. Do you have a follow-up?"", 'Timothy Michael Arcuri', ""I did. Yes. So then on CapEx, can you talk about that? It was a little lower. It's running actually quite a bit below the $5 billion run rate now. So are you actually cutting CapEx now with -- since you're bringing on factory loading?"", 'Unidentified Company Representative', ""No, we're not. In fact, CapEx came in as expected, $5.1 billion, and we've been talking about $5 billion per year. So it was right on target. And you should expect and we expect to continue running at about $5 billion per year through 2026 as we complete the investment plans that we've been talking about."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with Citibank.', 'Christopher Brett Danely', 'Just a follow-up on the utilization rates. So is the target, I guess, inventory level, has that not changed for you guys? And so do you expect utilization rates to bottom in Q1? Or do you think you might have some more inventory adjustments going into Q2 for TI?', 'Unidentified Company Representative', ""Yes. No, thanks, Chris. So our -- broadly speaking, our inventory targets have not changed over the last 6, 9 months. through this cycle. So we still have some ways to go clearly less than we did 6 months ago. But we will still have some ways to go on that front. At one point, I talked about $4 billion to $4.5 billion worth of inventory. So that's in the ballpark. And we just finished just shy of $4 billion. But as far as when underutilization bottom, that's going to depend on revenue expectations and at this point, we're only -- as always, we only give 1 quarter at a time. So we'll see where we are 90 days from now, and we'll tell you about that."", 'Dave Pahl', ""Maybe I'll just add that our target inventory is set really by device. It's -- we look at things like how many customers are buying the product, what the buying patterns look like, how long it takes us to manufacture of the product. So it's really a bottoms-up plan built on that very, very specifically. So that's what drives that target overall, and we want to have inventory positioned to support growth. over the long term. This is a side comment. So you have a follow-on, Chris?"", 'Christopher Brett Danely', ""Yes. I guess just a little bit of color on the end market commentary. Thanks for that. On the industrial side, it sounds like most of the downside is due to excess inventory, not demand. I was hoping you could confirm that. And then with automotive weakening, is there any reason why automotive wouldn't fall under the same issues that the industrial end markets/inventory would as well."", 'Dave Pahl', ""Yes. So I'll start and then Rafael, if you want to add anything. I would say that the demand signals that we get from customers are orders that they place, whether that's either directly or through consignment fees. So that's the data that we can see. We actually can't see their inventory levels we can anecdotally as we see a market like personal electronics is down 30%, 40%. We know handsets and PCs that market hasn't gone down as much as that. So we know anecdotally that we're shipping below demand. So we believe that that's what's going on in industrial. We have customers who have told us that they have built inventory and plan to correct that. So having a real clear picture of what their demand looks like and their channel inventories look like isn't something that we can see directly overall. So -- and the comment on automotive. We know that customers there did want to build inventory. And we believe that they're in a good position now. So it wasn't surprising that we saw a sequential decline there. So thanks, Chris. We will go to our next caller please."", 'Operator', ""Our next question comes from the line of Tom O'Malley with Barclays."", ""Thomas James O'Malley"", ""I just wanted to understand the linearity of the industrial and automotive declines. When you set out in the quarter baked into your expectations, where you're kind of looking at these 2 businesses both a little bit better than they came in or was one a bit worse than the other versus your expectations? And then just in terms of the timing of the quarter, it looks like your finished goods inventory went up a bit. more than your other buckets. And I just wanted to understand, is that just because later in the quarter, customers were signaling some weaker trends? Or is there any reason behind the dynamic there?"", 'Rafael R. Lizardi', ""Let me start with the second part of the question. And Dave, do you want to take the first one, better. Second part, that's just a reflection of our ability to build those inventory buffers that we're talking about. And what you're seeing there is on the finished goods side. That's one, as Dave alluded to earlier, that's one set of targets that we have. That's at the finished goods level. Remember, we have 100,000 different parts. And the vast majority of those are what we call catalog, which means they sell to many, many customers. So we want to build certain finished good level for each one of those parts. But we're also building at the chip level. Think of a chip can go into 2, 3, 10 different finished goods. So it works out well to have some chip level inventory operationally. But you also have -- want to have finished goods. So that's what (inaudible) you saw there."", 'Dave Pahl', 'Yes. And by end markets, Tom, our guidance, as you saw where our revenues came in, we were, I think, less than 1% from the midpoint of the guidance range. So the business came in about as we expected and nothing unusual in -- versus our expectation in industrial or automotive overall. So do you have a follow-up.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.', 'Ross Clark Seymore', ""I just wanted to ask about the product side, the analog versus embedded. Embedded had a significantly better year, dropping 3% versus the analog down 15. I know there's very different end market exposures for those. But were there other competitive dynamics, pricing dynamics, strategic focus dynamics, anything else to explain the difference between the performance of those 2 segments."", 'Dave Pahl', 'Yes, Ross, I think your instincts are spot on that the first lens to look at things is through the end markets and embedded has those heavied up in industrial and automotive. So revenues there were stronger for a longer period of time. The second consideration is that embedded relies on foundry wafer supply more heavily. Most of our analog business is done internally. So There, the constraints lasted longer and have now been resolved and are behind us. So that created some of the lag between there as well. So -- and as you know, our CapEx plans and spend will have more of our wafers overall built internally, which is inclusive of Embedded. Do you have a follow-on?', 'Ross Clark Seymore', ""Yes, I do. And it's kind of a cyclical question. You guys are astute students of cyclicality of this whole industry. I think this is going to be included in your guide, the sixth quarter of negative year-over-year comps. Do you see anything that's TI-specific that's different this cycle, pricing just got so good before. Now it's a bigger headwind. You kind of addressed the pricing dynamic a little bit before. But what's making this duration so much longer? And is any of it TI specific?"", 'Dave Pahl', ""Ross, I think I'll make a comment, and Rafael, if you want to add anything. All cycles are the same, and they're all different, right, as we've all studied them over time. What's clearly different this time is how the markets have behaved in the bifurcation. We saw personal electronics begin to weaken the second quarter a year ago. And automotive, just we saw a sequential decline in this last quarter. So in the other markets, somewhere in between. So -- and then in addition, I think that we've had lots of other noise that's inside of the system, whether that's been pricing, as you mentioned. We've had noncancelable non-reschedule orders and other longer-term contracts that have required customers to take product that they don't need whether companies are using distributors more heavily than others. So all of that adds noise into it. So I think we just need to let that noise bring itself out over the cycle. And what we're focused on, of course, is investing in our competitive advantages, getting stronger, we believe that we're in a great position to continue to gain share over the long term."", 'Rafael R. Lizardi', ""Yes. I just want to clarify for those who maybe new on the call, when they've talked about our non-cancel, non returnable orders, that's not, we don't do that. Many of our competitors have done that. So that, in our view, is towards the market that wasn't the case with us. And the second point, distributors, same thing. Our distribution footprint is much smaller than with many of our competitors. We're down to 25% or so of our revenue through distribution of 75% direct whereas many of our competitors are the opposite."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.', 'Joseph Lawrence Moore', ""I wonder if you could talk about the chips act, how that's kind of flowing through both the investment tax credit and then any thoughts you may have on timing of kind of grant issuances or things like that?"", 'Rafael R. Lizardi', ""Yes. No, happy to talk about that. So first, let me address the ITC first, and then I'll go to the grant. So the ITC investment tax credit, 25% credit on CapEx for manufacturing in the United States, we have accrued to date over the last 1.5 years or so, $1.4 billion. We expect to get about $500 million of that later this year, probably in the fourth quarter as far as the current law and regulations stipulate. And we'll get the rest further down the road, mostly the following year and then after that. And we'll continue to accrue that benefit just again, 25% on anything we spend in the United States for manufacturing. That's the cash side and the balance sheet. On the P&L, you're already we're already seeing the benefit of lower depreciation. And that tends to be -- that benefit tends to be small, has been small so far because, for example, some of that is for buildings that haven't even started to depreciate but it will build up over time on that front. So that's the ITC. The grant we submitted our application for those in December. And at this point, we will wait to hear from the Department of Commerce and see what happens there."", 'Dave Pahl', 'You have a follow-on Joe?', 'Joseph Lawrence Moore', ""Yes, I did. So I think, obviously, that stuff will help the cash flow down the road, but your free cash flow is below the level of the dividend right now, I assume it's pretty important to keep paying the dividend. Where does that leave you in terms of share repurchases and other uses of cash?"", 'Rafael R. Lizardi', 'Yes. First, I would point you to our operating cash. Our business model is very strong. And our operating cash flow is very strong, and it supports our investment for growth through the cycle. So clearly, with the levels of CapEx that we have right now that hits the free cash flow, but big picture understand and look at the operating cash even in a depressed environment with the revenue (inaudible) the operating cash flow is very strong. We also have a very strong balance sheet, and we just finished the year $8.6 billion. When it comes to repurchases, I would take you to our objectives on capital management for cash return. And our objective is to return all free cash flow via dividends and repurchases. Each one of those has different objectives on dividends and repurchases. But we have a really good track record over many years of doing both of those.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.', 'Harlan L. Sur', ""Up to Q3 of that (inaudible) the team had seen numerous consecutive quarters of increasing cancellations and pushouts, right, typical customer behavior in a weak demand environment. I assume given your commentary that the team continues to see cancellations, pushouts activity expanding into the December quarter, you're almost a month into March. Are you still seeing cancellations and pushouts expanding or starting to maybe see some signs of stabilization?"", 'Dave Pahl', ""Yes, Harlan. As you would expect, we have seen cancellations in the quarter and fourth quarter had remained elevated I wouldn't describe them as increasing, but just at higher levels. And we're still early inside of the quarter. I would say all of what's going on with cancellations and the backlog that we see is all comprehended in our guidance and our outlook."", 'Harlan L. Sur', ""Perfect. And then yes, from a geographical perspective, China headquartered shipments seen about 20% of your sales through the October quarter of last year. This geography has experienced the most significant decline during this downturn, when it's down about 33% year-to-date up through Q3 of last year, your total business was down 13%, right? Is this geography continuing to contribute to the weakness stepping into this year? Or is the weakness more U.S. and European based?"", 'Dave Pahl', ""Yes. I would say when you look regionally this quarter from a -- just from a dollar standpoint, you've got -- sequentially, all the regions were down with the exception of the rest of Asia. So nothing unusual with China going on specifically there overall. So again, when we look at our business, I think most of that is explained by the end markets. And certainly, we hadn't seen a recovery inside of China that I think most of us were expecting."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen & Company.', 'Joshua Louis Buchalter', ""I wanted to ask about how you're thinking about OpEx given the extended softness. Any thoughts on getting more defensive with OpEx as the weakness last longer than expected? Or you grew OpEx 8% in 2023? Is that sort of the right level that you think you need to be investing in the business for the long-term growth."", 'Rafael R. Lizardi', ""Yes. Big picture, we have a disciplined process of allocating capital to R&D and SG&A to the best opportunities. And we've held a steady hand throughout a number of years, pre-pandemic, during the pandemic, post pandemic, where we manage OpEx very well during that time and didn't get ahead of our skis. So we will continue with that discipline process. Remember, of course, these investments, particularly industrial automotive, which is where we're biasing investments, they're very long term in nature. You're not going to -- what you say now is going to -- would hurt your long-term revenue growth. So we're not going to do that. So we're going to maintain those investments for the long term."", 'Dave Pahl', 'You have a follow-on, Josh?', 'Joshua Louis Buchalter', ""Yes. I guess I wanted to ask about your fixed cost leverage. I mean, in the past, you've talked about, I think, 75% gross margin fall through on incremental revenue. Is that still the right metric we should be using given revenues, a good amount lower and depreciation is larger. I'd just be curious to hear if anything in the mechanics of that math has changed. And basically, when can the incremental 300-millimeter capacity start flowing through to gross margin and be margin accretive?"", 'Rafael R. Lizardi', ""Yes. So the math is still the same. The fall-through (inaudible) is 70% to 75%. That is still a reasonable starting point. You then have to adjust for depreciation, as you alluded to in our depreciation. I gave you an update on that 90 days ago, but I'll reinforce that in a second, but you have to adjust for that. And then there are always puts and takes on any given quarter like right now, it's under utilization, but at some point, that goes the other way. Throughout this time, as you pointed out, we will continue to benefit increasingly from 300-millimeter -- more 300-millimeter wafers, which have a cost advantage. So let me go back to depreciation, just to make sure everybody has the right numbers. It's the same as what I said 90 days ago for 2024, expect $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion and for 2025, expect $2 million to $2.5 million."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of CJ Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald.', 'Unidentified Analyst', 'I guess first question, your revenue outlook for March basically gets us back to kind of pre-Covid first half 2020 levels. Yet at the same time, your inventory is roughly double. And so curious, how are you thinking about kind of normalized inventory over time? And also, how are you thinking about coming out of the trough, what kind of a gross margin recovery will look like given where your inventory levels are today?', 'Rafael R. Lizardi', ""So that's a multipart question, has many angles to that. What I would tell you, high level, we're very comfortable with our inventory level. Right now, we're just shy of $4 billion. As I said earlier on the call, we have a continued upward bias for at least one more quarter probably a couple of quarters at least an upward bias on that. But that is good inventory for catalog parts that sell to many customers that last a long time. So I feel really good about that. But we'll see how things play out in the early part of the cycle and depending on demand and different things. But I would expect to continue holding relatively high levels of inventory. We are just in a different position than we were even 3 or 4 years ago in terms of how much of our revenue and our parts are in industrial automotive, in catalog type of parts that last a long time. So our strategy is such that it makes sense to have to have that inventory. Our order fulfillment processes have also improved. We have ti.com and different tools that we can leverage to go direct to market. We have a much higher percent of our revenue, now 35% is direct. So all those factors play into having more inventory as a real leverage point that we can use to serve our customers even better."", 'Unidentified Analyst', ""A quick follow-up to a prior question. I know you can't share too much, but your application clearly in for the CHIPS Act. I guess, we should hear results between now and the summer. I guess, is there anything you can share on that front and perhaps how it's kind of impacting your thoughts on the capacity you're bringing online?"", 'Rafael R. Lizardi', ""Yes. No. Unfortunately, no, there's nothing we can share. It's really up to the Department of Commerce. We sent our application, and we'll see where that goes. What I would say just -- just like I said I've said before is when we decided about a year ago to take our CapEx up from $3.5 billion per year to $5 billion per year. And this tremendous plan to build more fabs in the United States, we comprehended CHIPS grant in that decision. So that was part of our thinking there. But at this point, yes, that's all we can share on that front."", 'Dave Pahl', ""And I think we've got time for one more call, please."", 'Operator', 'Our last question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Wolfe Research.', 'Christopher Caso', ""Just trying to understand a little bit about why the customers may have reacted as they did because we know your lead times have normalized well in advance of the rest of the industry. Do you think this is just simply a function of end markets took a note leg down here? Do you think perhaps some of your customers were delaying their inventory adjustments until they saw lead times for the rest of the industry come down because we know that's also some of your competitors lagged your lead time normalization. Perhaps that was a factor here."", 'Dave Pahl', ""Yes, Chris, as you know, you can't pin it on one thing, especially we've got well over 100,000 customers and 80,000 products that we're managing. As Rafael was talking about building inventory, we've got essentially all of our catalog products or almost all of our catalog products are now immediately available on ti.com. And our objective with inventory and the capacity we're putting in place is to have our customer service metrics remain high, which means keeping time lead times stable. So I think in some markets, we've seen customers that have told us that they were planning and have built their capacity and their inventories to grow at 25% in the coming year. And they showed up and their plans change, and they're only going to grow 10%, right? So they told us they won't be ordering product for some time as they equalize those numbers. they're still going to have healthy growth, but it's hard to put that across all of those 100,000 customers into one short concise statement. Do you have a follow-on?"", 'Christopher Caso', 'Yes. Fair enough. And if you could help us with the impact of the underutilization right now how much of a headwind is that providing right now on a cost of sales basis? And then on the other side of this, when we finally get to a recovery, what will be the right way to model this. Will there be a bigger snapback as some of the underutilization comes off? Or do we just kind of go back to sort of those mid-70s incremental margins on the way back up.', 'Rafael R. Lizardi', ""Yes. So what I would tell you, first, we don't quantify on the utilization, but you can fairly reasonably back into it, just looking at our numbers, our midpoint or our range, our midpoint and then consider the depreciation -- expected depreciation increase and it'd be relatively straightforward for you to back into something reasonable for first quarter on the underutilization impact there. Now after that, it's all going to depend on revenue and revenue expectations because, of course, depending what those are in the second half of the year, let's say, 90 days from now, then that will be a big factor in determining how the factories will run. But the bigger picture is all deployment of CapEx that we're doing is all on 300-millimeter, which has a 40% cost advantage versus 200-millimeter. As several questions people asked earlier, has ITC benefits on that. So the -- is coming in at 25% discount on the ITC, and we'll see how much we get on grant. So the fall-through on those investments for many, many years will be very positive, I would say. So with that, Dave?"", 'Dave Pahl', 'Yes. Thanks, Rafael. Thank you all for joining us. We look forward to sharing our capital management update next Thursday, February 1, at 10 a.m. Central Time, as I mentioned earlier and a replay of this call will be available shortly on our website. Good evening.', 'Operator', ""And this concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.""]"

But striking the right chord each time is not easy unless blessed with Midas touch. When it comes to the investment market, experts consider value style as one of the most effective approaches. Value investing is essentially about selecting stocks that have good things going on for them, even at a time when they have been beaten down by some external factors.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength but a random selection of ratios cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, we recommend Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) as one of the key metrics. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis — the lower the number, the better. PVH Corp. PVH, Centene Corporation CNC, General Motors Company GM and Graphic Packaging Holding Company GPK boast a low P/CF ratio.', 'Questions may arise as to why we are considering the Price to Cash Flow valuation metric, when the most widely used metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, what makes P/CF stand out is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly reflecting the financial health of a company.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. It is net cash flow that reveals how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is putting the same to use.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, shell out for its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Then again, a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.', ""An investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and also consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Here are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to their peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening.PVH Corp., which operates as an apparel company, carries a Zacks Rank #2.

Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco this month. Zovighian was speaking one month after Edwards forecast 8% to 10% revenue growth in 2024.', 'The expansion of TAVR into asymptomatic patients is one reason Edwards believes revenue growth can accelerate. The survey supports the view that the expansion can drive a quick uptick in growth, with the respondents predicting a 10% increase in volumes one year after approval in asymptomatic patients. The prediction exceeds the 4% growth forecast by Leerink, although the analysts are more optimistic than the surveyed cardiologists about the impact by year three.', 'Leerink analysts expect Edwards to present data in asymptomatic patients later this year and called the readout “the most important near-term TAVR-related catalyst” for the company.

22,e74c2148-32a4-34c5-86f4-5cda8b676540,WMT,2024-01-24,Why Walmart pays its truck drivers 6 figures,FreightWaves,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-walmart-pays-truck-drivers-140000671.html,1706018400,STORY,['WMT'],"['One Walmart truck driver says he has 15 years left of working, and he intends to spend them hauling loads for Walmart. “Barring a lottery win or marrying a sugar mama, I don’t see myself going anywhere,” said the Texas-based driver, who asked not to have his name included as he is not authorized to speak on behalf of the company.', 'Such loyalty to a single company is unusual in trucking, an industry notorious for massive turnover. And the Texas trucker isn’t alone in his dedication to Walmart. One of the best jobs you can get in trucking is at Walmart. The uber-retailer says truck drivers can make up to $110,000 in their first year at the company. That’s twice the nationwide median pay of a truck driver, and certainly above the $17.50 an hour that the average Walmart associate earns. Home time, paid vacation and good health insurance are also guaranteed for Walmart company drivers. These offerings are elusive in the trucking world.', 'It’s not out of the goodness of Walmart’s corporate heart that it pays truck drivers a truckload. Rather, truckers are key to Walmart’s retail dominance — and they have been from the start. Without a highly engaged trucking workforce, it’s not likely that the company would have flourished in the way it has. The Fortune 1 company prioritized supply chain long before it became a buzzword.', '', '“At Walmart, we believe in offering our drivers a competitive compensation package to attract the best drivers in the industry,” a Walmart spokesperson told FreightWaves in an emailed statement.', 'Walmart employs some 14,000 drivers, which makes it comparable to some of the largest for-hire fleets in the U.S. It’s added 5,800 drivers to the company in the past five years alone.', 'Recently, Walmart has shifted some of its strategies around recruiting those new drivers. In 2018, Walmart changed its truck driving recruitment program to allow more drivers to pass its program. A senior vice president at Walmart told Yahoo! Finance at the time it was because of a “shortage” of truck drivers. (Those who study the trucking industry dispute that such a shortage exists, concluding that drivers leave the industry for jobs with better pay and hours.)', 'Last year, Walmart announced another key pivot. The company said in January 2023, building on a pilot it launched the year before, that it would allow Walmart associates living in participating locations to apply to a 12-week CDL program. For perhaps the first time, a Walmart company driver doesn’t need years of experience to get behind the wheel of its branded 18-wheelers. It may be that Walmart’s tack on trucking is changing.', 'Decades before Walmart became the biggest company in the world — raking in $611 billion in revenue last year — its leadership team couldn’t find anyone to haul freight to its first stores. Walmart operated mostly in the boondocks, far from where most trucking companies wanted to go.', '“We couldn’t find anybody who wanted to run their trucks 60 or 70 miles out of the way into these little towns where we were operating,” Don Sonderquist, an early Walmart executive, explained in an interview published in 1992. “We were totally ignored by the distributors and the jobbers. That’s not only how we came to build our own distribution system, it’s also how we got used to beating the heck out of everybody on prices.”', 'This forced founder Sam Walton to build up his own network of suppliers, too. Walmart elected to work directly with the brands it sells in-store, which still allows the company unusual control over the minutiae of the products of some very large companies, according to journalist Charles Fishman, the author of the 2006 book “The Wal-Mart Effect.”', 'This hyperfocus on supply chain and distribution shaped key decisions from the top to the bottom of Walmart’s operations. That’s according to two people who have closely studied Walmart: Fishman and historian Nelson Lichtenstein, author of the 2006 book “Wal-Mart: The Face of Twenty-First-Century Capitalism” and professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara.', 'When Walmart sought to open a new store, Fishman and Lichtenstein explained, it built the distribution center. Then, it built stores within a one-day drive of that distribution center. This might seem like an obvious strategy in 2024, but it was somewhat revolutionary in the mid-20th century. Kmart, for example, targeted the same blue-collar Americans that Walmart did. However, Kmart would simply plop stores into suburbs that had plenty of customers. Distribution was an afterthought.', '“Walmart has become the largest company in human history by doing something that was already being done, better than anyone else did it,” Fishman said. “Logistics and transportation is one of the things that made Walmart, Walmart, and allowed them to outcompete.”', 'Kroger, Home Depot, Target and the like all operate huge supply chains and obviously manage to get their shelves robustly stocked — without the front-and-center obsession on supply chain. Walmart’s supply chain, though, is different for a few key reasons. Professor Brian Gibson, executive director of the Center for Supply Chain Innovation at Auburn University, laid it out:', 'Walmart is just, well, bigger than any other retailer. It has 4,616 stores, compared to fewer than 2,000 for Target, around 2,200 for Home Depot and 2,750 for Kroger. Walmart also has a larger average square footage per store, too.', 'Walmart has a mix of grocery and general merchandise, which adds complexity to its trucking network.', 'As a result of its large, private fleet, Walmart has unusual clout among equipment manufacturers and other trucking service providers. It’s the type of status that’s usually reserved for companies that only do trucking.', '“Walmart’s mission is to save people money so they can live better,” the Walmart spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “Managing our own distribution and trucking networks helps us better serve our customer and manage costs.”', 'The importance of distribution is perhaps incredibly obvious. If stuff is not on the shelves, customers aren’t going to be buying that stuff. Customers would ultimately buy less during that visit and, if they get fed up by a consistent lack of stuff, eventually not at all. The stuff has to be moved safely and on time across the country. If paying top dollar makes that happen, then it’s sensible for Walmart to agree to do that.', '“They wanted to pay them good money because it was the absolute core of their, of their business — to get this stuff from the distribution center to the store at precisely the right time with no screw-ups,” Lichtenstein said. “That was crucial.”', 'Paying truck drivers top dollar also makes sense because Walmart doesn’t employ that many of them. The company has about 14,000 truck drivers and 1.6 million associates. Each of those truck drivers holds a lot of power over the shopping experience of a Walmart store.', '“One associate here or there can have a positive impact, but it’s not going to change the economics of the store,” Fishman said. “A truck driver is going to really matter. They have an outsized impact on the way the company runs.”', 'Paying six figures to 14,000 employees may seem reasonable enough for Walmart. “It’s not even 1% of their staff,” Fishman said.', 'Walmart is now changing its truck driver hiring policies. Until 2022, the company required 30 months of driver experience before one could be considered for the company driver role. That year, the company began piloting a program that allowed Walmart associates to go to a 12-week driver training program and become fleet drivers. Walmart expanded the program nationwide. (Outside applicants still need 30 months of training, and not every associate who applies is admitted to the program.)', '“We started the Associate-to-Driver program because we wanted to tap into our own talent pool of incredible associates and give them opportunity to develop their career,” the Walmart spokesperson said in a written statement. “It’s been a great opportunity for our associates to continue to grow their careers without having to leave the company.”', 'The spokesperson said the company requires all trainees to pass the same skills assessment as external hires. Then, they’re partnered with a mentor for six weeks of continued training.', 'It’s a sensible move for Walmart to train from within; its current CEO, Doug McMillon, started as an hourly associate. “I think it’s a recognition that [you value] your own employees better than somebody walking in off the street,” GIbson said.', 'Some Walmart drivers aren’t delighted.', 'The Texas-based Walmart truck driver, who joined the company two years ago, said the retailer could attract more drivers by raising its pay. “Raise the driver’s pay and you’ll retain and attract [experienced drivers],” he said.', 'Another Texas-based truck driver, who joined Walmart seven years ago, said he fears it’s a sign that Walmart is approaching trucking in the same way as large for-hire fleets, which see typical turnover rates around 94%.', '“Back in the day, you used to need a decade before you’re even looked at to get on with Walmart,” he said. (The driver asked not to have his name included as he is not authorized to speak on behalf of the company.)', 'Both complaints get at the heart of an ongoing debate in the trucking industry: the so-called truck driver shortage. Trucking employers maintain that they’re unable to hire drivers due to a persistent shortage — caused largely by demographic issues and the lifestyle of trucking. However, researchers (and truck drivers themselves) disagree. Studies suggest the massive turnover seen by large fleets keeps them scrambling to hire new workers; one March 2019 study published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics concluded that “price signals” would lead to a more stable trucking workforce.', 'A company, like Walmart, that pays six figures and offers good benefits should not struggle with turnover. On the other hand, Walmart needs to hire more drivers as the retailer expands operations and current truckers retire. Walmart has hired nearly 6,000 new drivers in the past five years.', 'From the perspective of these supply chain experts, it doesn’t seem like the associate-to-driver program is necessarily a way to cut costs. Gibson said Walmart has been “very aggressive” in recruiting drivers in recent years. It may have simply tapped out of the current supply of drivers.', '“I think this is just the latest in the evolution of the hiring process for Walmart,” Gibson said. “Going internal has been proven to be a good strategy by other organizations.”', 'What’s more, the associate-to-driver program could be a way to better mold the Walmart truck driver.', '“You take somebody who’s been with another company, they’ve developed habits, they’ve developed styles, they know certain systems –\xa0 for the good and the bad,” Gibson said. “If they’ve developed any bad habits over time, you can train your new drivers the way you want, the way you need on your systems and try to focus on the skills, capabilities and safety issues that are directly of importance to your organization.”', 'Fishman agreed. An associate-turned-driver might not bring years of trucking experience, but they certainly get Walmart.', '“It’s possible in this wave of hiring that [outside trucking hires] are diluting this Walmart culture,” Fishman said. “Truck drivers are famously independent.”', 'What do you think of Walmart’s trucking fleet?

Based on a survey conducted by PwC, grocery industry experts expect the market share of online grocery shopping to increase to between 35% and 50% in Germany, France, the UK, Turkey, and the Netherlands by 2050. Retailers that wish to keep or grow their current market share by becoming leading omni-channel players need to launch eGrocery offerings early to gain the necessary expertise. The research and survey responses underscore that online grocery retailing will progressively penetrate the traditional market in the coming decade. Although brick-and-mortar stores will retain a substantial market share, their revenue, and profitability will face erosion as consumers increasingly embrace the convenience of new digital services. While the complete transformation to an omni-channel model and the precise trajectory ahead remains uncertain, the early success of grocery retailers in the online space is indicating the direction forward.', ""As we progress into 2024, it's worth noting that specific grocery items have exhibited resilience amid economic challenges and seem poised for the coming quarters. The focus on expanding plant-based alternatives, particularly in the realm of meat substitutes, has benefited companies with a significant presence in consumers' shopping preferences. The period before this had been marked by inflation, leading to elevated input costs for manufacturers and affecting consumers' purchasing power, subsequently impacting companies' sales volumes. However, there are indications that the inflationary trend is now displaying signs of moderation."", 'That said, the uncertainty remains about whether consumers will increase spending in 2024 or adopt a more frugal approach. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) CEO Doug McMillon suggested to CNBC that high credit card balances and shrinking bank accounts might lead to reduced consumer spending, impacting grocery retailers. However, a potential bright spot in this uncertainty is the growing popularity of private label items.

With that, let me now turn it over to Steve."", ""Stephen Steinour: Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone and welcome. Thank you for joining the call today. We're pleased to announce our fourth quarter results, which Zach will detail later. These results are again supported by our colleagues across the bank, who live our purpose every day as we make people's lives better, help businesses thrive and strengthen the communities we serve. Now on to Slide 4. There are five key messages we want to leave you with today. First, we are leveraging our position of strength and executing on our strategic growth initiatives. We are well-positioned to benefit during times like these. We managed our capital levels to enable us to accelerate initiatives during 2023 and support continued growth."", 'We added key specialty verticals in Commercial Banking and expanded into the Carolinas. Second, we outperformed on both deposits and loans throughout the year. Our colleagues are acquiring new customers and deepening our existing customer relationships. Importantly, we delivered this growth, while effectively managing our deposit beta. Third, we expect to modestly expand net interest income as we manage the challenges of the interest rate cycle and are driving increased fee revenues. Fourth, we are rigorously managing credit across our portfolios, consistent with our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite. Credit trends are normalizing as expected, and we continue to believe we will outperform the industry on credit through the cycle. Finally, we remain intently focused on our core strategies.', 'Huntington remained resilient through the events of 2023, emerging as one of the strongest regional banks. We maintained our disciplined execution and we expect to grow earnings over the course of 2024 and continuing into 2025 and beyond. I will move us on to Slide 5 to recap our performance in 2023. Huntington delivered solid results over the course of the year against a challenging backdrop. While the banking sector faced headwinds early in the year, Huntington emerged as a secular winner, gaining new customers, adding over $3 billion of deposit growth and further bolstering our capital. We also increased loans by $2.5 billion for the full-year or 2%, while driving capital ratios higher. We expect the pace of loan growth to accelerate in 2024.', 'We added to our revenue base primarily as net interest income increased by 3.3% for the full-year. We maintained our leadership in customer satisfaction and digital capabilities, having again been awarded the number-one ranking by JD Power for both categories. We remained focused on executing our strategies, including growing consumer primary bank relationships by 3%. Additionally, we completed the realignment of business segments. We also delivered on efficiency initiatives, including Operation Accelerate, the voluntary retirement program, staffing efficiencies, business process offshoring and branch and other real estate consolidations. We were nimble and opportunistic, adding key talent this past year, with the addition of three new specialty commercial banking verticals.', ""We also expanded our commercial and regional bank into the Carolinas, adding experienced teams in these attractive and high-growth markets. Additionally, we further strengthened our balance sheet and drove capital ratios higher over the course of the year. We're getting ahead of proposed industry requirements. And finally, credit was managed exceptionally well with full-year net charge-offs of 23 basis points. Moving to Slide 6. Looking ahead to 2024, we have a clear set of objectives. We will leverage our position of strength to increase growth of both deposits and loans. This outlook will result in accelerated revenue growth and is further bolstered by fee opportunities. This posture, coupled with our dynamic balance sheet management and hedging programs is expected to benefit the revenue and profitability outlook for 2024 and further expand into 2025 and beyond."", 'This aligns with the improving macro backdrop, the higher probability of continued GDP growth and the avoidance of a hard landing. While we deliver this accelerated growth, we will continue to maintain our aggregate moderate-to-low-risk appetite. Zach, over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance.', 'Zach Wasserman: Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide 7 provides highlights of our fourth quarter results. We reported GAAP earnings per common share of $0.15 and adjusted EPS of $0.27. The quarter included $226 million of notable items, primarily related to the FDIC special assessment, which impacted EPS by $0.12 per common share. Additionally, the termination of the pay-fixed swaptions hedging program impacted pre-tax income by $74 million or $0.04 per share. Return on tangible common equity or ROTCE came in at 8.4% for the quarter. Adjusted for notable items, ROTCE was 15.1%. Average deposits continued their trend of growth into the fourth quarter, increasing by $1.5 billion or 1%. Cumulative deposit beta totaled 41% through year end.', 'Loan balances increased by $445 million, as we continue to optimize the pace of loan growth to drive the highest return on capital. Credit quality remained strong. The trend is normalizing, consistent with our expectations and net charge-offs totaled 31 basis points. Allowance for credit losses ended the quarter at 1.97%. Turning to Slide 8. As I noted, average loan balances increased quarter-over-quarter and were higher by 2% year-over-year. We expect the pace of future loan growth to accelerate over the course of 2024. Total commercial loans increased by $125 million for the quarter and included distribution finance, which increased by $225 million, benefited by normal seasonality as manufacturer shipments increased due to inventory build of winter products.', 'Auto Floorplan increased by $359 million and CRE balances, which declined by $361 million, including the impact of payoffs and normal amortization. And all other commercial categories net decreased as we continued to drive optimization toward the highest returns. In Consumer, growth was led by residential mortgage, which increased by $295 million and RV/Marine, which increased by $121 million, while auto loan balances declined for the quarter . Turning to Slide 9. As noted, we continued to gather deposits consistently in the fourth quarter. Average deposits increased by $1.5 billion or 1% from the prior quarter. Turning to Slide 10. Growth was maintained each month throughout the fourth quarter, continuing the recent trend. Total cumulative deposit beta ended the year at 41%, in-line with our expectations and reflecting the decelerating rate of change we would expect at this point in the rate cycle.', ""As we've noted in the past, where beta ultimately tops out, will be a function of the end game for the rate cycle in terms of the level and timing of the peak and the duration of any extended pause before a decrease. Given market expectations for rate cuts to start sometime in 2024, our current outlook for deposit beta remains unchanged, trending a few percentage points higher and then beginning to revert and fall if and when we see rate cuts from the Fed. When interest rate cuts commence, we expect to manage betas on the way down with the same discipline as we have during the increasing rate cycle. Turning to Slide 11. Non-interest bearing mix-shift continues to track closely to our forecast with deceleration of sequential changes. The non-interest bearing percentage decreased by 80 basis points from the third quarter, and we continue to expect this mix-shift to moderate and stabilized during 2024."", 'On to Slide 12. For the quarter, net interest income decreased by $52 million or 3.8% to $1.327 billion. Net interest margin declined sequentially to 3.07%, in-line with our forecast. Cumulatively over the cycle, we have benefited from our asset sensitivity and the expansion of margins with net interest revenues growing at an 8% CAGR over the past two years. Reconciling the change in NIM from Q3, we saw a decrease of 13 basis points. This was primarily due to lower spread, net of refunds, which accounted for 9 basis points, along with a 2 basis point negative impact from lower FHLB stock dividends and a 2 basis point reduction from hedging. Turning to Slide 13, let me share a few added thoughts around the fixed-rate loan repricing opportunity that will benefit us over the moderate term.', 'The construct of our balance sheet is approximately half fully variable rate, 10% in indirect auto, which is a shorter approximately two-year average life, and 10% in ARMs with a four-year average life. The remainder of approximately 30% is longer average life fixed-rate. We have seen notable increases in fixed asset portfolio yields thus far in the rate cycle. Even as the forward curve forecast lower short-term rates, many of our fixed-rate loan portfolios retained substantial upside repricing opportunity for some time to come. We forecast approximately $13 billion to $15 billion of fixed-rate loan repricing opportunity in 2024, with an estimated yield benefit of approximately 350 basis points. Slide 14 provides the drivers of our spread revenue growth.', ""As a reminder, we continue to analyze and develop action plans for a wide range of potential economic and interest rate scenarios. The basis of our planning and guidance continues to be a central set of those scenarios that is bounded on the lower end by a scenario which includes five rate cuts in 2024. The higher scenario assumes rates stay higher for longer and tracks closely with the Fed's dot plot from year end. This scenario assumes three cuts in 2024. We continue to be focused on managing net interest margin in a tighter corridor. Should the lower rate scenario play out and we see rate cuts as early as March, that will likely result in a margin over the course of the year within a range near the level we saw in the fourth quarter. This would equate to a net interest margin between 3% and 3.1% for each quarter of 2024."", 'If the higher for longer scenario comes to pass, we expect the margin to expand and at a level that is up to 10 basis points above that. As we saw in December, the outlook for longer-term interest rates also moved lower significantly. There were a number of benefits from this lower market rate outlook. First, it resulted in higher capital levels given AOCI accretion, which supports our accelerated loan growth outlook now. Second, it provides for easing deposit competition over time. Third, it provides credit support for borrowers with the potential for locking in lower long-term rates. However, the rate outlook is incrementally more challenging for full-year spread revenue than the levels we had seen underlying our guidance in December. Net of these items, including the forecasted pace of loan growth, we now expect net interest income on a dollar basis to trough in the first quarter before expanding sequentially from that level over the course of the year.', ""Turning to Slide 15, our contingent and available liquidity continues to be robust at $93 billion and has grown quarter-over-quarter. At quarter end, we continue to benefit from a diverse and highly granular deposit base with 70% insured deposits. Our pool of available liquidity represented 206% of total uninsured deposits, a peer-leading coverage. Turning to Slide 16, our level of cash and securities at year end increased as we've begun to reinvest portfolio cash flows during the fourth quarter. This investment strategy is consistent with our approach to continue to manage the unhedged duration of the portfolio lower over-time. We have reduced overall hedge duration of the portfolio from 4.1 years to 3.7 years over the past 18 months. Turning to Slide 17, we've updated our forecast for the recapture of AOCI."", ""As of year-end, we've recaptured 26% of total AOCI from the peak level at September 30th. Using market rates at year end, we would recapture an estimated incremental 44% of AOCI over the next three years. Turning to Slide 18, we continue to be dynamic in positioning our hedging program. As the rate outlooks changed over the course of the fourth quarter, we focused our objective incrementally on the protection of NIM in down rate scenarios and actively reduced instruments that were intended to protect capital in up rate scenarios. As we announced in late December, we terminated the pay-fixed swaptions program as our assessment of the probability for substantial upgrade moves decreased. Over the course of Q2 through Q4, this program worked as intended, providing significant protection against possible tail risk up-rate moves with a modest overall cost for that insurance."", ""Additionally, during the quarter, we added to our down rate NIM protection strategies, adding $2.1 billion of forward-starting received fixed swaps and adding $1 billion of floor spreads. We exited $2 billion of Collars, which were near expiration. Our objective with respect to our down rate hedging activities remains unchanged, to support the management of net interest margin and as tighter range as possible. Moving on to Slide 19, our fee growth strategies remain centered on three key areas: capital markets, payments and wealth management. Note, this quarter in our earnings materials, we've updated the presentation of our non-interest income categories in order to more clearly highlight our strategic areas of focus and more closely align to the way we manage the business."", ""Slide 35 in the appendix provides further detail on the components of each line item. These three key focus areas for fee growth collectively represent 63% of total non-interest income. We're seeing positive underlying growth in each of these areas. In capital markets, we're pleased that revenues expanded sequentially, both advisory and core banking capital market products grew in the quarter. Our outlook is constructive for 2024 and we expect capital markets to remain a key driver for-fee revenue growth over the medium-term. Payments and cash management revenue includes debit and credit card revenues along with treasury management and merchant processing. Our payments opportunity is substantial, reflecting 31% of total fee revenues today, with the potential for significant growth over-time."", 'Wealth and asset management revenue has benefited from the realignment earlier this year, which brought together our private bank and retail advisory businesses under one umbrella. Our advisory penetration rate of the customer base continues to increase as wealth advisory households have grown 11% year-over-year and assets under management are up 16% from a year-ago. Moving on to Slide 20. On an overall level, GAAP non-interest income decreased $104 million to $405 million for the fourth quarter. Excluding the mark-to-market on the pay-fixed swaptions and the CRT premium, fees increased by $5 million quarter-over-quarter. Moving on to Slide 21 on expenses. GAAP noninterest expense increased by $258 million and underlying core expenses increased by $47 million.', ""As I mentioned, we incurred $226 million of notable item expenses related primarily to the FDIC deposit insurance fund special assessment during the quarter. It also included the last portion of costs related to our staffing efficiency program in corporate real estate consolidations. Excluding these items, core expense included higher personnel and professional services, driven by seasonally higher benefits expense, incentives, as well as consulting expenses. The level of expenses we saw in the fourth quarter is largely consistent with the dollar amount we expect quarterly over the course of 2024. This is inclusive of the investments we've discussed previously, as well as sustained efficiencies we are driving across the company. Slide 22 recaps our capital position."", 'Reported common equity Tier 1 increased to 10.3% and has increased sequentially for five quarters. Our adjusted CET1 ratio, inclusive of AOCI was 8.6%. This metric increased 58 basis points compared to the prior quarter, driven by adjusted earnings net of dividends as well as the benefit from the credit risk transfer transaction we announced in December, which more than offset the impact from the FDIC special assessment. We also saw a significant benefit from AOCI recapture given the move in rates during the quarter. Our capital management strategy remains focused on driving capital ratios higher, while maintaining our top priority to fund high return loan growth. We intend to drive adjusted CET1 inclusive of AOCI into our operating range of 9% to 10%.', 'On Slide 23, credit quality continues to perform very well and with normalization of metrics consistent with our expectations. Net charge-offs were 31 basis points for the quarter. This was higher than Q3 by 7 basis points and resulted in full-year net charge-offs of 23 basis points. This outcome was aligned with our outlook for full-year net charge-offs between 20 and 30 basis points at the low-end of our target through-the-cycle range for net charge-offs of 25 basis points to 45 basis points. Gross charge-offs in the fourth quarter were relatively flat with the overall change in net charge-offs largely result of lower recoveries. Given ongoing normalization, non-performing assets increased from the previous quarter, while remaining below the prior 2021 level.', ""The criticized asset ratio increased quarter-over-quarter with risk rating changes within commercial real estate being the largest component. Allowance for credit losses was higher by 1 basis point to 1.97% of total loans. And our ACL coverage ratio continues to be among the top-quartile in the peer group. Let's turn to our outlook for 2024. As we mentioned, we expect to drive accelerated loan growth between 3% and 5% for the full-year. Deposits are likewise expected to continue their solid trend of growth between 2% and 4%. As a result of the loan growth and margin outlook I shared earlier, net interest income for the full-year is expected to range between down 2% to up 2%. The pace of loan growth coupled with the rate scenario we see actually play out, will drive the range of spread revenue."", 'If the higher for longer rate scenario plays out and loan growth tracks to the top-end of our range, we expect net interest income to grow by approximately 2%. If the lower scenario comes to fruition and loan growth tracks to the lower end of our growth range, we could see spread revenue declining 2 percentage points. In both scenarios, I expect net interest income to trough in the first quarter before expanding throughout 2024 from that level. Non-interest income on a core underlying basis is expected to increase between 5% and 7%. The baseline of core excludes notable items, the mark-to-market impact from the pay-fixed swaption program as well as CRT impacts. Fee revenue growth is expected to be driven primarily by capital markets, payments and wealth management.', ""Core expenses are expected to increase by 4.5%, this level reflects the finalization of our budget and includes the additional loan growth we discussed earlier, which will have some incremental compensation expense tied to production. Expenses could fluctuate depending on the level of revenue-driven compensation, primarily associated with our fee-based revenues, including capital markets. The tax-rate is expected to be approximately 19% for the full-year. We expect net charge-offs for the full-year to be between 25 basis points and 35 basis points. With that, we'll conclude our prepared remarks and move to questions-and-answers. Tim, over to you."", 'Tim Sedabres: Thanks, Zach. Operator we will now take questions. We ask that as a courtesy to your peers, each person ask only one question and one related follow-up.

Outfitted with a new Core Independent Peripheral (CIP)—the Configurable Logic Block (CLB) module—the MCUs enable the creation of hardware-based, custom combinational logic functions directly within the MCU. Because of its integration into the MCU, the CLB allows designers to optimize the speed and response time of embedded control systems, eliminating the need for external logic components and reducing Bill of Materials (BOM) cost and power consumption. The process is further simplified by a graphical interface tool, which helps synthesize custom logic designs using the CLB. The PIC16F13145 family is designed for applications utilizing custom protocols, task sequencing or I/O control to manage real-time control systems in the industrial and automotive sectors.', '“The Configurable Logic Cell (CLC) Module has been integrated into Microchip MCUs for more than a decade and the new CLB module is the next step in the evolution of our customizable logic offering, enabling this family of MCUs to be utilized in applications that are typically the domain of standalone programmable logic devices,” said Greg Robinson, vice president of Microchip’s 8-bit microcontroller business unit. “Few single-chip solutions in today’s market address embedded engineers’ design challenges like the PIC16F131 MCU family. The new MCUs handle custom logic functions, minimize power consumption, simplify designs and can accommodate changing design requirements.”', 'Since the CLB’s operation is not dependent on the CPU clock speed, it improves the system’s latency and provides a low-power solution. The CLB can be used to make logical decisions while the CPU is in sleep mode, further reducing power consumption and software reliance. The PIC16F13145 MCUs also include a fast 10-bit Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) with built-in computation, an 8-bit Digital-to-Analog (DAC) converter, fast comparators, 8- and 16-bit timers and serial communication modules (I2C and SPI) to allow many system-level tasks to be performed without the CPU. The family will be available in various packages from 8 pins up to 20 pins.', 'Development ToolsThe PIC16F13145 family of MCUs is supported by the MPLAB® Code Configurator (MCC), a free software plug-in within MPLAB X IDE which provides an easy GUI-based interface to configure the device and on-board peripherals, including the CLB. This interface reduces development time as the desired custom logic can be designed schematically with options for an advanced user to utilize Hardware Description Language (HDL). The new synthesizer is available in two options: integrated into MCC and online at logic.microchip.com. The PIC16F131 Curiosity Nano Evaluation Kit offers complete support for designing with the PIC16F131 family and these features coordinate for a seamless embedded development experience and reduced time to market.', 'Pricing and AvailabilityPIC16F131 MCUs are available starting at $.47 each in 10,000-unit quantities. For additional information and to purchase, contact a Microchip sales representative, authorized worldwide distributor or visit Microchip’s Purchasing and Client Services website, www.microchipdirect.com.', 'ResourcesHigh-res images available through Flickr or editorial contact (feel free to publish):', 'Application image: https://www.flickr.com/photos/microchiptechnology/53451201638/sizes/l/', 'Block diagram: https://www.flickr.com/photos/microchiptechnology/53450157287/sizes/o/', 'Tool photo: https://www.flickr.com/photos/microchiptechnology/53451411614/sizes/l/', 'About Microchip Technology:Microchip Technology Inc. is a leading provider of smart, connected and secure embedded control solutions.

Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.', 'Below, we take a look at Gartner (IT), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B.

Over the past quarter, shares of Gartner have risen 41.96%, and are up 40.56% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 15.25% and 23.87%, respectively.', ""Investors should also pay attention to IT's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. IT is currently averaging 365,904 shares for the last 20 days."", 'Earnings Outlook', ""The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with IT."", ""Over the past two months, 2 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost IT's consensus estimate, increasing from $11.06 to $11.07 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period."", 'Bottom Line', ""Given these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that IT is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B.

Following the 2022 bear market, the benchmark S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite screamed higher by 24% and 43%, respectively, while the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed to a record high.', 'Despite these sizable gains, a fresh high still eludes the Nasdaq Composite, while the small-cap-driven Russell 2000 remains nearly 18% below its all-time high set in the latter-half of 2021. In other words, bargains can still be found for investors willing to seek them out.', ""What's great about putting your money to work on Wall Street is that online brokers have steadily torn down barriers for everyday investors. Most online brokerages have eliminated minimum deposit requirements and commission fees for common stock trades on major U.S. exchanges. This means any amount of money -- even $300 -- can be the ideal amount to put to work."", ""If you have $300 to invest, and you're absolutely certain this isn't cash you'll need to pay bills or to cover emergency expenses, the following three stocks stand out as no-brainer buys right now."", 'The first magnificent stock to add to your portfolio with $300 is none other than premier retail real estate investment trust (REIT), Realty Income (NYSE: O). Realty Income sports a 5.4% yield, doles out its distribution on a monthly basis, and has raised its payout 123 times since becoming a publicly listed company in 1994.', ""All stocks face headwinds, and Realty Income is no exception. With the Fed set to begin cutting interest rates in 2024, which'll make REITs more attractive from a yield perspective, Realty Income's clearest headwind is the growing possibility of a U.S. recession. A couple of money-based metrics and recession indicators suggest a downturn is likely in the new year. Economic contractions may make it tougher for Realty Income to collect rental income on time, as well as raise rates on lease renewals."", ""But let me be clear: Realty Income isn't your run-of-the-mill retail REIT. It's the retail REIT other companies envy."", 'One of the big keys to Realty Income\'s ongoing success is the composition of its commercial real estate (CRE) portfolio. The company estimates that greater than 90% of total rent collection is ""resilient to economic downturns."" Dig a bit deeper and you\'ll find that more than a third of the company\'s annualized contractual rent derives from grocery stores, convenience stores, dollar stores, and drug stores. These are businesses that consumers will visit in any economic climate, which substantially lessens the concerns about rental delinquencies from its tenants.', ""To build on this point, Realty Income aims to increase its adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) through diversification. It completed two deals over the past two years in the gaming industry, and at the time of this writing is expected to close on its $9.3 billion all-share acquisition of Spirit Realty Capital on January 23. Aside from being immediately accretive to AFFO, Spirit's CRE assets will further diversify Realty Income's portfolio."", ""Did I mention that Realty Income is also historically inexpensive? Shares are currently valued at a shade over 13 times Wall Street's consensus cash flow estimate for 2024. This represents its lowest multiple to cash flow in more than a decade."", ""A second no-brainer stock to buy with $300 right now is a company that's collectively disliked by Wall Street analysts. I'm talking about pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA)."", ""Whereas investors really have to do some digging to find Realty Income's headwinds, Walgreens' stock chart makes it clear the company has been contending with some challenges. Growing online competition in the pharmacy space, coupled with a recent (but expected) dividend cut, has made Walgreens Boots Alliance akin to Wall Street's chopped liver. But it's not all bad news for this once high-flying healthcare stock."", ""The biggest catalyst for Walgreens in 2024 (and beyond) is the recent hiring of Tim Wentworth as CEO. Before becoming CEO of Walgreens, Wentworth headed Evernorth, Cigna Group's health services platform. He was the CEO of Express Scripts, as well, which was acquired by Cigna in 2018. The key point being that Walgreens purposefully brought in a CEO with healthcare experience, which is something it was sorely lacking with its previous CEO, Rosalind Brewer."", ""Walgreens is also currently in the midst of implementing a multipoint turnaround plan designed to reduce its expenses, broaden its margins, and improve customer loyalty. What I'd argue is most important about Walgreens' turnaround efforts is the company's shift into healthcare services."", ""For far too long, Walgreens relied on horizontal expansion. This is to say that it kept adding to its network of brick-and-mortar locations to reach new consumers. The company's new vertical approach will help to expand its margins and is likely to be beneficial with regard to customer loyalty."", ""Walgreens and VillageMD -- Walgreens is a majority investor in VillageMD -- intend to open 1,000 full-service, physician-staffed health clinics co-located in Walgreens' stores in 30 major U.S. markets by 2027. Being physician-staffed means these clinics can treat far more patients and ailments than the healthcare clinics found at most pharmacy chains."", 'The valuation makes sense, too. Despite aforementioned challenges, Walgreens Boots Alliance stock can be scooped up right now for a little over 6 times forward-year consensus earnings per share. Not only does this represents its lowest forward-year earnings multiple in at least a decade, but patient investors will enjoy a 4.5% annual yield to boot.', 'The third no-brainer stock to buy with $300 right now is cybersecurity company Okta (NASDAQ: OKTA).', ""While most cybersecurity stocks have soared of late, Okta hasn't enjoyed nearly as much success. That's because the company admitted in November that hackers gained access to data on all of its customers from late September through mid-October. It's not uncommon for cybersecurity companies to lose out on near-term revenue in the immediate aftermath of a security breach."", ""While breaches aren't ideal, they're not a long-term game changer for Okta or its sustained double-digit growth potential."", ""Okta aims to be the premier name in identity verification solutions. The company's platform is cloud-native and leans heavily on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to grow more effective at spotting and responding to potential threats over time. Though it's clear there's more learning to be done by Okta's AI solutions, the company's cloud-native platform has a clear long-term advantage over on-premises security solutions."", ""In November 2022, Okta estimated the identify verification market to be an $80 billion addressable opportunity. With sales expected to reach $2.24 billion in fiscal 2024 (the company's fiscal year ends on Jan. 31, 2024), it's evident that Okta's growth runway is just getting started."", 'The acquisition of Auth0, which closed in February 2022, should also be a key growth driver for the company. Despite higher-than-expected integration costs, Auth0 provides Okta with a way to gain share in the $30 billion Customer Identity market. Further, Auth0 should help Okta expand into international markets, which is sorely needed to sustain a double-digit growth rate.', ""Lastly, don't overlook that cybersecurity has evolved into a basic necessity service. Any business that has an online or cloud-based presence needs to protect their data and that of their customers from attacks by hackers. Protecting access to data is increasingly falling to third-party providers like Okta, which should lead to highly predictable operating cash flow from one year to the next."", ""Although Okta's forward-year earnings multiple of 42 might look lofty, expected annualized earnings growth of 25% over the coming five years means it's cheaper than most investors probably realize."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Realty Income wasn't one of them.

The company noted that while it continues to employ research and development personnel in Russia as well as limited post-sales support and administrative personnel, its total number of employees in Russia was materially reduced in 2022.', 'Further, Align Technology anticipates increasing headwinds from macroeconomic uncertainty and potential supply issues related to the war in the Middle East in the upcoming period.

The company estimates that there are approximately 500 million people globally with malocclusion.

The company introduced DSP in the United States and Canada in 2021 and expanded it to Spain and the Nordic countries in the second quarter of 2023.', 'Further, Align Technology has plans to launch DSP in France and the United Kingdom in the second half of 2023.

Sure, there are still tech stocks for that investing class, but there are also plenty of profitable, blue-chip tech dividend stocks to consider as well."", 'Here are five technology stocks with the necessary ingredients to provide double-digit dividend growth for the foreseeable future. Consider buying and holding these in your diversified portfolio.', ""Technology entered a new era when the internet was born, and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has ridden that growth, blossoming into a tech juggernaut and one of the world's largest corporations. Its reach spans software, hardware, cloud, gaming, and other businesses that generate over $60 billion in annual cash flow."", ""The company has already shown a commitment to sharing its profits with investors. It's paid and raised its dividend for 21 consecutive years."", ""The company's decades of growth have kept the dividend payout ratio under control at 32% of cash flow despite giving shareholders routine double-digit increases. Microsoft has deep roots throughout the technology space, including artificial intelligence. Therefore, investors can confidently hold the stock without losing sleep at night."", 'Artificial intelligence could grow for many years, which makes ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) a stock investors need to know about. The manufacturer dominates the market for extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines, which are crucial for making advanced semiconductors that provide critical computing power for AI models. In other words, if AI is a gold rush, ASML sells the proprietary tools to get the gold.', ""ASML is a European company that doesn't pay dividends as steadily as many American corporations. You can see above that the dividends ASML pays are volatile. They'll go up and down, but ASML will fill your pockets with cash over time. The dividend payout ratio is a modest 43%, and healthy long-term semiconductor demand due to AI and other technologies bodes well for ASML's shareholders to see dividend growth going forward."", ""Companies often don't pay dividends until their business matures, which means financial software company Intuit (NASDAQ: INTU) could be getting warmed up for massive dividend growth. The company has raised its payout for 12 consecutive years, and its 21% payout ratio and mid-teens growth rate signal many more increases ahead."", 'Intuit owns software products like TurboTax, MailChimp, Quickbooks, and CreditKarma, so the business should continue raking in profits as long as people pay taxes, have credit scores in need of monitoring, or track their business expenses -- and people will probably do these things forever! That has Intuit looking like an upcoming dividend superstar.', ""Data analytics company Moody's (NYSE: MCO) is another business that will probably be around for a very long time. After all, does anyone expect corporations and governments to stop borrowing money anytime soon? Moody's is one of the primary authorities in the corporate credit space, issuing ratings on debt, along with its peer, S&P Global. Moody's also sells software and tools for economic research."", ""Moody's authoritative reputation separates it from competitors and creates a durable business poised for solid dividend growth. As of today, the company has raised its dividend for 12 consecutive years. And a 31% payout ratio means that there's much more where that came from. Warren Buffett has owned Moody's via Berkshire Hathaway for nearly a quarter century, a vote of confidence for investors."", ""Quick, open your wallet. You'll probably find a debit or credit card with Visa's (NYSE: V) logo. Visa is the leading payment network in America, and potentially worldwide. Whenever you swipe a payment card, information flows on Visa's network between your bank and the merchant to verify funds, authorize the transaction, and move the money.

As of today, the company's sporting a 15-year streak of consecutive increases, and Visa's financials make it easy to see that streak doubling or tripling from here. The starting yield is only 0.77%, but such big raises will multiply your dividend payments over a decade or two."", ""The recurring theme with these companies is that they dominate what they do. That means competition can't easily knock them down, and they have enough growth and pricing power to grow cash flow year in and year out."", ""Remember, dividends are cash expenses for the company, so if you find a company that can organically grow and share increasingly significant amounts of those profits with you -- well congrats, you've got yourself a true wealth-compounding machine."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

As an investor, you can snag a piece of the action in these businesses and benefit from their growth trajectory through the decades.', ""Investors don't need to have a huge wad of cash to start buying great stocks, either. Even if it's a few hundred dollars a month, steadily putting cash into stocks and consistently growing their positions can help investors generate meaningful returns over time."", 'Here are two such super stocks that disappointed investors in five years will look back on and wish they had bought shares in.', 'Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) continues to strengthen its foothold in the rare disease treatment industry with a robust lineup of drugs as well as a promising pipeline that could dominate multiple underserved markets. The company already has a chokehold on the cystic fibrosis treatment space, a market set to reach a valuation of $37 billion by 2030, according to some analyst estimates.', ""The reason for Vertex's dominance in this space is very simple: The company is the only one that has approved drugs on the market that treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis. It has four drugs that serve this function, which brought in combined revenue of $8.9 billion in 2022, $7.6 billion in 2021, and $6.2 billion in 2020. These four drugs have also enabled Vertex to grow its annual profits by more than 40% in the trailing three-year period alone."", ""The expansion of its drugs' use cases to younger and younger cohorts of patients has opened up Vertex's opportunity within the vast addressable market for cystic fibrosis treatments. The company is developing a cystic fibrosis drug with Moderna that's designed specifically for patients who can't take drugs in its existing lineup, a cohort of individuals that management currently numbers at around 5,000."", 'Vertex is also working on stem cell therapies for diabetes, a non-opioid drug for acute pain ailments that could disrupt the existing pain management market, and a drug for patients with the genetic illness APOL1-mediated kidney disease, which if it gets the regulatory green light, would be the first drug approved to treat the underlying cause of this disease. The biggest news that investors should be following with this stock right now, though, is the ongoing approvals for Casgevy, the gene-editing therapy it developed with CRISPR Therapeutics.', ""Casgevy was recently approved in the U.S. and the U.K. for transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (TDT) and sickle cell disease (SCD), and approvals are ongoing in other key markets. The European Union's regulatory decision for Casgevy is expected in the coming months. Both TDT and SCD are potentially deadly diseases for which the pre-existing care standard has been a range of ongoing treatments including regular blood transfusions. Casgevy poses a functional cure for both TDT and SCD, so the market opportunity here is extensive."", 'The rollout of this drug will be a gradual process, and Vertex is working with hospitals to establish authorized treatment centers where qualifying patients can receive these therapies. Moreover, because Casgevy is a gene-editing therapy, the process for each patient receiving the treatment is highly intensive. The patient has stem cells taken from them, edited, and infused back, while also undergoing chemotherapy to condition the cells for the infusion. Then comes a lengthy recovery process.', ""Casgevy is approved in the U.S. as a one-time therapy for patients 12 and up who either have TDT and require habitual blood transfusions or have SCD that causes them regular vaso-occlusive crises, which is a common and painful complication that SCD patients experience when the sickled cells obstruct blood flow. Under the Food and Drug Administration's approval, this means that 1,000 patients are eligible for this treatment at the time of this writing."", ""Still, this is only the beginning of the potential market opportunity for this drug. There are over 100,000 patients with SCD in the U.S. alone. And the drug is going to run with a target cost of $2.2 million per patient. Vertex Pharmaceuticals has a lot of room to run in the rare disease drug market. Investors who want to follow the stock's journey in the years ahead may want to consider putting some cash to work in this promising profit powerhouse of a healthcare business."", 'Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has been a mainstay in the tech industry for nearly five decades. The company has proven its ability to continuously innovate and refine its offerings through the years while remaining true to its core lineup of businesses. Even as the company has invested billions of dollars into artificial intelligence (AI), and is infusing this technology into virtually every corner of its business, it still rakes in eye-popping revenue and profits from some of its oldest products.', 'The company has an incredibly well-diversified business that spans tools and solutions including productivity software, cloud computing services; operating systems; computer, gaming, and mobile hardware; and gaming platforms. This extensive lineup of digital and physical products and services raked in a mouth-watering $57 billion in revenue in the most recent quarter, a 13% hike from the same period in the prior year.', ""Microsoft's operating income for the quarter totaled $27 billion, while net income came in at $22 billion. These two quarterly figures represented respective increases of 25% and 27% on a year-over-year basis. The company also had a staggering $144 billion in cash and investments on its balance sheet at the end of the quarter."", ""Microsoft Cloud revenue was a major driver of this growth, with sales totaling $32 billion, a 24% hike from the year-ago period. Broken down by segment, revenue from Microsoft's productivity and business processes segment, which includes products and services like Office and LinkedIn, and its intelligent cloud segment, which includes server products and Azure, clocked revenue increases of 13% and 19%, respectively, from one year ago."", ""Perhaps a lesser-known side of Microsoft for some investors is its advertising business. The company's revenue from search and news advertising, which features properties like Microsoft Edge, Microsoft News, and Bing, rose 10% year over year in the most recent quarter. Bear in mind, Microsoft's advertising business brought in $12 billion in revenue in 2023, and the company was chosen as the exclusive tech and sales partner for Netflix's newly launched ad-supported tier."", 'Meanwhile, Microsoft continues to incorporate AI into everything from its productivity software to its Bing search engine (which features certain ChatGPT tools) to LinkedIn to newly launched products. The company recently introduced an AI assistant called Copilot that integrates with software like Teams, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, along with its search engines Edge and Bing, and it is already being used by 40% of the Fortune 100 through an early access program.', ""The company's AI-powered cybersecurity solution, Security Copilot, is currently being used by entities like Fidelity National Financial, Bridgewater, and the government of Alberta, Canada, in an early launch as part of its enterprise defense suite Microsoft Defender. Then there's LinkedIn, which has just shy of 1 billion members worldwide and is now leveraging generative AI technology like AI-assisted messages for recruiters."", ""When it comes to finding great stocks that can stand the test of time and build wealth in your portfolio, you don't always have to look for the newest and shiniest toy.

Technology offers the highest ROIC of the 11 US equity sectors: around 20% over the last 12 months (compared with around 3–4% for utilities or real estate). Tech sector balance sheets are also the strongest, with an average net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of just 0.5x. With business models that combine subscription-based revenue streams with a presence in high-growth segments including artificial intelligence, we think tech companies look poised to deliver healthy earnings growth next year. Stocks have already rallied hard in anticipation of higher AI demand, yet we think companies across the AI value chain— from cloud to semis, software, and internet—have further to run, both in 2024 and over the longer term.

However, this stage of risk management best manifests itself in down markets as it did in 2022. This year has been quite different since equities have broadly recovered, and our risk management focus has shifted toward establishing a level of permanence. We characterize this phase of risk management as Value Capture. Essentially, we have harvested disproportionate equity outcomes (Nvidia)and other strong performers (Passport holdings such as CrowdStrike) to fund a ~700bps increase in our India weighting (Makemytrip, Apollo Healthcare), a 235bps investment in Coca Cola (in correlation terms the real thing), and even a 114bps position in Alibaba (6.6X consensus 2023 EPS at purchase). These investments are not risk free, but they are stores of value that have the potential to enhance diversification and staying power in any market reversal. Moreover, we have marginally reduced portfolio concentration over the course of the year. Essentially, 2022 was a moment of extremely low reinvestment risk that allowed us to deemphasize China and other holdings, while concentrating around a handful of financially and strategically sound investments such as Nvidia, MercadoLibre, Airbnb and CrowdStrike.With these investments having largely reflated, we have sought to redistribute some of this capital while retaining significant residual positions.

Its growth was largely driven by the expansion of the artificial intelligence (AI) market, which prompted more companies to install its high-end GPUs in their data centers."", ""Nvidia generated 80% of its revenue from its data center chips in its latest quarter, while its gaming business -- its original growth engine prior to the AI boom -- only brought in 16% of its revenue. The bulls believe Nvidia's data center business will continue growing as companies develop more advanced generative AI platforms and large language models, and that its GPUs will remain the industry standard for processing those complicated tasks."", ""Nvidia's current list of customers supports that bullish view. ChatGPT's creator OpenAI, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google, Amazon, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and other tech giants all use its chips to power their AI services. But over the long term, other chipmakers could loosen Nvidia's iron grip on the AI market. Let's take a closer look at the three most likely challengers."", ""Nvidia's GPUs usually work alongside Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) high-end Xeon CPUs in data centers to accelerate machine learning and AI tasks. For Intel, which still controls about 94% of the server CPU market, Nvidia's expansion into the data center market is an unwelcome intrusion which implies its CPUs can't efficiently handle AI tasks on their own."", 'CPUs still process one piece of data at a time, while GPUs process a large array of integers and floating point numbers simultaneously -- which makes them better suited for graphics and AI applications. To close that gap, Intel launched its own line of Xe GPUs in September 2020, and its Xe-HP (High Performance) and Xe-HPC (High Performance Compute) directly target Nvidia\'s data center GPUs. It followed that up with the rollout of its new ""Max"" data center GPUs last year.', ""In an unusual departure from its first-party foundry model, Intel outsources the production of its GPUs to its rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing -- which also manufactures Nvidia's high-end GPUs. Those chips haven't gained much momentum yet, but Intel's ongoing expansion of that business -- and its ability to bundle its GPUs with its Xeon CPUs -- might eventually hurt Nvidia."", ""Nvidia's expansion into the data center market gave it an edge against Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), which controls a much smaller slice of the discrete GPU market. However, AMD has been fighting back with its new Instinct data center chips for AI tasks."", ""It launched its first three Instinct GPUs (the MI6, MI8, and MI25) in 2017, which were followed by additional 7-nanometer and 6nm MI chips over the following four years. It launched its latest MI300 Instinct chips, which were built on TSMC's 5nm and 6nm nodes, last December. In the latest benchmarks, AMD's top-tier MI300X beats Nvidia's H100 in terms of processing power and memory bandwidth, but Nvidia claims the H100 still outperforms the MI300X when it's running on optimized software."", ""AMD's AI ambitions could cause problems for Nvidia, especially if it continues its tradition of selling its chips at lower prices. Companies like Microsoft, Meta, Oracle, Dell, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise are already testing or running Instinct GPUs -- and that customer list could grow longer as cost-conscious data center operators shop around for the best deals."", ""Last but not least, Nvidia's dominance of the data center GPU market is driving many of its top customers -- including OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta -- to develop their own AI accelerator chips. It could take years for those projects to bear fruit, but the development of those chips raises red flags for Nvidia's long-term growth."", 'Last year, Google published a research paper that suggested its own fourth-generation TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) were faster and more efficient than Nvidia\'s A100 chips. Meta also recently poached an entire research team from Graphcore, the AI start-up that claims its ""graph processing"" method can process AI tasks more efficiently than Nvidia\'s GPUs.', ""These tech giants are still buying a lot of Nvidia's A100 GPUs to process their AI tasks, but they could gradually replace those chips with their first-party silicon to cut costs. If that happens, Nvidia's biggest growth engine could sputter out."", ""Nvidia's future looks bright, but investors should expect it to face some unpredictable challenges over the next few years. Intel, AMD, and first-party chips won't throttle its growth anytime soon, but they could eventually evolve into major threats. Simply put, investors shouldn't assume Nvidia is an invincible leader of the AI market."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

The chatbot highlighted how far AI has come, with the potential to advance countless industries, including cloud computing, e-commerce, consumer products, healthcare, education, autonomous driving, and more."", ""In fact, according to data from Grand View Research, the AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% until at least 2030. The market's trajectory would see it exceed a value of $1 trillion before the decade's end. As a result, it's not surprising that numerous AI stocks have soared over the last year."", ""For instance, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) shares have climbed 69% since last January, rallying Wall Street with its 49% stake in OpenAI. The partnership has granted Microsoft access to some of the industry's most advanced AI models, suggesting the Windows company has significant potential in the sector."", 'However, AI is expanding quickly, presenting dozens of other attractive ways to invest in the industry. Some of these options could have more growth potential than Microsoft, or offer more value.', 'So forget Microsoft in 2024. Here are two AI stocks to buy instead.', ""Whether you're a casual investor or trade professionally, you're probably aware of Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) meteoric rise last year. Its stock soared 239% in 2023 as the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) became the gold standard for AI developers worldwide."", 'As interest in AI soared, so did demand for GPUs, and Nvidia was perfectly positioned to supply its hardware to the entire market. The company achieved an estimated 90% market share in AI chips alongside soaring earnings.', ""In the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended October 2023), Nvidia's revenue rose 206% year over year as operating income increased 1,600%. The company profited from a spike in AI GPU sales, represented by a 279% rise in data center revenue."", 'Nvidia has a powerful position in AI. Competition in the software side of the industry is heating up, with companies like Microsoft and Amazon facing off over leadership in AI cloud services. However, increased competition only means more chip customers for Nvidia, with the company likely to flourish for years.', ""This chart shows that over the next two fiscal years, Nvidia's earnings could hit $24 per share, while Microsoft's may achieve about $15 per share. Multiplying these figures by each company's forward price-to-earnings ratio (Nvidia's 48 and Microsoft's 35) yields stock prices of $1,152 for Nvidia and $525 for Microsoft."", ""Considering their current positions, these projections would see Nvidia's stock rise 96% and Microsoft's 33% over the next two fiscal years. While both figures are impressive, Nvidia's higher percentage and prominent role in AI make it a more attractive investment this year."", 'As the home of potent brands like Google, Android, and YouTube, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) has massive potential in AI.', 'The company has grown into a tech behemoth, hosting nine products with more than 1 billion users. Its top performers are Google Search, Android, and Chrome. While these services enabled Alphabet to build a lucrative digital advertising business, they could also prove to be assets in its AI expansion.', ""Last December Alphabet unveiled Gemini, a highly anticipated AI model that is expected to be competitive with OpenAI's GPT-4. The popularity of Alphabet's various services and Gemini could prove to be a powerful combination.\xa0With the new model, Alphabet could create a Search experience closer to ChatGPT, offer more effective advertising, introduce new AI tools on Google Cloud, and better track viewing trends on YouTube."", ""Alphabet surpassed $77 billion in free cash flow last year, significantly more than rivals Microsoft or Amazon. The company's considerable cash reserves strengthen its outlook in AI, as it has the funds to invest heavily in its research and development and overcome potential hurdles."", ""These charts show Alphabet's stock is also far cheaper than Microsoft's. The company has lower figures in two key valuation metrics: forward price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-sales (P/S) ratios. Forward P/E is calculated by dividing a company's current share price by its estimated future earnings per share. Meanwhile, forward P/S divides its market cap by estimated revenue. For both metrics, the lower the figure, the better the value."", ""Forward P/E and P/S are great ways to determine the value of a company's shares, as they take into account its financial health against its stock price. In this case, Alphabet is a far bigger bargain than Microsoft on both fronts.

Following the 2022 bear market, the benchmark S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite screamed higher by 24% and 43%, respectively, while the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed to a record high.', 'Despite these sizable gains, a fresh high still eludes the Nasdaq Composite, while the small-cap-driven Russell 2000 remains nearly 18% below its all-time high set in the latter-half of 2021. In other words, bargains can still be found for investors willing to seek them out.', ""What's great about putting your money to work on Wall Street is that online brokers have steadily torn down barriers for everyday investors. Most online brokerages have eliminated minimum deposit requirements and commission fees for common stock trades on major U.S. exchanges. This means any amount of money -- even $300 -- can be the ideal amount to put to work."", ""If you have $300 to invest, and you're absolutely certain this isn't cash you'll need to pay bills or to cover emergency expenses, the following three stocks stand out as no-brainer buys right now."", 'The first magnificent stock to add to your portfolio with $300 is none other than premier retail real estate investment trust (REIT), Realty Income (NYSE: O). Realty Income sports a 5.4% yield, doles out its distribution on a monthly basis, and has raised its payout 123 times since becoming a publicly listed company in 1994.', ""All stocks face headwinds, and Realty Income is no exception. With the Fed set to begin cutting interest rates in 2024, which'll make REITs more attractive from a yield perspective, Realty Income's clearest headwind is the growing possibility of a U.S. recession. A couple of money-based metrics and recession indicators suggest a downturn is likely in the new year. Economic contractions may make it tougher for Realty Income to collect rental income on time, as well as raise rates on lease renewals."", ""But let me be clear: Realty Income isn't your run-of-the-mill retail REIT. It's the retail REIT other companies envy."", 'One of the big keys to Realty Income\'s ongoing success is the composition of its commercial real estate (CRE) portfolio. The company estimates that greater than 90% of total rent collection is ""resilient to economic downturns."" Dig a bit deeper and you\'ll find that more than a third of the company\'s annualized contractual rent derives from grocery stores, convenience stores, dollar stores, and drug stores. These are businesses that consumers will visit in any economic climate, which substantially lessens the concerns about rental delinquencies from its tenants.', ""To build on this point, Realty Income aims to increase its adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) through diversification. It completed two deals over the past two years in the gaming industry, and at the time of this writing is expected to close on its $9.3 billion all-share acquisition of Spirit Realty Capital on January 23. Aside from being immediately accretive to AFFO, Spirit's CRE assets will further diversify Realty Income's portfolio."", ""Did I mention that Realty Income is also historically inexpensive? Shares are currently valued at a shade over 13 times Wall Street's consensus cash flow estimate for 2024. This represents its lowest multiple to cash flow in more than a decade."", ""A second no-brainer stock to buy with $300 right now is a company that's collectively disliked by Wall Street analysts. I'm talking about pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA)."", ""Whereas investors really have to do some digging to find Realty Income's headwinds, Walgreens' stock chart makes it clear the company has been contending with some challenges. Growing online competition in the pharmacy space, coupled with a recent (but expected) dividend cut, has made Walgreens Boots Alliance akin to Wall Street's chopped liver. But it's not all bad news for this once high-flying healthcare stock."", ""The biggest catalyst for Walgreens in 2024 (and beyond) is the recent hiring of Tim Wentworth as CEO. Before becoming CEO of Walgreens, Wentworth headed Evernorth, Cigna Group's health services platform. He was the CEO of Express Scripts, as well, which was acquired by Cigna in 2018. The key point being that Walgreens purposefully brought in a CEO with healthcare experience, which is something it was sorely lacking with its previous CEO, Rosalind Brewer."", ""Walgreens is also currently in the midst of implementing a multipoint turnaround plan designed to reduce its expenses, broaden its margins, and improve customer loyalty. What I'd argue is most important about Walgreens' turnaround efforts is the company's shift into healthcare services."", ""For far too long, Walgreens relied on horizontal expansion. This is to say that it kept adding to its network of brick-and-mortar locations to reach new consumers. The company's new vertical approach will help to expand its margins and is likely to be beneficial with regard to customer loyalty."", ""Walgreens and VillageMD -- Walgreens is a majority investor in VillageMD -- intend to open 1,000 full-service, physician-staffed health clinics co-located in Walgreens' stores in 30 major U.S. markets by 2027. Being physician-staffed means these clinics can treat far more patients and ailments than the healthcare clinics found at most pharmacy chains."", 'The valuation makes sense, too. Despite aforementioned challenges, Walgreens Boots Alliance stock can be scooped up right now for a little over 6 times forward-year consensus earnings per share. Not only does this represents its lowest forward-year earnings multiple in at least a decade, but patient investors will enjoy a 4.5% annual yield to boot.', 'The third no-brainer stock to buy with $300 right now is cybersecurity company Okta (NASDAQ: OKTA).', ""While most cybersecurity stocks have soared of late, Okta hasn't enjoyed nearly as much success. That's because the company admitted in November that hackers gained access to data on all of its customers from late September through mid-October. It's not uncommon for cybersecurity companies to lose out on near-term revenue in the immediate aftermath of a security breach."", ""While breaches aren't ideal, they're not a long-term game changer for Okta or its sustained double-digit growth potential."", ""Okta aims to be the premier name in identity verification solutions. The company's platform is cloud-native and leans heavily on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to grow more effective at spotting and responding to potential threats over time. Though it's clear there's more learning to be done by Okta's AI solutions, the company's cloud-native platform has a clear long-term advantage over on-premises security solutions."", ""In November 2022, Okta estimated the identify verification market to be an $80 billion addressable opportunity. With sales expected to reach $2.24 billion in fiscal 2024 (the company's fiscal year ends on Jan. 31, 2024), it's evident that Okta's growth runway is just getting started."", 'The acquisition of Auth0, which closed in February 2022, should also be a key growth driver for the company. Despite higher-than-expected integration costs, Auth0 provides Okta with a way to gain share in the $30 billion Customer Identity market.

Shares have dipped by 11% over the past year, underperforming the S&P 500 (SPX), which has risen 21% during the same period. However, I see the cup as half full and brimming with potential. This is due to strong growth prospects and a cheap valuation, forming a promising blend for bullish optimism.', 'Starbucks is weathering a storm of controversy as employees, former baristas, and Palestinian advocacy groups nationwide unite in boycotts. At the heart of the turmoil is a legal battle between Starbucks and its workers’ union, Starbucks Workers United, over a pro-Palestinian social media post during the Israel-Hamas conflict.', 'The company alleges trademark infringement, while the union countersues, claiming defamation and seeking to retain its name and logo. Starbucks distanced itself from the union’s stance, condemning terrorism and violence. At the same time, tensions escalated during a nationwide boycott event, coinciding with Red Cup Day, where Starbucks employees protested alleged unfair labor practices.', 'The controversy has spilled into stores, with customers even confronting employees and sending violent messages to Starbucks. As calls for a boycott gained momentum on social media, Starbucks faces a complex challenge in restoring its image and managing the impact of legal disputes and broader issues of labor practices and its political stance.', 'In the face of these events, the market is anticipating headwinds for the company’s upcoming results, encompassing the period from November to January. In a recent analysis, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst John Ivankoe downgraded Starbucks’ initial Q1 U.S. comparable sales growth forecast from 6% to 4%. Projections from Wall Street forecast the company’s sales in its upcoming Q1-2024 results to reach $9.67 billion, notably below the $9.88 billion estimate for this quarter around the same time last year.', 'Reflecting on these developments, it becomes evident why investors have been offloading their Starbucks shares. Whether driven by funds aiming to uphold a positive image for their clients or investors genuinely foreseeing a potential downturn in sales and profits due to the ongoing boycott, the prospect of holding Starbucks stock lacks its usual allure.', 'Despite the ongoing havoc, Starbucks’ growth remains robust. Take the company’s upcoming Q1-2024 results, for example. Despite heavy downgrades among Wall Street analysts, as I just mentioned, it still implies year-over-year growth of 11%. What company is in the midst of heavy consumer boycotting yet is still expected to deliver double-digit growth?', 'From my perspective, the extensive media coverage of Starbucks’ boycott may significantly influence investors closely monitoring the company’s developments. However, the average consumer is likely unaware of such a movement or indifferent to getting involved.', 'I know it’s anecdotal evidence, but every Starbucks location I pass by in Athens, Greece, these days is bustling with customers. To put it simply, even if there is a boycott taking place in certain isolated regions, it certainly doesn’t appear to be a widespread phenomenon, especially when it comes to Starbucks’ international locations.', 'In the meantime, the company continues to open more stores and maximize same-store sales, pointing to near-double-digit growth throughout this year. For context, the company ended Fiscal 2023 with 38,038 locations, up 6.5% compared to the previous year, while global same-store sales in its existing locations grew by 8%. With aggressive store openings set to continue this year and overall sales growth expected to remain strong, Starbucks is anticipated to deliver total sales of $39.48 billion in Fiscal 2024, up 9.8% versus last year.', 'With Starbucks stock lagging lately despite continuing to post revenue and earnings growth, its valuation appears to be hovering at rather cheap levels now. I believe this is going to make bulls return to the stock sooner rather than later.', 'As highlighted earlier, Starbucks is poised for robust sales growth, which is anticipated to approach 10% in Fiscal 2024. At the same time, the company’s management is committed to extending margins this year. Consequently, Wall Street analysts anticipate that EPS growth will outpace the overall increase in revenue.', 'Projections indicate EPS of $4.12 for Fiscal 2024, implying a strong year-over-year surge of 16.4%. Despite this, the implied forward price-to-earnings ratio of 22.7 seems cheap, in my view. Numerous companies in the S&P 500 trade at comparable or loftier multiples, often without the luxury of double-digit growth. Furthermore, few can rival the brand strength that Starbucks commands, which inherently attracts a premium.', 'In my view, a P/E ratio nearing 25 appears to better align with Starbucks’ growth potential. But even if we assume that Starbucks’ existing forward P/E persists and stock returns align with EPS growth, the stock appears poised for strong returns. This is supported by Starbucks’ projected double-digit EPS growth in the medium term.', 'Regarding Wall Street’s view on the stock, Starbucks has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on eight Buys and 11 Holds assigned in the past three months. At $108.83, the\xa0average\xa0SBUX stock prediction implies 18.3% upside potential.', 'If you’re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell SBUX stock, the most accurate analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is John Ivankoe\xa0from JPMorgan, with an average return of 19.83% per rating and a 75% success rate.', 'While Starbucks is currently grappling with challenges stemming from controversies and boycotts, its growth prospects and undervalued stock suggest a potential turnaround. The ongoing issues, particularly related to labor disputes and geopolitical tensions, have impacted the stock negatively. However, the company’s strong global presence, aggressive expansion plans, and robust sales growth forecast for Fiscal 2024 indicate resilience.', 'With its forward P/E ratio appearing cheap compared to its growth potential, Starbucks might reattract bullish investors, signaling upside potential.', 'Disclosure']"

That is an all-time low, down from 10.1% of workers in 2022.', 'The number of unionized workers in the private sector increased by 191,000 to 7.4 million last year. That includes workers at auto companies, Las Vegas hotels and Hollywood studios, all of whom went through high-profile contract negotiations in 2023.', 'But the percent of unionized workers in the private sector – 6% -- remained unchanged from the previous year, as unionization rates didn’t keep pace with overall hiring.', 'The unionization rate for public-sector employees, including government workers, teachers and police, was far higher, at 32.5%. But that sector didn’t see as much growth in employment. About 7 million public-sector workers were union members in 2023, which was unchanged from the year before.', '“Union organizing gains continue to be offset by job growth in nonunion jobs and job loss in heavily unionized sectors,” said Kate Bronfenbrenner, a senior lecturer and director of labor education research at Cornell University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations.', ""Bronfenbrenner said the data also doesn't take into account the surge in unionization at companies like Trader Joe's and Starbucks, where workers are unionizing individual stores but haven't yet reached labor agreements with their employers."", 'Men had a higher union membership rate last year, at 10.5%. The rate for women was 9.5%. And Black workers have a higher union membership rate, at 11.8%, than white workers, at 9.8%.', 'U.S. polls show growing enthusiasm for unions. In August, a Gallup poll said 67% of Americans approve of labor unions. That approval has seen a steady rise since 2009, when just 48% of Americans approved of unions, Gallup said.', 'The National Labor Relations Board reported 2,594 filings for union representation in its 2023 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30. That was up 3% from 2022, and the highest number of filings since the 2015 fiscal year.', ""But unionizing a workplace in the U.S. can be a long and arduous process if the employer doesn't support the union. Over the last two years, Starbucks workers have voted to unionize at 370 U.S. stores, but they haven't yet negotiated a labor agreement with Starbucks."", 'Fights over unionization can also drag on for years in courts. The U.S. Supreme Court recently agreed to hear an appeal filed by Starbucks in a dispute with the National Labor Relations Board over union organizers who were fired nearly two years ago from a Starbucks store in Memphis, Tennessee.', 'Union power has also been diluted by “right-to-work” laws in 26 states, which prevent unions from compelling workers to be members as a requirement for their job.', 'As a result, union membership rates have been on a decades-long decline. In 1983, the first year for which comparable data are available, the U.S. union membership rate was 20.1% and nearly 18 million workers were union members, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said.']"

Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.', ""Applied Industrial Technologies has a Value Score of B.

The players have been committed to product launches and innovation. Expansion into newer markets has been a critical focus for soft drink makers to boost market share. The companies are expected to reap the benefits of digital and technology-driven investments based on the shifting consumer preference for online shopping. Companies in the industry have been accelerating investments to build strong digital capabilities by piloting numerous digital-enabled fulfillment options. They have been expanding digital offerings and investing in loyalty programs to capture online demand. These investments are likely to position soft drink companies for long-term growth.Evolving Trends: One of the notable trends in the U.S. beverage soft drinks industry is the increasing demand for healthier options. Consumers are becoming more health-conscious, driving a shift toward beverages with natural ingredients, lower sugar content and functional benefits, while staying excited for varied flavors and better taste experiences. Plant-based beverages have gained significant traction as consumers seek alternatives to traditional soft drinks. Plant-based ingredients, such as botanical extracts and non-dairy milk alternatives, are becoming popular choices for those looking to reduce their environmental impacts and make healthier choices. Additionally, functional beverages that offer specific health benefits, such as enhanced hydration, energy boosters, and mood enhancers, are carving out a niche in the market. Companies in the industry are expected to benefit from the expansion into newer and adjacent categories, including capturing market share in the fast-growing RTD alcoholic beverage category through collaborations. RTD has emerged as the fastest-growing category since 2018. The industry players are also exploring CBD-infused drinks, which have been gaining popularity lately.Raw Material Cost Inflation and Supply Constraints: The beverage industry has been troubled by higher costs, including rising commodity input costs and transportation expenses. Raw material cost inflation, particularly steel and aluminum, has increased packaging costs. The ongoing supply constraints in the aluminum can industry have been other headwinds. The companies are also witnessing delays in procuring certain ingredients, domestically and internationally, leading to shortages of some goods. The industry players have been facing freight inefficiencies, and significant increases in domestic and international freight costs.

The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', 'Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.', 'On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.', 'Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year.

And now let me introduce PPG's Chairman and CEO, Tim Knavish."", ""Tim Knavish: Thank you, Jonathan, and congratulations on your new role, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings call. I'd like to start by providing a few highlights on our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial performance, and then I will move to our outlook. In the fourth quarter, the PPG team delivered strong financial results, including record fourth quarter sales of $4.4 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.53. This is our fourth consecutive quarter of delivering record sales as we continue to benefit from organic sales growth. Our fourth quarter adjusted EPS was 25% higher year-over-year driven by aggregated segment margin improvement of 260 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 as we continue to be laser-focused on driving margin improvement."", 'Our results reflect our continuing growth trends and strong execution in several of our leading and technology advantage businesses, which culminated in record fourth quarter sales in the aerospace, automotive OEM and automotive refinish businesses with strong performance in the Protective & Marine and PPG Mexico Architectural Coatings businesses. Our year-over-year sales volume trend improved compared to recent quarters, decreasing less than 1% year-over-year. We continue to experience lower global industrial production along with soft U.S. and European architectural demand, especially for DIY-related products. Notable for us during the quarter was China, where despite a lethargic general economy we achieved high single-digit percentage volume growth, reflecting our strong mix of businesses in the country.', 'In addition, we delivered flat year-over-year volumes in Europe as we see economic stabilization in the region, albeit at lower absolute demand levels. Our selling prices were about 2% higher with both segments delivering positive price led by the Performance Coatings segment. We expect total company selling prices to remain modestly positive in the first quarter of 2024 as new selling price increases have been implemented in several of our businesses. We also benefited from further normalization of our operations as we experienced stabilization of both upstream and downstream supply chains and order patterns. From a supply perspective, the vast majority of our suppliers have more than sufficient capacity heading into 2024. We started the year laser-focused on margin recovery and the fourth quarter marked our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating segment margin improvement.', 'And as I mentioned, fourth quarter aggregate segment operating margins increased 260 basis points year-over-year and full year increased 310 basis points. We also achieved our second key priority for the year by delivering excellent cash generation of nearly $900 million during the fourth quarter, which was up over $300 million on a year-over-year basis, leading to record full year cash generation of over $2.4 billion. We significantly reduced working capital by a total of about $600 million on a sequential quarterly basis and this includes the benefit from a partial reduction of our inventory levels. However, we still ended the year with higher inventory levels from a historical perspective, primarily in raw materials and will continue to reduce inventory in the first half of 2024.', ""The strong cash generated drove a reduction in net interest expense by about $20 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 as we repaid some high variable cost debt during the quarter. Additionally, we repurchased $100 million of stock in the fourth quarter, which essentially offset dilution. Now a few comments on the full year 2023. As we communicated at the beginning of 2023, my priorities included margin recovery, strong cash generation and further strengthening of our capabilities to support our customers' productivity and sustainability needs, which will result in higher PPG organic growth. Coming into 2023, we had a high degree of conviction that our global business portfolio would prove resilient while anticipating a challenging economic environment, and these clearly played out during the year."", ""For the full year, I'm proud of our team's execution against our strategic objectives as it resulted in delivery of record sales, record adjusted EPS and record operating cash flow. Our sales performance was led by continued selling price execution to offset significant multi-year cost inflation. Our year-over-year earnings growth was driven by these improved selling prices coupled with moderating input costs and cost structure reductions stemming from our cost management and restructuring initiatives. This resulted in improved margins in both segments. Our businesses delivered innovative and value-added products and solutions to our customers, and this enabled several of our businesses to set all-time annual sales records, including our aerospace, auto OEM, automotive refinish, architectural Mexico and the Protective & Marine coatings businesses."", 'Our enterprise growth initiatives delivered about $150 million of incremental sales in the first year, including strong growth from selling our innovative products for electric vehicles, as well as our share gains in powder coatings. In automotive refinish, customer adoption of our industry-leading digital tools accelerated yielding nearly 2,000 net body shop wins. These digital tools include our Link Services and moonwalk mixing machines, both of which are best-in-class and are focused on improving bodyshop productivity. In Mexico, we further advanced cross-selling of our valued products, including protective coatings and certain light industrial coatings through the best-in-class distribution network of nearly 5,200 concessionaire locations.', 'Finally, our strong focus on the customer drove share gains across several businesses including expansion of our architectural coatings products at Walmart. Strategically, we conducted an ongoing review of both our product and business portfolios leading to the divestiture of several non-core assets including our European and Australian Traffic Solutions businesses, along with the recently announced strategic alternatives review of the silicas product business. In a variety of cases, we also simplified and improved our product offering, allowing us to reduce complexity and drive down working capital. Finally, these actions plus strong balance sheet management resulted in record full year 2023 cash generation of $2.4 billion. So overall, we achieved excellent financial results in 2023 and are anticipating improving from this higher base in 2024.', ""We remain confident that we will deliver positive sales volume in 2024, including benefits from China, India and Mexico. We've delivered share gains in several businesses, including auto refinish, packaging and the protective and marine coatings businesses. We will also execute on our more than $250 million order backlog in Aerospace drive further growth in our well-positioned businesses in Mexico and further expand the benefits of our key growth initiatives, including powder coatings, electric vehicle products and digital solutions. We will drive further improvement of our operating margins aided by the sales volume growth leverage and our initiatives that drive manufacturing productivity following several years of supply chain and other disruptions."", ""Lastly, we entered 2024 with a strong balance sheet, which provides us with the flexibility for further shareholder value creation going forward, including funding organic growth initiatives, appropriate acquisitions, debt repayment and share repurchases. Now, I'll comment on our first quarter outlook. We expect to deliver sequential adjusted EPS growth from $1.53 per share in Q4 2023 to a range of $1.80 to $1.87 per share in Q1 of 2024, an increase of 20% at the midpoint of the range. We anticipate global industrial production to remain soft, and our year-over-year sales volume performance will be unfavorably impacted by the approximate $40 million non-recurring Walmart customer load-in that occurred in the first quarter of 2023. Also, the timing of the Easter holiday will shift some sales into the second quarter."", 'Despite these difficult year-over-year comparison items, we expect our first quarter sales volume will be flat overall, aided by positive sales volume growth in our aerospace, Protective & Marine and packaging, coatings businesses. We project solid growth in our Auto OEM business in Asia Pacific, where we expect to drive solid volume growth in China, led by our strong positioning with the electric vehicle OEM producers. Additionally, we expect to deliver organic sales growth through our best-in-class Mexico distribution platform. We anticipate overall company selling prices to remain positive, as some modest declines in our industrial reporting segment related to a small portion of customer-based index contracts will be more than offset by targeted selling price increases in our Performance Coatings segment.', 'First quarter comparisons also include declines in certain transitory European and energy-related pricing indices, that were put in place during the period of extremely high energy prices in the region. These particular price declines are offset by lower purchased energy costs for our facility. The net selling price increases, along with various productivity initiatives will serve to offset somewhat higher expected wage inflation in 2024, especially in emerging regions. With regard to commodity raw materials, supply remains ample, and we will continue to realize benefits from moderating input costs including further recognition of savings stemming from working down, our higher inventories as we progress through 2024. We will diligently manage our costs and expect to deliver manufacturing and productivity gains supported by a more stable supply chain and customer order patterns.', 'We anticipate more moderate year-over-year earnings growth in the first quarter associated with some of the transitory items, I mentioned earlier. However, we are confident that we will deliver our commitment for full year earnings growth of around 10% at our forecast guidance midpoint. Finally, I want to thank our more than 50,000 employees for making it happen by delivering excellent 2023 financial results and positioning the company for growth and value creation in 2024 and beyond for the benefit of all stakeholders. Thank you for your continued confidence in PPG. And this concludes our prepared remarks. And now would you please open the line for questions.', 'See also 15 Best Places in Washington State for a Couple To Live on Only Social Security and 30 Best Investors to Follow on Twitter and Social Media.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Good morning, and welcome to the SLB fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings conference call. Today's call is being hosted from Houston, following our Board meeting, held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and our other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures.

With that, I will turn the call over to Olivier."", ""Olivier Le Peuch: Thank you, James. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on the call today. In my prepared remarks, I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year results, highlight a number of achievements and share our thoughts on the outlook for 2024 and our financial ambitions. Stephane will then provide more detail on our financial results and will open the line for your questions. Let's begin. The fourth quarter was an impressive conclusion to the year's financial results. We grew revenue both sequentially and year-on-year and we achieved cycle high margins and cash flows during the quarter. Our strong performance was fueled by the international and offshore markets and was supported by robust sales in digital and integration of the acquired Aker subsea business."", 'Throughout the year, we witnessed continued growth in the international and offshore markets, where customers are focused on enhanced production and capacity additions. We have also seen further investments in digital technologies for planning and operational efficiency. This is driving growth today and presenting opportunities into the future. The international shift in investment has accelerated during the year, with fourth quarter revenue growth driven by the Middle East and Asia and Europe and Africa, where we continue to benefit from long-cycle developments, capacity expansions and exploration appraisal activities. Specific to offshore, we delivered a very strong fourth quarter as we grew our legacy portfolio and harnessed a strong performance from our OneSubsea joint venture.', 'On this note, I would like to extend my thanks to the entire Aker subsea team who have joined us three months ago and have already contributed very well to our strong year and results. Exiting the year, our international revenue and margins reached new cycle highs, marking our tenth consecutive quarter of year-on-year double-digit revenue growth on the international front. And we delivered exceptional free cash flow of $2.3 billion in the quarter. Next, let me reflect on our accomplishments for the full year. We fulfilled our full year financial ambitions, growing revenue by 18%, surpassing our revenue growth target for the year and achieving adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid-20s. Additionally, we generated $4 billion in free cash flow, our highest since 2015.', 'See also Cathie Wood’s Latest Stock Picks: 11 Biggest Positions and Best Water Damage Restoration Services in Each of 30 Biggest Cities in the US.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that HOLX is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.', 'Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.', 'The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.', ""HOLX currently has a forward P/E ratio of 18.55, while SONVY has a forward P/E of 28.24.

With the crisis nearly over now, the key focus of medical device R&D is again shifting from COVID-related treatment options to point-of-care testing, heavy as well as minimally invasive implants, elective procedures, and so on and so forth.In fact, since the beginning of 2023, this industry has been witnessing massive adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Medical Things in the form of digital healthcare options in hospitals and other healthcare settings. Digital enhancement, while optimizing costs, proves to be better for clinical outcomes. However, deteriorating international trade, with global inflationary pressure leading to a tough situation related to raw material and labor cost as well as freight charges, has put the industry in a tight spot again. Further, staffing shortages and supply chain-related hazards are denting growth. Meanwhile, industry players like Hologic, Inc. HOLX, Masimo Corporation MASI and Veracyte, Inc. VCYT have adapted well to changing consumer preferences and are still witnessing an uptrend in their stock prices.', 'Industry Description', 'The Zacks Medical - Instruments industry is highly fragmented, with participants engaged in research and development (R&D) in therapeutic areas. This FDA-regulated industry comprises an endless number of products, starting from transcatheter valves to orthopedic products to imaging equipment and robotics. Prior to the pandemic, the Medical Instruments space was advancing well in terms of R&D. Among the recent path-breaking inventions, bone growth stimulators, 3D mapping of CT scans, wireless brain sensors and human-brain pacemakers are worth mentioning. During the COVID-hit years, many non-COVID and non-emergency-line innovations were stuck or delayed. However, with the severity of the pandemic easing, the industry players are again more focused on strengthening their pipeline.', '3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Medical Instruments Industry', 'M&A Trend Continues: The medical instruments space has been benefiting from the ongoing merger and acquisition (M&A) trend. It is a known fact that smaller and mid-sized industry players attempt to compete with the big shots through consolidation. The big players attempt to enter new markets through a niche product. According to an Evaluate MedTech report, in 2022, M&A in this sector represented just under $65 billion in deals. This trend significantly slowed down in 2023, thanks to the tremendously volatile global macroeconomic situation, which resulted in restrained venture capital investment. In the first half of 2023, M&A transactions totaled $13 billion, spanning just 42 deals. The Evaluate report stated that if this trend continued through the second half of the year, it would make the 2023 total the lowest in a decade. Per GlobalData’s Deals Database, as published in Medical Device Network, in the third quarter of 2023, this industry had 107 M&A deals initiated, with a total value of a mere $4 billion. Among the recently completed deals, Globus Medical closed the $3.1 billion deal to acquire spine technology company NuVasive. Also, Boston Scientific recently inked a $3.4 billion deal to acquire publicly traded medical technology company Axonics.', 'Business Trend Disruption: Considering the ongoing macroeconomic situation, the IMF came up with its October 2023 World Economic Outlook Update. Per the baseline forecast, growth is expected to decelerate from 3.5% in 2022 to 3% in 2023 before settling at 2.9% in 2024. IMF expects developed economies to see an especially pronounced slowdown in growth, from 2.6% in 2022 to 1.5% in 2023. IMF specifically noted that global headline inflation in the baseline is going to fall from 8.7% in 2022 to 6.9% in 2023 due to a tighter monetary policy aided by lower international commodity prices. However, underlying (core) inflation is likely to decline more slowly. Inflation’s return to target is unlikely before 2025 in most cases. Per the report, following a strong initial rebound from the pandemic-led market disruption, the pace of recovery has moderated. Several forces that are holding back the recovery include Russia’s war in Ukraine and increasing geoeconomic fragmentation. Other major factors denting growth are the effects of monetary policy tightening to reduce inflation and the withdrawal of fiscal support amid high debt. Overall, Medical Instruments industry players are expected to collectively report a year-over-year decline in earnings due to logistical challenges and higher unit costs.', 'Digital Revolution: With an increase in the adoption of digital platforms within the medical device space, robotic surgeries, big-data analytics, bioprinting, 3D printing, electronic health records, predictive analytics, real-time alerting and revenue cycle management services are gaining prominence in the United States. An October 2023 report of Precedence Research suggests that the global digital health market size is anticipated to reach around $939.54 billion by 2032, up from $262.63 billion in 2022 at a CAGR of 13.1%. Various other reports suggest that companies that adopted AI witnessed a 50% reduction in treatment costs. Telemedicine stocks received an impressive response when, in 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention asked healthcare service communities to broaden the use of telemedicine.', 'Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Improving Prospects', 'The Zacks Medical Instruments industry’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates improving near-term prospects.

The leading streamer posted two straight quarters of subscriber declines, and the stock plunged as investors seemed to believe the growth story was over.', ""However, since then, Netflix has stunned the market. The stock has more than tripled from its nadir in 2022, including Tuesday's after-hours gains, as it's adapted to the challenges in front of it, and found new ways to grow."", 'Those include advertising and paid sharing, and the company has begun to expand its product offerings, leaning further into games and live sports, which include a new deal with the WWE. With this new strategy, Netflix has stepped back from some of its sacred cows and shown a willingness to meet consumer demand where it is. For example, the company had refused to offer ad-based subscriptions for years and had also been reluctant to crack down on password-sharing. But both of those strategies have been successful, and the company now seems flexible in its resistance to live sports after the WWE deal.', 'Netflix shares jumped 8% after hours Tuesday as the company delivered a stellar earnings report.', 'Revenue jumped 12.5% to $8.83 billion, ahead of estimates of $8.72 billion.', 'It added 13.1 million net new subscribers, driven by the advertising tier, paid sharing, and a strong content slate. That was its best subscriber growth in a Q4 ever. Subscriber growth was broad-based with at least 2 million new adds in each of its four regions.', 'Operating margin came in at 17%, up from 7% in the quarter a year ago, and beating its own guidance. For the year, its operating margin was 21%, ahead of the 18%-20% forecast it gave at the beginning of the year.', 'Guidance calls for revenue to grow 13.2% to $9.24 billion in the first quarter, and it expects an operating margin of 26.2% in the first quarter of 2024. It also now sees an operating margin of 24% for the full year 2024, from a previous range of 22%-23%.', 'In just a few quarters, Netflix has solved the issues that were plaguing it in early 2022, which now seem like more of a pandemic hangover than a chronic challenge.', ""The company has returned to its pre-pandemic cadence of adding roughly 30 million subscribers every year, and its ad tier is clearly resonating with subscribers as the company said that ads-based subscribers increased by 70%, just as it did in the third quarter. Forty percent of all new subscribers join the ad plan in markets where it's available."", ""Offering ads also gives the company another growth lever to pull. It can cater to more price-sensitive customers with a lower-priced option that starts at $6.99/month in the U.S., and it can also grow revenue by raising ad prices or increasing ad load in addition to the two ways it's long been able to grow revenue, by adding new members and raising prices."", 'The 13 million new subscribers should reassure investors that Netflix can continue to grow its subscriber base even as it now has more than 260 million paying members, and the leverage in its subscription model should help it continue to expand profit margins as its content spending has started to mature. The company plans to spend $17 billion in cash on content in 2024, equal to 2022 levels. Spending in 2023 was diminished due to writers and actors strikes.', ""Netflix remains head-and-shoulders above the streaming competition, and it has a key advantage over most of its rivals. It doesn't have a declining legacy media business it needs to manage, meaning it can invest all of its resources in streaming. It's also years ahead in building out its business, which explains why it's producing strong profits and most of its competitors are still unprofitable in streaming."", ""Finally, Netflix still has a lot of potential growth opportunities. It recently added Grand Theft Auto to its games collection, and it's been able to license more content from its legacy media partners, more evidence that its large subscriber base is a competitive advantage."", ""Netflix has also been moving further into live experiences with a Stranger Things play in London, a Bridgerton wedding dress collection, a traveling Bridgerton experience called the Queen's Ball, and a Squid Game live experience as well."", 'Expect Netflix to take more risks like the WWE partnership now that advertising and paid sharing have both paid off, and that should fuel further growth.', ""The streamer still retains many of the competitive advantages that made it so successful in the first place.

Shares of the streaming service soared after a blowout financial update shortly after Tuesday's close. Netflix hit levels it hasn't reached in 24 months. But history can be cruel."", ""The last time Netflix stock traded this high -- two years ago -- it plummeted 70% over the next four months. Did it do enough this time to make sure things can be different this time? Let's go over some of the reasons the stock is moving higher after this week's fourth-quarter report. Let's also see if it's enough to keep the rally going."", 'Founder and longtime helmsman Reed Hastings stepped down in January of last year. It was part of a calculated retreat from the corner office. He had promoted programming and content guru Ted Sarandos to serve as co-CEO in the summer of 2020. It was time to move on.', ""The stock initially moved higher after Hastings' departure, but would investors have faith in a company that would be without Hastings at the top for the first time in more than two decades? Well, Netflix is doing just fine, 12 months after he stepped down. The stock soared 65% last year. On Tuesday we learned that revenue accelerated in 2023, posting double-digit growth in the latest quarter for the first time in two years."", ""Netflix is now serving more than 260 million paid members worldwide. It has been raising prices almost every year, including bumping the rate for its costliest subscription tier higher in early November. That move follows cracking down on password sharing. Despite the perpetually rising cover charge in the face of desperate rivals, Netflix isn't afraid to flex its pricing elasticity."", ""And it's working. Netflix closed out 2023 with 13.1 million more subscribers than it had three months earlier. It's the platform's largest increase in paid memberships since the first quarter of 2020, when the world was hunkering down in front of the TV to ride out the initial wave of the COVID-19 crisis."", ""Despite the growing popularity of its new ad-supported tier at a discounted price, revenue is keeping up with subscriber growth over the past year. It's hard to argue when Netflix is handling the pricing gun like it's Annie Oakley."", ""A strong quarter wouldn't translate into sustainable upticks if the view through the windshield didn't look as promising as the one in the rearview mirror. Netflix is eyeing a record $9.24 billion in revenue for the new quarter, a 13% year-over-year increase. That would translate into a third consecutive quarter of accelerating top-line growth, and its strongest revenue gain since the final frame of 2021."", ""Widening margin finds the outlook even more encouraging on the bottom line. Its fresh guidance for the first quarter calls for operating income and net income to soar 41% and 51%, respectively. The $4.49 a share it's targeting in earnings for the period is well ahead of the Wall Street consensus of $4.10. Even the rosiest of the two dozen bottom-line forecasts is below where Netflix now stands."", ""Tuesday's report hit a juicy milestone: Netflix has now been profitable for 20 consecutive years. Most of the competition is still trying to get out of the red. It generated $6.9 billion in free cash flow for all of 2023."", ""Netflix is willing to return some of its good fortune to shareholders, but it isn't likely to start shelling out a quarterly dividend anytime soon. Its preferred path to payback is repurchasing shares. It spent $2.5 billion to buy back 5.5 million shares in the fourth quarter. Some companies repurchase shares to offset their stock-based compensation, but Netflix is making a dent here. Its share count has declined by 1% over the past three months and 2% over the past year."", ""Don't worry about the critics arguing that Netflix is wrong to be buying back its stock as it's hitting two-year highs. Netflix has been buying on the way up. It will also help profitability on a per-share basis, at least slightly, as it enters what should be its 21st year of profitability."", ""Apologies to The Rock, but can you smell what the Netflix is cooking? Hours before its monster quarter, Netflix announced a partnership with WWE that will bring the wrestling federation's Raw live show exclusively to the streaming platform in the U.S. and other key markets next year."", ""It's a win-win pairing.

What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. As with many other companies Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) makes use of debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky."", ""Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Phillips 66 ', 'As you can see below, at the end of September 2023, Phillips 66 had US$19.4b of debt, up from US$17.4b a year ago. Click the image for more detail. On the flip side, it has US$3.54b in cash leading to net debt of about US$15.9b.', 'The latest balance sheet data shows that Phillips 66 had liabilities of US$17.4b due within a year, and liabilities of US$28.4b falling due after that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$3.54b as well as receivables valued at US$12.0b due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$30.3b.', 'While this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since Phillips 66 has a huge market capitalization of US$57.0b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. However, it is still worthwhile taking a close look at its ability to pay off debt.', ""We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it."", ""Phillips 66's net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 1.5 suggests only moderate use of debt. And its commanding EBIT of 11.5 times its interest expense, implies the debt load is as light as a peacock feather. Phillips 66's EBIT was pretty flat over the last year, but that shouldn't be an issue given the it doesn't have a lot of debt. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Phillips 66 can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts."", ""Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Over the most recent two years, Phillips 66 recorded free cash flow worth 76% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to."", ""The good news is that Phillips 66's demonstrated ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. But, on a more sombre note, we are a little concerned by its level of total liabilities. Looking at all the aforementioned factors together, it strikes us that Phillips 66 can handle its debt fairly comfortably. On the plus side, this leverage can boost shareholder returns, but the potential downside is more risk of loss, so it's worth monitoring the balance sheet. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Phillips 66 is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those is concerning..."", ""If you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet."", 'Have feedback on this article?

The most valuable Lincoln penny is worth $2 million on the collectibles market, and many more are worth five or six figures.', 'The value of copper coins, as in all coins, is based on scarcity and condition. Rare coins with minting errors or other unique features tend to bring high prices, as do those in mint or near-mint condition.', 'As The Spruce Crafts noted, many collectors of U.S. coins began with the Lincoln penny and took most of them out of circulation. Because so many are out of circulation, you likely need to visit a dealer or auction to get examples of the highest quality and rarity. This scenario created high demand — and high prices.', 'Here’s a look at five copper coins worth a lot of money.', 'The CoinValue website calls this the “rarest and most valuable wheat penny with an error.” It holds the record for the most expensive sale among wheat pennies at $1.7 million, though it is valued at $2.3 million in uncirculated mint condition.

First, it contains errors involving numbers. Second, it was not supposed to be minted with copper in 1982, but there were “leftover copper planchets” that the U.S. Mint struck with zinc to create the error, according to CoinValue. Prices range from $10,000 to $30,000 and more.', 'In 1909, the U.S. Mint replaced the Indian Head penny with the Lincoln cent, according to The Spruce Crafts. Slightly less than 500,000 of these pennies were minted before the Treasury Department “demanded that the initials be removed,” — the initials of designer Victor David Brenner (VDB) between the two wheat stalks — which created heavy demand among collectors. This penny is currently valued at more than $117,000 in top condition.', 'Slightly more than 4 million were minted and most went into circulation. What makes certain coins of this date rare is their “exceptional condition,” according to The Spruce Crafts. Some of the more valuable examples are so well preserved you can still see the original bright red-copper color. These coins are valued at $126,500 and in particularly excellent condition (the price listed is for an MS-67, or high mint state, for example).', 'Here is another coin valued at $126,500 (at least, in MS-64 condition) — and most of that value is due to doubling on the date and lettering on the obverse. The errors were first discovered in 1970. The U.S. government at first believed these were counterfeit coins and began confiscating them, The Spruce Crafts noted. Five coins were confiscated and destroyed before they were acknowledged as genuine.', '(This article was updated to reflect the 1982 penny is a Lincoln penny, not a wheat penny.)', 'More From GOBankingRates', ""Don't Buy a House in These 3 Cities Facing a 'Climate Change Real Estate Bubble'"", 'The Best $5,000 You Can Spend Every Year in Retirement', 'How To Eliminate $100,000 of Debt', '3 Surprising Reasons Women Should Consider an Annuity', 'This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 5 Copper Coins Worth A Lot Of Money']"

On the call this morning are Brian Doubles, Synchrony's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Wenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Brian Doubles."", 'Brian D. Doubles', ""Thanks, Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. Today, Synchrony reported strong fourth quarter results, including net earnings of $440 million or $1.03 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 1.5% and a return on tangible common equity of 14.7%.These fourth quarter results contributed to a full year 2023 net earnings of $2.2 billion or $5.19 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 2% and a return on tangible common equity of 19.8%.This strong financial performance was supported by continued consumer resilience and powered by our multiproduct strategy and diversified sales platforms. We achieved another year of record purchase volume totaling $185 billion for the full year and up 3% from last year. Our compelling products and value propositions helped drive the origination of almost 23 million new accounts in 2023 and also helped grow our average active accounts by 2.5%. The broad utility and value of our product offerings continue to resonate deeply with our customer base, leading to another year of record purchase volume. This, combined with the continued moderation in payment rates to drive loan receivables growth of 11.4%. Credit continued to normalize this fourth quarter, net charge-offs reached prepandemic levels, in line with our expectations, and contributing to a full year net charge-off rate of 4.87%, still below our target underwriting range of 5.5% to 6%. We also drove continued progress toward our target operating efficiency ratio, demonstrating cost discipline while maintaining investments to ensure the long-term success of our franchise.And through strong execution and prudent capital management over time, Synchrony continued our long history of capital returns, including $1.5 billion returned to shareholders this year. Since 2016, we have paid $3.6 billion in dividends and reduced our outstanding shares by 50%.Synchrony's ability to consistently generate and return capital to our shareholders is enabled by our differentiated business model, which prioritizes the sustained delivery of attractive risk-adjusted returns through changing market conditions and economic cycles.Our focused execution across key strategic priorities enable Synchrony's resilient returns by reinforcing our core strengths and facilitating our ongoing evolution to meet changing preferences and needs. With that in mind, Synchrony continued to grow and win new partners over the past year. With the addition of more than 25 partners and over 30 renewed relationships.Among our new partnerships, we were excited to announce that J.Crew selected Synchrony to launch its first co-branded credit card, which will be a digital-first program with mobile wallet provisioning, robust preapproval capabilities, scan to apply and direct-to-device credit applications. This competitive win is a testament to our culture of innovation, consistent investment in our digital ecosystem, and our strategic focus to empower our customers and partners to connect seamlessly through best-in-class omnichannel experiences. We also continue to diversify our programs, products and markets during 2023, broadening the utility of our offerings and extending our reach. Synchrony believes in the power of choice, choice for our customers and partners, providers and merchants, as they engage in person and digitally across a full suite of everyday financing options. This year, we launched multiproduct prequalification and began presenting customers with side-by-side offers of both revolving and installment solutions to bring choice to the forefront. These enhancements empower customers to weigh the benefits of various options in real time and make the decisions that best suit their financing needs in that moment. We continue to scale our Pay Later solution, which is now offered at over 200 provider locations in our Health & Wellness platform and at 18 retail partners.For our partners and providers, Pay Later seamlessly integrates into the broader partner relationship and product offering, and provides another tool for deepening engagement with customers. And the response has been strong. Since we launched partners who have offered these solutions have seen a 20% lift in new accounts, with 95% of Pay Later sales coming from net new customers.Synchrony's continued diversification and expansion of our offerings over the last year benefited from opportunities to extend our reach. In the fourth quarter, we announced the sale of our Pets Best insurance business, and through a minority interest from that sale, the opportunity to build a strategic partnership with Independence Pet Holdings, or IPH, one of the leading pet-focused companies in North America. Since acquiring the Pets Best business in 2019, we've grown pets in force by over 45% per year on average, more than double the industry's growth rate, and become a leading pet insurance provider in the U.S. We're very proud of what we've been able to achieve with such a great business and team, which enabled us to gain considerable insight into the pet industry, more broadly over the last 4 years. We are confident that IPH will be able to use its pet insurance expertise to unlock new opportunities for Pets Best and offer still greater value for Pets Best customers. And through the strategic relationship forged between IPH and ourselves, Synchrony is positioned to gain still greater exposure on insights into the rapidly growing pet industry, as we seek to expand access to flexible pet care financing across the country. More recently, Synchrony announced still another opportunity to expand our business and accelerate our growth with the acquisition of Ally Lending's point-of-sale financing business. This $2.2 billion loan portfolio consists of partnerships with nearly 2,500 merchant locations and supports more than 450,000 active borrowers in the home improvement services and health care industries. Through this acquisition, Synchrony will create a differentiated solution in the industry, simultaneously offering both revolving credit and installment loans at the point of sale and the home improvement vertical. This multiproduct presentation furthers our product diversification strategy, delivering consumer choice, while maximizing conversions and sales for our partners. This opportunity also enables Synchrony to expand our home specialty financing in roofing, windows and electrical services. We are excited about the natural synergies we see between Ally Lending and Synchrony's Home and Auto and Health and Wellness platforms. We look forward to leveraging our industry expertise and scale to drive operating efficiency and accelerate growth across platforms, with attractive market opportunities and return profiles over time. And of course, Synchrony's ability to successfully deliver a breadth of financing solutions across an expansive distribution network is reliant on delivering best-in-class experiences with each customer interaction.This year, we continue to elevate the presence and utility of our offerings across in-person and digital transactions by adding digital wallet provisioning capabilities for 8 partners, including PayPal and Venmo, Verizon, TJX and Belk. And our digital sales continue to grow at an outsized pace, climbing 9% to nearly 39% of our total 2023 sales.Over the last year, Synchrony launched the first phase of our marketplace on synchrony.com and within our native app, where shoppers can find hundreds of offers showcasing our partner brands, compared with Synchrony's tailored multiproduct financing solutions. In fact, as Synchrony leverage our analytics and marketing capabilities to develop compelling cross-shopping opportunities in this initial launch. Marketplace attracted over 220 million visits by shoppers for our partners, providers and merchants, as we more than doubled the number of partners participating.In summary, Synchrony is increasingly any where our customer is looking to make a purchase or a payment, large or small, in-person or digitally and across an ever-expanding range of markets and industries. We can meet them whenever and however they want to be met, with a variety of flexible financing solutions to meet their needs in any given moment. Our ability to deliver the versatility of our financial ecosystem seamlessly across channels, industries, partners and providers alike, is what positions Synchrony so well to sustainably grow and deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns, particularly as customer needs and market conditions evolve.With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian to discuss our financial performance in greater detail."", 'Brian J. Wenzel', ""Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony's fourth quarter results demonstrate the power of our differentiated business and financial model, performing as designed. Our diversified sales platform in spend categories enabled record purchase volume growth, as our disciplined underwriting and credit management kept credit performance in line with our expectations.Our retail share arrangements ensured alignment of economic interest between Synchrony and our partners. As credit normalize towards historical prepandemic levels and funding costs increased from higher benchmark rates, our RSA payments were lower, providing a partial buffer to the economic environment enabling Synchrony delivery of consistent, attractive risk-adjusted returns. And our strong balance sheet provides the flexibility to return capital to shareholders, while investing in opportunities to achieve our longer-term strategic goals, all while delivering for our customers and partners and their evolving needs today. Overall, our prudent business management and differentiated financial model have positioned Synchrony to deliver sustainable outcomes for our customers, partners and shareholders, through an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop this past year and as we move forward in 2024. Now let's turn to our fourth quarter results. Purchase volume increased 3% versus last year, and reflected the breadth and depth of our sales platforms and the compelling value our products offer, combined with the resilient consumer.In Health & Wellness, purchase volume increased 10%, reflecting broad-based growth in active accounts led by dental, pet and cosmetic verticals. Digital purchase volume increased 5%, with growth in average active accounts and strong customer engagement. Diversified value purchase volume increased 4%, reflecting a higher end and out-of-partner spend.Lifestyle purchase volume increased 3%, with stronger average transaction values in outdoor and luxury.In our Home and Auto, purchase volume decreased 4%, as lower customer traffic, fewer large ticket purchases and lower gas prices more than offset growth in home specialty, auto network and commercial.Purchase volume across Synchrony, dual and co-branded cards grew 9% and represented 43% of total purchase volume for the quarter, reflecting the broad utility and value that these products deliver for our customers.As we've discussed in the past, our out-of-partner spend is split roughly evenly between discretionary and nondiscretionary categories, and this trend held steady throughout the year. In the fourth quarter, we saw some shift in categories, as consumers shifted from travel spend to clothing, for instance, and from gasoline and automobiles towards spend at grocery and discount stores. We have not seen any meaningful changes in the overall composition between discretionary and nondiscretionary spend. The combination of broad-based purchase volume growth in approximately 110 basis point decrease in payment rates, drove ending loan receivables growth of 11.4%.Our fourth quarter payment rate of 15.9% still remains approximately 115 basis points higher than our 5-year pre-pandemic historical average.Net interest income increased 9% to $4.5 billion, driven by a 16% growth in interest and fees. The increase in interest and fees reflected the combined impact of higher loan receivables and benchmark rates as well as a lower payment rate. Our net interest margin of 15.10% declined 48 basis points compared to the prior year. The decrease largely reflected higher interest-bearing liability costs, which increased 169 basis points to 4.55%, and reduced net interest margin by 138 basis points. This impact was partially offset by 66 basis points of growth in loan receivables yield, which contributed 55 basis points to net interest margin.Higher liquidity portfolio yield added 29 basis points to net interest margin. And our loan receivables growth improved the mix of interest-earning assets, contributing 6 basis points to net interest margin. RSAs of $878 million in the fourth quarter or 3.49% of average loan receivables, a reduction of $165 million versus the prior year, reflecting higher net charge-offs, partially offset by higher net interest income.Provision for credit losses increased to $1.8 billion, reflecting higher net charge-offs and a $402 million reserve build, which largely reflected the growth in loan receivables.Other expenses grew 14% to $1.3 billion. The increase primarily reflect the growth-related items as we continue to see strong growth in volumes as well as a return of operational losses to pre-pandemic average levels as a percent of our purchase volume.Expenses in the quarter also included several notable items, including $43 million in employee costs related to a voluntary early retirement program, $9 million in real estate-related restructuring charges, as we continue to adjust our physical footprint in favor of a hybrid working environment. $9 million for the FDIC special assessment, $7 million of preparatory expenses in anticipation of a potential [LAFE] rule change and $5 million of transaction-related expenses related to the sale of Pets Best. Our efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter improved by approximately 120 basis points compared to last year, to 36%. Excluding the impact of the notable items in the quarter, our efficiency ratio would have been approximately 200 basis points lower in the fourth quarter. All in, Synchrony generated net earnings of $440 million or $1.03 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 1.5% and return on tangible common equity of 14.7%.Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 10. Overall, we see the consumer remaining resilient, as they manage through inflation and higher interest rates. The external deposit data we monitor also supports this view, as it shows average savings account balances returned closer to prepandemic levels during 2023 and remain relatively steady through the third and fourth quarters.At year-end, average industry savings balances remained approximately 9% above levels from 2020.Our discipline through cycle underwriting and active credit management has positioned us well as we entered 2024. Our delinquency ratios finished the year slightly above average levels from 2017 to 2019 prior to the pandemic. At year-end, our 30-plus delinquency rate was 4.74% compared to 3.65% in the prior year, and 12 basis points above our average for the fourth quarters of 2017 to 2019.Our 90-plus delinquency rate was 2.28% versus 1.69% last year and 4 basis points above our average for the fourth quarters of 2017 to 2019. And consistent with our expectations, Synchrony's net charge-offs reached 5.58% in the fourth quarter compared to 3.48% in the prior year, at an average of 5.49% in the fourth quarters of 2017, 2018 and 2019.We continue to monitor our portfolio and implement actions as necessary to proactively position our business for 2024 and beyond. Moving to reserves. Our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 10.26%, down 14 basis points from 10.40% in the third quarter. The reserve build of $402 million in the quarter was largely driven by receivables growth.Turning to Slide 12. Synchrony's balance sheet continues to be a source of flexibility and strength. Our consumer bank offerings continue to resonate with customers in the fourth quarter, driving over $3 billion of growth in total deposits in the quarter or 13% compared to the prior year.At quarter end, deposits represented 84% of our total funding, while securitized debt comprised 7% and unsecured funding 9%. Total liquid assets and undrawn credit facilities were $19.8 billion, up $2.6 billion from last year and at quarter end represented 16.8% of total assets, up 42 basis points from last year.Moving on to our capital ratios. As a reminder, we elected to take the benefit of the CECL transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies. Synchrony will continue to make its annual transitional adjustments to our regulatory capital metrics of approximately 50 basis points each January until 2025. The impact of CECL has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, Synchrony made a change to its balance sheet presentation of contractual amounts related to our retailer partner agreements. At year-end, assets of approximately $500 million, which were previously classified as intangible assets, were reclassified to other assets and prior periods were reclassified to perform to this presentation. This change in presentation had a corresponding impact to each of our regulatory capital metrics that resulted in an increase of approximately 50 basis points to our capital ratios in both the current and prior years. Under the CECL transition rules and including this balance sheet change, we ended the fourth quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.2%, 110 basis points lower than last year's 13.3%. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.9% compared to 14.1% last year. The total capital ratio decreased 60 basis points to 14.9%.In a Tier 1 capital plus reserve ratio on a fully phased-in basis decreased to 22.1% compared to 22.8% last year.During the fourth quarter, we returned $353 million to shareholders, consisting of $250 million of share repurchases and $103 million of common stock dividends.At the end of the quarter, we had $600 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization. We're well positioned to return capital to shareholders as guided by our business performance, market conditions, regulatory restrictions and subject to our capital plan. We will also continue to seek opportunities to complete the development of our capital structure through the issuance of additional preferred stock as conditions allow.Synchrony remains committed to our capital allocation framework, which prioritizes investment in organic growth and payment of our regular dividends, followed by share repurchases and investments in inorganic growth opportunities, where the rates of return meet or exceed that of our other potential uses of capital.To that end, as Brian mentioned, Synchrony announced the acquisition of the Ally Lending point-of-sale financing business, which we view as a great opportunity to expand our leadership position in the Home Improvement and Health and Wellness verticals, while leveraging our industry expertise and scale to unlock still greater value. We've agreed to purchase approximately $2.2 billion of loan receivables at a discount. Upon closing the transaction and subject to the completion of purchase accounting, we expect our CET1 ratio to be reduced by approximately 50 basis points, inclusive of our provision for credit losses of approximately $200 million relating to the initial reserve builds.Synchrony expects this acquisition to be accretive to full year 2024 earnings per share, excluding the impact of the initial reserve build for credit losses. On integration of our business, conversion to our Prism underwriting model and execution of our strategy, we expect to achieve attractive internal rate of return with approximately a 3.5-year tangible book value earn back.Additionally, the sale of our Pets Best business will result in approximately $750 million gain, net of tax in 2024, which will contribute to an approximately 80 basis point increase to our CET1 ratio, inclusive of the capital required to be held on the minority interest in IPH. Excluding the gain on sale, we expect the transaction to be neutral to earnings.We're excited about the opportunities we have identified to continue to drive consistent growth and appropriate risk-adjusted returns, and have established a long track record of execution across both strategic and financial objectives.During 2023, we drove strong growth in purchase volume, which combined with the payment rate moderation to deliver solid growth in loan receivables. We are opportunistic in funding that growth and continue to expand our deposit franchise and in turn, deliver attractive net interest income. Credit normalized in line with our expectations and our RSA functioned as designed. And finally, we fulfilled our commitment to deliver positive operating leverage. Turning to Slide 14. Let's review our outlook for 2024. Our baseline assumption for this discussion include: a stable macroeconomic environment, full year GDP growth of approximately 1.7%, a year-end 2024 on (inaudible) rate of 4.0% and an ending Fed funds rate of 4.75%, with cuts beginning in the second half of 2024. This outlook also assumes the closing of our Pets Best and Ally Lending transactions in the first quarter of 2024. And given the uncertainty of timing and implementation of a potential final rule regarding late fees, we have not assumed any related impact to our 2024 financial outlook. In the event that a final late fee rule is published, we will provide an update with the associated impact to our financial guidance.Starting with loan receivables. We expect our compelling value propositions and the broad utility of our products will continue to drive purchase volume growth. We also expect payment rates to continue to moderate, although we anticipate they will remain above pre-pandemic levels through 2024. Together, these dynamics should deliver ending loan receivables growth of 6% to 8%.We expect full year net interest income of $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion. Net interest income should follow typical seasonal trends through the year, adjusted for several impacts: one, higher interest-bearing liabilities expense as our fixed rate debt reprices with higher benchmark rates; two, the impact of competition for retail deposits and pace of deposit repricing once rate cuts begin. Our expectation is for betas to trend near 30% as rates begin to decline later in the year, thereby reducing impact to interest expense during 2024; and three, interest and fee yield growth, partially offset by higher income reversals.We expect net charge-offs of 5.75% to 6% within our targeted underwriting range of 5.5% to 6%. Losses are expected to peak in the first half before returning to prepandemic seasonal trends, following the normalization of delinquency metrics in 2023.We expect ROCEs of 3.5% to 3.75% of average loan receivables for the full year. This reflects the impact of continued credit normalization, higher interest expense and the mix of our loan receivables growth, partially offset by purchase volume growth. The reduction in RSA demonstrates the functional design of the RSA and the continued alignment of our interest with partners.And finally, we expect to reach an operating efficiency ratio of 32.5% to 33.5% for the year, driven primarily by the optimization of our loan yields as credit normalization occurs. This outlook excludes the impact of the Pets Best gain on sale, which will be recognized in other income. We remain committed to delivering operating leverage for the full year and continuing to invest in our long-term success of our business. As demonstrated again this past year, Synchrony's purpose-built business and financial model is performing as designed. Through an evolving backdrop, our diversified portfolio of products and platforms continue to drive growth, our leading credit management ensures attractive risk-adjusted returns, our RSA provides a buffer against changes in economic performance and our stable balance sheet creates opportunity. Taken together, our business continued to deliver value for each of our stakeholders in 2023 and positioned well for 2024. I'll now turn the call back over to Brian for his closing thoughts."", 'Brian D. Doubles', ""Thanks, Brian. Synchrony delivered another strong performance in 2023. We executed on key strategic priorities that expand the breadth and depth of our customer acquisition and engagement, further diversify the products, services and value we provide and enhance the quality of the experiences we power for our customers, partners, providers and merchants.This focus on deepening our core strengths, while continuing to evolve with the ever-changing world of commerce has enabled Synchrony to deliver strong financial results and returns to our shareholders, while also preparing our business for the future.We are confident in our ability to continue to sustainably grow and deliver resilient risk-adjusted returns over time and are excited about both the near and longer-term opportunities we see ahead to deliver still greater value for our many stakeholders. With that, I'll turn the call back to Kathryn to open the Q&A."", 'Kathryn Harmon Miller', 'That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now begin the Q&A session. (Operator Instructions). Operator, please start the Q&A session.', 'Operator', ""(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Terry Ma with Barclays."", 'Terry Ma', ""Can you maybe just talk about the cadence we should expect for delinquencies in 2024? Should the fourth quarter or first quarter be kind of peak delinquencies? And then as we look forward out to 2025, can you maybe just talk about your confidence level that you'll stay within this net charge-off range of 5.75% to 6%."", 'Brian J. Wenzel', ""Sure. Thanks, Terry. When we look at our delinquency formation really in the fourth quarter, first, I think you have to recognize we normalize slower than all of our peers, which is partially attributable to the fact that we didn't really adjust the credit box during the pandemic. Our advanced underwriting tool, Prism, which we invested heavily in since 2017 and the data elements we bring in. So that really helped the formation as we exit out of 2023.It's important to note that when you look at both the 30-plus and the 90-plus delinquency rate that is in the fourth quarter, they're only 12 basis points and 4 basis points, respectively, over the 3-year average from 2017 to 2019. And then when I look at the mix of credit that sits in delinquency today, it's substantially similar to that of the 2019 credit mix. So when I look at that -- I then look a little bit at the trending, Terry, and performance of delinquency. When you look at it, the consistency of the growth month-on-month, year-over-year, 30-plus, 90-plus is not shown deterioration. It's been very consistent, a range between 109 basis points and 116 basis points each month, 90-plus has been between 55 and 63. So it's been very consistent. Relative to seasonality, it's been generally in line. So I look at those factors as we can enter -- entry rate continues to be better than 2019. So now that roll that forward, what we expect from a charge-off perspective that your first half charge-offs are going to be higher in the first half, lower in the second half and should give you a range of 5.75% to 6% for the year, so inside of our underwriting target. Again, you recall that we did take actions in the second quarter and the third quarter, which we outlined. Those are beginning to season, and you should see the effects of those beginning into effect delinquencies here in the first half of 2024. So with that, we feel good about where credit is. We'll continue to monitor the trends in credit, what's rolling in, but the positive entry rate, which has a slightly negative effect on the float to loss, but that positive entry rate is really encouraging for us as we enter the year."", 'Terry Ma', 'Got it. And then my follow-up is on just the NII guide. It looks like you assumed about 2 rate cuts. Can you maybe just talk about what we should expect if we get more than kind of 2 rate cuts for the year?', 'Brian J. Wenzel', ""Yes. Thanks for that question, Terry. If I look at what we're projecting, we actually had 3 rate cuts really beginning in September of 2024, going through the end of the year, which -- I'll hit the point on betas, it's 30%. So if you think about having rate cuts that late in the year, digital banks generally lag about 30 to 90 days with regard to when they start to move rates. And then you also have to take into consideration the fact that in the fourth quarter when you want to maintain a higher level of financing to fund seasonal growth. So that's why the beta is a little bit lower.If you were to get rate increases more than that early in the year, you would get in theory, some benefit on to the net interest margin and lower interest on interest bearing liabilities."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan.', 'Richard Barry Shane', ""Really just want to talk a little bit about the relationship between NCOs and RSAs, when we look at the '24 guidance. '24 guidance from an NCO perspective basically puts you at the higher end, but within the range of NCO targets. RSA looks a little bit lower than what we would have seen on a pre-pandemic basis. And I'm assuming that's really not a function of credit, but more a function of the interest rates.And as we look forward, if we assume net charge-offs wind up in that 5.5% to 6% target range, but interest rates start to come down, will the RSA trend back up? I just want to sort of get a sense of what we should be looking at in a normal environment for that RSA ratio?"", 'Brian J. Wenzel', ""Sure. Thank you, Rick. The first thing, I'm going to continue to point you to page 4 of our materials this morning, which shows the risk-adjusted return -- really the relationship between NCOs and RSA, which generally trend in line with each other. You are right. As you think about 2024, you do see some lift continuing under that charge-off line, which pulls back through the RSA. You continue to get headwinds as the interest-bearing liabilities will reset. We have 92% of our CDs were reset in 2024. 74% of our debt will reset in 2024. So you're going to have a full year effect of the rate increases that we've seen in 2022 and 2023, flow through the book. And again, we're expecting, I think, in the guidance, we said, listen, payment rate does not get back to prepandemic levels. So you're not getting the full interest and fee yield going back through, you have higher interest-bearing liabilities, which will, in theory, benefit the company through a low RSA. To the extent that interest-bearing liabilities comes down faster through other resets, you would see an increase to the RSA."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.', 'Ryan Matthew Nash', ""Brian, maybe as a follow-up to the first question. I just wanted to flesh out the NII and NIM guide a little bit more. Can you maybe just talk about what gets us to the bottom end of the range to the top of the range? Obviously, it's a pretty wide range. And maybe just explain a little bit further what is the 30% beta. Is that a point to point? Is that a downside? I just want to make sure we fully understand that. And lastly, just given that you were liability sensitive on the way up, do you still see a path to a 16% NIM and over what time frame?"", 'Brian J. Wenzel', ""Yes. Thanks for the question, Ryan. So let me deal with the beta comment first. So when you think about beta, this is really the beta in year for really effectively the end of the year. I think if you think about betas over a longer period of time, so think about what you would see in a rate decline cycle here, I would not expect a beta 1. We didn't get 1 on the way up, so we wouldn't get 1 on the way down. When you look at our book of our portfolio of liabilities, we were approximately 80% beta on savings, 90% beta on CDs. I would expect that over that cycle coming down. So over time, you're going to see it kind of probably nearer the way it went up, it will mirror on the way down. So that's how I would think about betas over the longer term. When you think about the net interest income -- the question here becomes what is the assumption? If you go, we have 3 rate cuts in, the market has 6. Some have as early as March, some will certainly have interest-bearing liabilities starts earlier and there's greater rate declines, that could push your NII dollars up.Conversely, if rates don't get cut off, it could push you a little bit lower. And the big other factor that's going to come through here is going to be what this team will be continue to do. We have been conservative. I think I'm paying rates saying it doesn't get back to prepandemic levels. I think it's been slower than our anticipated decline here in 2023. So those are generally the moving pieces as I think how you would slide between the range of 17.5 to 18.5."", 'Ryan Matthew Nash', 'Got it. And maybe as a follow-up on credit, you talked about starting to see delinquencies follow more normal patterns and also charge-offs peaking by the second quarter. Brian, if your outlook proves to be correct, when do we start to see the allowance coming down? When does it peak and come down? And maybe just help us understand the potential magnitude that it could come down over the course of the year.', 'Brian J. Wenzel', ""Yes. So we're entering the year at (inaudible) on a covered rate basis. I would expect in the first quarter, you're going to see a rise and normally seasonally rise as your receivables go down, number one. Number two, [Audio Gap] of just under $200 million or around $200 million for the Ally Lending portfolio that we bring over, there will be some on the purchase account in March that will increase that coverage a little bit as well. It doesn't go through the P&L. So you're going to see a rise really in the first quarter, call it, seasonally. We anticipate that it will be lower than the (inaudible) as we exit out at (inaudible) So you're primarily going to see growth builds as we move throughout the year, but you will see rate declines. Some of the QAs burn off or get realized. And again, if credit performs as we think it would be exiting down. Towards the day 1, we won't be (inaudible) more certainly in 2024, but trending downwards as we move through the year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with TD Cowen.', 'Moshe Ari Orenbuch', ""I know that your guidance doesn't contemplate the late fee ruling yet because it hasn't been issued. But maybe could you -- you did mention that you spent $7 [million] kind of in preparation. Could you talk about the things that you are doing in preparation and kind of any updated thoughts you have on the fact that we're sitting here kind of in the -- towards the end of January and haven't heard anything yet from (inaudible)?"", 'Brian D. Doubles', ""Yes, sure, Moshe. I'll start on this. We're obviously still waiting for the final rule to be issued. But with that said, while there's still some unknowns in terms of the implementation period and other things that we'll see in the final rule, we've been working on this for almost a full year now at this point. It's very complicated. Our teams have done a lot of work in preparation for this. We spent a lot of time with our partners. We've agreed on pricing actions and offsets that we would deploy when we see the final rule. So it's really all the work that has been going on over the past year. I mean it's systems work. You got -- you have to issue a lot of CIT's change in terms. And so it's really that kind of stuff.I will say that the conversations with our partners have been very constructive. They fully recognize that without these offsets, that a meaningful portion of their customers that we approve today and that we underwrite and give credit to, would no longer have access to credit. And that's something clearly we do not want, they do not want. So really no change to what we said in the past. Our goal is to protect our partners, fully offset the impact of the final rule when it does come, and we want to continue to provide credit to the customers that we do today."", 'Moshe Ari Orenbuch', ""Great. And just as kind of as a second thought, when you look at the different kind of verticals, obviously, you had strong growth in 2023 and a couple of them in Home and Auto had been somewhat weaker, particularly as you get closer to year-end. As you look into 2024, any changes in mix in terms of the growth, anything that you're seeing or launches and product refreshes that are going to drive in those various lines?"", 'Brian D. Doubles', ""Yes. I think, look, generally, we would continue to expect outsized growth in Health and Wellness. That's a platform where we've accelerated investment in the past year or 2. We're seeing really good growth from our acquisition of Allegro Credit. It's a big market. We've got a leading position. This is dental, that cosmetic, great engagement in the partner network. And so that's a platform we'll continue to invest in, and we would expect to see growth there on the higher side relative to the other platforms. The other one I would mention is digital. That's where we've got Venmo, Verizon, PayPal, Amazon. And so I think you'd continue to see some outsized growth there and then maybe a little bit softer in Lifestyle and Home and Auto. I don't know, Brian, if you have anything to that?"", 'Brian J. Wenzel', ""No, you'll see (inaudible) in digital will be above average. Diversified value would be around company average, maybe a hair below and then you'll see Lifestyle. Listen, the Home and Auto trend, particularly in the home, what we're seeing there is lower foot traffic in the store and we see frequency, not necessarily terribly down, but it's more transaction values. Our people are -- they're buying a mattress, they're not buying high-end mattress, they're buying a little bit lower. So we would expect that trend to continue into the start of 2024."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies.', 'John Hecht', ""Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But I guess one of the questions I have is, I think we've had depleted recoveries on the charge-off side, part of that equation over the past couple of years. I'm wondering, Brian, to what degree does maybe a recovery and recoveries impact the NCO guide?"", 'Brian J. Wenzel', ""Yes. Thanks for the question, John. When we look at recoveries, we've done a couple of things really through the pandemic. Number one, we made a strategic shift to in-source our recovery operations. So we used to have a lot of it externally managed. We brought it in now, so which effectively drove rate increases on ultimate recoverability of dollars written off. So that was a positive as you move through.You are right. When you look at -- particularly when you're doing some level of forward flow on a rate basis, that's down and your total charge-offs were down. But I think the swing that we had of being more efficient by in-sourcing has helped to offset that. So I think on a relative percentage, it's been flat.Most certainly, it should rise as we step out of 2023 for a couple of reasons. Number one, your rate, we'll get more volume just on a net charge-off basis. And then if you do see an easing of rates, the cost of capital associated with people who purchase written off paper should go down, you'll get better pricing in the market. So there's a number of different dynamics for us that it hasn't been much of an issue on net charge-offs and probably exiting out of '24 maybe provides a tailwind beyond."", 'John Hecht', ""Okay. And maybe kind of a higher level question. I think, Brian, I think you mentioned you still have nondiscretionary versus discretionary purchase activity was consistent. I'm wondering, I mean, given inflation is stabilizing, we've got student loan repayments turned back on, are you seeing anything on the margin that would reflect changing consumer behavior? Or is it just sort of a steady as she goes, given those changes in the macro?"", 'Brian J. Wenzel', ""Yes. As we highlighted, John, what we're seeing is a little bit of a rotation out of some of travel into some of the other items. Again, that was a trend more in the fourth quarter. We would expect travel to ease as you move into 2024. So that's bigger shift.We do not see the shift between discretionary, nondiscretionary, we do not see a shift where the consumer is trying to really stretch dollars. We do see our transaction values down and frequency up a little bit, which means that as the consumer is making purchases, they are trying to be efficient with the dollars but not really pulling back. So as I look at that, I don't see big overwhelming trends. I would tell you for the first 20 days, and I always put that as a frame of reference, sales have been a little bit softer than expectations as we entered into 2024, but that's only 20 days of data. And if I talk to some of my retail friends, they would tell you whether it did play factors. You had several states that have been cold and significant storms, but there's been lower foot traffic generally across the board as we started 2024."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America.', 'Mihir Bhatia', ""Maybe to start with, I wanted to ask about portfolio renewals and just portfolio movements. And I apologize, it's a 2-part question. But firstly, can you just remind us of your renewal cadence? Are there any large programs coming up for renewal here in the next 24 months? And then second part is just we've gone through a period of credit normalization. You still have the late fee rule outstanding. So I was wondering what the environment is like for renewals and RFPs. Currently as you talk to retailers, are retailers waiting for a little bit more certainty? Or I mean I know you announced J.Crew this morning, you're also buying the Ally portfolio. But like what about the other big retail programs? Or do you send like -- but can you put your pipeline in context maybe like what it looks like and just put that into context for us relative to last year or a few years ago or a normal environment?"", 'Brian D. Doubles', ""Yes. So I would say first -- I'll take the second part first, which is late fees and how that's impacting the pipeline. I do think it does make pricing new business, even renewals, to some extent, a little more challenging, but we've been able to kind of work through that.You mentioned J.Crew. We're excited to announce that new program. But you got to spend time, that's part of the negotiation, right? And there's speculation there and there's some uncertainty. And so you kind of got to try and cover yourself for those possible outcomes, which we believe we've done.So it does make, I think pricing new business or renewals a little more challenging. I do think there'll be some clarity here the next month or 2, and that will clear that up and make things a little bit easier from that perspective. But it has influenced, I think, not only us, but other market participants. It's a big part of the conversation once she gets through. The way I think about the kind of the BD or the sales process, it's a lot about capabilities, technology, data analytics, data share, all those things. But then when you get to the financials, this is a big part of the discussion that's crept in there over the last 12 months, just given the uncertainty. The other thing, just in terms of our pipeline for renewals, the vast majority of our programs are out there 2026 and beyond. With that said, if we have an opportunity, as always, if we have an opportunity to renew early, if there's something the partner wants to change in the deal or something we want to change, we'll get together and see if we can kick the term out a few years. So that's something we're always actively trying to work on with our partners."", 'Brian J. Wenzel', ""The only thing I'd answer is or just to add, but you'll see in February, again, we'll continue to update the revenue that's under contract in (inaudible) and beyond, so expect that in February."", 'Mihir Bhatia', ""Excellent. And then just switching gears. In terms of the health of the consumer, it sounds like stable, still feel pretty good about it. So I was wondering about your underwriting posture here. Clearly, soft landing is becoming more of a consensus view.I know you aren't prone to big gyrations there. But -- how are you feeling about that underwriting posture. Maybe just talk about like what your standards look like today versus maybe 1 year ago or even 2019. Is this like 2024, like more of a normal year? Is there -- is it still a little on the tight side and the opportunity to loosen and drive growth? Just any comments there?"", 'Brian J. Wenzel', ""Yes. Here we're again, it's gotten a lot of issues are in trouble as they try to underwrite growth in the '21 and '22 vintages, which people are paying a price for now. Some refer to as growth plan, some refer to it as losing standards and lower returns. So we're not going to use credit as a mere growth lever for us. We are more prudent than we were a year ago. Again, we talked about we (inaudible) actions on partners and channels. I don't want to say every day, but more certainly, we watch it every day. We took broader-based actions, both in 2Q and 3Q, given the shared consumer and what other people have done from an underwriting basis.We were slightly encouraged in the fourth quarter as we've seen at the bureaus that other issues have begun to take credit actions, which will benefit -- which will benefit the industry in the latter part of 2024. But I think we're going to be cautious as we move throughout the year. We're going to continue to watch the trend of the consumer. Again, we haven't seen the consumer stretch. When we look at payment rates, the payment rate movements by credit rate have been relatively consistent, and probably the biggest mover has been in the [650] to 720 range than what you'd see in a nonprime person. So again, we look at it and say, okay, I don't see any consumer stretching from a spending standpoint and struggling. We don't see the payment rate changing. We're going to continue to watch the flow in the delinquency. Again, entry rate continues to be better than 2019, which again, the flow to (inaudible) gets worse whenever entry rate goes down. But generally -- we're generally cautiously optimistic on credit, and which is reflected in the guide of 5.75% to 6%."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.', 'Sanjay Harkishin Sakhrani', ""Brian Doubles, you were pretty active on the transaction front with the sale of the pet insurance business and part of the business and then the acquisition of the Ally Lending business. Could you just -- maybe a little bit more on sort of what drove those decisions? And then what the pipeline for other deals look like? I mean I think there's one big fish at least out there in terms of a portfolio. So maybe just talk about what the positioning is there."", 'Brian D. Doubles', ""Yes. Let me -- why don't I start with Ally because it's the more recent of the 2 transactions. I mean, look, I think we're super excited about this acquisition. I think it's actually great for both companies. These are conversations that JB and I started back in the first half of '23. I think this wasn't a scale business for Ally, but on our side, this is absolutely a scale business. This is exactly the type of acquisition that we look for. These are businesses and industries that we know really well. We obviously have a presence already in home improvement and health and wellness. In fact, as we got into this, we realized that we serve some of the same partners. So as I think about Ally, it really just complements and accelerates our current strategy. I also think that -- and Brian covered this, I got a very attractive financial profile. It's EPS accretive. It's got a nice ROA that will be in line or maybe a little bit better than the company average. We get 2,500 new merchants, we've got 500,000 new customers. So there's really a lot to like here. I mean this is a nice bolt-on acquisition for us and will be a nice add for both home and auto, but also health and wellness. And then Pets Best was really more opportunistic. We weren't looking to sell the pet insurance business. It's been a great business for us. We're obviously creating a lot of value in a relatively short period of time. We did a great job growing the business. From 2019, we grew the pets in force over 5x. We took the business to (inaudible) was #7 or #8 to the #4 pet (inaudible) insurance provider in the U.S. And when IPH approached us, there's a great offer, tough to turn it down. It's over 10x our original investment or (inaudible) after-tax gain. But I think more importantly than that, it allows us to stay invested in the pet space, and do it with someone, a great partner like IPH that has the scale that has the expertise. And so we think there's not only a nice financial gain, but a long-term strategic play here that will benefit us. So a nice way to close out the year with 2, I think, really great transactions."", 'Sanjay Harkishin Sakhrani', 'Other deals? What else is out there?', 'Brian D. Doubles', 'Sorry, Sanjay. One more. Say that again.', 'Sanjay Harkishin Sakhrani', 'Yes. You were saying -- I asked sort of what else might be out there? One big portfolio out there, I know. Yes.', 'Brian D. Doubles', ""Yes. Look, we got a lot on our plate. I'd start with that. We got to get both of these transactions closed, which we hope to do in the first quarter. We got a lot going on in 2024 for sure. With that said, we typically get invited into most RFPs in this space. And the things that are important to us haven't changed. We look for good risk-adjusted return. We look for -- we look for really good alignment with the partner. I think that's probably the most important thing, particularly when you're looking at large deals, you got to make sure that both partners like the deal in good times and bad times, that our interests are aligned around marketing and credit and underwriting and really all aspects of the program. So will always be in the market for opportunities that fit that screen."", 'Sanjay Harkishin Sakhrani', 'Got it. And just one follow-up. I guess, Brian Wenzel, like in your reserve coverage, what is -- or for the year, what are you assuming for the unemployment rate specifically?', 'Brian J. Wenzel', 'The unemployment rate as we exit out of 2024 is 4%.', 'Sanjay Harkishin Sakhrani', 'Got it.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Jeff Adelson with Morgan Stanley.', 'Jeffrey David Adelson', ""Last year, you ended up seeing your loan growth comment about the initial expectations of that kind of initial 8% to 10%. I guess I'm wondering if you think there's maybe some potential upside or a similar set up this year. And then more specifically, could you talk a little bit more about the specific drivers that you see getting you to the low end versus the high end of the range there on that 6% to 8% in terms of payment rate, consumer spend, new account growth and maybe even how addive you think that this installment opportunity could be to your growth? It seems like you're maybe leaning in a little bit more here with the acquisition and the prequalification launch this year?"", 'Brian J. Wenzel', ""Yes. When I look at the growth rate, Jeff, what gets you to the lower end of the range is a couple of things potentially, right? A softer consumer, right? The macroeconomic environment softens up, number one. Number two, payer rate remains more elevated than we anticipate you'll be at the low -- you could be at the lower end of that range. If we -- if the credit actions we've taken deliver more of a sales impact than we expect, again, it's not material in the whole, that could put to the low end of the range. Conversely, as you think about the high end of the range, if pay rates decline faster than we think, number one. If you see the economy maybe be a little bit more robust than what we're seeing on -- we gave you a GDP growth rate there, but the comp is a little more robust and we see spending elevate, you can see some more there. With regard to more certainly the home specialty, that's been a vertical inside of home and auto that has grown nicely for us. We'll continue to grow nicely for it. It's really not going to move the company average. So it's a nice acquisition, the acquisition itself is not necessarily generally going to material enough to move a lot of the underlying metrics. You'll get the (inaudible) day 1, and we'll certainly will grow as we create the synergies between our home specialty platform and what's a very attractive Ally Lending point-of-sale platform. So the combination will grow a little bit faster, but it shouldn't move the overall needle of the company."", 'Jeffrey David Adelson', ""Got it. And just a follow-up on the new expense ratio guide. I know in the past, you've given more of a quarterly dollar amount. It seems like you might be implying a pretty very low single-digit type expense growth next year. Is that right? And where do you think you're kind of gaining some efficiencies from here as marketing, lower comp, et cetera?"", 'Brian J. Wenzel', ""Yes. So first of all, on the switch to really efficiency ratio, Jeff, if you recall a number of years ago, we were actually on efficiency ratio, and that's what we guided long term. We (inaudible) during the pandemic because the implications to revenue, because of the paying rate dislocation that we saw. So we're trying to be more helpful to investors and analysts by going to dollars. Now we're just really migrating back to where we should be from an efficiency ratio standpoint and where the industry generally operates, number one. With regard to the expense dollars. If I look at controllable dollars, so if I take operational losses up, again, we can control them, but take that out for 1 second, and you remove marketing, which is more contractual for us. Based upon volume, we are growing expense at a slower rate. So we're getting operating leverage inside the company. We made several investments, as you saw in our notable items, both on a voluntary early retirement program as well as some smaller but again, meaningful impacts to our facilities that will drive a benefit in 2024.So I think from a controllable expense standpoint, they're going to be -- you're going to see operating leverage when it comes to that. With regard to operational losses, we've invested in some incremental tools that have there in some new strategies. So we expect that growth rate to really flatten out as you move '23 to '24."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI.', 'John G. Pancari', ""Just have a couple of follow-ups on the late fee topic. I guess in terms of the offsets, could you just remind us what is likely to be the most material mechanism in offsetting the impact of the late fees? Is it incremental fees or the underlying interest rate that you're dialing in? And then secondly, how -- can you talk about the competition for negotiating the offsets that you indicated are in place? Is it -- how heavy is it in terms of competition? Are there competitors out there willing to eat the cost, and could you possibly see any relationships move as a result of this?"", 'Brian D. Doubles', ""Yes. Let me start with the second one first. I think, look, we're all on a level playing field here in terms of the new late fee proposal. So as we're in there trying to -- whether it's a renewal or new business, the impact is the same. I think it all comes down to what is the issuers required rate of return, what are the things that are important to them. So I don't see it changing the competitive dynamic, much because it impacts us all equally. It really depends on the type of portfolio, what's important to the partner, the sharing, the alignment, all the things I talked about. So I don't think -- I don't see it having a big impact there. And particularly at the point in which we have some clarity here around the final rule, then I think it becomes even clearer in terms of what to bake in. And Brian, why don't you talk a little bit about the APRs and fees?"", 'Brian J. Wenzel', ""Yes. So obviously, John, we have a set of pricing strategy changes that will come through, some of which come through with a faster cadence in '24, which will be fee oriented as well as some policy orientation. And then there will be APR increases that build with some of which you'll see in 2024 if the rule gets issued and then build into 2025. So we'll be back. If the rule does get issued, we'll come back and probably provide a little bit more color with regard to how to think about that in the context of 2024."", 'Brian D. Doubles', ""Some of these will have a bigger short-term impact to only have a bigger long-term impact. And so we'll be in a position to provide a little more clarity when we have a final rule, and we start to roll out some of these actions."", 'John G. Pancari', ""Got it. Okay. Great. And then secondly, just around your purchase volume, I appreciate the color you gave in terms of the drivers between the different verticals.Overall, as you're looking at 2024, what's your expectation for total card purchase volume or overall purchase volume as you look at the full year versus 2023 and (inaudible) for overall account growth."", 'Brian J. Wenzel', ""Yes. So I'd say we're not specifically guiding John, on purchase volume. Obviously, you've seen the rate of asset growth decline from '23 to '24, there was some impact last year really around that asset growth of stemming from payment rates decline, which, again, we don't think it will have as big an impact in 2024. So I think you're going to see something generally consistent with probably last year. I mean, a good benchmark to sit back and say, we do see GDP at 1.7, we grow a multiple of that. So again, probably generally consistent with the last year. You got to remember, too, our purchase line at $185 billion for 2023 was record high for this company. So we are facing a difficult comp as we move into '24. But again, we're proud of the sales platforms and the differentiation and diversification that's inside of those platforms."", 'Operator', 'Our last question will come from Mark DeVries with Deutsche Bank.', 'Mark DeVries', 'I wanted to ask about your thoughts around preferred equity issuance for this year. Brian, does that need to be additive to total capital levels? Or does it free you up to replace some of that with or return some common? Talk a little bit about potential timing, what you kind of need to see from a market perspective and also how much you might look at issue?', 'Brian J. Wenzel', ""Yes. Thanks for the question, Mark. As we look at the capital stack, we fully developed our Tier 2. We have about 75 basis points, give or take, of capacity in Tier 1, which puts the max amount you probably can do just to reach the target level for Tier 1 of about $700 million to $750 million, ultimately that you'd want to do. We don't necessarily think of that relative to common equity as more as we want to develop.More certainly, the most cost-effective capital structure they want. The timing which is going to depend upon market conditions, rates throughout 2023, were incredibly high. It wasn't necessarily the best time to kind of ensure. We'll look at how the markets develop in 2024 and whether or not there's desire to invest or demand for the products, and we'll also look at the structure of whether or not that's a more retail-oriented preferred stock or not. So there's a number of different factors that go in. It just really goes into how do I fully develop all the levels of the capital stack from a regulatory standpoint."", 'Mark DeVries', 'Okay. Great. And then just a follow-up on kind of your updated thoughts on plans for how to deploy the capital created by the Pets Best sale?', 'Brian J. Wenzel', ""Yes. I don't think our priorities changed. We generated some capital in '23 by making some adjustments. We'll spend about 50 basis points of capital on the Ally transaction. We'll generate about 80 basis points on the Pet's Best sale and net of the investment that we're taking back in IPH. So I think that kind of goes in the pie. We will look to the priorities of organic growth, number one, maintaining the dividend, two. And then three, we'll look either at share repurchases or if there's other inorganic opportunities.Again, I think we're very focused when it comes to inorganic opportunities, it has to be the right thing. It has to be priced incredibly well, which we feel we got with Ally Lending. And so we'll be prudent when it comes to deploying that capital. But again, we're not changing the strategy or the cadence because of the Pets Best transaction."", 'Operator', 'Thank you for your participation.

I will now turn the call over to Brian Doubles."", 'Brian Doubles -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. Today, Synchrony reported strong fourth-quarter results, including net earnings of 440 million or $1.03 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 1.5%, and a return on tangible common equity of 14.7%. These fourth-quarter results contributed to a full-year 2023 net earnings of 2.2 billion or $5.19 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 2%, and a return on tangible common equity of 19.8%. This strong financial performance was supported by continued consumer resilience and powered by our multiproduct strategy and diversified sales platforms.', 'We achieved another year of record purchase volume totaling 185 billion for the full year and up 3% from last year. Our compelling products and value propositions helped drive the origination of almost 23 million new accounts in 2023 and also helped grow our average active accounts by 2.5%. The broad utility and value of our product offerings continue to resonate deeply with our customer base, leading to another year of record purchase volume. This combined with the continued moderation in payment rates to drive loan receivables growth of 11.4%.', 'Credit continued to normalize this fourth-quarter net charge-offs reach pre-pandemic levels, in line with our expectations and contributing to a full year net charge-off rate of 4.87%, still below our target underwriting range of 5.5% to 6%. We also drove continued progress toward our target operating efficiency ratio, demonstrating cost discipline while maintaining investments to ensure the long-term success of our franchise. And through strong execution and prudent capital management over time, Synchrony continued our long history of capital returns, including 1.5 billion returned to shareholders this year. Since 2016, we have paid 3.6 billion in dividends and reduced our outstanding shares by 50%.', ""Synchrony's ability to consistently generate and return capital to our shareholders is enabled by our differentiated business model, which prioritizes the sustained delivery of attractive risk-adjusted returns through changing market conditions and economic cycles. Our focused execution across key strategic priorities enables Synchrony's resilient returns by reinforcing our core strengths and facilitating our ongoing evolution to meet changing preferences and needs. With that in mind, Synchrony continued to grow and win new partners over the past year with the addition of more than 25 partners and over 30 renewed relationships. Among our new partnerships, we were excited to announce that J.Crew selected Synchrony to launch its first co-branded credit card, which will be a digital-first program with mobile wallet provisioning, robust preapproval capabilities, scan to apply and direct-to-device credit applications."", 'This competitive win is a testament to our culture of innovation, consistent investment in our digital ecosystem, and our strategic focus to empower our customers and partners to connect seamlessly through best-in-class omnichannel experiences. We also continue to diversify our programs, products, and markets during 2023, broadening the utility of our offerings and extending our reach. Synchrony believes in the power of choice, choice for our customers and partners, providers, and merchants as they engage in person and digitally across a full suite of everyday financing options. This year, we launched multiproduct prequalification and began presenting customers with side-by-side offers of both revolving and installment solutions to bring choice to the forefront.', 'These enhancements empower customers to weigh the benefits of various options in real time and make the decisions that best suit their financing needs in that moment. We continue to scale our Pay Later solution, which is now offered at over 200 provider locations in our health and wellness platform and at 18 retail partners. For our partners and providers, Pay Later seamlessly integrates into the broader partner relationship and product offering and provides another tool for deepening engagement with customers. And the response has been strong.', ""Since we've launched, partners who have offered these solutions have seen a 20% lift in new accounts, with 95% of Pay Later sales coming from net new customers. Synchrony's continued diversification and expansion of our offerings over the last year benefited from opportunities to extend our reach. In the fourth quarter, we announced the sale of our Pets Best insurance business, and through a minority interest from that sale, the opportunity to build a strategic partnership with Independence Pet Holdings, or IPH, one of the leading pet-focused companies in North America. Since acquiring the Pets Best business in 2019, we've grown pets in force by over 45% per year on average, more than double the industry's growth rate and become a leading pet insurance provider in the U.S."", ""We're very proud of what we've been able to achieve with such a great business and team, which enabled us to gain considerable insight into the pet industry, more broadly over the last four years. We are confident that IPH will be able to use its pet insurance expertise to unlock new opportunities for Pets Best and offer still greater value for Pets Best customers. And through the strategic relationship forged between IPH and ourselves, Synchrony is positioned to gain still greater exposure on insights into the rapidly growing pet industry as we seek to expand access to flexible pet care financing across the country. More recently, Synchrony announced still another opportunity to expand our business and accelerate our growth with the acquisition of Ally Lending's point-of-sale financing business."", 'This 2.2 billion loan portfolio consists of partnerships with nearly 2,500 merchant locations and supports more than 450,000 active borrowers in the home improvement services and healthcare industries. Through this acquisition, Synchrony will create a differentiated solution in the industry, simultaneously offering both revolving credit and installment loans at the point of sale and the home improvement vertical. This multiproduct presentation furthers our product diversification strategy, delivering consumer choice, while maximizing conversions and sales for our partners. This opportunity also enables Synchrony to expand our home specialty financing in roofing, windows, and electrical services.', ""We are excited about the natural synergies we see between Ally Lending and Synchrony's home and auto and health and wellness platforms. We look forward to leveraging our industry expertise and scale to drive operating efficiency and accelerate growth across platforms with attractive market opportunities and return profiles over time. And of course, Synchrony's ability to successfully deliver a breadth of financing solutions across an expansive distribution network is reliant on delivering best-in-class experiences with each customer interaction. This year, we continue to elevate the presence and utility of our offerings across in-person and digital transactions by adding digital wallet provisioning capabilities for eight partners, including PayPal and Venmo, Verizon, TJX, and Belk."", ""And our digital sales continue to grow at an outsized pace, climbing 9% to nearly 39% of our total 2023 sales. Over the last year, Synchrony launched the first phase of our marketplace on synchrony.com and within our native app, which shoppers can find hundreds of offers showcasing our partner brands paired with Synchrony's tailored multiproduct financing solutions. In fact, as Synchrony leverage our analytics and marketing capabilities to develop compelling cross-shopping opportunities in this initial launch, marketplace attracted over 220 million visits by shoppers for our partners, providers, and merchants as we more than doubled the number of partners participating. In summary, Synchrony is increasing any where our customer is looking to make a purchase or a payment, large or small, in person or digitally, and across an ever-expanding range of markets and industries."", ""We can meet them whenever and however they want to be met with a variety of flexible financing solutions to meet their needs in any given moment. Our ability to deliver the versatility of our financial ecosystem seamlessly across channels, industries, partners, and providers alike is what positions Synchrony so well to sustainably grow and deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns, particularly as customer needs and market conditions evolve. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian to discuss our financial performance in greater detail."", 'Brian Wenzel -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony's fourth-quarter results demonstrate the power of our differentiated business and financial model performing as designed. Our diversified sales platform in spend categories enabled record purchase volume growth as our disciplined underwriting and credit management kept credit performance in line with our expectations. Our retail share arrangements ensured alignment of economic interest between Synchrony and our partners."", ""As credit normalized toward historical pre-pandemic levels and funding costs increased from higher benchmark rates, our RSA payments were lower, providing a partial buffer to the economic environment and enabling Synchrony delivery of consistent, attractive risk-adjusted returns. And our strong balance sheet provides the flexibility to return capital to shareholders while investing in opportunities to achieve our longer-term strategic goals, all while delivering for our customers and partners and their evolving needs today. Overall, our prudent business management and differentiated financial model have positioned Synchrony to deliver sustainable outcomes for our customers, partners, and shareholders through an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop this past year and as we move forward in 2024. Now, let's turn to our fourth-quarter results."", 'Purchase volume increased 3% versus last year and reflected the breadth and depth of our sales platforms and the compelling value our products offer combined with the resilient consumer. In health and wellness, purchase volume increased 10%, reflecting broad-based growth in active accounts led by dental, pet, and cosmetic verticals. Digital purchase volume increased 5%, with growth in average active accounts and strong customer engagement. Diversified value purchase volume increased 4%, reflecting a higher in- and out-of-partner spend.', ""Lifestyle purchase volume increased 3% with stronger average transaction values in outdoor and luxury. In our home and auto, purchase volume decreased 4% as lower customer traffic, fewer large ticket purchases, and lower gas prices more than offset growth in home specialty, auto network, and commercial. Purchase volume across Synchrony dual and co-branded cards grew 9% and represented 43% of total purchase volume for the quarter, reflecting the broad utility and value that these products deliver for our customers. As we've discussed in the past, our out-of-partner spend is split roughly evenly between discretionary and nondiscretionary categories, and this trend held steady throughout the year."", 'In the fourth quarter, we saw some shift in categories as consumers shifted from travel spend to clothing, for instance, and from gasoline and automobiles toward spend at grocery and discount stores. We have not seen any meaningful changes in the overall composition between discretionary and nondiscretionary spend. The combination of broad-based purchase volume growth and approximately 110-basis-point decrease in payment rates drove ending loan receivables growth of 11.4%. Our fourth-quarter payment rate of 15.9% still remains approximately 115 basis points higher than our five-year pre-pandemic historical average.', 'Net interest income increased 9% to 4.5 billion, driven by a 16% growth in interest and fees. The increase in interest and fees reflected the combined impact of higher loan receivables and benchmark rates, as well as a lower payment rate. Our net interest margin of 15.10% declined 48 basis points compared to the prior year. The decrease largely reflected higher interest-bearing liability costs, which increased 169 basis points to 4.55% and reduced net interest margin by 138 basis points.', 'This impact was partially offset by 66 basis points of growth in loan receivables yields, which contributed 55 basis points to net interest margin. Higher liquidity portfolio yield added 29 basis points to net interest margin. And our loan receivables growth improved the mix of interest-earning assets, contributing 6 basis points to net interest margin. RSAs of $878 million in the fourth quarter or 3.49% of average loan receivables, a reduction of $165 million versus the prior year, reflecting higher net charge-offs, partially offset by higher net interest income.', 'Provision for credit losses increased to $1.8 billion, reflecting higher net charge-offs and a $402 million reserve build, which largely reflected the growth in loan receivables. Other expenses grew 14% to $1.3 billion. The increase primarily reflect the growth-related items as we continue to see strong growth in volumes as well as a return of operational losses to pre-pandemic average levels as a percent of our purchase volume. Expenses in the quarter also included several notable items including: $43 million in employee costs related to a voluntary early retirement program; $9 million in real estate-related restructuring charges as we continue to adjust our physical footprint in favor of a hybrid working environment; $9 million for the FDIC special assessment; $7 million of preparatory expenses in anticipation of a potential late fee rule change; and $5 million of transaction-related expenses related to the sale of Pets Best.', ""Our efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter improved by approximately 120 basis points compared to last year to 36%. Excluding the impact of the notable items in the quarter, our efficiency ratio would have been approximately 200 basis points lower in the fourth quarter. All in, Synchrony generated net earnings of $440 million or $1.03 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 1.5% and return on tangible common equity of 14.7%. Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 10."", 'Overall, we see the consumer remaining resilient as they manage through inflation and higher interest rates. The external deposit data we monitor also supports this view, as it shows average savings account balances returned closer to pre-pandemic levels during 2023 and remain relatively steady through the third and fourth quarters. At year-end, average industry savings balances remained approximately 9% above levels from 2020. Our disciplined through cycle underwriting and active credit management has positioned us well as we entered 2024.', ""Our delinquency ratios finished the year slightly above average levels from 2017 to 2019 prior to the pandemic. At year-end, our 30-plus delinquency rate was 4.74%, compared to 3.65% in the prior year and 12 basis points above our average for the fourth quarters of 2017 to 2019. Our 90-plus delinquency rate was 2.28% versus 1.69% last year and 4 basis points above our average for the fourth quarters of 2017 to 2019. And consistent with our expectations, Synchrony's net charge-offs reached 5.58% in the fourth quarter, compared to 3.48% in the prior year, at an average of 5.49% in the fourth quarters of 2017, 2018, and 2019."", 'We continue to monitor our portfolio and implement actions as necessary to proactively position our business for 2024 and beyond. Moving to reserves. Our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 10.26%, down 14 basis points from 10.40% in the third quarter. The reserve build of $402 million in the quarter was largely driven by receivables growth.', ""Turning to Slide 12. Synchrony's balance sheet continues to be a source of flexibility and strength. Our consumer bank offerings continue to resonate with customers in the fourth quarter, driving over $3 billion of growth in total deposits in the quarter or 13% compared to the prior year. At quarter-end, deposits represented 84% of our total funding, while securitized debt comprised 7% and unsecured funding 9%."", 'Total liquid assets and undrawn credit facilities were $19.8 billion, up $2.6 billion from last year and, at quarter-end, represented 16.8% of total assets, up 42 basis points from last year. Moving on to our capital ratios. As a reminder, we elected to take the benefit of the CECL transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies. Synchrony will continue to make its annual transitional adjustments to our regulatory capital metrics of approximately 50 basis points each January until 2025.', 'The impact of CECL has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, Synchrony made a change to its balance sheet presentation of contractual amounts related to our retailer partner agreements. At year-end, assets of approximately $500 million, which were previously classified as intangible assets, were reclassified to other assets, and prior periods were reclassified to perform to this presentation. This change in presentation had a corresponding impact to each of our regulatory capital metrics that resulted in an increase of approximately 50 basis points to our capital ratios in both the current and prior years.', ""Under the CECL transition rules and including this balance sheet change, we ended the fourth quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.2%, 110 basis points lower than last year's 13.3%. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.9%, compared to 14.1% last year. The total capital ratio decreased 60 basis points to 14.9%. And our Tier 1 capital plus reserve ratio on a fully phased-in basis decreased to 22.1% compared to 22.8% last year."", ""During the fourth quarter, we returned $353 million to shareholders, consisting of $250 million of share repurchases and $103 million of common stock dividends. At the end of the quarter, we had $600 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization. We're well positioned to return capital to shareholders as guided by our business performance, market conditions, regulatory restrictions, and subject to our capital plan. We will also continue to seek opportunities to complete the development of our capital structure through the issuance of additional preferred stock as conditions allow."", ""Synchrony remains committed to our capital allocation framework, which prioritizes investment in organic growth and payment of our regular dividends, followed by share repurchases and investments in inorganic growth opportunities, where the rates of return meet or exceed that of our other potential uses of capital. To that end, as Brian mentioned, Synchrony announced the acquisition of the Ally Lending point-of-sale financing business, which we view as a great opportunity to expand our leadership position in the home improvement and health and wellness verticals, while leveraging our industry expertise and scale to unlock still greater value. We've agreed to purchase approximately $2.2 billion of loan receivables at a discount. Upon closing the transaction and subject to the completion of purchase accounting, we expect our CET1 ratio to be reduced by approximately 50 basis points, inclusive of our provision for credit losses of approximately $200 million relating to the initial reserve builds."", 'Synchrony expects this acquisition to be accretive to full-year 2024 earnings per share, excluding the impact of the initial reserve build for credit losses. Upon integration of our business, conversion to our Prism underwriting model, and execution of our strategy, we expect to achieve attractive internal rate of return with approximately a 3.5-year tangible book value earn back. Additionally, the sale of our Pets Best business will result in approximately $750 million gain net of tax in 2024, which will contribute to an approximately 80-basis-point increase to our CET1 ratio, inclusive of the capital required to be held on the minority interest in IPH. Excluding the gain on sale, we expect the transaction to be neutral to earnings.', ""We're excited about the opportunities we have identified to continue to drive consistent growth and appropriate risk-adjusted returns and have established a long track record of execution across both strategic and financial objectives. During 2023, we drove strong growth in purchase volume, which combined with the payment rate moderation, to deliver solid growth in loan receivables. We are opportunistic in funding that growth and continue to expand our deposit franchise and, in turn, deliver attractive net interest income. Credit normalized in line with our expectations, and our RSA functioned as designed."", ""And finally, we fuel our commitment to deliver positive operating leverage. Turning to Slide 14. Let's review our outlook for 2024. Our baseline assumption for this discussion include: a stable macroeconomic environment, full-year GDP growth of approximately 1.7%, a year-end 2024 on unemployment rate of 4%, and an ending Fed funds rate of 4.75% with cuts beginning in the second half of 2024."", 'This outlook also assumes the closing of our Pets Best and Ally Lending transactions in the first quarter of 2024. And given the uncertainty of timing and implementation of a potential final rule regarding late fees, we have not assumed any related impact to our 2024 financial outlook. In the event that a final late fee rule is published, we will provide an update with the associated impact to our financial guidance. Starting with loan receivables.', 'We expect our compelling value propositions and the broad utility of our products will continue to drive purchase volume growth. We also expect payment rates to continue to moderate, although we anticipate they will remain above pre-pandemic levels through 2024. Together, these dynamics should deliver ending loan receivables growth of 6% to 8%. We expect full-year net interest income of $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion.', 'Net interest income should follow typical seasonal trends through the year adjusted for several impacts: one, higher interest-bearing liabilities expense as our fixed rate debt reprices with higher benchmark rates; two, the impact of competition for retail deposits and pace of deposit repricing once rate cuts begin. Our expectation is for betas to trend near 30% as rates begin to decline later in the year, thereby reducing impact to interest expense during 2024; and three, interest and fee yield growth, partially offset by higher income reversals. We expect net charge-offs of 5.75% to 6% within our targeted underwriting range of 5.5% to 6%. Losses are expected to peak in the first half before returning to pre-pandemic seasonal trends following the normalization of delinquency metrics in 2023.', 'We expect ROCs of 3.5% to 3.75% of average loan receivables for the full year. This reflects the impact of continued credit normalization, higher interest expense, and the mix of our loan receivables growth, partially offset by purchase volume growth. The reduction in RSA demonstrates the functional design of the RSA and the continued alignment of our interest with partners. And finally, we expect to reach an operating efficiency ratio of 32.5% to 33.5% for the year, driven primarily by the optimization of our loan yields as credit normalization occurs.', ""This outlook excludes the impact of the Pets Best gain on sale, which will be recognized in other income. We remain committed to delivering operating leverage for the full year and continuing to invest in our long-term success of our business. As demonstrated again this past year, Synchrony's purpose-built business and financial model is performing as designed. Through an evolving backdrop, our diversified portfolio of products and platforms continue to drive growth, our leading credit management ensures attractive risk-adjusted returns, our RSA provides a buffer against changes in economic performance, and our stable balance sheet creates opportunity."", ""Taken together, our business continued to deliver value for each of our stakeholders in 2023 and positioned well for 2024. I'll now turn the call back over to Brian for his closing thoughts."", 'Brian Doubles -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Brian. Synchrony delivered another strong performance in 2023. We executed on key strategic priorities that expand the breadth and depth of our customer acquisition and engagement; further diversify the products, services, and value we provide; and enhance the quality of the experiences we power for our customers, partners, providers, and merchants. This focus on deepening our core strengths while continuing to evolve with the ever-changing world of commerce has enabled Synchrony to deliver strong financial results and returns to our shareholders while also preparing our business for the future.', ""We are confident in our ability to continue to sustainably grow and deliver resilient risk-adjusted returns over time and are excited about both the near and longer-term opportunities we see ahead to deliver still greater value for our many stakeholders. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Kathryn to open the Q&A."", 'Kathryn Miller -- Senior Vice President, Investor Relations', ""That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now begin the Q&A session. So, that we can accommodate as many of you as possible, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the investor relations team will be available after the call."", 'Operator, please start the Q & A session.', '', 'Operator', ""[Operator instructions] As a reminder, please limit yourself to one primary question and one follow-up question. We'll take our first question from Terry Ma with Barclays. Please go ahead."", 'Terry Ma -- Barclays -- Analyst', ""Thanks. Good morning. Can you maybe just talk about the cadence we should expect for delinquencies in 2024? Should the fourth quarter or first quarter be kind of peak delinquencies? And then as we look forward out to 2025, can you maybe just talk about your confidence level that you'll stay within this net charge-off range of 5.75% to 6%."", 'Brian Wenzel -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Sure. Thanks, Terry. You know, when we look at our delinquency formation really in the fourth quarter, first, I think you have to recognize we normalize slower than all of our peers, which is partially attributable to the fact that we didn't really adjust the credit box during the pandemic. Our advanced underwriting tool, Prism, which we invested heavily in since 2017 and the data elements we bring in."", ""So, that really helped the formation as we exit out of 2023. It's important to note that when you look at both the 30-plus and the 90-plus delinquency rate that is in the fourth quarter, they're only 12 basis points and 4 basis points, respectively, over the three-year average from 2017 to 2019. So, -- and then when I look at the mix of credit that sits in delinquency today, it's substantially similar to that of the 2019 credit mix. So, when I look at that -- then look a little bit at the trending, Terry, and performance of delinquency."", ""When you look at it, the consistency of the growth month on month, year over year, 30-plus, 90-plus has not shown deterioration. It's been very consistent, a range between 109 basis points and 116 basis points each month, 90-plus has been between 55 and 63. So, it's been very consistent. Relative to seasonality, it's been generally aligned."", 'So, I look at those factors as we can enter -- entry rate continues to be better than 2019. So, now that roll that forward, what we expect from a charge-off perspective that your first half charge-offs are going to be higher in the first half, lower in the second half and should give you a range of 5.75% to 6% for the year, so inside of our underwriting target. Again, you recall that we did take actions in the second quarter and the third quarter, which we outlined. Those are beginning to season, and you should see the effects of those beginning into -- effect delinquencies here in the first of 2024.', ""So, with that, we feel good about where credit is. We'll continue to monitor the trends in credit, what's rolling in, but the positive entry rate, which has a slightly negative effect on the float to loss, but that positive enter rate is really encouraging for us as we enter the year."", 'Terry Ma -- Barclays -- Analyst', 'Got it. Thank you. And then my follow-up is on just the NII guide. It looks like you assumed about two rate cuts.', 'Can you maybe just talk about what we should expect if we get more than kind of two rate cuts for the year?', 'Brian Wenzel -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes. Thanks for that question, Terry. If I look at what we're projecting, we actually had three rate cuts really beginning in September of 2024 going through the end of the year, which -- I'll hit the point on beta, it's 30%. So, if you think about having rate cuts that late in the year, digital banks generally lag about 30 to 90 days with regard to when they start to move rates."", ""And then you also have to take into consideration the fact that in the fourth quarter when you want to maintain a higher level of financing to fund seasonal growth. So, that's why the beta is a little bit lower. If you were to get rate increases are more than that early in the year, you would get, in theory, some benefit on to the net interest margin and lower interest on interest bearing liabilities."", 'Terry Ma -- Barclays -- Analyst', 'Got it. Thank you.', 'Brian Wenzel -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Thanks, Terry.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.', 'Rick Shane -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', ""Thanks, everybody, for taking my questions this morning. Really just want to talk a little bit about the relationship between NCOs and RSA. When we look at the '24 guidance, '24 guidance from an NCO perspective basically puts you at the higher end but within the range of NCO targets. RSA looks a little bit lower than what we would have seen on a pre-pandemic basis."", ""And I'm assuming that's really not a function of credit but more a function of the interest rates. And as we look forward, if we assume net charge-offs wind up in that 5.5% to 6% target range but interest rates start to come down, will the RSA trend back up? I just want to sort of get a sense of what we should be looking at in a normal environment for that RSA ratio."", 'Brian Wenzel -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Sure. Thank you, Rick. The first thing, I'm going to continue to point you to Page 4 of our materials this morning, which shows the risk-adjusted return. Really, the relationship between NCOs and RSA, which generally trend in line with each other."", 'You are right. As you think about 2024, you do see some lift continuing on that charge-off line, which flows back through the RSA. You continue to get headwinds as the interest-bearing liabilities will reset. We have 92% of our CDs will reset in 2024.', ""Seventy-four percent of our debt will reset in 2024. So, you're going to have a full-year effect of the rate increases that we've seen in 2022 and 2023 flow through the book. And again, we're expecting, I think, in the guidance, we said, listen, payment rate does not get back to pre-pandemic levels. So, you're not getting the full interest and fee yield going back through."", 'You have higher interest-bearing liabilities, which will, in theory, benefit the company through a low RSA. To the extent that interest-bearing liabilities comes down faster through other resets, you would see an increase to the RSA.', 'Rick Shane -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', ""Great. That's it for me. Thank you, guys."", 'Brian Doubles -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Rick.', 'Brian Wenzel -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Thanks, Rick. Have a good day.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.', 'Ryan Nash -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'Good morning, guys.', 'Brian Wenzel -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Good morning, Ryan.', 'Ryan Nash -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', ""Brian, maybe as a follow-up to the first question. I just wanted to flush out the NII and NIM guide a little bit more. Can you maybe just talk about what gets us to the bottom end of the range to the top of the range? Obviously, it's a pretty wide range. And maybe just explain a little bit further what is the 30% beta."", 'Is that a point to point? Is that a downside? I just want to make sure we fully understand that. And lastly, just given that you were liability sensitive on the way up, do you still see a path to a 16% NIM and over what time frame? Thanks.', 'Brian Wenzel -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Yes. Thanks for the question, Ryan. So, let me deal with the beta comment first. So, when you think about beta, this is really the beta in year for really the end of the year.', ""I think if you think about betas over a longer period of time, so think about what you would see in a rate decline cycle here, I would not expect a beta 1. We didn't get one on the way up, so we wouldn't get one on the way down. When you look at our book of our portfolio of liabilities, we were approximately 80% beta on savings, 90% beta on CDs. I would expect that over that cycle coming down."", ""So, over time, you're going to see it kind of probably nearer the way it went up, it will mirror on the way down. So, that's how I would think about betas over the longer term. When you think about the net interest income, the question here becomes what is the assumption? If you go -- we have three rate cuts in, the market has six. Some have as early as March, some will certainly have interest-bearing liabilities starts earlier, and there's greater rate declines that could push your NII dollars up."", ""Conversely, if rates don't get cut off, it could push you a little bit lower. And the big other factor that's going to come through here is going to be what this payment rate continue to do. We have been conservative. I think I'm paying rates saying it doesn't get back to pre-pandemic levels."", ""I think it's been slower than our anticipated decline here in 2023. So, those are generally the moving pieces as I think how you would slide between the range of 17.5 to 18.5."", 'Ryan Nash -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'Got it. And maybe as a follow-up on credit, you talked about starting to see delinquencies follow more normal patterns and also charge-offs peaking by the second quarter. Brian, if your outlook proves to be correct, when do we start to see the allowance coming down? When does it peak and come down? And maybe just help us understand the potential magnitude that it could come down over the course of the year. Thank you.', 'Brian Wenzel -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes. So, we're entering the year at 10.26 on a covered rate basis. I would expect in the first quarter, you're going to see a rise and normally seasonally rise as your receivables go down, number one. Number two, vision of just under $200 million or around $200 million for the Ally Lending portfolio that we bring over."", ""There will be some on the purchase account in March that will increase that coverage very a little bit as well. It doesn't go through the P&L. So, you're going to see a rise really in the first quarter, call it, seasonally. We anticipate that it will be lower than the 10.26 as we exit out at '24 ]."", ""So, you're primarily going to see growth builds as we move throughout the year, but you will see rate declines, some of the QAs burn off or get realized. And again, if credit performs as we think it would be, you'd be exiting down. Towards the day one, we won't be at day one more certainly in 2024 but trending downwards as we move through the year."", 'Ryan Nash -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'Thanks for the color, Brian.', 'Brian Wenzel -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Thanks, Ryan.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.', 'Moshe Orenbuch -- TD Cowen -- Analyst', ""Great. Thanks. I know that your guidance doesn't contemplate the late fee ruling yet because it hasn't been issued. But maybe could you -- you did mention that you spent $7 million kind of in preparation."", ""Could you talk about the things that you are doing in preparation, and kind of any updated thoughts you have on the fact that we're sitting here kind of in the -- toward the end of January and haven't heard anything yet from CFPB?"", 'Brian Doubles -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes, sure, Moshe. I'll start on this. We're obviously still waiting for the final rule to be issued. But with that said, while there's still some unknown in terms of the implementation period and other things that we'll see in the final rule."", ""We've been working on this for almost a full year now at this point. It's very complicated. Our teams have done a lot of work in preparation for this. We spent a lot of time with our partners."", ""We've agreed on pricing actions and offsets that we would deploy when we see the final rule. So, it's really all the work that has been going on over the past year. I mean, it's systems work. You got -- you have to issue a lot of CIT's, change in terms."", ""And so, it's really that kind of stuff. I will say that the conversations with our partners have been very constructive. They fully recognize that without these offsets that a meaningful portion of their customers that we approve today and that we underwrite and give credit to would no longer have access to credit. And that's something clearly we do not want, they do not want."", 'So, really no change to what we said in the past. Our goal is to protect our partners, fully offset the impact of the final rule when it does come, and we want to continue to provide credit to the customers that we do today.', 'Moshe Orenbuch -- TD Cowen -- Analyst', 'Great. Thanks. And just as kind of as a second thought. When you look at the different kind of verticals, obviously, you had strong growth in 2023 and a couple of them in home and auto had been somewhat weaker, particularly as you get closer to year-end.', ""As you look into 2024, any changes in mix in terms of the growth, anything that you're seeing or launches and product refreshes that are going to drive in those various lines?"", 'Brian Doubles -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes. I think, look, generally, we would continue to expect outsized growth in health and wellness. That's a platform where we've accelerated investment in the past year or two. We're seeing really good growth from our acquisition of Allegro Credit."", ""It's a big market. We've got a leading position. This is dental, that cosmetic, great engagement in the partner network. And so, that's a platform we'll continue to invest in, and we would expect to see growth there on the higher side relative to the other platforms."", ""The other one I would mention is digital. That's where we've got Venmo, Verizon, PayPal, Amazon. And so, I think you'd continue to see some outsized growth there and then maybe a little bit softer in lifestyle and home and auto. I don't know, Brian, if you'd add anything to that."", 'Brian Wenzel -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""No, you'll see health and wellness in digital will be above average. Diversified value would be around company average, maybe a hair below. And then you'll see lifestyle. Listen, the home and auto trend, particularly in the home, what we're seeing there is lower foot traffic in the store."", ""And we see frequency, not necessarily terribly down, but it's more transaction values. Our people are -- they're buying a mattress, they're not buying high-end mattress, they're buying a little bit lower. So, we would expect that trend to continue into the start of 2024."", 'Moshe Orenbuch -- TD Cowen -- Analyst', 'Thanks so much.', 'Brian Doubles -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Moshe.', 'Brian Wenzel -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Thanks, Moshe.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies. Please go ahead.', 'John Hecht -- Jefferies -- Analyst', ""Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions, guys. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But I guess one of the questions I have is, I think we've had depleted recoveries on the charge-off side, part of that equation over the past couple of years. I'm wondering, Brian, to what degree does maybe a recovery in recoveries impact the NCO guide?"", 'Brian Wenzel -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes. Thanks for the question, John, and good morning. When we look at recoveries, we've done a couple of things really to the pandemic. Number one, we made a strategic shift to in-source our recovery operations."", 'So, we used to have a lot of it externally managed. We brought it in now. So, which effectively drove rate increases on ultimate recoverability of dollars written off. So, that was a positive as you move through.', ""You are right. When you look at -- particularly when you're doing some level of forward flow on a rate basis, that's down and your total charge-offs were down. But I think the swing that we had of being more efficient by in-sourcing has helped to offset that. So, I think on a relative percentage, it's been flat."", ""Most certainly, it should rise as we step out of 2023 for a couple of reasons. Number one, your rate will get more volume just on a net charge-off basis. And then if you do see an easing of rates, the cost of capital associated with people who purchase written off paper should go down, you'll get better pricing in the market. So, there's a number of different dynamics for us that it hasn't been much of an issue on net charge-offs, and probably exiting out of '24 maybe provides a tailwind beyond."", 'John Hecht -- Jefferies -- Analyst', ""OK. And maybe kind of a higher-level question. I think, Brian, I think you mentioned you still have nondiscretionary versus discretionary purchase activity was consistent. I'm wondering, I mean, given inflation is stabilizing, we've got student loan repayments turned back on, are you seeing anything on the margin that would reflect changing consumer behavior? Or is it just sort of been steady as she goes given those changes in the macro?"", 'Brian Wenzel -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes. As we highlighted, John, what we're seeing a little bit of a rotation out of some of travel into some of the other items. Again, that was a trend more in the fourth quarter. We would expect travel to ease as you move into 2024."", ""So, that's bigger shift. We do not see the shift between discretionary, nondiscretionary. We do not see a shift where the consumer is trying to really stretch dollars. We do see our transaction values down and frequency up a little bit, which means that as the consumer is making purchases, they are trying to be efficient with the dollars but not really pulling back."", ""So, as I look at that, I don't see big overwhelming trends. I would tell you for the first 20 days, and I always put that as a frame reference, sales have been a little bit softer than expectations as we entered into 2024, but that's only 20 days of data. And if I talk to some of my retail friends, they would tell you weather did play a factor. You had several states that have been cold and significant storms, but there's been lower foot traffic generally across the board as we started 2024."", 'John Hecht -- Jefferies -- Analyst', 'Great. Appreciate the color.', 'Brian Doubles -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, John.', 'Brian Wenzel -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Thanks, John. Have a good day.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Please go ahead.', 'Mihir Bhatia -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. Maybe to start with, I wanted to ask about portfolio renewals and just portfolio movements. And I apologize, it's a two-part question. But firstly, can you just remind us of your renewal cadence? Are there any large programs coming up for renewal here in the next 24 months? And then second part is just we've gone through a period of credit normalization."", ""You still have the late fee rule outstanding. So, I was wondering what the environment is like for renewals and RFPs. Currently as you talk to retailers, are retailers waiting for a little bit more certainty? Or -- I mean, I know you announced J.Crew this morning. You're also buying the Ally portfolio."", 'But like what about the other big retail programs? Or do you send like -- but can you put your pipeline in context maybe like what it looks like and just put that into context for us relative to last year or a few years ago or a normal environment? Thanks.', 'Brian Doubles -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah, yeah. So, I would say first -- I'll take the second part first, which is late fees and how that's impacting the pipeline. I do think it does make pricing new business, even renewals, to some extent, a little more challenging, but we've been able to kind of work through that. You mentioned J.Crew."", ""We're excited to announce that new program. But you got to spend time, that's part of the negotiation, right? And there's speculation there and there's some uncertainty. And so, you kind of got to try and cover yourself for those possible outcomes, which we believe we've done. So, it does make, I think pricing new business or renewals a little more challenging."", ""I do think there'll be some clarity here in the next month or two, and that will clear that up and make things a little bit easier from that perspective. But it has influenced, I think, not only us, but other market participants. It's a big part of the conversation once she gets through. The way I think about the kind of the BD or the sales process, it's a lot about capabilities, technology, data analytics, data share, all those things."", ""But then when you get to the financials, this is a big part of the discussion that's crept in there over the last 12 months, just given the uncertainty. The other thing just in terms of our pipeline for renewals, the vast majority of our programs are out there 2026 and beyond. With that said, if we have an opportunity, as always, if we have an opportunity to renew early, if there's something the partner wants to change in the deal or something we want to change, we'll get together and see if we can kick the term out a few years. So, that's something we're always actively trying to work on with our partners."", 'Brian Wenzel -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""The only thing I'd answer is -- or just to add, but you'll see in February, again, we'll continue to update the revenue that's under contract in '26 and beyond. So, expect that in February."", 'Mihir Bhatia -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Excellent. Thank you. And then just switching gears. In terms of the health of the consumer, it sounds like stable, still feel pretty good about it.', ""So, I was wondering about your underwriting posture here. Clearly, soft landing is becoming more of a consensus view. I know you aren't prone to big gyrations there, but how are you feeling about that underwriting posture? Maybe just talk about like what your standards look like today versus maybe one year ago or even 2019. Is this like 2024, like more of a normal year? Is there -- is it still a little on the tight side and the opportunity to loosen and drive growth? Just any comments there?"", 'Brian Wenzel -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes. Here again, it's gotten a lot of issues are in trouble as they try to underwrite growth in '21 and '22 vintages, which people are paying a price for now. Some refer to those growth. Some refer to it as losing standards and lower returns."", ""So, we're not going to use credit as a mere growth lever for us. We are more prudent than we were a year ago. Again, we talked about we do idiosyncratic actions on partners and channels. I don't want to say every day, but certainly, we watch it every day."", ""We took broader-based actions, both in 2Q and 3Q, given the shared consumer and what other people have done from an underwriting basis. We were slightly encouraged in the fourth quarter as we've seen at the bureaus that other issues have begun to take credit actions, which will benefit -- which will benefit the industry in the latter part of 2024. But I think we're going to be cautious as we move throughout the year. We're going to continue to watch the trend of the consumer."", ""Again, we haven't seen the consumer stretch. When we look at payment rates, the payment rate movements by credit rate have been relatively consistent. And probably the biggest mover has been in the 6.60 to 7.20 range than what you'd see in a non-prime person. So, again, we look at it and say, OK, I don't see any consumer stretching from a spending standpoint and struggling."", ""We don't see the payment rate changing. We're going to continue to watch the flow in the delinquency. Again, entry rate continues to be better than 2019, which again, the flow to loss gets worse whenever entry rate goes down. But we generally -- we're generally cautiously optimistic on credit, which is reflected in the guide of 5.75 to 6."", 'Mihir Bhatia -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Brian Wenzel -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Thanks, Mihir. Have a good day.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead.', 'Sanjay Sakhrani -- Keefe, Bruyette and Woods -- Analyst', ""Thanks. Good morning. Brian Doubles, you were pretty active on the transactions front with the sale of the pet insurance business and part of the business and then the acquisition of the Ally Lending business. Could you just maybe a little bit more on what drove those decisions and then what the pipeline for other deals look like? I mean, I think there's one big fish at least out there in terms of a portfolio."", 'So, can you just talk about what the positioning is there?', 'Brian Doubles -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah, let me -- well, why don't I start with Ally because it's the more recent of the two transactions. I mean, look, I think we're super excited about this acquisition. I think it's actually great for both companies. These were conversations that JB and I started back in the first half of '23."", ""I think this wasn't a scale business for Ally, but on our side, this is absolutely a scale business. This is exactly the type of acquisition that we look for. These are businesses and industries that we know really well. We obviously have a presence already in home improvement and health and wellness."", ""In fact, as we got into this, we realized that we serve some of the same partners. So, as I think about Ally, it really just complements and accelerates our current strategy. I also think that, and Brian covered this, got a very attractive financial profile, it's EPS accretive, it's got a nice ROA that'll be in line or maybe a little bit better than the company average. We get 2,500 new merchants."", ""We get 500,000 new customers. So, there's really a lot to like here. I mean, this is a nice bolt-on acquisition for us and will be a nice ad for both home and auto, but also health and wellness. And then Pets Best was really more opportunistic."", ""We weren't looking to sell the pet insurance business. It's been a great business for us. We're obviously creating a lot of value in a relatively short period of time We did a great job growing the business. From 2019, we grew the pets in force over 5x."", ""We took the business to number seven or number eight to the number four pet insurance provider in the U.S. And when IPH approached us, it was a great offer, tough to turn it down. It's over 10x our original investment. We'll record a nice after-tax gain."", ""But I think more importantly than that, it allows us to stay invested in the pet space and do it with someone, a great partner like IPH that has the scale, that has the expertise. And so, we think there's not only a nice financial gain, but a long-term strategic play here that will benefit us. So, it's a nice way to close out the year with two, I think, really great transactions."", 'Sanjay Sakhrani -- Keefe, Bruyette and Woods -- Analyst', 'Other deals? What else is out there?', 'Brian Doubles -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Sorry, Sanjay. One more, say that again?', 'Sanjay Sakhrani -- Keefe, Bruyette and Woods -- Analyst', 'Yeah, you were saying -- I asked what else might be out there? One big portfolio out there right now.', 'Brian Doubles -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. Look, we got a lot on our plate. I'd start with that. We got to get both of these transactions closed, which we hope to do in the first quarter."", ""We got a lot going on in 2024 for sure. With that said, we typically get invited into most RFPs in this space, and the things that are important to us haven't changed. We look for a good risk-adjusted return. We look for really good alignment with the partner."", ""I think that's probably the most important thing, particularly when you're looking at large deals. You've got to make sure that both partners like the deal in good times and bad times, that our interests are aligned around marketing and credit and underwriting and really all aspects of the program. So, we'll always be in the market for opportunities that fit that screen."", 'Sanjay Sakhrani -- Keefe, Bruyette and Woods -- Analyst', 'Got it. And just one follow-up. I guess, Brian Wenzel, like in your reserve coverage, what do you -- or for the year, what are you assuming for the unemployment rate specifically?', 'Brian Wenzel -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'The unemployment rate as we exit out of 2024 is 4%.', 'Sanjay Sakhrani -- Keefe, Bruyette and Woods -- Analyst', 'Got it. All right, great. Thank you.', 'Brian Doubles -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Sanjay. Have a good day.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Jeff Adelson with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.', 'Jeff Adelson -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', ""Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Last year you ended up seeing your loan growth come in about the initial expectations of that kind of initial 8% to 10%. I guess I'm wondering if you think there's maybe some potential upside or a similar setup this year? And then more specifically, could you talk a little bit more about the specific drivers that you see getting you to the low end versus the high end of the range there in that 6% to 8% in terms of payment rate, consumer spend, new account growth, and maybe even how additive you think that this installment opportunity could be to your growth? It seems like you're maybe leaning in a little bit more here with the acquisition and the pre-qualification launch this year."", 'Brian Wenzel -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. When I look at the growth rate, Jeff, what gets you to the lower end of the range is a couple of things potentially, right? A softer consumer, right? The macroeconomic environment softens up, number one. Number two, payment rate remains more elevated than we anticipate. You'll be at the low -- could be at the lower end of that range."", ""If we -- if the credit actions we've taken deliver more of a sales impact than we expect, again, it's not material in whole, that could put you lower than range. Conversely, as you think about the high end of the range, if payment rates decline faster than we think, number one. If you see the economy maybe be a little bit more robust than what we're seeing on -- we gave you GDP growth rate there, but the economy's a little more robust, and we see spending elevate. You can see some more there."", ""With regard to, well, certainly the home specialty, that's been a vertical inside of home and auto that has grown nicely for us, will continue to grow nicely for us. It's really not going to move the company average, so it's a nice acquisition. The acquisition itself is not necessarily generally going to be material enough to move a lot of the underlying metrics. You'll get the pop day one and most certainly it will grow as we create the synergies between our home specialty platform and what's a very attractive Ally Lending point-of-sale platform."", ""So, the combination will grow a little bit faster, but it shouldn't move the overall needle of the company."", 'Jeff Adelson -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', ""Got it. And just to follow up on the new expense ratio guide, I know in the past you've given more of a quarterly dollar amount. It seems like you might be implying a pretty very low single-digit type expense growth next year. Is that right, and where do you think you're kind of gaining some efficiencies from here? Is it on marketing, lower comp, etc.?"", 'Brian Wenzel -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. So, first of all, on the switch to really efficiency ratio, Jeff, if you recall a number of years ago, we were actually on efficiency ratio and that's what we guided long term. We pivot during the pandemic because of the implications to revenue, because of the payment rate dislocation that we saw. So, we're trying to be more helpful to investors and analysts by going to dollars."", ""Now, we're just really migrating back to where we should be from an efficiency ratio standpoint and where the industry generally operates, number one. With regard to the expense dollars, if I look at controllable dollars, so if I take operational losses out, we can control them, but take that out for one second, and you remove marketing, which is more contractual for us based upon volume. We are growing expense at a slower rate. So, we're getting operating leverage inside the company."", ""We need several investments as you saw in our notable items, both on a voluntary early retirement program as well as some smaller but again, meaningful impacts to our facilities that will drive a benefit in 2024. So, I think from a controllable expense standpoint, they're going to be -- you're going to see operating levers when it comes to that. With regard to operational losses, we've invested in some incremental tools that have there some new strategies. So, we expect that growth rate to really flatten out as we move '23 to '24."", 'Jeff Adelson -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', 'Great. Thank you.', 'Brian Wenzel -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Thanks, Jeff. Have a good day.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI.', 'John Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', ""Good morning. Just have a couple of follow-ups on the late fee topic. I guess in terms of the offsets, can you just remind us what is likely to be the most material mechanism in offsetting the impact of the late fees? Is it incremental fees or the underlying interest rates that you're dialing in? And then, secondly, how -- can you talk about the competition for negotiating the offsets that you indicated are in place? Is it -- how heavy is it in terms of competition? Are there competitors out there willing to eat the cost? And could you possibly see any relationships move as a result of this?"", 'Brian Doubles -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. Let me start with the second one first. I think we're all on a level playing field here in terms of the new late fee proposal. So, as we're in there trying to, whether it's a renewal or new business, the impact is the same."", ""I think it all comes down to what is the issuers required rate of return, what are the things that are important to them. So, I don't see it changing the competitive dynamic much because it impacts us all equally. It really depends on the type of portfolio, what's important to the partner, the sharing, the alignment, all the things I talked about. So, I don't think it will have -- I don't see it having a big impact there."", ""And particularly at the point at which we have some clarity here around a final rule, then I think it becomes even clearer in terms of what to bake in. And, Brian, why don't you talk a little bit about the APRs and fees?"", 'Brian Wenzel -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. So, obviously, John, we have a set of pricing strategy changes that will come through, some of which come through with a faster cadence in 2024, which will be fee oriented as well as some policy orientation. And then there will be APR increases that build with some of which you'll see in 2024 if the rule gets issued and then build into 2025. So, we'll be back if the rule does get issued."", ""We'll come back and probably provide a little bit more color with regard to how to think about that in the context of 2024. Some of these will have a bigger short-term impact; some of them will have a bigger long-term impact. And so, we'll be in a position to provide a little more clarity when we have a final rule and we start to roll out some of these actions."", 'John Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', 'Got it. OK, great. Thank you. And then, secondly, just around your purchase volume, I appreciate the color you gave in terms of the drivers between the different verticals.', ""Overall, as we're looking at 2024, what's your expectation for total card purchase volume or overall purchase volume as you look at the full year versus 2023 and the same for overall account growth? Thanks."", 'Brian Wenzel -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. So, I'd say, we're not specifically guiding, John, on purchase volume. Obviously, you've seen the rate of asset growth decline from 2023 to 2024. There was some impact last year really around that asset growth of -- stemming from payment rates decline, which again, we don't think it will have as big an impact in 2024."", ""So, I think you're going to see something generally consistent with probably last year. I mean, a good benchmark is sit back and say, we do see GDP at 1.7%. We grow multiple of that. So, again, probably generally consistent with the last year."", ""You've got to remember, too, our purchase volume at $185 billion for 2023 was a record high for this company. So, we are facing a difficult comp as we move into 2024. But again, we're proud of the sales platforms and the differentiation and diversification that's inside of those platforms."", 'John Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', 'OK, great. Thank you.', 'Brian Wenzel -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Thanks, John. Have a good day.', 'Operator', 'Our last question will come from Mark DeVries with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.', 'Mark DeVries -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst', 'Yeah, thanks. I wanted to ask about your thoughts around preferred equity issuance for this year. Brian, does that need to be additive to total capital levels, or does it free you up to replace some of that with or return some common? Talk a little bit about potential timing, what you kind of need to see from a market perspective, and also how much you might look to issue?', 'Brian Wenzel -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. Thanks for the question, Mark. As we look at the capital stack, we fully developed our Tier 2. We have about 75 basis points, give or take, of capacity in Tier 1, which puts the max amount you probably can do just to reach the target level for Tier 1 of about $750 -- $700 million to $750 million, ultimately that you'd want to do."", ""We don't necessarily think of that relative to common equity as more as we want to develop, most certainly the most cost-effective capital structure that we want, the timing of which is going to depend upon market conditions. Rates throughout 2023 were incredibly high and wasn't necessarily the best time to kind of issue it. We'll look at how the markets develop in 2024 and whether or not there's desire to invest or demand for the products. And we'll also look at the structure of whether or not that's a more retail-oriented preferred stock or not."", ""So, there's a number of different factors that go in. It just really goes into how do I fully develop all the levels of the capital stack from a regulatory standpoint."", 'Mark DeVries -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst', 'OK, great. And then just to follow-up on kind of your updated thoughts on plans for how to deploy the capital created by the Pets Best sale.', 'Brian Wenzel -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. I don't think our priorities change. We generated some capital in '23 by making some adjustments. We'll spend about 50 basis points of capital on the Ally transaction."", ""We'll generate about 80 basis points on the Pets Best sale and net of the investment that we're taking back in IPH. So, I think that kind of goes [Inaudible]. We will look to the priorities of organic growth, number one; maintaining the dividend, two; and then three, we'll look either at share of purchases or if there's other inorganic opportunities. Again, I think we're very focused when it comes to inorganic opportunities."", ""It has to be the right thing. It has to be priced incredibly well, which we feel we got with Ally Lending. And so, we'll be prudent when it comes to deploying that capital. But again, we're not changing the strategy or the cadence because of the Pets Best transaction."", 'Mark DeVries -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst', 'Got it.

Rare coins with minting errors or other unique features tend to bring high prices, as do those in mint or near-mint condition.', 'As The Spruce Crafts noted, many collectors of U.S. coins began with the Lincoln penny and took most of them out of circulation.

Prices range from $10,000 to $30,000 and more.', 'In 1909, the U.S. Mint replaced the Indian Head penny with the Lincoln cent, according to The Spruce Crafts. Slightly less than 500,000 of these pennies were minted before the Treasury Department “demanded that the initials be removed,” — the initials of designer Victor David Brenner (VDB) between the two wheat stalks — which created heavy demand among collectors. This penny is currently valued at more than $117,000 in top condition.', 'Slightly more than 4 million were minted and most went into circulation. What makes certain coins of this date rare is their “exceptional condition,” according to The Spruce Crafts. Some of the more valuable examples are so well preserved you can still see the original bright red-copper color. These coins are valued at $126,500 and in particularly excellent condition (the price listed is for an MS-67, or high mint state, for example).', 'Here is another coin valued at $126,500 (at least, in MS-64 condition) — and most of that value is due to doubling on the date and lettering on the obverse. The errors were first discovered in 1970. The U.S. government at first believed these were counterfeit coins and began confiscating them, The Spruce Crafts noted.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion about the travel industry, travel safety, and tourism trends, head over to the 5 Safest Countries For US Travelers In The World.\xa0', 'The United States is one of the major economies contributing to global travel and tourism in 2023. In the next decade, the US travel and tourism industry is expected to generate more than $2 trillion for the US economy. However, a significant proportion of Americans look forward to visiting other countries, which has become more challenging in the last five years because of Covid 19 pandemic and the global political environment.', 'The travel industry, valued at $10 trillion in 2019, is set to be worth $15.5 trillion by 2033. While the years following the COVID-19 pandemic took a hit on the travel industry, it is expected to grow in the next ten years. This is already evident in the increase in stock prices of companies such as Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) and Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) in the last twelve months. Both companies suffered a 10% and 15% decline respectively in stock prices amid travel restrictions, inflation, and the Ukraine-Russia war over the last five years. However, these booking companies suffered next to nothing, when compared to airline companies. During the pandemic, the travel industry lost around $230 billion, more than 70% of which could be attributed to the airline sector.\xa0', ""Amid the rising tensions and deteriorating global peace, looking for the safest places to travel is essential. American travelers usually rely on the State Department's U.S. Travel Advisory System, which gives country-by-country guides to minimize the risk of crime, violence, or civil unrest. Travel safety entails preparedness and avoiding danger, which can come in various forms. Some places may not have hostility against Americans, but they may have risks of natural disasters. "", 'So, it is essential to have real-time information about global and natural incidences that might affect you while traveling. Travel difficulties can also come in the form of health. Some companies work to assist travelers if they encounter any emergencies during their travel. Travel insurance will usually cover medical expenses, evacuations, loss or delay, among other things. ', ""Some of the top companies in the travel insurance market are Chub Limited (NYSE:CB) and Zurich Insurance Group AG (OTC:ZURVY). Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB) recently announced its 'Studio Developer Portal'. It will offer B2B2C partners access to digital insurance products and services. Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB)'s portal will allow customers to explore a wide array of campaigns and applications, by integrating insurance propositions, products, services, and claims."", 'The Studio Developer Portal aims to capitalize on the smart tourism trend, which has been recently increasing in popularity. Smart tourism integrates technologies like cloud computing, AI, IOT, ICT, and mobile communication to make traveling easy. Reservations, planning, and location tracking, are some of the features that smart tourism applications provide to their users. Another rising tourism trend is sustainable tourism. ', 'Recently, the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) launched its Sustainable Tourism for Development Programme, which will provide funding and technical assistance to developing countries so they can implement sustainable tourism strategies. Sustainable tourism has already become so popular that, according to a report by the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC), it contributed $3.5 trillion to the global economy in 2022 and supported 330 million jobs. Companies that operate in the travel and tourism industry know the importance of this trend and are committed to utilizing it to their advantage. ', ""Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) is developing a comprehensive Climate Action Plan. The company is actively promoting sustainable travel options to travelers. This Climate Action Plan is part of Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE)'s Open World™ social impact and sustainability strategy, which focuses on three key pillars: Inclusive Access, Economic Mobility, and a Prosperous Planet. This seems to be working well for the company as Patient Capital Management made the following comment about Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) in its Q3 2023 Investor letter."", '""At Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE), we believe the market is underappreciating the company’s transformation. Over the past few years, the company has prioritized its top three brands (expedia.com, hotels.com, vrbo.com), successfully implemented a single technology stack, and officially rolled out OneKey their combined loyalty program, across all brands. With strong free cash flow generation, the company continues to buy back their stock, creating a positive flywheel of shareholder return.""', ""With this backdrop, let's look at the safest countries for US travelers.\xa0"", 'oneinchpunch/Shutterstock.com', ""For our list of the safest countries for US travelers, we relied on three (1,2,3) sources. One of our sources also considered state departments' travel advisories, among other factors. For each source, we listed the countries according to their rank. Then, for each country, we assigned it a score equal to the total number of countries in the ranking divided by the rank of the countries. For example, if a country was second in a ranking of 50 countries, it got a score of 25 (50/2) for that source. Then for each country, we totalled the score from every source to determine the Insider Monkey Travel Safety Score. The higher this score, the safer the country is for American travelers.\xa0"", 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

Eric Sheridan, Senior Equity Research Analyst at Goldman Sachs, joins Yahoo to discuss why he gave a ""Buy"" rating on Expedia and why the travel industry may be a smart play going forward.', 'Sheridan gives insight to his rating: ""We believe they\'re coming out of a technology re-platforming initiative that could be a tailwind for margins in \'24 and beyond. Last quarter, the reason why the stock rallied as much as it did in Q4 was they announced a very large stock repurchase program to purchase upwards of 35, 40% of the stock over the next couple of years and we don\'t even think that\'s as properly modeled yet on the Street, looking out at Street numbers.""', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino"", ""- All right, and Eric, let's talk a little bit more about one of your plays that caught our attention, and that's Expedia. And the reason why we were a bit surprised by the fact that you had a buy rating on the stock is given the fact that this macro narrative that we've been talking about, the consumer is weakening, they're going to be pulling back on some of their spending. Why, despite all of that, do you think a name like Expedia is still well-positioned in this environment?"", 'ERIC SHERIDAN: Well, look, we track travel data daily, weekly, monthly. Travel is not heading towards a recession as we speak right now. Travel is normalizing. Now yes, there was a pandemic impact to travel, followed by a post-pandemic recovery in travel. Some people called it revenge travel, over the better part of two, 2 and 1/2 years as we all stopped sheltering in place and began to travel again. And everything we can track would tell you that travel is normalizing.', ""Meaning if you go back to 2019, online travel companies grew high single digits. Low double digits, we think a company like Expedia can grow with those levels. In 2024 and beyond, we believe they're coming out of a technology replatforming initiative that could be a tailwind for margins in '24 and beyond. And last quarter, the reason why the stock rallied as much as it did in Q4, was they announced a very large stock repurchase program to purchase upwards of 35%, 40% of the stock over the next couple of years. And we don't even think that's as properly modeled yet on the street, looking at a street numbers."", ""So you've got a buyback tailwind as well as a normalization tailwind. Obviously, if the consumer were to dramatically weaken, which is not our base case that would act as a headwind, but you still have that stock buyback, we believe, giving you a cushion on the shares at a fairly low valuation to growth."", ""- All right. And we'll get those results in just about two weeks. Eric Sheridan, always great to get your insight. Thanks so much for joining us here this morning. Goldman Sachs' senior equity research analyst covering the US internet sector. Thanks so much, Eric."", 'ERIC SHERIDAN: Thank you.']"

It was the first time the head of a major online travel agency was invited to speak at the conference — arguably the largest one for hotel owners and developers.', 'Some backstory: Hotels have long set aside some rooms at discounted wholesale rates for contracted partners to offer to specific, coveted travelers. A hotel might offer wholesale rates to a tour operator to bundle with a flight in a discounted vacation package, for example.', 'Kern complains that some agencies are breaking the rules.', '“Wholesale rates get out in the world where they’re unintended, and ‘unintended’ means they are available at the retail marketplace on other OTAs [online travel agencies] and comparison sites,” Kern said. “All of a sudden, people are showing up at your front desk with a rate that your desk doesn’t know how the hell it got there.”', 'Kern’s team at Expedia has worked with Marriott and other major hotel chains to curb the distribution of rates. However, the “wholesale leakage” problem continues to plague independent and regional hotel groups.', 'Why don’t more hotels care, given that they’re the ones who are being undercut on price? A few reasons: It’s filling rooms with guests, and that’s what general managers are judged on for performance. It also takes some time and money to tighten one’s distribution.', 'The rogue rates are also hard to track.', '“You may not even see the rates because they’re gated to geography,” Kern said.', 'If you’re based in the U.S. and you search for rates at your company’s hotel in Vietnam, it may look fine on the price-comparison sites you use, Kern said. But travelers searching sites in Asia Pacific may see other, cheaper rates.', 'Kern conceded that some hotels just aren’t that concerned. But he found that puzzling.', '“If you end up filling your room at 30% off and killing your direct-to-consumer rates, I don’t know where that gets you long-term,” Kern said.', 'Expedia Asked Google to Crack Down on Bait and Switch Hotel Rates', 'Expedia CEO Calls Out Rival Agoda: How They Get Those Cheap Prices', 'Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.']"

Taiclet', ""Thanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings call. In 2023, the 122,000 men and women of Lockheed Martin, working closely with our customers, made excellent progress advancing our 21st Century security strategy and delivered strong financial results for our shareholders.Turning to Chart 3. Robust demand for our broad portfolio of aircraft, helicopters, satellites, radar systems and other products, services and advanced digital technologies boosted backlog to a record $161 billion. Full year sales of $67.6 billion increased 2% year-over-year and came in stronger than anticipated, as did earnings per share of $27.55. To position the company to take full advantage of these future growth opportunities, we invested more than $3 billion across research and development and capital in 2023. We generated $6.2 billion of free cash flow, as expected, which resulted in year-over-year free cash flow per share percentage growth in the mid-single digits. We returned approximately 145% of free cash flow to shareholders over $9 billion through dividends and share repurchases combined. Our expectation for Lockheed Martin's 2024 financial outlook, include low single-digit growth in sales off of the higher 2023 base and a range of $6 billion to $6.3 billion of free cash flow.Our ongoing dividend and expectation for $4 billion of share repurchases will sustain our focus on returns to shareholders in 2024. We also plan to further advance our vision for 21st Century security in the year as we believe that it is our responsibility at Lockheed Martin to bring the best of U.S. and allied technology and industrial capability to help maintain an effective deterrent to arm conflict and to provide our armed forces with the capabilities to win should we need to.First, we work closely with our supply chain to apply anti-fragility measures and increased resilience. Through teaming arrangements to expand sources of supply and by making strategic investments in start-ups with cutting-edge technologies. For example, we are collaborating with a supplier in which we have a minority investment, to accelerate our additive manufacturing progress, reducing material and process dependencies and complex thermal management applications such as heat exchangers. We also stood up a wholly owned subsidiary called ForwardEdge ASIC to work with major semiconductor fabs to design and manufacture the cutting-edge microprocessors that we need.Second, we led the industry to broaden and strengthen the defense industrial base by making significant progress with our commercial technology collaborators to bring their innovations into the service and national defense. For example, in the fourth quarter, Lockheed Martin worked together with a team, including Intel, Verizon, Microsoft, Juniper Networks, Keysight and Radisys to successfully demonstrate a secure, resilient, hybrid 5G and military datalink network in a live field demonstration in Colorado. Our 5G.MIL unified network solutions performed as a tactical and commercial multi-node hybrid network for integrating land, air and space operations. Together, we demonstrated absolutely cutting-edge system capabilities, performance and operation for customers in a field setting by combining the best of our technology with those of our commercial teammates.Third, we deepened relationships internationally with partners and allies to ensure that the U.S. can drive maximum interoperability in both industry and in military operations. We are making progress towards a mission-centric approach that uses the latest digital technologies to network aircraft, satellites, command centers and other key elements together to vastly improve their effectiveness and deterrent value across our U.S. and allied customers. One example from 2023 is work with Australia to develop Phase 1 of AIR6500, that's a joint battle management system and the first of its kind in terms of situational awareness and interoperability. This increases collaboration with trusted allies and partners can also help reduce the fragility and increase the capacity of the defense production system.Last week, Lockheed Martin was awarded the guided weapons production capability risk reduction activity contract, which will provide a mechanism for swift knowledge and technology transfer and serve as a path finder to manufacturing our suite of guided munitions in Australia with their workforce and with contributions from their society and their economy.Turning briefly now to the status of the U.S. defense budget. The current proposed agreement being discussed with the administration in Congress would support an $886 billion top line budget, 3% higher than 2023. We will continue to monitor the status of the U.S. budget process and strongly believe that Lockheed Martin programs will continue to be well-supported as the process unfolds.I'll now review a few notable highlights from our operations. Starting with Aeronautics and the F-35. We delivered 18 F-35 aircraft in the Technology Refresh 2 or TR-2 configuration in the fourth quarter, bringing the 2023 total to 98 jets. We are making continued progress towards delivering the first TR-3 configured aircraft. Today, over 90% of the TR-3 functionality is currently in flight test, and we are further advancing the software integration to include additional aircraft and mission subsystems. While this system maturation process continues to advance, it is taking somewhat more time than we originally anticipated. A second quarter customer acceptance of delivery software remains our target. However, we now believe that the third quarter may be more likely scenario for a TR-3 software acceptance.We are taking the time and attention to get this technology insertion right the first time because it will be absolutely worth it. The step function technological advances of TR-3 will provide our customers with the onboard digital infrastructure of data storage, data processing and pilot user interface to provide unmatched capabilities for many years to come. These include increased types of capability for air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions, advanced sensing, jamming and cybersecurity capabilities and more accurate target recognition. To achieve this level of reliable capability for the long run, the resulting aircraft delivery range for 2024 is between 75 and 110 and requires the TR-3 hardware suppliers to keep pace with production demands both this year and in the future.Given the increasing operational capability and digital connectivity of the aircraft is a cornerstone of all domain operations, international demand for the F-35 remains very strong. In December, the Republic of Korea made a decision to procure 20 additional F-35 aircraft. Also in December, we presented the first F-35A to the Belgian government, which will be one of more than 600 F-35s that will be stationed in Europe across NATO member bases by the 2030s. Aero also continued to advance the F-16 as the first European F-16 training center in Romania was inaugurated in November and a partnership with Romania and the Netherlands. This center will provide world-class training to enhance mission readiness and ensure safety of flying and operating F-16 fighter jets.In addition, we delivered the first 2 Slovakia and F-16 Block 70 jets in the fourth quarter. Deliveries for Slovakia totaling 14 aircraft will continue through 2025. Aero Skunk Works continues to pioneer groundbreaking innovation as well. And for a change, I can actually tell you about one. The X-59 experimental supersonic aircraft built by Skunk Works and NASA Aeronautics was selected as one of Time Magazine's best inventions of 2023. The X-59 is expected to transform the future of commercial supersonic flight over land by quieting the sonic boom, one of aviation's modes persistent challenges. The X-59 was unveiled at a rollout ceremony earlier this month and is expected to take first flight later this year.Our MFC business continued to push technological advancements forward as well. through modernization of air and missile defense and precision strike capabilities. In the fourth quarter, we delivered the first Precision Strike Missile, or PrSM, to the U.S. Army and conducted system qualification test for an extended range guided multiple launch rocket system or GMLRS, which will extend the range of the HIMARS system that many of you are familiar with. MFC also delivered the 800th THAAD, that's a terminal high-altitude area defense interceptor to the U.S. government in October. And also, we successfully integrated the PAC-3 Patriot Missile with the U.S. Army's new air and missile defense radar system to defend against cruise missiles, tactical ballistic missiles as well as hypersonics.International demand for the PAC-3 remains strong too. This year, Switzerland and Romania each signed letters of offer an acceptance for PAC-3 MFCs, marking 15 partner nations for this program. RMS also saw strong international interest in the fourth quarter. The U.S. Navy awarded Lockheed Martin contract to produce 8 MH-60 Romeo SEAHAWK helicopters for the Spanish Navy and 6 of them for the Norwegian government as well. To date, Sikorsky has delivered 330 MH-60 Romeo aircraft to 5 countries, including the United States, 67 more are on order or in production for India, Greece, South Korea, Australia and now Spain and Norway. Also in the quarter, Sikorsky installed the U.S. Army's improved turbine engine on our RAIDER X, designed for the army's future attack reconnaissance aircraft or FARA program. This final phase of the RAIDER X build brings us one step closer to completing the system that will support the Army's high-tech future missions requirements, and we anticipate the first flight of RAIDER X in late 2024.Finally, turning to space. United Launch Alliance successfully launched the Vulcan Centaur Rocket earlier in January. This launch was the first of 2 flights required to complete national security space certification and the second planned mission could happen as soon as April. The U.S. Air Force awarded Space a nearly $1 billion contract to develop a new reentry vehicle for the Sentinel Intercontinental Ballistic Missile. The reentry vehicle or Mk21A will be mounted on top to Sentinel. The award follows a technology maturation and risk reduction contract and the ICBM recapitalization contributes to modernizing strategic deterrents and reinforcing Lockheed Martin's critical technological contributions to the nuclear triad.And last week, the Space Development Agency announced Lockheed Martin was awarded an almost $900 million contract for Tranche 2 Tracking Layer to provide 18 small sats, 16 of those space vehicles are for missile warning and tracking and 2 space vehicles are for missile defense infrared sensors to be on board. The first group of 9 satellites is expected to launch in April of 2027. A lot going on at Lockheed Martin in all of our operations.And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jay and join you later for questions."", 'Jay Malave', ""Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will recap our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results and provide our initial guidance for 2024. As I describe our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings release today.On Chart 4, we'll start with the fourth quarter results for consolidated sales and segment operating profit. We had a better-than-expected close to the year, nearly matching last year's record fourth quarter. Sales exceeded internal expectations by close to $1 billion, with the improvement largely due to material throughput, leading to a less than 1% year-over-year decline in the quarter and a sign of improving synchronization between Lockheed Martin's demand signals and supply chain fulfillment. The strong finish led to about 2.5% sales growth for the year, which was about $2 billion stronger on an absolute basis than originally expected last January. Overall segment operating profit in the quarter was also better than expected on the higher sales volume and was down 1% year-over-year due to lower net profit adjustments and lower equity earnings. Book-to-bill was 1.15x for the year with strength across all 4 segments.Moving to earnings per share on Chart 5. GAAP EPS grew 2% year-over-year, with lower segment profit and higher interest expense more than offset by benefits from the lower share count and fewer mark-to-market losses. Excluding mark-to-market activity and other nonrecurring charges, adjusted EPS was up $0.11 year-over-year or 1%. For the year, adjusted EPS was $27.82, up 2% year-over-year and consistent with the sales growth. The steady improvement this year resulted in higher adjusted EPS by about $1 per share from our original expectations last January.Moving to cash flow on Chart 6. We generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $6.2 billion for the full year, helped by approximately $625 million in working capital reductions in the fourth quarter from strong and timely conversion of operational milestone achievement to billings and collections. We maintained our commitment to shareholders by returning $3.8 billion through dividends and share repurchases this quarter and over $9 billion for the year or 145% of our free cash flow.Before getting into the segments, let me pause here to put the numbers in perspective. The key takeaway is that industry growth is crystallizing based on 3 converging demand cycles. First, to meet support requirements of the near and midterm security environment; second, to strengthen the effectiveness of existing security platforms and systems with improved sensing, connectivity, interoperability and embedded intelligence; and lastly, to recapitalize platforms and systems that maintain technological superiority in deterrence over a longer time frame. We expect these demand trends to endure and drive requirements to closely match with Lockheed Martin's advanced technology and systems integration capabilities. The long-cycle nature of Lockheed Martin Systems has, in part, led to slower growth, but the 2023 results show that it is materializing as evidenced by our 7% increase in ending backlog to a record $161 billion as well as our return to top line growth a year earlier than originally expected.And we demonstrated our confidence in the company's positioning amongst these demand cycles and multiyear outlook by again delivering strong shareholder returns. Over the past 2 years, we have repurchased about 12% on of the current market capitalization.Okay, back to the segment details and starting with aeronautics on Chart 7. Fourth quarter sales at Aero were comparable year-over-year with higher volume at Skunk Works and the F-16 production ramp offset by lower volume on F-35 primarily production cost timing. As expected, operating profit decreased 7% from the prior year due to lower net profit adjustments. For the year, sales were up 2% as growth in Skunk Works and F-16 more than offset a low single-digit decline on F-35. Profit declined by 1%, primarily due to lower profit adjustments. Book-to-bill for the year was 1.14x, leading to 6% growth in the backlog to $60 billion, with nearly 600 aircraft across all production platforms in the backlog.Shifting to Missiles and Fire Control on Page 8. Sales in the quarter decreased 4% year-over-year, driven by lower volume on PAC-3 due to supplier cost timing, partially offset by production ramps on JASSM and LRASM. Segment operating profit decreased 12% year-over-year as expected due to the lower volume and loss recognition related to a classified program. For the year, sales decreased 1% year-over-year as growth in tactical and strike missiles were offset by program transitions at Sensors and Global Sustainment and integrated air and missile defense supplier cost timing.Operating profit was down 6% due to lower profit adjustments and the classified program loss. Book-to-bill for the year was 1.3x, leading to 12% growth in backlog to $32 billion, driven by strong demand for tactical and strike misses.Turning to Rotary and Mission Systems on Page 9. Sales declined 2% in the quarter, driven by lower volume across a handful of programs within our integrated warfare systems and sensors and training and logistics systems lines of business, partially offset by higher sales at Sikorsky from deliveries of International Black Hawks. Operating profit increased 2% and mainly due to favorable contract mix within our IWSS portfolio. For the year, sales were up 1% as growth in IWSS from Radar and battle management system ramps, more than offset declines in the other lines of business. Operating profit declined 2%, primarily due to lower profit adjustments. Book-to-bill for the year was 1.14x and with backlog growing 8% to $38 billion based on strong order intake on Sikorsky platforms as well as radar and battle management systems.On Chart 10, as expected, space growth moderated in the quarter with sales increasing 3% year-over-year, driven by higher volume in strategic and missile defense, primarily from next-gen Interceptor as that program advances from its successful completion of preliminary design review towards the critical design review milestone. Operating profit increased 31% compared to 2022 and driven by higher net profit adjustments across the portfolio. For the year, sales increased 9% with growth across all lines of businesses. And profit grew by 10% as benefits from higher profit adjustments and volume more than offset lower ULA equity income. Space backlog grew again in fourth quarter and remains at a solid $30 billion or almost 2.5x sales.Now shifting to the outlook for 2024 on Page 11. Before discussing our expectations, I'd like to highlight a few key assumptions embedded within our guidance for the year. First, based on recent progress made in budget negotiations, we assume the U.S. government passes appropriations bills by March, consistent with the funding levels within the President's FY '24 budget request, equating to approximately 3% top line growth for the DoD. On F-35, as Jim stated, we're targeting between 75 to 110 deliveries commencing in the third quarter. In addition, we anticipate sufficient progress being made on the MFC classified program to result in the recognition of losses from 2 production lots, amounting to approximately 50 basis points of margin headwind against our consolidated results. With that framework in mind, we anticipate sales between $68.5 billion and $70 billion, with the midpoint that represents approximately 2.5% growth. At the midpoint, we expect growth in 3 of the 4 segments with MFC leading the way at 7% growth from a strong munitions backlog. At the high end, all 4 segments would grow. Segment operating profit is expected to be between $7.175 billion and $7.375 billion down at the midpoint as lower expected profit adjustments and the MFC classified losses more than offset volume benefits. Excluding the MFC classified program, 50 basis points impact, underlying margins in the balance of the portfolio are expected to be approximately 11%. Our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment declines around $400 million from last year to a little less than $1.7 billion for 2024, and due primarily to lower FAS pension income. The pension headwind, along with lower segment profit and higher interest expense led to lower expected EPS year-over-year to between $25.65 and $26.35.For purposes of clarity, on Page 12, we've included an EPS walk at the midpoint of the range. Benefits from volume mix provide about $0.55, with the impact of the MFC classified program losses, netting down segment operating profit to a $0.35 decline. Total FAS/CAS pension is about $1.40 headwind with higher taxes and interest more than offset by the lower share count. Our free cash flow estimate for 2024 has ranged between $6 billion and $6.3 billion. So bringing it all together, we expect continued sales growth in 2024 off the higher 2023 base, some profit and EPS pressure based on loss recognition timing, but with continued solid cash generation and capping it off with another year of capital deployment.So in summary, on Page 13. We closed out 2023 with record backlog and positive momentum that will carry us into 2024 with a line of sight to sustained out-year growth in sales, profit and free cash flow. Of course, we will continue to invest in 1LMX as part of our strategy to ensure our people, processes and systems remain the most advanced in the industry, and we remain committed to disciplined and dynamic capital returns to shareholders.With that, Lois, let's open up the call for Q&A."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) And our first question is from Myles Walton from Wolfe Research.', 'Myles Alexander Walton', ""I was hoping to lead off with Aero and F-35 in particular, and the margins, number one, that you're looking for in '24 are down about 40 basis points. Is that primarily on lower incentives as a result of the delays in delivery. And then more broadly, for the supply chain on the F-35, given the absence of deliveries, can you continue to simply build inventory, or is there a point at which you'd actually have to slow down the supply chain?"", 'Jay Malave', ""Okay. Thanks, Myles. On the margins for F-35, what we're seeing in 2024 are lower favorable profit adjustments, and so it's really twofold. One of it is the F-35, where as we make progress on the TR-3 program as well as getting ourselves into production, it's difficult to take risk and rely on risk retirements as we're still facing this program and the progress we're making there. And so we assume that the profit adjustments slow down in 2024 on the F-35 program. There's also some headwinds on C-130 program, where we're seeing the effects of inflation and also some disruption related to supply chain, some pressures that we've had there. And so when you look at that decline year-over-year, you're talking about 30 basis points, say, half and half between C-130 and F-35.On the production cadence for F-35, yes, we feel pretty confident in where we are through the third quarter. To the extent that there were any delays beyond that, we would have to revisit our production cadence at that point in time. But right now, all signs are pointing to our production and delivery restart here in the third quarter."", 'Operator', 'And the next question is from the line of Scott Deuschle from Deutsche Bank.', 'Scott Deuschle', ""Jay, here to ask on 2025, but at a high level, is the 10.5% total company margin guide for '24. Is that the right jumping off point for thinking about '25, or is it the underlying margin, or is it the 10.8% margin you did in '23, just in terms of identifying jumping off point in '25?"", 'Jay Malave', ""Yes. I think you do have to start at the 10.5% to jump off. And we do have a line of sight and a path to get overall back to 11%, including the absorption of these losses on the MFC classified program, but it's going to be a gradual march back up. And so I wouldn't expect it to snap back in 2025. I would expect there to be in the range of, say, 10 to 20 basis points of improvement starting in '25, and that to continue to grow at that rate until we get back up to 11%."", 'Operator', 'And your next question is from Gavin Parsons from UBS Equity Research.', 'Gavin Eric Parsons', 'Jay, what does the pension contribution schedule look like beyond 2024? And do you have any opportunity to pull that forward or use the balance sheet to offset that?', 'Jay Malave', ""Yes, a good question. That's something that we've contemplated. Just where we are from a baseline perspective, zero contributions required in 2024. 2025, we're looking at in the range of about $1 billion of required contributions there. And so we're always looking at whether or not there's an opportunity to pull forward. As you mentioned, the utilization of our strong balance sheet to potentially do that. We haven't made any firm decisions on that, but that's definitely an opportunity that's under consideration for us."", 'Operator', 'And our next question is from the line of Pete Skibitski from Alembic Global.', 'Peter John Skibitski', ""Jim or Jay, can you give us a sense for how much the '24 guide is impacted by what looks like on the order of a 6-month delay here to the government's budget and still a little bit of lack of clarity in the supplementals."", 'Jay Malave', ""Yes, for the most part, Pete, it's not really impacted significantly. In our case, we're able to build up inventories. And then as we get the funding, we're able to take that to sales. And so for the most part, we've kept all of our processes intact. That becomes more difficult if the process extends beyond March. And that's why I was very clear in my comments that we're dependent on this happening that the budget getting clarity and finalization in March. Because going beyond that makes it very -- just makes it difficult for things to get on contract and you run out of runway in the year to convert those into sales."", 'Peter John Skibitski', ""Okay. Appreciate it. And then anything on big awards you're expecting in '24 and maybe the timing of NGAD?"", 'Jay Malave', ""Well, just some key things that we're talking about from a sales perspective. Lot 18, 19 is a big one for the F-35 program. We also have some long lead F-35 awards that we would be expecting as well. We've got things -- there are some classified contracts across the portfolio. I can't really get into any beyond that. But you're talking multibillions of dollars there that we have in our order plan for this year. There are things like PAC-3 orders, which is multiple billions of dollars there for FY '24 requirements. And also, I would say hypersonics space, particularly on CPS is another one that can approach $2 billion. So there are a number there. As those get clicked off in the year, we'll certainly report on those and keep you appraised in the progress."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi Research.', 'Jason Michael Gursky', ""Jay, just a quick clarification then one for Jim and sorry if I missed this, but the deliveries that you're expecting for the F-35 this year with the acceptance on T-3 happening potentially in the third quarter. Can you discuss a little bit about the cadence throughout the year? Do you expect to deliver some F-35s throughout the year and maybe the older version of it, at of the year? I'm just trying to get a sense of whether you're truly doing 75 to 100 aircraft in the second half of the year? And what does that tell us about the potential for deliveries in 2025. Can you get to 200 in that year as a bit of a catch-up.And then, Jim, for you, just overall expectations on bookings, book-to-bill for this next year based on the pipeline that you're seeing and maybe just kind of update us on your current thoughts on the competitive environment and fixed price versus cost plus, and how you -- how the industry and you all specifically are kind of reacting to the contracting environment and what's being asked of you and whether you're toggling back more towards less risky programs."", 'Jay Malave', ""So let me get into the deliveries. Jason, we do have a handful of deliveries we expect in the first half. But for the most part, you're talking 90% of the anticipated deliveries actually will happen in the back half of the year. And so I think that's just the way to think about just a handful, really in the first half. Maybe I'll kind of give a little bit of color and then hand it over to Jim. For the year, we still expect there to be strong demand, and we have a pretty solid line of sight to a book-to-bill that would be above 1 yet again in 2024. And so obviously, these things have to materialize. The budget has to be approved and all these things have to happen. But the line of sight is there for continued growth in orders as well as in our backlog.A couple of things, too, and you've just done the question about cost plus. The interesting thing is that part of the margin pressure that we saw in 2023 was due to mix. Our percent of sales of cost-type contracts went from 38% in 2022 to 41% in 2023. That in itself caused some margin pressure of about 20 basis points relative to what we were anticipating in the year. And so we're actually seeing an uptick in cost-plus contracts, which we think kind of bodes well from terms of risk tolerance in the way some of these stronger technological types of programs will be contracted for. And so I think that is, generally speaking, a favorable trend.Well, the other thing that we're -- just to talk about what we're thinking about contractually, and Jim has really led the way here is that we just are employing a lot more pricing discipline than we have more recently. And we're looking at things and ensuring that there's just a more analytical support for the way we approach pricing. Do we capture any types of technological advantages that we may have also that as we make an assessment of risk, a, the contracting vehicle is appropriate to that risk, but that our pricing accounts for that risk as well. And so that's the way we've been approaching things for really this year going into 2024. And I'll hand it over to Jim."", 'James D. Taiclet', ""Yes. Sure, Jay. So look, there's a near-term and a long-term approach that we're taking to government contracting with industry. And the near-term piece of it is a lot of what Jay just described, really matching the pricing and the risk profile within our company, I'll say. Now I don't know what other companies doing -- how they're making their decisions. But what we've recognized and I've said to our senior customer base, look, we're in a monopsony environment here, meaning there's a single buyer for the most part, for almost everything that we make or Boeing Defense makes or General Dynamics makes. And I guess, the government's credit in a way, they've been taking advantage of that monopsony power, if you will, over the industry.And what's happened as a result of that over the last number of years or even decades is you have lots of programs which are over cost, cost overruns, right, whether fixed price or cost plus and you have scheduled delays because what that monopsony environment can do is give so much power to the buyer that some of the competitors feel that there are must-win programs for them that they will take tremendous risk on cost and pricing and tremendous cost on the ability to technically deliver these capabilities. So when you multiply those 2 risks together, you get a lot of cost overruns, a lot of schedule delays, programs reviewed by Congress, et cetera.So I've been advocating in the near term and certainly implementing with our company, we don't have any must-win programs at Lockheed Martin anymore. If we have a good business opportunity with a balanced price risk profile, we will bid. If not, we will not bid. If we hit our limit parameters, we won't go beyond those, a competitor may win, so be it. And so that's our near-term approach to this. The longer-term approach is, in addition to delivering products that we and our cohorts in the traditional defense industry do so well, we need to start migrating towards delivering capabilities right? So capability would include either products that are already fielded and/or new products but especially digital technologies, which is why we are collaborating with so much effort with commercial tech companies large and small because we can value price capabilities, right? If we sell products, and that's all we do as an industry, we are kind of locked into the far, the federal acquisition regulation as it is written today, which means even a fixed price contract, you've got to provide all your cost information, right? And you have to do it often every year. Even with a multiyear fixed price, there can be adjustments.So we want to move as briskly as we can as an industry with our commercial partners to their kind of pricing, which is value-based subscription. That's going to take time. It's going to take changes in government. It's going to probably take literally act of Congress to do it. But that will be the thing that will make our industry healthier on one hand, the traditional defense and aerospace industry, but it will also invite in the commercial tech companies who are basically, if you look at the broad scope investing 10x what we are in R&D. And we want to bring a lot of that 10x R&D and all that talent over into the defense department as part of their supply chain, but it's really tough under the bar for those companies to put time and attention and effort into DoD.So that's the long-term -- a long-term solution, but the near-term solution will also continue."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is from Doug Harned from Bernstein.', 'Douglas Stuart Harned', ""As you look at Tech Refresh 3, this delay and then going longer, as you really want to build out the full kind of Block IV capabilities, which continue to seem to expand. First, as Tech Refresh 3 takes longer. And then as you look toward the kind of multiyear trajectory on Block 4 implementation, how do you see delays here affecting your production rate, knowing that you've been trying to produce sort of at the full 156 type rate. But can that continue as you look at these challenges if they get more difficult?"", 'James D. Taiclet', ""Look -- it's -- Doug, it's Jim. I think we can continue at this rate. Demand from the U.S. service and our international customers, Air Forces, Navy, et cetera, around the world is they need the aircraft, right? They've got to recapitalize the planes that they're still flying that I was trying to get when I went to pilot training in 1983 right? So is essential that this production line keep up, it's the -- basically, it's the recapitalization of the Allied fighter aircraft for us, is the F-35. And so I think the key to that is full transparency and realizing the reality of the situation. When you're trying to drive this much technology into an air vehicle, you've got to be honest about the schedule. What can industry do, what can the test and evaluation community handle in the various military to accept that technology and what's the supply chain capacity. And we're being brutally honest with our services and our joint program offices to what we think industry can do with us and our airplane.And industry is who makes the radar. Industry is who makes the EOT, the electrical optical system. The industry is who makes the electronic warfare suite. It's not us. So we have to be brutally honest as an industry and with our suppliers' inputs to that with the government and say what is feasible to keep the production rate up. I think that's starting to get traction. I hope it gets more traction because we cannot afford to be overoptimistic in the ability to deliver these technologies as rapidly as one might like. There are real technical and physical challenges to doing this. And our commitment to the government, meeting the service chiefs and our allies is I will tell you honestly, what we think industry can do with the jet. And if you want to push it beyond that, I'll tell you what the risks are and what the cost might be to do it. But let's agree on a feasible executable plan for exactly Doug, what you talked about."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies.', 'Sheila Karin Kahyaoglu', ""Jim, I don't want to talk about what happened in 1983, but in terms of the puts and takes for MFC, if you could just talk about the 7% top line growth you guys have what are the biggest program drivers there between missile defense and tactical, and just on the margins, you've already highlighted the 50 bps from the classified programs. Are there any offsets? And I really appreciate your commentary about the government and how you plan to sell to them. So I was just thinking, where do you think that will manifest itself in its portfolio in your portfolio, the fact is, is it MFC?And specifically, can you give any specifics?"", 'Jay Malave', ""Yes. So I'll start with the growth drivers. And for MFC, you would expect, tactical and strike missiles. So the guided weapons, the HIMARS, JASSM, LRASM, all those will continue towards their march through these ramps for by 2025 and in certain cases, 2026 and 2027. So that is the largest driver of the growth. And that's followed by Integrated Air and Missile Defense really on the back of PAC-3. So we'll start seeing a more significant spike in PAC-3 activity and deliveries over the next few years here as we get to 550 by 2025 and then ultimately 650 by 2027. So those are the 2 -- really the 2 businesses, the lines of business within MFC that are going to be driving it, which is really -- should be no surprise."", 'James D. Taiclet', ""And then when it gets to moving towards a value pricing model, Sheila. The first place that's already starting to happen is in command and control, command situational awareness, information advantages our customers would call it. So those are largely digital services, right? You've got sensors on satellites, aircraft, ships, radars out scanning the sky, infrared sensors in space looking for plumes of heat when a missile is launched, things like that. That's data, right? So how do we gathered all the data from our sensors, whatever domain they happen to be in land airspace, et cetera. How do we make intelligent data fusion and then present commanders and decision makers with options using AI and other digital services.So this will be probably the first place where we can value price because my goal is to bring in commercial technology to do that digital data fusion, evaluation, AI application, et cetera. As I said a minute ago, commercial industry is investing 10x what our aerospace and defense industry could invest in these areas, and we need to take advantage of that. The only way they're going to participate in a material fashion in that industry is value pricing. They're not going to provide cost information. It's just not how their industry works. They're not delivering an airplane that you can add up all the costs that it took to make that airplane and give it to the government, so they can give you the margin on top.So these command and control systems, and they're real programs, by the way, defensive (inaudible) is a program like this, AIR6500 is one dimension. And also something called Joint Fires Network, which will be deployed in the INDOPACOM Command of the U.S. So this is where I think it will start. And then as we look at mission road maps that we've established and drawn out inside of Lockheed Martin, and we're now sharing and have been sharing with the U.S. services and DoD. We're looking for capability gaps where digital technology can really make a difference, right? I'll give you one really quick one. So if we could get a direct feed from an orbiting satellite scanning a wide swath of the Pacific to find ships and actually directly provide that data link and that information to aircraft flying in the area, then those aircraft can vector towards those targets and turn on their radars and get a much more precise location and maybe even a tracking solution to sync the ship if that's what's needed.And so that's a mission gap, a capability gap that we would have in an antiship mission. And so how do we value price that because that's basically a data management exercise, which requires what we call 5G.MIL. It requires an artificial intelligence solution within it, and it requires the management of that data at various classifications, which is something not many companies can do besides those in our industry.So we can value price something like that. And I think it'd be a capability gap that would be interesting to the Department of Defense, and they might accept value pricing, but not to take too much time on this topic. But one of the things that we're really advocating for at Lockheed Martin, and we've got some friends of the court trying to work with us on this is, how do we set up an adjacent acquisition process in the Department of Defense to its traditional acquisition process, designed and reconstituted and originated to purchase digital services versus platforms and products, which is what the traditional acquisition system is built to do. That is a heavy lift. It is very complicated. It's what I've kind of referenced earlier, where you're literally going to need to enact the confidence to do this. But if we want to value price as an industry, bringing commercial partners at scale, I think the government needs to consider and actually go do this with us."", 'Jay Malave', ""Let me just circle back, Sheila, on the margins in your question. I'll use MFC as an example in 2024. When you look at their headwind, the headwind is about 200 basis points of margin compression in the year 2024. The MFC classified program is actually accounted for 230. And so the rest of their business is actually expanding by 30 basis points. And so they're doing everything we would expect them to do in their core business. In general, across all of Lockheed Martin, the way we're approaching these headwinds is really threefold. First, we're just keeping a tight lid on overhead and indirect costs and streamlining that cost structure where the opportunities exist. The second is we're driving cost reduction in our direct cost base through supply chain optimization, factory productivity and also on 1LMX driven efficiencies. And then lastly, we talked about a little bit earlier in the call, is just making sure that we're employing pricing discipline across our bid and proposals. And so those 3 together will help us drive to a better result in the future and give us confidence that we'll be able to expand margins even with these headwinds."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan.', 'Seth Michael Seifman', ""Maybe one clarification and one question. Jay, on F-35, at the end of '24, should we think about there being maybe 120 undelivered aircraft in inventory based on the production rate of 150 plus and the deliveries you've told us, that's the clarification, and that inventory will have to be worked out over the subsequent year or 2. And then as far as the question goes, I think you talked about 10 to 20 basis points of segment margin expansion in '25. If we thought about only 1 lot exercised on classified missile, that's probably 25 basis points. The margin in aeronautics seems pretty depressed in '24. So you think there may be some potential for expansion there. And you just talked about the efforts that you're making across the company to support margins. Are there other discrete headwinds that we're not aware of that wouldn't allow -- that would prevent more than that kind of 10 to 20 basis points that you outlined?"", 'Jay Malave', ""Yes. Let me start with that question first, and I'll come back to the F-35. Just on the 2025 margins going forward, yes, it would be essentially 1 lot versus 2. However, you got to take into account the volumes that are in that lot versus the volumes that we're in these first 2 lots. And so you really -- you think about it from a gross headwind, it doesn't necessarily change all that much because you're -- there's more in there. And so that's what's keeping the pressure. There's not just an automatic lift because we're going from 2 lots to 1 lot in a subsequent year. On the F-35, I mean, I think the way you talked about it Seth is right, anywhere between 100 to 120 aircraft is, in terms of undelivered, against the 156 type of expected delivery rate is the right way to think about it, yes."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America.', 'Ronald Jay Epstein', ""I'll do the question first. What are you thinking about the opportunity for the Black Hawk going forward, meaning I don't know, we've kind of heard there's some challenges on future vertical lift. And what opportunities does that open to you for the Black Hawk?"", 'James D. Taiclet', ""Ron, it's Jim. Look, the Black Hawk, and I've gotten a flight autonomously and by hand actually. I think has a lot of potential. There's interesting Congress for modernization of the Black Hawk. There's a huge fleet out there. And by adding some of these digital capabilities like autonomy and AI to the Black Hawk, which is a really reliable platform that's offline in units today in great numbers and across our allies. That's a real, I think, value opportunity for the armies (inaudible) and others that use the helicopter. So I do think there's a lot of upside there. I don't want to comment on anybody else's programs or how well or not they may be doing, but this is a proven scaled vehicle, with digital technology upgrade insertion can be very, very versatile. And that can be done much more rapidly than new production of new aircraft. So I do think that there is upside there.Now the services and Congress have to agree. And to that and fund those modernizations and keep those units flying. And that will be up to them. But we are trying to provide them every opportunity to make that decision by inserting digital and other technologies like autonomy that will really make the aircraft much more capable in doing missions like air evacuation, resupply of the hot landing zone, things like that, that when you put it into the entire equation, of completing a mission, it will be a good value to consider it."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley.', 'Kristine Liwag', ""Jay, Jim, I mean, there's been discussion in the public markets about the depletion of U.S. missiles ammunitions and a potential shortage. I mean that side from your commentary today, it sounds like supply chain issues continue to linger, weighing on the company's ability to convert the demand into revenue. So can you talk more about the additional actions you're taking to improve the supply chain's ability to get products through the system? And what metrics are you monitoring? And how much upside could you see in 2024 if things improve?"", 'James D. Taiclet', ""I'll make a couple of comments and ask Jay to follow. The steps that we're taking to take the fragility out of the missile production system are varied. One of them is -- and it's very specific, we are endeavoring to stand up a third solid rocket motor supplier in the United States that can be additive to the industry supply chain we have today, which hasn't been performing well, right? That's one piece. More broadly, we're using additive manufacturing, and we're bringing in more varied suppliers into the supply chain so that we can get the materials we need from a more diverse set of group of suppliers outside of solid rocket motors. And also, we're looking at international opportunities to build this equipment including in Australia and in Poland, U.K. and others are kind of on tap for coproduction or joint ventures with us to do these things, and Germany, I should mention as well.So these are some of the approaches we're taking. And it really comes down to these 3 areas, which is how can we on one hand take basic steps of anti-fragility to more suppliers, more diversity on the supply chain, different labor pools, better training, those kinds of things where it's just basic. Secondly, how can we insert technology to make this more reliable production system, which we just mentioned. And then thirdly is how do we get international countries and take advantage of their labor forces, their supply -- sub-supply chains, et cetera, and get them into the production system. So we look at this in all 3 areas of our core company strategy and apply it to missile production.Jay, anything you want to add?"", 'Jay Malave', ""Yes. I'll just say over the last year, Kristine, we've deployed resources. So we haven't just sat back and waiting for improvement. Depending on the supplier, depending on the issues, we have deployed manufacturing engineering resources. We've deployed quality engineering resources and program management resources as well as, in certain cases, we've actually deployed hourly workers to support suppliers in certain cases. And so we've taken an all-hands on deck approach, where we've seen the issues become more significant. And we've done everything we can to support these suppliers and help them get through. I would expect that to continue where we see these bottlenecks. But as I mentioned earlier, we did see some general improvement. We are expecting that improvement to continue. And in terms of potential upside, what I would point you to is that if we're able to unlock and see a little bit better performance and that what drives to the high end of our sales profit and EPS range."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Matt Akers from Wells Fargo.', 'Matthew Carl Akers', 'Could you touch on F-16 real quick, just latest thoughts on the ramp rate here and also just margins on that program that compares to the segment now? And then sort of do they get better over time as you kind of come back down learning curve?', 'Jay Malave', ""Yes. So we delivered 5 aircraft in 2023. We would expect that to triple, potentially quadruple, here in 2024. And so we're -- the ramp is certainly in full force. We've got over 30 aircraft there (inaudible) as we ended the year. And so that is, I think, from a delivery standpoint, increasing the production cadence is all trending well. From a profitability standpoint, you may recall, we've had some pressure because it's taken us longer to get to this point. And so that puts some pressure on our initial contracts. Here, as we fully deliver those out and deliver on the subsequent contracts, we will see profitability improve on the F-16 over the next few years."", 'Operator', 'Next question is from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.', 'George D. Shapiro', ""I'm looking at a longer-term perspective here. If I look at the margins like from 10 years ago, MFC made 18%, aeronautics made 11%, Space made 13%. And so we're obviously down in all of those categories overall, maybe 200 basis points in 10 years ago. So my question is, was this due to a lot of the fixed-price development, more aggressive bidding. And now you're trying to change that. So when we look towards 2025, we actually could see margins go up from where they'd be in 2024 or kind of -- are they just lower margins overall that we expect to see from what we used to see?"", 'James D. Taiclet', ""George, it's Jim here. I think the story, I told a little bit earlier today is what caused that. There's margin compression in the whole industry here, driven by the monopsony customer, if you will. So they got pretty good at figuring out how to use their position in the quarter analysis of how they should negotiate contracts. And what I think you're seeing is boards and management of companies in our traditional space, I'll call it, are understanding this now, the management tends to not necessarily -- senior management tends not to necessarily be historically wedded to this business model and looking at other ways to run these companies.And so we are taking the shareholders' interest into account and all the things we talked about, which should help improve our margins, even though it may result in some difficult discussions with some of the customer base. we're prepared to do that. But I think over the last 10 years, as you said, there's been a decline and it needs to reverse to have a healthy industry."", 'Maria Ricciardone Lee', ""Okay. Lois, I think we're at the top of the hour. So I'm just going to turn it back over to Jim for some final thoughts."", 'James D. Taiclet', ""Okay. Thanks, Maria. So over the past 12 months, again, I mentioned the people of Lockheed Martin have worked relentlessly to advance this vision we have for 21st Century security and transform our company internally, and they created, produced and delivered cutting-edge capabilities that are focused on what the defense department says as its own strategy that they call integrated deterrence. And we're trying to maintain our company values along the way, and that's to do what's right, respect others and perform with excellence. And all this yields positive results for our employees at work here, our customers and our suppliers and especially our shareholders.So thanks again for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in April. Lois, that concludes the call. Thank you."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim."", 'Jim Taiclet -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings call. In 2023, the 122,000 men and women of Lockheed Martin, working closely with our customers, made excellent progress advancing our 21st Century Security strategy and delivered strong financial results for our shareholders. Turning to Chart 3.', 'Robust demand for our broad portfolio of aircraft, helicopters, satellites, radar systems, and other products, services, and advanced digital technologies boosted backlog to a record $161 billion. Full year sales of $67.6 billion increased 2% year over year and came in stronger than anticipated, as did earnings per share of $27.55. To position the company to take full advantage of these future growth opportunities, we invested more than $3 billion across research and development and capital in 2023. We generated $6.2 billion of free cash flow, as expected, which resulted in year-over-year free cash flow per share percentage growth in the mid-single digits.', ""We returned approximately 145% of free cash flow to shareholders, over $9 billion through dividends and share repurchases combined. Our expectation for Lockheed Martin's 2024 financial outlook include low single-digit growth in sales off of the higher 2023 base and a range of $6 billion to $6.3 billion of free cash flow. Our ongoing dividends and expectation for $4 billion of share repurchases will sustain our focus on returns to shareholders in 2024. We also plan to further advance our vision for 21st Century Security in the year as we believe that it is our responsibility at Lockheed Martin to bring the best of U.S."", 'and allied technology and industrial capability to help maintain an effective deterrent to armed conflict and to provide our armed forces with the capabilities to win should we need to. First, we work closely with our supply chain to apply anti-fragility measures and increase resilience through teaming arrangements to expand sources of supply and by making strategic investments in start-ups with cutting-edge technologies. For example, we are collaborating with a supplier in which we have a minority investment to accelerate our additive manufacturing progress, reducing material and process dependencies in complex thermal management applications such as heat exchangers. We also stood up a wholly owned subsidiary called ForwardEdge ASIC to work with major semiconductor fabs to design and manufacture the cutting-edge microprocessors that we need.', 'Second, we led the industry to broaden and strengthen the defense industrial base by making significant progress with our commercial technology collaborators to bring their innovations into the service and national defense. For example, in the fourth quarter, Lockheed Martin worked together with a team including Intel, Verizon, Microsoft, Juniper Networks, Keysight, and Radisys to successfully demonstrate a secure, resilient, hybrid 5G and military data link network in a live field demonstration in Colorado. Our 5G.MIL Unified Network Solutions performed as a tactical and commercial multi-node hybrid network for integrating land, air, and space operations. Together, we demonstrated absolutely cutting-edge system capabilities, performance, and operation for customers in a field setting by combining the best of our technology with those of our commercial teammates.', 'Third, we deepened relationships internationally with partners and allies to ensure that the U.S. can drive maximum interoperability in both industry and in military operations. We are making progress toward a mission-centric approach that uses the latest digital technologies to network aircraft, satellites, command centers, and other key elements together to vastly improve their effectiveness and deterrent value across our U.S. and allied customers.', ""One example from 2023 is the work with Australia to develop phase 1 of AIR6500 that's a joint battle management system and the first of its kind in terms of situational awareness and interoperability. This increases collaboration with trusted allies and partners can also help reduce the fragility and increase the capacity of the defense production system. Last week, Lockheed Martin was awarded the Guided Weapons Production Capability Risk Reduction Activity contract, which will provide a mechanism for swift knowledge and technology transfer and serve as a pathfinder to manufacturing our suite of guided munitions in Australia with their workforce and with contributions from their society and their economy. Turning briefly now to the status of the U.S."", 'defense budget. The current proposed agreement being discussed with the administration and Congress would support an $886 billion top-line budget, 3% higher than 2023. We will continue to monitor the status of the U.S. budget process and strongly believe that Lockheed Martin programs will continue to be well-supported as the process unfolds.', ""I'll now review a few notable highlights from our operations, starting with aeronautics and the F-35. We delivered 18 F-35 aircraft in the Technology Refresh 2, or TR2, configuration in the fourth quarter, bringing the 2023 total to 98 jets. We are making continued progress toward delivering the first TR3-configured aircraft. Today, over 90% of the TR3 functionality is currently in flight test, and we are further advancing the software integration to include additional aircraft and mission subsystems."", 'While this system maturation process continues to advance, it is taking somewhat more time than we originally anticipated. The second quarter customer acceptance of delivery software remains our target. However, we now believe that a third quarter may be more likely scenario for a TR3 software acceptance. We are taking the time and attention to get this technology insertion right the first time because it will be absolutely worth it.', 'The step-function technological advances of TR3 will provide our customers with the onboard digital infrastructure of data storage, data processing, and pilot user interface to provide unmatched capabilities for many years to come. These include increased types of capability for air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions; advanced sensing, jamming, and cybersecurity capabilities; and more accurate target recognition. To achieve this level of reliable capability for the long run, the resulting aircraft delivery range for 2024 is between 75 and 110 and requires the TR3 hardware suppliers to keep pace with production demands both this year and in the future. Given the increasing operational capability and digital connectivity of the aircraft as a cornerstone of all-domain operations, international demand for the F-35 remains very strong.', 'In December, the Republic of Korea made the decision to procure 20 additional F-35 aircraft. Also in December, we presented the first F-35A to the Belgian government, which will be one of more than 600 F-35s that will be stationed in Europe across NATO member bases by the 2030. Aero also continued to advance the F-16 as the first European F-16 training center in Romania was inaugurated in November in a partnership with Romania and the Netherlands. This center will provide world-class training to enhance mission readiness and ensure safety of flying and operating F-16 fighter jets.', ""In addition, we delivered the first two Slovakian F-16 Block 70 jets in the fourth quarter. Deliveries for Slovakia totaling 14 aircraft will continue through 2025. Aero's Skunk Works continues to pioneer groundbreaking innovation as well. And for a change, I can actually tell you about one."", ""The X-59 experimental supersonic aircraft built by Skunk Works and NASA Aeronautics was selected as one of Time magazine's best inventions of 2023. The X-59 is expected to transform the future of commercial supersonic flight over land by quieting the sonic boom, one of aviation's most persistent challenges. The X-59 was unveiled at a rollout ceremony earlier this month and is expected to take first flight later this year. Our MFC business continued to push technological advancements forward as well through modernization of air and missile defense and precision strike capabilities."", ""In the fourth quarter, we delivered the first Precision Strike Missile, or PrSM, to the U.S. Army and conducted system qualification test for an extended range Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System, or GMLRS, which will extend the range of the HIMARS system that many of you are familiar with. MFC also delivered the 800th THAAD, that's a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense interceptor to the U.S. government in October."", ""And also, we successfully integrated the PAC-3 Patriot missile with the U.S. Army's new air and missile defense radar system to defend against cruise missiles, tactical ballistic missiles, as well as hypersonic. International demand for the PAC-3 remains strong, too. This year, Switzerland and Romania each signed Letters of Offer and Acceptance for PAC-3 MFCs, marking 15 partner nations for this program."", 'RMS also saw strong international interest in the fourth quarter. The U.S. Navy awarded Lockheed Martin contracts to produce eight MH-60R Seahawk helicopters for the Spanish Navy and six of them for the Norwegian government as well. Today, Sikorsky has delivered 330 MH-60R aircraft to five countries, including the United States, 67 more are on order or in production for India, Greece, South Korea, Australia, and now, Spain and Norway.', ""Also in the quarter, Sikorsky installed the U.S. Army's improved turbine engine on our RAIDER X, designed for the Army's Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft or FARA program. This final phase of the RAIDER X build brings us one step closer to completing the system that will support the Army's high-tech future missions requirements, and we anticipate the first flight of RAIDER X in late 2024. Finally, turning to space."", 'United Launch Alliance successfully launched the Vulcan Centaur rocket earlier in January. This launch was the first of two flights required to complete national security space certification, and the second planned mission can happen as soon as April. The U.S. Air Force awarded space a nearly $1 billion contract to develop a new reentry vehicle for the Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile.', ""The reentry vehicle or Mk21A will be mounted atop the Sentinel. The award follows a technology maturation and risk reduction contract, and the ICBM recapitalization contributes to modernizing strategic deterrence and reinforcing Lockheed Martin's critical technological contributions to the nuclear triad. And last week, the Space Development Agency announced Lockheed Martin was awarded an almost $900 million contract for Tranche 2 Tracking Layer to provide 18 small sats. Sixteen of those space vehicles are for missile warning and tracking and two space vehicles are for missile defense infrared sensors to be on board."", ""The first group of nine satellites is expected to launch in April of 2027. A lot going on at Lockheed Martin and all of our operations. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jay and join you later for questions."", 'Jay Malave -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will recap our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results and provide our initial guidance for 2024. As I describe our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings release today. On Chart 4, we'll start with the fourth quarter results for consolidated sales and segment operating profit."", ""We had a better-than-expected close to the year, nearly matching last year's record fourth quarter. Sales exceeded internal expectations by close to $1 billion, with the improvement largely due to material throughput, leading to a less than 1% year-over-year decline in the quarter and a sign of improving synchronization between Lockheed Martin's demand signals and supply chain fulfillment. The strong finish led to about 2.5% sales growth for the year, which was about $2 billion stronger on an absolute basis than originally expected last January. Overall, segment operating profit in the quarter was also better than expected on the higher sales volume and was down 1% year over year due to lower net profit adjustments and lower equity earnings."", 'Book to bill was 1.15 for the year, with strength across all four segments. Moving to earnings per share on Chart 5. GAAP EPS grew 2% year over year, with lower segment profit and higher interest expense more than offset by benefits from the lower share count and fewer mark-to-market losses. Excluding mark-to-market activity and other nonrecurring charges, adjusted EPS was up $0.11 year over year or 1%.', 'For the year, adjusted EPS was $27.82, up 2% year over year and consistent with the sales growth. The steady improvement this year resulted in higher adjusted EPS by about $1 per share from our original expectations last January. Moving to cash flow on Chart 6. We generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $6.2 billion for the full year, helped by approximately $625 million in working capital reductions in the fourth quarter from strong and timely conversion of operational milestone achievement to billings and collections.', ""We maintained our commitment to shareholders by returning $3.8 billion through dividends and share repurchases this quarter and over $9 billion for the year or 145% of our free cash flow. Before getting into the segments, let me pause here to put the numbers in perspective. The key takeaway is that industry growth is crystallizing based on three converging demand cycles: first, to meet support requirements of the near- and mid-term security environment; second, to strengthen the effectiveness of existing security platforms and systems with improved sensing, connectivity, interoperability, and embedded intelligence; and lastly, to recapitalize platforms and systems that maintain technological superiority and deterrence over a longer time frame. We expect these demand trends to endure and drive requirements that closely match with Lockheed Martin's advanced technology and systems integration capabilities."", ""The long cycle nature of Lockheed Martin's systems has, in part, led to slower growth, but the 2023 results show that it is materializing, as evidenced by our 7% increase in ending backlog to a record $161 billion, as well as our return to top-line growth a year earlier than originally expected. And we demonstrated our confidence in the company's positioning among these demand cycles and multiyear outlook by again delivering strong shareholder returns. Over the past two years, we have repurchased about 12% of the current market capitalization. OK, back to the segment details and starting with aeronautics on Chart 7."", 'Fourth quarter sales at aero were comparable year over year, with higher volume at Skunk Works and the F-16 production ramp, offset by lower volume on F-35, primarily production cost timing. As expected, operating profit decreased 7% from the prior year due to lower net profit adjustments. For the year, sales were up 2% as growth in Skunk Works and F-16 more than offset a low single-digit decline on F-35. Profit declined by 1%, primarily due to lower profit adjustments.', 'Book to bill for the year was 1.14, leading to 6% growth in the backlog to $60 billion, with nearly 600 aircraft across all production platforms in the backlog. Shifting to missiles and fire control on Page 8. Sales in the quarter decreased 4% year over year, driven by lower volume on PAC-3, due to supplier cost timing, partially offset by production ramps on JASSM and LRASM. Segment operating profit decreased 12% year over year, as expected, due to the lower volume and loss recognition related to a classified program.', 'For the year, sales decreased 1% year over year as growth in tactical and strike missiles were offset by program transitions at sensors and global sustainment and integrated air and missile defense supplier cost timing. Operating profit was down 6%, due to lower profit adjustments and the classified program loss. Book to bill for the year was 1.3, leading to 12% growth in backlog to $32 billion, driven by strong demand for tactical and strike missiles. Turning to rotary and mission systems on Page 9.', 'Sales declined 2% in the quarter, driven by lower volume across a handful of programs within our integrated warfare systems and sensors and training and logistics systems lines of business, partially offset by higher sales at Sikorsky from deliveries of international Black Hawks. Operating profit increased 2%, mainly due to favorable contract mix within our IWSS portfolio. For the year, sales were up 1% as growth in IWSS from radar and battle management system ramps more than offset declines in the other lines of business. Operating profit declined 2%, primarily due to lower profit adjustments.', 'Book to bill for the year was 1.14, with backlog growing 8% to $38 billion based on strong order intake on Sikorsky platforms, as well as radar and battle management systems. On Chart 10, as expected, space growth moderated in the quarter, with sales increasing 3% year over year, driven by higher volume in strategic and missile defense, primarily from next-gen interceptor as that program advances from its successful completion of Preliminary Design Review toward the Critical Design Review milestone. Operating profit increased 31% compared to 2022, driven by higher net profit adjustments across the portfolio. For the year, sales increased 9%, with growth across all lines of businesses, and profit grew by 10% as benefits from higher profit adjustments and volume more than offset lower ULA equity income.', ""Space backlog grew again in the fourth quarter and remains at a solid $30 billion or almost 2.5 times sales. Now, shifting to the outlook for 2024 on Page 11. Before discussing our expectations, I'd like to highlight a few key assumptions embedded within our guidance for the year. First, based on recent progress made in budget negotiations, we assume the U.S."", ""government passes appropriations bills by March, consistent with the funding levels within the president's FY '24 budget request, equating to approximately 3% top-line growth for the DOD. On F-35, as Jim stated, we're targeting between 75 to 110 deliveries commencing in the third quarter. In addition, we anticipate sufficient progress being made on the MFC classified program to result in the recognition of losses from two production lots, amounting to approximately 50 basis points of margin headwind against our consolidated results. With that framework in mind, we anticipate sales between $68.5 billion and $70 billion, with a midpoint that represents approximately 2.5% growth."", 'At the midpoint, we expect growth in three of the four segments, with MFC leading the way at 7% growth from its strong munitions backlog. At the high end, all four segments would grow. Segment operating profit is expected to be between $7.175 billion and $7.375 billion, down at the midpoint as lower expected profit adjustments and the MFC classified losses more than offset volume benefits. Excluding the MFC classified program 50-basis-points impact, underlying margins in the balance of the portfolio are expected to be approximately 11%.', ""Our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment declines around $400 million from last year to a little less than $1.7 billion for 2024, due primarily to lower FAS pension income. The pension headwind, along with lower segment profit and higher interest expense, lead to lower expected EPS year over year to be between $25.65 and $26.35. For purposes of clarity, on Page 12, we've included an EPS walk at the midpoint of the range. Benefits from volume mix provide about $0.55, with the impact of the MFC classified program losses netting down segment operating profit to a $0.35 decline."", 'Total FAS/CAS pension is about a $1.40 headwind, with higher taxes and interest more than offset by the lower share count. A free cash flow estimate for 2024 has ranged between $6 billion and $6.3 billion. So, bringing it all together, we expect continued sales growth in 2024 off the higher 2023 base, some profit and EPS pressure based on loss recognition timing, but with continued solid cash generation, and capping it off with another year of capital deployment. So, in summary on Page 13, we closed out 2023 with record backlog and positive momentum that will carry us into 2024, with a line of sight to sustain out-year growth in sales, profit, and free cash flow.', ""Of course, we will continue to invest in 1LMX as part of our strategy to ensure our people, processes, and systems remain the most advanced in the industry.

I was hoping to lead off with aero and the F-35 in particular. In the margins, number one, that you're looking for in '24 are down about 40 basis points."", ""Is that primarily on lower incentives as a result of the delays in delivery? And then more broadly, for the supply chain on the F-35, given the absence of deliveries, can you continue to simply build inventory or is there a point at which you'd actually have to slow down the supply chain? Thanks."", 'Jay Malave -- Chief Financial Officer', ""OK. Thanks, Myles. On the margins for F-35, what we're seeing in 2024 are lower favorable profit adjustments. And so, it's really twofold."", ""One of it is the F-35 where as we make progress on the TR3 program, as well as getting ourselves into production, it's difficult to take risk and rely on risk retirements as we're still facing this program and the progress we're making there. And so, we assumed that the profit adjustments slow down in 2024 in the F-35 program. There's also some headwinds on C-130 program where we're seeing the effects of inflation and also some disruption related to supply chains and pressures that we've had there. And so, when you look at that decline year over year, you're talking about 30 basis points that's, say, half and half between C-130 and F-35."", 'On the production cadence for F-35, you know, yes, we feel pretty confident in where we are through the third quarter. And to the extent that there were any delays beyond that, we would have to revisit our production cadence at that point in time.

Thank you."", 'Jay Malave -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. I think you do have to start at the 10.5 to jump off.

For the most part, Pete, it's not really impacted significantly. You know, in our case, we're able to build up inventories, and then as we get the funding, we're able to take that to sales. And so, for the most part, we've kept all of our processes intact."", ""That becomes more difficult if the process extends beyond March. And that's why I was very clear in my comments that we're dependent on this happening that the budget getting clarity and finalization in March because going beyond that makes it very -- just makes it difficult for things to get on contract, and you run out of runway in the year to convert those into sales."", 'Pete Skibitski -- Alembic Global -- Analyst', ""OK.

We also have some long-lead F-35 awards that we would be expecting as well. We've got things -- there are some classified contracts across the portfolio. I can't really get into any beyond that."", ""But you're talking multibillions of dollars there that we have in our order plan for this year. There are things like PAC-3 orders, which is multiple billions of dollars there for FY '24 requirements. And also, I would say hypersonics at space, particularly on CPS, is another one that can approach $2 billion. So, there's a number there."", ""You know, as those get kicked off in the year, we'll certainly report on those and keep you apprised on the progress."", 'Pete Skibitski -- Alembic Global -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. The next question is from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi Research. Please go ahead.', 'Jason Gursky -- Citi -- Analyst', ""Hey. Jay, just a quick clarification and one for Jim, and sorry if I missed this. But the deliveries that you're expecting for the F-35 this year with the acceptance on T3 happening potentially in the third quarter, can you discuss a little bit about the cadence throughout the year? Do you expect to deliver some F-35s through -- throughout the year and maybe, you know, the older version of it in the first half of the year? Just trying to get a sense of whether you're truly doing 75 to 100 aircraft in the second half of the year and what does that tell us about, you know, the potential for deliveries in 2025. Can you get to 200 in that year as a bit of a catch-up? And then, Jim, for you, just overall expectations on, you know, bookings, book to bill for this next year based on the pipeline that you're seeing, and maybe just kind of update us on your current thoughts on the competitive environment and, you know, fixed price versus cost plus and how you -- how the industry and you all specifically are kind of reacting to the contracting environment and what's being asked of you and whether you're toggling back more toward less risky programs? Thanks."", 'Jay Malave -- Chief Financial Officer', ""So, let me get into the deliveries, Jason. You know, we do have a handful of deliveries we expect in the first half. But for the most part, you're talking, you know, 90% of the anticipated deliveries actually will happen in the back half of the year. And so, I think that's just the way to think about it, just a handful, really, in the first half."", ""You know, maybe I'll kind of give a little bit of color and then hand it over to Jim on -- for the year, we still expect there to be strong demand and we have a pretty solid line of sight to a book to bill that would be above 1 yet again in 2024. And so, you know, obviously, these things have to materialize, the budget has to be approved, and all these things have to happen, but the line of sight is there for continued growth in orders, as well as in our backlog. A couple of things, too, and just on the question about cost plus. The interesting thing is that part of the margin pressure that we saw in 2023 was due to mix."", ""Our percent of sales of cost-type contracts went from 38% in 2022 to 41% in 2023. That in itself caused some margin pressure, about 20 basis points, relative to what we were anticipating in the year. And so, we're actually seeing an uptick in cost plus contracts, which we think kind of bodes well in terms of risk tolerance in the way some of these stronger technological types of programs will be contracted for. And so, I think that is a -- generally speaking, a favorable trend."", ""Well, the other thing that we're -- you know, just to talk about what we're thinking about contractually, and Jim has really led the way here, is that we just are employing a lot more pricing discipline than we have more recently, and we're looking at things and ensuring that there's just more analytical support for the way we approach pricing, that we capture any types of technological advantages that we may have. Also that as we make an assessment of risk, A, the contracting vehicle is appropriate to that risk, but then our pricing accounts for that risk as well. And so, that's the way we've been approaching things for, really, this year going into 2024. And I'll hand it over to Jim."", 'Jim Taiclet -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. Sure, Jay. So, look, there's a near-term and a long-term approach that we're taking to government contracting with industry. And the near-term piece of it is a lot of what Jay just described, really matching the pricing and the risk profile within our company, I'll say."", ""Now, I don't know what other companies are doing or how they're making their decisions. But, you know, we've recognized and I've said to our senior customer base, you know, that look, we're in a monopsony environment here, meaning there's a single buyer, you know, for the most part for almost everything that we make or Boeing Defense makes or General Dynamics makes. And, you know, to, I guess, the government's credit in one -- in a way, they've been taking advantage of that monopsony power, if you will, over the industry. And what's happened as a result of that over the last number of years or even decades is you have lots of programs which are over-cost, cost overruns, right, whether fixed price or cost plus, and you have schedule delays because what that monopsony environment can do is give so much power to the buyer that some of the competitors feel that they're must-win programs for them that they will take, you know, tremendous risk on costs and pricing and tremendous cost on the ability to technically deliver these capabilities."", ""So, when you multiply those two risks together, you get a lot of cost overruns, a lot of schedule delays, programs, you know, reviewed by Congress, etc. So, I've been advocating in the near term and certainly implementing with our company, we don't have any must-win programs with Lockheed Martin anymore. If we have a good business opportunity with a balanced price-risk profile, we will bid. If not, we will not bid."", ""If we hit our limit parameters, we won't go beyond those. A competitor may win, so be it. And so, that's our near-term approach to this. The longer-term approach is in addition to delivering products that we and our cohorts in the traditional defense industry do so well, we need to start migrating toward delivering capabilities, right? So, capability would include either products that are already fielded and/or new products, but especially digital technologies, which is why we are collaborating so -- with so much effort with commercial tech companies large and small because we can value price capabilities, right? If we sell products, and that's all we do as an industry, we are kind of locked into the FAR, the Federal Acquisition Regulation, as it is written today, which means even at fixed price contract, you've got to provide all your cost information, right, and you have to do it often every year, even with a multiyear fixed price."", ""And there can be adjustments. So, we want to move, you know, as briskly as we can as an industry with our commercial partners to their kind of pricing, which is value-based subscription. That's going to take time. It's going to take changes in government."", ""It's going to probably take literally acts of Congress to do it. But that will be the thing that will make our industry healthier on one hand, the traditional defense and aerospace industry, but it'll also invite in the commercial tech companies who are basically, if you look at the broad scope, investing 10x what we are in R&D. And we want to bring a lot of that 10x R&D and all that talent over into the Defense Department as part of their supply chain, but it's really tough under the FAR for those companies to put time and attention and effort into DOD. So, that's the long-term -- a long-term solution, but the near-term solution will also continue."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Your next question is from Doug Harned from Bernstein.

Industry is who makes the EOPs, the electrical optical system. The industry is who makes the electronic warfare suite."", ""It's not us. So, we have to be brutally honest as an industry and with our suppliers' inputs to that with the government and say what is feasible to keep the production rate up.

Please go ahead.', 'Sheila Kahyaoglu -- Jefferies -- Analyst', ""Good morning, guys. Jim, I don't want to talk about what happened in 1983, but in terms of the puts and takes for MFC, if you could just talk about the 7% top-line growth you guys have, what are the biggest program drivers there between missile defense and tactical and defend the margins you've already, you know, highlighted, the 50 bips from the classified programs. Are there any offsets? And I really appreciate your commentary about the government and how you plan to sell to them. So, I was just thinking where do you think that'll manifest itself in its portfolio -- in your portfolio the fastest? Is that MFC? And specifically, can you give any specifics?"", 'Jay Malave -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. Sure. I'll start with the growth drivers. And, you know, for MFC, they're what you would expect, tactical and strike missiles."", ""So, the guided weapons, the HIMARS, JASSM, LRASM. All those will continue toward their march toward these ramps for -- by 2025 and, in certain cases, 2026 and 2027. So, that is the largest driver of the growth. And that's followed by integrated air and missile defense really on the back of PAC-3."", ""So, we'll start seeing a more significant spike in PAC-3 activity and deliveries over the next few years here as we get to 550 by 2025 and then ultimately 650 by 2027. So, those are the two -- really the two businesses -- the lines of business within MFC that are going to be driving it, which is really should be no surprise."", 'Jim Taiclet -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', ""And when it gets to -- you know, moving toward a value pricing model, Sheila, the first place that's already starting to happen is in command and control, command situational awareness, information advantages our customers would call it. So, those are largely digital services, right? You know, you've got, you know, sensors on satellites, aircraft, ships, radars out, you know, scanning the sky, infrared sensors in space, you know, looking for plumes of heat when a missile is launched, things like that. That's data, right? So, how do we gather all the data from our sensors, whatever domain they happen to be, in land, air, space, etc.? How do we make intelligent data fusion and then present commanders and decision-makers with options using AI and other digital services? So, yeah, this will be probably the first place where we can value price because my goal is to bring in commercial technology to do that digital data fusion evaluation, AI application, etc. As I said a minute ago, commercial industry is investing, you know, 10x what our aerospace and defense industry could invest in these areas, and we need to take advantage of that."", ""The only way they're going to participate in a material fashion in that industry is value pricing. They're not going to provide cost information. It's just not how their industry works. You know, they're not delivering an airplane that you can add up all the costs that it took to make that airplane and give it to the government so they can give you the margin on top."", ""So, these command and control systems. And they're real programs, by the way. Defense of Guam is a program like this. AIR6500 is one that I mentioned."", ""And also, something called Joint Fires Network, which will be deployed in the INDOPACOM command of the U.S. So, this is where I think it will start. And then as we look at mission road maps that we've established and drawn out inside of Lockheed Martin and we're now sharing and have been sharing with the U.S. services and DOD, we're looking for capability gaps where digital technology can really make a difference, right? So, I'll give you one really quick one."", ""So, if we could get a direct feed from, you know, an orbiting satellite scanning a wide swath of the Pacific to find ships and actually directly provide that data link and that information to aircraft flying in the area, then those aircraft can vector toward those targets and turn on their radars and get a much more precise location and maybe even a tracking solution to sink the ship, if that's what's needed. And so, that's a mission gap, a capability gap that we would have in an anti-ship mission. And so, you know, how do we value price that because that's basically a data management exercise, which requires what we call 5G.MIL? It requires an artificial intelligence solution within it, and it requires, you know, the management of that data at various classifications, which is something, you know, not many companies can do, besides those in our industry. So, we can value price something like that."", ""And I think it'd be a capability gap that would be interesting to the Department of Defense and they might accept value pricing. But, you know, not to take too much time on this topic, but one of the things that we're really advocating for at Lockheed Martin, and we've got some friends of the court that are trying to work with us on this, is how do we set up an adjacent acquisition process in the Department of Defense to its traditional acquisition process, designed and reconstituted and originated to purchase digital services versus platforms and products, which is what the traditional acquisition system is built to do. That is a heavy lift. It is very complicated."", ""It's what I kind of referenced earlier where you're literally going to need an act of Congress to do this. But if we want a value price as an industry, bring in commercial partners at scale, I think the government needs to consider and actually go do this with us."", 'Jay Malave -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Let me just circle back, Sheila, on the margins in your question. I'll use MFC as an example in 2024. When you look at their headwind, their headwind is about 200 basis points of margin compression in the year 2024. The MFC classified program is actually accounted for 230."", ""And so, the rest of their business is actually expanding by 30 basis points. And so, they're doing everything we would expect them to do in their core business. In general, across all of Lockheed Martin, the way we're approaching these headwinds is really threefold. First, we're just keeping a tight lid on overhead and indirect costs and streamlining that cost structure where the opportunities exist."", ""The second is we're driving cost reduction in our direct cost base through supply chain optimization, factory productivity, and also 1LMX-driven efficiencies. And then lastly, we talked about a little bit earlier in the call is just making sure that we're employing pricing discipline across our bidding proposals. And so, those three together will help us drive to a better result in the future and give us confidence that we'll be able to expand margins, even with these headwinds."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Seth Seifman from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.', 'Seth Seifman -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', ""Hey. Thanks very much and good morning, everyone. Maybe one clarification and one question. Jay, on F-35, at the end of '24, should we think about there being maybe 120 undelivered aircraft in inventory based on, you know, the production rate of, you know, 150-plus and the deliveries you've told us? That's the clarification, and that inventory will have to be worked out over the subsequent year or two? And then as far as the question goes, I think you talked about 10 basis points to 20 basis points of segment margin expansion in '25."", ""You know, if we thought about only one lot exercised on classified missile, that's probably 25 basis points. The margin in aeronautics seems pretty depressed in '24. So, you know, you'd think there may be some potential for expansion there. And you just talked about the efforts that you're making across the company to support margins."", ""Are there other discrete headwinds that we're not aware of that wouldn't allow -- you know, that would prevent more than that kind of 10 basis points to 20 basis points that you outlined?"", 'Jay Malave -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. Let me start with that question first, and I'll come back to the F-35. Just on the 2025 margins going forward, yes, it would be essentially one lot versus two. However, you got to take into account the volumes that are in that lot versus the volumes that were in these first two lots."", ""And so, you really -- if you think about it from a gross headwind, it doesn't necessarily change all that much because you're -- there's more in there. And so, that's what's keeping the pressure. You know, there's not just an automatic lift because we're going from two lots to one lot in a subsequent year. On the F-35, I mean, I think what you -- the way you talk about it, Seth, is right."", 'Anywhere between 100 to 120 aircraft is -- in terms of undelivered against the 156 type of expected delivery rate is the right way to think about it, yes.', 'Operator', 'Thank you.

Look, the Black Hawk -- and, you know, I've gotten to fly it autonomously and by hand, actually. I think it has a lot of potential. There's an interest in Congress for modernization of the Black Hawk."", ""There's a huge fleet out there. And by adding some of these digital capabilities like autonomy and AI to the Black Hawk, which is a really reliable platform that's offline, in units today in great numbers and across our allies, that's a real, I think, value opportunity for the armies and rank corps and others that use the helicopter. So, I do think there's a lot of upside there. I don't want to comment on anybody else's programs or how well or not they may be doing."", ""But this is a proven scaled vehicle which with digital technology upgrade and insertion can be very, very versatile. And that can be done much more rapidly than new production of new aircraft. So, I do think that there's upside there. Now, the services and Congress have to agree to that and fund those modernizations and keep those units flying, and that'll be up to them."", 'But we are trying to provide them every opportunity to make that decision by inserting digital and other technologies like autonomy that will really make the aircraft much more capable in doing missions like air evacuation, resupply of a hot landing zone, things like that, that when you put it into the entire equation of completing a mission, it will be a good value to consider it.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.', 'Kristine Liwag -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', ""Hey. Jay, Jim, I mean, there's been discussion in the public markets about the depletion of U.S. missiles and munitions and a potential shortage. I mean, that said, from your commentary today, it sounds like supply chain issues continue to linger, weighing on the company's ability to convert the demand into revenue."", ""So, can you talk more about the additional actions you're taking to improve the supply chain's ability to get products through the system and what metrics are you monitoring and how much upside could you see in 2024 if things improve?"", 'Jim Taiclet -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', ""I'll make a couple of comments and ask Jay to follow up. The steps that we're taking to take the fragility out of the missile production system are varied. One of them is, and it's very specific, we are endeavoring to stand up a third solid rocket motor supplier in the United States that can be additive to the industry supply chain we have today, which hasn't been performing well, right? That's one piece. More broadly, we're using additive manufacturing and we're bringing in more varied suppliers into the supply chain so that we can get the materials we need from a more diverse set of group of suppliers outside of solid rocket motors."", ""And also, we're looking at international opportunities to build this equipment, including in Australia and in Poland, and U.K. and others that are kind of untapped for co-production or joint ventures with us to do these things. And Germany I should mention as well. So, these are some of the approaches we're taking."", 'And it really comes down to these three areas which is how can we, on one hand, take basic steps in anti-fragility to more suppliers, more diversity on the supply chain. Different labor pools, better training, those kinds of things which are just basic. Secondly, how can we insert technology to make this a more reliable production system, which we just mentioned? And then thirdly is how do we get international countries and take advantage of their labor forces, their supply -- sub-supply chains, etc. and get them into the production system? So, we look at this in all three areas of our core company strategy and apply it to missile production.', 'Jay, anything you want to add?', 'Jay Malave -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. I'll just say, you know, over the last year, Kristine, you know, we've deployed resources. So, we haven't just sat back and waiting for improvement.

So, my question is, was this due to a lot of the fixed price development, more aggressive bidding, and now, you're trying to change that so when we look toward 2025, we actually could see margins go up from where they'd be in 2024, or kind of are they just lower margins overall that we expect to see from what we used to see?"", 'Jim Taiclet -- Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer', ""George, hey, it's Jim here.

And so, we are taking the shareholders' interest into account and all the things we've talked about, which should help improve our margins, even though it may result in some, you know, difficult discussions with some of the customer base.

I am now pleased to turn the call over to Joaquin."", 'Joaquin Duato', ""Thank you, Jess, and good morning, everyone. 2023 was a remarkable year for Johnson & Johnson. In becoming a 2-sector company focused on Innovative Medicine and MedTech, we strengthened our position as an innovation powerhouse. With breakthrough science and transformative technology, we innovate across the entire patient pathway in ways no other company can. And as we shared at our enterprise business review, we have a stronger growth and margin profile and are more focused and agile than ever before, which is what you see with today's results. I'm particularly proud of our Q4 results with Innovative Medicine operational sales, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, growing by 9.5%, a metric adjusted operational sales growing by an impressive 9.1%. For the full year, we delivered strong and sustained performance with 9% operational sales growth, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, and 10.8% adjusted operational earnings per share growth. These results reflect the breadth and competitiveness of our portfolio. And when I look at the milestones we achieved in 2023 and the promise of our pipeline, I have confidence in our guidance for 2024 and beyond. So let's take a deeper look at the business and what we achieved last year. Starting with Innovative Medicine for the full year, we delivered above-market operational sales growth of 7.2%, excluding the COVID-19 vaccine. Our Innovative Medicine business continues to be fueled by growth from key brands and the acceleration of sales of new products. Our multiple myeloma portfolio is a good example with significant contribution from recently launched products, including CARVYKTI, TECVAYLI and TALVEY. Turning to clinical trials. Key results from the year included positive Phase III readouts for more than 10 of our in-line and pipeline medicines, including CARVYKTI in 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy in multiple myeloma; DARZALEX in frontline multiple myeloma transplant-eligible patients; RYBREVANT in combination with chemotherapy and RYBREVANT plus lazertinib in nonsmall cell lung cancer; and finally, TREMFYA monotherapy in ulcerative colitis. In addition, we saw positive Phase I and Phase II readouts for nipocalimab and TAR-200 and TAR-210. And we initiated our Phase III clinical development programs for milvexian and our targeted oral peptide JNJ-2113. Beyond that, we received FDA breakthrough designation for TAR-200 for the treatment of bladder cancer and fast track designations for milvexian in atrial fibrillation, stroke and acute coronary syndrome. And with 19 U.S. and EU filings across our Innovative Medicine business in 2023, we have high expectations for the year ahead. Our recent announcement of a definitive agreement to acquire Ambrx to develop next-generation antibody drug conjugates further strengthens our Oncology pipeline. Now moving to MedTech. In 2023, we delivered full year operational sales growth of 12.4% and full year adjusted operational sales growth of 7.8%. For the first time, our MedTech team delivered more than $30 billion in sales as we continue to build a best-in-class business. We are accelerating growth through commercial execution, differentiated innovation and moving into higher-growth markets as you saw with our successful integration of Abiomed and our recent acquisition of Laminar, which focused on eliminating the left atrial appendage in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. And at the same time, we are making strong progress in our pipeline, including advancing our Ottava surgical robot, MONARCH approval in China for bronchoscopy and continued market expansion for VELYS, our robotic-assisted solution for total knee replacement with CE Mark approval in 2023. In electrophysiology. We have a lot of momentum in our post-field ablation portfolio. We announced regulatory approval a few weeks ago for the VARIPULSE PFA platform in Japan and have submitted for CE Mark approval in the EU. The (inaudible) generator has received approval in the EU. And we received first and only approval from the U.S. FDA for a zero fluoroscopy workflow for cardiac ablation. And in the fourth quarter, findings from our Q DOT micro catheter Q efficiency study showed that very high power, short duration ablations improved quality of life and reduced health care utilization for atrial fibrillation patients. In Vision, we are driving strong performance across our TECNIS IOLs and OASYS 1-Day family of contact lenses, including our most premium lens, ACUVUE OASYS MAX 1-Day, which has proven superiority in comfort and clarity than the competition. Turning to Abiomed. We recently completed our Impella ECP pivotal clinical trial. In Q4, we also enrolled our first patient in the Abiomed Recover IV randomized, controlled trial. As we look ahead, I have never been more excited about the future of our business. At our enterprise business review, we shared that we expect our Innovative Medicine business to grow 5% to 7% from 2025 to 2030 with our industry-leading pipeline and portfolio delivering more than 10 assets that have the potential to generate over $5 billion in peak year sales by 2030. We also expect a further 15 assets to have the potential for $1 billion to $5 billion in peak year sales. In 2024, we expect data readouts for many of these assets, including Phase III trials for TREMFYA in IBD, ERLEADA in heavy stage prostate cancer, our targeted oral peptide, JNJ-2113 in psoriasis, nipocalimab in myasthenia gravis as well as aticaprant and seltorexant in major depressive disorder. We also expect Phase II readouts for our combination therapy, guselkumab and golimumab, JNJ-4804 in psoriatic arthritis, nipocalimab in Sjogren's disease and TAR-200 in nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer. In MedTech, we shared that we expect to grow at the upper range of our markets, which are anticipated to grow by 5% to 7% between 2022 and 2027. And that by 2027, we expect 1/3 of our revenue to be generated by new products. In 2024, we see strong progress towards these goals in electrophysiology that includes the full U.S. market release of Q DOT my catheter. And we are expecting CE Mark approval for our post-field ablation catheter VARIPULSE in Europe in the first half of 2024. We plan to submit an investigational device exemption to the FDA for Ottava in the second half of 2024. And in Abiomed, we expect U.S. commercial launch of Impella RP Flex with smart assist and an Impella ECP submission in 2024. As you can see, our pipeline is advancing. Our business is transforming. Before I turn the call to Jess and Joe, I want to thank our teams around the world for everything they do help our patients. We have entered 2024 from a position of strength, and I'm confident in our ability to lead the next wave of health innovation. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jess."", 'Jessica Moore', ""Thanks, Joaquin. Unless otherwise stated, the financial results and guidance highlighted reflects the continuing operations of Johnson & Johnson. We will report the Consumer Health financial results as discontinued operations. Furthermore, the percentages quoted represent operational results and therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation. Starting with Q4 2023 sales results. Worldwide sales were $21.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2023. Sales increased 7.2%, with 11% in the U.S. and 2.7% outside of the U.S. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 5.7% worldwide, 8.8% in the U.S. and 2.1% outside the U.S. It is important to note that sales in Europe were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 vaccine and loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA by approximately 1,500 basis points operationally. Turning now to earnings. For the quarter, net earnings were $4.1 billion, and diluted earnings per share was $1.70 versus diluted earnings per share of $1.22 a year ago. Excluding after-tax intangible asset amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $5.6 billion. And the diluted earnings per share was $2.29, representing increases of 2.4% and 11.7%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 11.2%. For the full year 2023, sales were $85.2 billion. Sales grew 7.4%, with 10.6% in the U.S. and 3.8% outside of the U.S. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 5.9% worldwide, 8.2% in the U.S. and 3.4% outside the U.S. Sales in Europe were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 vaccine and loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA by approximately 1,000 basis points operationally. Net earnings for the full year 2023 were $13.3 billion. And diluted earnings per share was $5.20 versus diluted earnings per share of $6.14 a year ago. Full year 2023 adjusted net earnings were $25.4 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $9.92, representing increases of 6.8% and 11.1%, respectively, versus full year 2022. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 10.8%. I will now comment on business sales performance in the quarter. Beginning with Innovative Medicine. Worldwide Innovative Medicine sales of $13.7 billion increased 4% with growth of 9.5% in the U.S. and a decline of 3.1% outside of the U.S. Excluding COVID-19 vaccine sales, worldwide and U.S. sales growth was 9.5%, and growth outside of the U.S. was 9.4%. Sales outside the U.S., excluding the COVID-19 vaccine, were negatively impacted by approximately 120 basis points due to the loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA in Europe. Innovative Medicine growth was driven by our key brands and continued uptake from recently launched products, with 9 assets delivering double-digit growth. We continue to drive strong sales growth for both DARZALEX and ERLEADA, with increases of 22.2% and 19%, respectively. Within immunology. We saw sales growth in both STELARA and TREMFYA, with increases of 14.5% and 20.5%, respectively. This growth was driven by market growth and share gains as well as favorable patient mix in TREMFYA. Growth of 17.4% in pulmonary hypertension was driven by favorable patient mix, share gains and market growth. Turning to newly launched products. We continue to make progress on our launches of CARVYKTI and SPRAVATO. We are also encouraged by the early success of our launches of TECVAYLI and TALVEY, sales of which are driving the growth in Other Oncology. As a reminder, we expect to begin disclosing TECNIS sales in Q1 2024. Total Innovative Medicine sales growth was partially offset by unfavorable patient mix in XARELTO, a decrease in IMBRUVICA sales due to competitive pressures and a loss of exclusivity of ZYTIGA, REMICADE and Prezista.I'll now turn your attention to MedTech. Worldwide MedTech sales of $7.7 billion increased 13.4% with Abiomed contributing 4.5% to growth. Growth in the U.S. was 14.1% and 12.8% outside of the U.S. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, worldwide adjusted operational sales growth was 9.1%. MedTech was negatively impacted by international sanctions in Russia worth approximately 50 basis points, primarily in Advanced Surgery and Vision. Electrophysiology delivered double-digit growth of 25.2% with strong growth in all regions, including Europe. This growth was driven by our global market-leading portfolio, including the most recently launched QDOT RF ablation and OCTARAY catheters. Abiomed contributed $340 million in sales within the quarter driven by continued strong adoption of Impella 5.5 technology. Growth of 6.4% in surgery was driven primarily by procedure recovery and strength of our biosurgery and wound closure portfolios. Growth was partially offset by volume-based procurement in China, primarily in endocutters. Orthopaedics growth of 5% reflects procedure growth, success of recently launched products such as the global expansion of our VELYS digital solutions and expansion in ambulatory surgical centers as well as lapping of prior year (inaudible) VBP price concessions in spine. Growth of 6.6% in Vision was driven by price actions in contact lenses as well as strength of new products including ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products and contact lenses and TECNIS Eyehance, our monofocal intraocular lens and surgical vision. Growth of contact lenses was partially offset by U.S. stocking dynamics. Global Vision growth was negatively impacted by 140 basis points due to the Blink divestiture in Q3. Now turning to our consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023. I'd like to highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed compared to the same quarter of last year. Cost of products sold margin deleveraged by 130 basis points due to commodity inflation and unfavorable product mix in MedTech, partially offset by favorable patient mix and lower COVID-19 vaccine supply network-related exit cost in Innovative Medicine. We continue to invest strategically in research and development at competitive levels, [investing] $4.5 billion or 20.9% of sales this quarter. We invested $3.4 billion or 24.5% of sales in Innovative Medicine with the increase in investment being driven by higher milestones, partially off by portfolio prioritization. In MedTech, R&D investment was $1.1 billion or 14.6% of sales with the increase in investment primarily driven by the Laminar acquisition. Interest income was $212 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to $77 million of income in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase in income was driven by higher interest rates earned on cash balances and a lower average debt balance. The other income and expense line was income of $421 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to an expense of $795 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. This was primarily driven by higher unrealized gains on securities and [lower] COVID-19 vaccine-related exit costs. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate was 14.4% versus 16% in the same period last year. This decrease was primarily driven by the net decrease of tax liabilities, including the settlement of the 2013 through 2016 U.S. audit. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 10.8% versus 16.2% in the same period last year. I encourage you to review our upcoming 2023 10-K filing for additional details on specific tax-related matters. Lastly, I will direct your attention to the box section of the slide, where we have also provided our income before tax, net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of intangible amortization expense and special items. Now let's look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the fourth quarter of 2023, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise as a percentage of sales decreased from 32.5% to 29.2%. Innovative Medicine margins declined from 37.7% to 37.4%, primarily driven by higher R&D milestones, partially offset by favorable patient mix and leveraging and selling and marketing expense. MedTech margins declined from 24.5% to 15.5%, primarily driven by in-process research and development expense from the Laminar acquisition, commodity inflation and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by selling and marketing expense leverage. This concludes the sale and earnings portion of the call. I'm now pleased to turn it over to Joe."", 'Joseph J. Wolk', ""Thank you, Jessica, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. As Joaquin and Jessica commented, 2023 was a strong year for Johnson & Johnson evidenced by notable top and bottom line performance beats relative to what we guided to 2023 at this time last year. We are particularly proud of the innovation we advanced to strengthen our development pipelines, the continued expansion of our portfolio and investments made for future success. All of this provides us with a strong foundation as we enter 2024. Thus far during the call, you've heard about sales and income performance in 2023. So now let's dive into some detail on capital allocation highlights. We generated free cash flow of more than $18 billion in 2023. At the end of the year, we had approximately $23 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $29 billion of debt for a net debt position of $6 billion. We maintained a healthy balance sheet and robust credit rating, underscoring the strength of Johnson & Johnson's financial position, which enables us to strategically invest and deploy capital to unlock value. To that end, we executed against all of our capital allocation priorities in 2023. For starters, we invested more than $15 billion in research and development, or 17.7% of sales, an all-time high for the company as we remain one of the top investors in R&D across all industries. Jessica provided R&D investment by business segment, information we will continue to provide on a quarterly basis moving forward. As far as dividends, 2023 marked the 61st consecutive year in which we increased our dividend. We know this use of capital is a priority for our investors, and we plan to continue to increase our dividend annually. We also deployed, announced or committed over $3 billion in strategic value-creating inorganic growth opportunities in the last 12 months. This amount includes the recent Ambrx and Laminar transactions as well as more than 50 smaller early-stage licensing deals and partnerships that complement our current Innovative Medicine and MedTech pipelines. Finally, share repurchases. In early 2023, we completed the $5 billion share repurchase program initiated in late 2022 and in combination with our dividend, returned over $14 billion to shareholders last year. Through the Kenvue separation, we further reduced the Johnson & Johnson's outstanding share count by 191 million shares, or approximately 7%, without the use of cash and in a tax-free manner. Looking ahead to 2024, Johnson & Johnson's robust free cash flow generation should continue to solidify our already strong financial foundation and fuel further investment leading to growth for our business or returns to shareholders. Now turning to our full year 2024 guidance. Today, we are confirming the 2024 guidance for those items previewed at our enterprise business review in early December by filling in some of the details. We expect operational sales growth for the full year to be in the range of 5% to 6% or $88.2 billion to $89 billion. As a reminder, our sales guidance continues to exclude any impact from COVID-19 vaccine sales. In Innovative Medicine, we expect 2024 to deliver a 13th consecutive year of above-market growth, driven by market share gains from key brands such as DARZALEX, TREMFYA and ERLEADA, as well as continued adoption of recently launched newer products such as CARVYKTI, TECVAYLI, TALVEY and SPRAVATO. In MedTech, we remain focused on executing our key value drivers: first, advancing our differentiated pipeline such as programs in pulse field ablation, Abiomed and surgical robotics, further shifting our portfolio into high-growth markets. Second, expanding our reach and scale around the world. And third, building operational resilience across our portfolio. We don't speculate on future currency movements. But utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at $1.09 as well as other major currencies, we estimate there would be a slight unfavorable impact of $400 million or a negative 0.5% on reported sales growth for the year. Turning to other items on our P&L. We expect our 2024 adjusted pretax operating margin to improve by approximately 50 basis points, driven primarily by a continuation of efficiency programs across the organization. We expect this to be partially offset by anticipated STELARA biosimilar entrants in Europe in the second half of this year and some lingering inflation impact in MedTech inventory that will flow through 2024's P&L. This margin improvement encompasses dilution of additional investment associated with our planned acquisition of Ambrx, which will be treated as a business combination. Now we do acknowledge that the 50 basis point improvement simply gets us back to what your models expected, given the elevated Q4 2023 R&D investment for new pipeline assets. Regarding other income and expense. We anticipate income to be $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion for 2024. This is less than the 2023 amount, driven by the impact of actuarial assumptions on certain employee benefit programs such as lower discount rates. We are comfortable with new modeling net interest income between $450 million and $550 million, consistent with 2023 levels. Finally, we are projecting an effective tax rate for 2024 in the range of 16% to 17% based on current tax laws and anticipated geographic income mix across our businesses. This tax rate takes into account an increase of approximately 1.5% or 150 basis points relative to the recently enacted Pillar 2 legislation. We continue to believe the U.S. Treasury's current perspective on Pillar 2 is harmful, reducing U.S. incentives for innovation and resulting in U.S.-based multinational companies paying more tax revenue to foreign governments. Our full year share count calculation for adjusted earnings per share in 2024 will include the remaining benefit equal to approximately 120 million shares from the approximately 191 million net share reduction in outstanding J&J shares following the Kenvue exchange offer. Given all these factors, we expect adjusted operational earnings per share to grow 7.4% at the midpoint for a range of $10.55 to $10.75. Based on the euro spot rate of 1.09 from last week, we do not estimate any currency impact on earnings per share. I'll now provide some qualitative considerations on quarterly phasing for your models. We expect Innovative Medicine sales growth to be slightly stronger in the first half of the year compared to the second half, given the anticipated entry of STELARA biosimilars in Europe towards the middle of the year. This headwind will be partially offset by continued uptake from our recently launched products. We project MedTech operational sales growth to be relatively consistent throughout the year, expecting procedures in 2024 to remain above pre-COVID levels. The first half of the year will continue to have modest impact from Russia sanctions as our licenses are approved. We anticipate China VBP pricing for surgical IOLs and orthopedic sports to begin in 2024 with impacts from 2023 VBP in electrophysiology, endocutters, energy, spine and trauma to begin to anniversary throughout 2024. Regarding EPS phasing. It is important to highlight that the first half of the year will benefit from the full 191 million net share reduction following the Kenvue exchange offer, with only a partial comparative benefit in the third quarter versus Q3 2023, and the fourth quarter being neutral versus Q4 2023. So based on the foundation strengthened in 2023 and numerous catalysts that Joaquin outlined across our business in 2024, we are confident in our ability to achieve both near- and long-term financial targets. I'd like to close by thanking our colleagues for their dedication and commitment to benefit patients around the world. It is their effort that enables Johnson & Johnson to deliver innovative therapies and solutions that address serious unmet medical needs and creates long-term sustainable value for shareholders. With that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Kevin to begin the Q&A portion of the call."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from Joanne Wuensch from Citi.', 'Joanne Karen Wuensch', ""With my one question, I'm curious why you're looking for 2024 procedure volumes to remain above pre-COVID levels and your expectations for how long that will last?"", 'Joaquin Duato', ""Thank you, Joanne, and good morning, everyone. First, let me remark the strong close of our MedTech business in 2023. We delivered annually more than $30 billion in sales, which is -- were all-time high in our company history with operational -- adjusted operational growth in the fourth quarter of 9.1. So very strong results across the board in electrophysiology, in recovery, in surgery, in orthopedics and in vision. So when we think about our results in 2023, we think it's going to be aligned with our competitor composite for the year but ahead of our competitor composite in the fourth quarter. Now certainly, COVID-19 impacts have stabilized globally. While we continue to see some challenges, macro challenges from the point of view of inflation, hospital staffing and the like, there is a bolus of patients coming out into the market after COVID-19, which has made 2023 market growth faster than historical averages. And we see that trend continuing into a good part of 2024. And therefore, being a tailwind into 2024. There's a lot of factors playing into that. But overall, we see the amended procedures continuing into, at least, the first half of 2024. Now we also have a number of tailwinds on our side, other than the procedures that make me optimistic about 2024. We have the trajectory of Abiomed in heart recovery, which is very strong with the adoption of Impella 5.5. We filed already for our Impella ECP, which is the smaller version of Impella CP. In orthopedics, we continue to move into higher-growth markets with the expansion of our VELYS Robotic-Assisted Solution. We obtained CE Mark in Europe. In surgery, we continue to launch innovations across our surgery business with the ENSEAL X1 Curved Jaw Tissue Sealer in energy and ECHELON 3000 as a Stapler. And we continue to see good expansion of our Plus Sutures, too. In our Vision business, we are expanding our TECNIS family into the premium segment of IOLs. And finally, and I know this is an area of interest to you. In electrophysiology, we continue to expand our PFA portfolio of catheters. We obtained approval for our VARIPULSE, loop catheter, PFA loop catheter in Japan at the beginning of this year. And we continue to roll out the global launch of QDOT Micro, our newest radiofrequency ablation catheter. So overall, a number of catalysts and tailwinds into our MedTech business into 2024. As we discussed in our enterprise business review, we continue to see our MedTech business growing at the upper end of our markets and becoming a best-in-class competitor in MedTech."", 'Operator', 'Next question is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley.', 'Terence C. Flynn', ""Great. Maybe 2 parts for me on CARVYKTI. I noticed an ODAC panel was just announced to review the CARTITUDE-4 data. I was just wondering if you can talk about the focus of that upcoming meeting and your confidence in an on-time label expansion for CARTITUDE-4. And then the second part of the question is I know in manufacturing, you've been ramping up in Belgium. And I believe that facility is now up and running. So how should we think about supply for 2024 broadly for CARVYKTI?"", 'Joaquin Duato', ""Thank you, Terence. So with more than 2,000 patients treated, CARVYKTI, it's really the fastest launch CAR-T in the market overall. And we are pleased to continue to see quarter-over-quarter sequential growth in CARVYKTI. And overall, we remain confident in 2 things, both the risk benefit of CARVYKTI in the indication that it is being studied, and at the same on the potential of CARVYKTI to be $5 billion-plus asset at peak year sales. Regarding the ODAC that you commented. We are very confident on the data of our Phase III CARTITUDE-4 study that support the efficacy and safety of CARVYKTI in 1 to 3 prior lines in the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. We presented the results at ASCO, as you know. And we also published those results in the New England Journal of Medicine. And we very much look forward to review the updated survival and safety data with the FDA ODAC in the future. We are committed to work with the FDA in the continued development of CARVYKTI. And we continue to have the focus on bringing this immunotherapy to multiple myeloma patients in early lines of therapy. We are working with the FDA towards a PDUFA date for our CARTITUDE-4 indication in April 5 and with EMEA towards an anticipated CHMP opinion in the first quarter of 2024. So overall, we feel confident about the risk-benefit profile in this indication and about the future of CARVYKTI. Regarding your manufacturing question. We've done a significant progress in our manufacturing capacity, which is a major driver in the continuous growth of CARVYKTI. On the cell processing side, we have doubled our cell processing capacity in our Raritan facility. Since 2023, we are making progress to your point, Terence, in our European cell processing facilities. We are already manufacturing the first batches of CARVYKTI for clinical use this month of January. And we also have contracted additional capacity, external capacity to scale up production and increase our ability moving forward, that will start mid this year. On the other hand, we have also made significant progress in the internalization and scale-up of our lentivirus production. We have increased capacity in Switzerland, in our Switzerland side. And at the same time, we continue to progress with new U.S. capacity and addition sites in the Netherlands to produce our lentivirus. Late December, we received approval to expand our lentivirus capacity from 20-liter tanks to 50-liter tanks of lentivirus production in our U.S. facility. So overall, we feel good that we are progressing with CARVYKTI, that we will continue to deliver quarter-over-quarter growth in 2024. And we are working towards building this $5 billion-plus product and continue to transform the treatment paradigm in multiple myeloma. As we have discussed in the past, moving from treating-to-progression to treating-to-cure as we move CARVYKTI into earlier lines of therapy."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is coming from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.', 'Lawrence H. Biegelsen', ""Congrats to a nice finish to the year here. Joe or Joaquin, I'd love to hear just a general update on your M&A appetite and expand on your recent comments about Abiomed being a gateway in cardiovascular devices, which you, Joaquin, commented on earlier this month."", 'Joseph J. Wolk', ""Yes. So Larry, let me start, and then I can turn it over to Joaquin. So we are very well positioned to continue to entertain many types of deals. As you know, we have the parameters of making sure that they are a strategic fit so that we've got scientific expertise and insights. A familiarity with the space has proven to be our most successful platforms. We want to make sure that we're earning a fair return to compensate shareholders for the risk that we're bearing on their behalf. It was only 13 months ago, we were able to deploy $17 billion in capital for Abiomed. We're very pleased with that acquisition. Not only has it beat our internal deal models, but it also is performing better than what the Street had called for that business prior to the announcement of the acquisition. So it's been a really nice fit. What I would say is we also deployed or announced, as I said in my prepared remarks, over $3 billion in capital for more than 50 smaller licensing partnerships or deals. And while those have not made headlines, they usually are headlines when they become products for patients. And so that when you think about our history of DARZALEX, IMBRUVICA, CARVYKTI for one, it's been -- that's kind of our track record. Our appetite is still, I would say, interested in moving into spaces that complement our existing portfolio, whether that be for the near or long term."", 'Joaquin Duato', ""Thank you. And look, talking about that, Larry. Let me say we are agnostic to sector and agnostic to size. And as Joe commented, our preference is clearly to be in areas in which we have internal capabilities and know-how and also to go into products that represent a significant progress from the point of view of improving the current standard of care and that are first-in-class and best-in-class. To illustrate that, the 2 deals that we completed this year, Laminar and Ambrx would be in that direction. So for example, Laminar is a deal in an area we know well, which is atrial fibrillation, and we believe could be first-in-class to be a device that can eliminate the left atrial appendage. When it comes to Ambrx, it's a deal in an area that we have a strong legacy like prostate cancer with a number of products marketed already. And this could be a first-in-class antibody drug conjugate, in order to address a significant medical need in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in patients that have failed under gene therapy. So very much so and in that context, we continue to see also opportunities when it comes to Innovative Medicines in neuroscience and in immunology. And when it comes to MedTech, to your point, in other cardiology areas based on the strength that we have now with Biosense Webster and Abiomed, and not excluding also the potential for other areas like robotic surgery or segments of orthopedics that are growing faster and also areas of vision. So overall, that's our approach. We try to put this strategic, scientific and to Joe's point, scientific lens, in order to be able to deliver value for patients and also value for our shareholders."", 'Operator', 'Next question is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.', 'Christopher Thomas Schott', ""Just, Joe, a question for you. How should we think about gross margins in 2024 and beyond? I know you've talked about operating margins, but it did seem like adjusted gross margins came down in 4Q. And I'm just wondering if that's a one-off result or a longer-term trend when you think about -- as we think about kind of the cadence of your P&L over the next few years."", 'Joseph J. Wolk', ""Chris, thanks for the question. I think as you look at that specifically for the fourth quarter, what you have in our operating margins is obviously the Laminar transaction that was part of that mix. So on our slide that details IBT, you likely saw a quarterly reduction in MedTech, specifically of about 9 points, about 2 points for the full year. I would say 2/3 of that is represented by the Laminar transaction. You also then have, I would say, in the fourth quarter specific some mix as orthopedics performed probably a little bit better than it had in previous quarters. And then you have the inflationary impact, obviously, with higher levels of inventory on our balance sheet that flow through the P&L, that is occurring throughout 2023. And we expect it to occur throughout at least the first half of 2024. We're not seeing any incremental inflation in, I'll call it, current activity. So it's not being additive to inventory, but it's also not subsiding either. So we're kind of at a new, I'd say water level, if you will, that should be going forward but not hurting as we look out beyond the second half of 2024."", 'Operator', 'Next question is coming from Shagun Singh from RBC Capital Markets.', 'Shagun Singh Chadha', ""I was just wondering if we could get your latest thoughts on the potential impact of Novo's osteoarthritis data on orthopedic utilization, given the focus on WOMAC or pain scores. I believe the presentation could be here soon. Just curious to hear your thoughts and also what kind of scores could or may not have a potential impact."", 'Joaquin Duato', ""So overall, look, that is a contributor to knee surgery. Sometimes I'm asked about osteoarthritis in the context of the GLP-1s, and weight is not a factor in osteoarthritis. We continue to look at this data, and it's early for us to give you an answer there. Now what we can tell you is that we continue to see an increased volume of procedures in orthopedics based on coming out of COVID. And we don't see any change in that neither in the hips or in the knee area or in any of the segments that we compete. So we are optimistic about our orthopedics trajectory. Specifically we are optimistic about how we are progressing with our VELYS Robotic System for total knee replacement. We have already have 30,000 procedures with very positive feedback from the surgeons, especially in the ambulatory surgical centers. We are working to submit our 510(k) for our VELYS unique knee application. And we are seeing a strong recovery also in our hip business with a combination of new products like ACTIS, KINCISE and VELYS hip navigation. So we feel good about our orthopedics business as we continue to see global procedure recovery in most markets. We continue to succeed with our new products, and we love also part of the headwind that we had in China during this year. So very positive outlook moving forward for our orthopedics business."", 'Joseph J. Wolk', ""It's also important to maybe provide us a reminder what we commented to last quarter, and that's -- we're looking very hard at improving the profitability of the orthopedics unit. So being very selective as to what geographies we play in and what SKUs are actually going to be offered. So not only will you see some of the strength in the top line, as Joaquin outlined, but you should see an improved margin profile for that business as well."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is coming from Vamil Divan from Guggenheim Securities.', 'Vamil Kishore Divan', ""So just maybe an area we don't spend as much time on is on the respiratory side, PAH. But just sort of a 2-part question, but that franchise of yours continue to sort of outperform expectations. So curious if you can talk about sort of what's driving success there. There's also an area where you don't have a lot of sort of longer-term investment. So going back to sort of the business development question, I'm just curious in your interest in sort of PAH or respiratory more generally as an area, further focus given your key franchises are going to be going away but you do have the infrastructure there already."", 'Joaquin Duato', ""So first, let me underline the great results of our PAH franchise in 2023. We had growth in the high teens driven by improved patient mix, market growth coming out of COVID, too. This was an area that was heavily impacted by COVID as pulmonologists were working at COVID and not diagnosing new patients. So overall, it's been a very positive trajectory of our PAH business, and we remain confident about the short-term future of this business into 2024. We are working towards the combination of macitentan, OPSUMIT with Tadalafil, which the trademark would be OPSYNVI. And that would be another option for patients there to enhance compliance. And in my talks with physicians treating pulmonary hypertension, they seem very positive about it, and we expect an approval of that combination in 2024. So that's the outlook for our pulmonary franchise. Are we looking at other areas there? There, we are looking at the space and see if there are potential opportunities to be able to improve the standard of care. And we continue to look to see how we can continue to extend success of our pulmonary franchise into the future. But overall, we're very happy with the trajectory of our pulmonary franchise in 2023. And we expect a similar trajectory as macitentan, OPSUMIT and UPTRAVI become standard of care clearly established in this area."", 'Operator', 'Your next question today is coming from Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald.', 'Louise Alesandra Chen', 'I just wanted to ask you with respect to your oncology franchise. Do you have any thoughts on CAR-Ts for autoimmune disease at all? And then secondly, radiopharmaceutical?', 'Joaquin Duato', ""So thank you, Louise. And we have a strong oncology franchise in different areas. I commented that here in prostate cancer with ERLEADA that I discussed before. We'll see data in high-risk localized prostate cancer in 2024 with the addition of Ambrx now, an antibody drug conjugate in this area. We are very, very excited about RYBREVANT and the combination of RYBREVANT plus lazertinib. We have Phase III studies completed. We expect -- we have filed all the 3 indications, and we expect approval of that in 2024. So we are very excited about RYBREVANT and the combination of RYBREVANT plus lazertinib in EGFR-mutated nonsmall cell lung cancer in first line. Moving into bladder cancer. You also will see data with TARIS-200, and TARIS-210 in nonmuscle invasive localized bladder cancer. And we received FDA breakthrough designation for TARIS-200 in 2023. And then we continue our progress in our multiple myeloma franchise. We talk about CARVYKTI, but it's important to recognize how well TECVAYLI and TALVEY, our 2 bispecific antibodies, are performing in the marketplace and the continued growth of DARZALEX with the impressive per sales data that we presented in first-line in newly diagnosed transplant-eligible multiple myeloma patients. So we are looking at CAR-T in autoimmune diseases to your question, yes. But it's early data. As you know, we did a deal earlier in 2023 to partner 2 CAR-Ts, a CD19 and a CD19/CD20 BiCAR. So we are looking at that, and it's early data. It looks promising. We are interested in radiopharmaceuticals. We believe that the avenue that we are doing with antibody drug conjugates, it's an important therapeutic option. And when it comes to radiopharmaceuticals, we did a deal earlier this year with Nanobiotix for a radio enhancer that they still been developing head and neck cancer. We expanded our rights at the end of the year. And this could be another avenue to be there for us in which we could combine our expertise in medical devices, in medical technology and pharmaceuticals. And we plan to do a broader development plan of our radio enhancer, and we'll provide you more information about it as we continue to move. So overall, we are very pleased with the progress that we see in our oncology franchise, both in solid tumors and in hematology. And it remains a core strength of our Innovative Medicine group."", 'Operator', 'Next question is coming from Matt Miksic from Barclays.', 'Matthew Stephan Miksic', 'I wanted to follow up on some of the comments you made about MedTech trends and margins. And I think you mentioned some of the headwinds there were patient mix. Would love to get an idea of maybe kind of in the middle of the P&L and the operating line, in terms of margin progression throughout the year. Which ones of those of your business lines there are kind of more reflecting that negative mix that you described and how that progresses during the year?', 'Joseph J. Wolk', ""Yes, Matt, I apologize, but it was a little bit tough to hear your question entirely. I think it was around margins, specifically in MedTech and how that may progress through the year. So as I stated earlier, I would say that the margin profile is going to be impacted by inflationary pressures that were incurred really in 2022, sit on our balance sheet as inventory and then kind of flow through the P&L throughout the corresponding 2023 and probably a good piece of 2024. That being said, Tim and the team are doing magnificent work in terms of finding efficiencies across the business. I highlighted one of the earlier ones with respect to orthopedics. But we're, quite frankly, doing that across the entire MedTech portfolio at this point in time, looking for opportunities whether it be aided by artificial intelligence or just infrastructure overall as to how we can further improve the MedTech profitability profile. Right now, we stand a little bit above the middle of the pack in terms of our peer set on margin. And we're looking to get towards the upper end of that peer set."", 'Operator', 'Our next question today is coming from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America.', 'Geoffrey Christopher Meacham', 'Great. I just wanted to ask you about the XARELTO patient mix that you guys called out. Just help us with kind of current dynamics and maybe looking forward whether this trend you expect to continue.', 'Jessica Moore', ""Yes, Geoff, I can answer that one. So specifically on XARELTO in the quarter. We would say there's 2 items. It's patient mix, but there is also a onetime entry. Moving forward in 2024, we do expect that there will be a decline but not to the extent that you saw in Q4."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is coming from Danielle Antalffy from UBS.', 'Danielle Joy Antalffy', ""Joe, sorry to harp on the MedTech margin side of things. I appreciate everything you're saying for going forward. But just as we look at Q4 specifically, even adding back Laminar, we're still getting to sort of down 400 basis points year-over-year in the quarter. And I was just hoping maybe you could bridge us a little bit more. Is there any component of that is sort of price increases taken in late '22 into '23 rolling off? Or anything that you would highlight there."", 'Joseph J. Wolk', ""No, Danielle. I think it's really the inflationary impact. So out of the 9% drop that you saw in Q4, 5 points are really Laminar. The other -- the balance of 4 points, I would chalk up to the inflationary impact that I spoke of earlier and then the mix component, whereby orthopedics, which is our lowest margin portfolio within the MedTech portfolio overall, performed a little bit better. So there's really nothing magical behind it other than the explanations that were already given on the call. Again, we are looking at cost improvement initiatives, specifically in orthopedics, but across the entire portfolio as we move through 2024. But there's nothing that happened -- maybe this is the best way to state it. There's nothing that happened in Q4 that has us concerned about our outlook or calls around margin profile or EPS for the balance of this upcoming year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is coming from David Risinger from Leerink Partners.', 'David Reed Risinger', ""So notwithstanding the recently announced Ambrx acquisition, in recent years, J&J has executed more MedTech M&A than pharma M&A. And I don't mean to belabor the point. I know that you got some specific therapeutic area questions. But could you just comment at a high level on what has held J&J back in pharma M&A in recent years? And whether we should expect greater cash deployment to accelerate long-term pharma revenue growth going forward?"", 'Joaquin Duato', ""So thank you, David. And M&A has been -- M&A and external innovation has been a core of our pharma portfolio growth and transformation. As I said initially, we are agnostic to sector. In the case of pharma, our preferred mode has been trying to go to assets that were around proof-of-concept. So generally speaking, from a size perspective, it's been about deals that have been either of a smaller size or have been different modalities like client senses or partnerships. Just last year, we completed overall, at Johnson & Johnson, more than 50 deals. The thing is that the headlines are only made by the ones that are M&A. So we've done multiple deals in our pharmaceutical side in order to be able to enhance our existing portfolio. And our bias is to go for transactions that are going to enable us to create more value by leveraging our clinical development strength, our manufacturing capabilities and our commercial reach. So hence, why the majority of the deals that you see in our pharmaceutical side are at an earlier stage. Are we looking broader than that? Yes, we do. But mainly, we find more opportunities to create value at an earlier stage. For example, this year, we did a number of deals that went less publicized. We did, as I commented before, a deal with CBMG now called AbelZeta, in CAR-T with CD19 and CD20, which we believe could be a best-in-class CAR-T in this area that could launch in this decade or at the end of the year. We also did another deal in antibody drug conjugates with a Korean company called LegoChem, which was underreported. But we continue to work in identifying deals in our pharmaceutical space that enables us to be able to put all our capabilities to work in the clinical development side, in manufacturing and in commercial. And that's been the source of very significant value creation in products that all of you know, like DARZALEX or CARVYKTI, that come from that type of approach of going earlier on into the development process."", 'Operator', 'Our final question today is coming from Rick Wise from Stifel.', 'Frederick Allen Wise', ""Maybe you could expand a little bit more on your electrophysiology comments. You had an extraordinary quarter. I'm guessing the new products helped. Maybe you could give us a little more color on maybe quantify the impact -- the negative impact from China VBP. And looking ahead, we've got not -- we've got one PFA device approved in the U.S. Another one seemingly coming in the next month or 3 maybe. How should we think about the EP franchise as we look ahead to '24? What are you incorporating in your thinking?"", 'Joaquin Duato', ""So thank you for the question. Great and strong results of our EP franchise in 2023. And you should think about our EP franchise in 2024 as also a strong year, another year of growth, a strong growth for our EP franchise. If I look at the -- to your point that the drivers of growth in 2023, it was across the board. I mean it was in Asia Pacific, in the U.S. and EMEA. It was driven by the procedure recovery but also by the new product performance and some offset also, a slight offset of value-based procurement in China. The new products that we introduced this year are the engine generator, our mapping catheters, OCTARAY and OPTRELL. And also, importantly, our QDOT MICRO Catheter in radiofrequency ablation that has efficacy results higher than any PFA catheter. And that together with our strong commercial execution and broad clinical support across the board has driven this result in electrophysiology that in the fourth quarter was 25% growth globally, 22% growth in the U.S. and 29% outside of the U.S. So very strong results. So we have a strong leadership in electrophysiology and 20 years of understanding this field. And when it comes to our strategy in cardiac ablation, we have multiple strategies, but one core strategy is our CARTO mapping system. That is a fundamental pillar of our strategy in cardiac ablation that supports procedural efficiency and very importantly, now low to zero fluoroscopy workflow. For the electrophysiologist, it's very important to know where they are and what are they doing to the heart anatomy. Otherwise, they are flying blind if they don't have a mapping system. And the CARTO system, it's providing the electrophysiologist real-time feedback and very important parameters like tissue proximity, contact force measurement and ablation indexes that give them an idea of how durable deletion is going to be and what are going to be the outcomes of the procedures. So that's key for us to be able to have a workflow that enables the type of progress that electrophysiologists have been already used to with radio frequency ablation. And hence, all our suite of catheters, it's is going to be from Day 1, fully integrated in our mapping system. We have 5,000 CARTO systems already deployed globally and an extensive network of mappers to support the electrophysiologist. When it comes to our catheters, we are developing a full portfolio of options. You commented on VARIPULSE, our multi-electrode catheter that was approved in Japan. We are developing a focal and a large focal catheter and also a single shot one. So electrophysiologists are going to be able to choose the catheter that is more appropriate for their anatomy and for the workflow that they are selecting. We have 5 clinical trials active, 3 of them have completed. And we have submitted our VARIPULSE catheter for CE Mark, and we plan submitting the VARIPULSE catheter to the U.S. FDA in 2024. Ultimately, PFA is an important option, but RF is also here to stay. That's why we believe that having the workflow and the procedure efficiency that CARTO gives you plus the option of having a catheter, like our dual energy catheter that would enable electrophysiologists to simply change depending on the anatomy of deletion from PFA to RFA, it's going to be important for the future. And it's going to help them adopting PFA as this is the most widely used catheter in the world. So very positive about our growth in 2024 based on the strength that we have in this area. I'm positive about the outlook of our ablation business moving forward. As we have commented in multiple occasions, atrial fibrillation. It's an area that is still undertreated. And the outcomes of radio frequency ablation and most likely, the outcomes of PFA have shown significant improvement even compared to medical therapy. So very positive about the outlook of our -- and the strength of our atrial fibrillation business."", 'Jessica Moore', ""Thank you, Rick, and thanks to everyone for your questions and your continued interest in our company. We apologize to those we couldn't get to because of time, but don't hesitate to reach out to the Investor Relations team with any remaining questions you may have. I will now turn the call back over to Joaquin for some brief closing remarks."", 'Joaquin Duato', ""Thank you, Jess. The strong performance we delivered in '23 gives me great confidence in the trajectory of our business. As I said earlier, we are entering 2024 from a position of strength, and we have multiple catalysts for growth. No other company is as well positioned as Johnson & Johnson to lead the next wave of health care innovation. And we look forward to sharing our progress in the year ahead.

That\'s according to ""The New York Times"". So Alibaba, Julie, big names making some big purchases.', 'We got founder Jack Ma has been buying shares. Bought $50 million worth of stock in the quarter. Of course, Ma is no longer executive chairman, but still an important shareholder over there. And then Chairman Joe Tsai has been buying too. And Bloomberg pointing out this is actually the first time his fund has purchased shares since at least the last quarter of 2017.', ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. And it seems to represent a change here, right? Because even Ma himself has been sort of critical of Alibaba falling behind some of its competitors, Temu Group. Temu, for example, owned by PDD. So there's, you know, so this seems to represent a vote of confidence, if you will, in the company that he founded. And I think that's part of the reason why we are seeing other investors follow him."", ""The other reason, of course, is the stock has done so poorly, right? And so that's part of the reason. You could also-- and we're going to talk about this more in the show-- put it down perhaps somewhat to the report that China is considering some measures to prop up its stock market. So all of that combined it seems helping with Alibaba."", ""JOSH LIPTON: To your point, we should note, I mean, the stocks popping today. But yikes, I mean, it's still down about 40% in the past 12 months."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yes, it is. Let's talk about another company we're watching today. That is Johnson & Johnson. It posted an earnings beat for the fourth quarter sales, surging in its pharmaceutical and medical devices business. The shares, though, are down here 1.6%. It looks like analysts and investors were zeroing in on the profit margins in its medical device unit. The company put that down too. They had some costs related to an acquisition. They had commodity, inflation. They called it an unfavorable product mix as well. And so that's something that's been weighing on the stock."", ""They also, like so many of these gigantic drug makers, they're facing competition in some of their top selling drugs, in this case, it's a drug called Stelara to treat psoriasis, which is going to be facing competition in Europe, specifically. And that could weigh on sales in the second half of the year."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Yeah. And another wrinkle here too, Julia, the investors consider how certain treatments being selected for Medicare price negotiations. And so you begin to think if you're an investor, OK, you kind of have to map out what exactly does that mean for sales looking ahead. Stocks in the red today and also over the past 12 months now."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Right. Finally here, let's take a look at Procter & Gamble reportedly mixed quarterly results and slashing its annual profit forecast. However, the company reported better than expected gross margins. So this one hits home, Julie Hyman. I mean, the Bounty paper towels, the Downy fabric softener, those are big in the Lipton household."", ""It looks like adjusted earnings beat.

Well, what in North America, volumes went up by 4% last quarter."", ""In China, the company struggled a little bit more. But in North America, even though prices rose, people bought more stuff.

The medical device giant failed to keep pace with broader equities, partly because it was still dealing with lingering pandemic-related issues, such as supply chain problems. However, Medtronic has a long and impressive track record of growing its revenue and earnings at a good clip and delivering solid returns to its shareholders."", ""While the past isn't a guarantee of anything, it's also important not to write off the company because of the headwinds it encountered in recent years. With that said, let's look deeper into Medtronic's business and decide whether it is worth buying its shares today."", ""Investors have been unsatisfied with Medtronic's revenue growth since before the pandemic."", ""Thankfully, the company is making moves to improve on that front. Medtronic is giving its business a makeover while investing in areas that could jump-start growth. Let's start by discussing the first of these items: Medtronic's business makeover. In late 2022, Medtronic announced it would separate its patient monitoring and respiratory intervention business."", ""The company aims to improve top-line growth as it focuses on more promising areas of its operations. Now, turning to Medtronic's investments in exciting areas, one example is the company focusing more on artificial intelligence (AI) to improve its products. For example, Medtronic improved the accuracy of its insertable cardiac monitor (ICM, designed to track patients' cardiac rhythms), the LINQ II, thanks to an AI algorithm."", ""The ICM returned fewer false alerts. Progress like this benefits everyone involved -- patients, physicians, and Medtronic itself -- since it increases people's confidence in its products. Another exciting growth area for Medtronic is robotic-assisted surgery (RAS). The healthcare giant developed an RAS device called the Hugo, which is currently used in some countries outside the U.S."", 'While not cleared in the U.S. yet, it is in testing and could eventually cross the regulatory barrier. RAS machines allow physicians to perform minimally invasive surgeries, that is, those involving no significant cutting of the skin. Surgeons use tiny instruments they can manipulate with uncanny precision. These procedures typically come with benefits such as less bleeding, less scarring, faster recovery times, and shorter hospital stays.', 'Yet, as Medtronic reported last year, less than 5% of procedures that could be performed robotically currently are. Intuitive Surgical leads this market by a mile, and Johnson & Johnson is looking to join the party. However, considering how severely underpenetrated the field is, Medtronic should be able to carve out a niche for itself. The company has other key growth areas, such as diabetes care. Expect Medtronic to report more robust revenue growth within a few years.', ""Medtronic is known for being a great dividend stock, and with good reason. The company is inching closer to Dividend King status; it is currently on its 46th consecutive year of dividend increases. The healthcare leader has hiked its payouts by a compound annual growth rate of 16% since 1978 -- that's incredible. Medtronic's payout ratio is almost 89%, which is a little high. However, the company should be able to maintain its dividend streak regardless. It also offers a yield of 3.21%, which is more than twice the S&P 500's average of 1.47%."", ""Medtronic will appeal to some investors, while others will ignore the stock. Those looking for incredible growth at all costs won't be opting for Medtronic. Even if the company's plan to jump-start top-line growth comes to fruition -- which I believe it will -- there are much better stocks for that kind of investor."", 'However, for those looking for a steady, reliable, blue-chip dividend stock that can keep raising its payouts for a while and is unlikely to become irrelevant anytime soon, Medtronic is a great stock to buy and hold.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Medtronic right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Medtronic, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Medtronic wasn't one of them.

It really was an asset buy as I just said. JetBlue wanted the airplanes and the crews to use to expand. My take on it, it would have improved competition in America.

JetBlue is a mainline carrier that could have competed a whole lot better with those immediate 200 airplanes with United, Southwest, and Delta, and American."", ""- And Mike, I'll get you out of here on this.

Do you expect generally good results from those?"", ""MIKE BOYD: No. I mean, at least the going forward picture for Alaska, they're being pilloried by this. Almost one third of their fleet is now grounded not flying. That means about 30%, 35% of their seats aren't being sold. And JetBlue is having issues too. Look, we do have problems at the periphery.

Scott Kirby', ""Thank you, Kristina, and good morning to everyone on the call today. Despite the numerous geopolitical and other headwinds around the globe, 2023 really was a year that our plan for United Next came together. Our thesis at this time last year was that operational constraints and other factors were leading to cost converters, and those cost pressures in turn would lead to higher revenue. That is certainly true for United because our diversified revenue streams continued to differentiate us from other airlines. Another way of saying that is that we believe that a new link between United's CASM and RASM was being solidified. And while I'd be hard to get either a CASM or RASM forecast exactly correct, we could have higher confidence in forecasting the relationship between the 2, and therefore, we have higher confidence in our earnings and the margin forecast. And is by the year, build on the best that we could have never predicted. That's exactly what happened in 2023. And so I'd like to thank the 100,000 United team members around the world who worked so hard to make that. And those same 100,000 people continue to deliver in the face of huge impacts on our employees and customers from the MAX 9 aircraft. I'm proud of our tech ops team, who's taken the lead and has been working 18-hour days nonstop since January to ensure that the MAX 9 is 100% safe before we return it to service. I'd also like to thank the FAA for their professional leadership in this situation and also acknowledge that they too are also working long hours and weekends with us, in an effort to ensure that we know for sure what happens so that we'd be confident that the remediation prevents it from ever happening again. 2023 really sets the stage for what is likely to be a repeat in 2024. United financial performance was impressive, especially considered what analysts were expecting just 1 year ago. In 2023, we delivered full year earnings per share above $10, which was within the range of our initial United targets of $10 to $12. I want to spend some time today examining how we got there and why we think those trends will persist in 2024. One, we expect the operating environment to be challenging, driven by pilots and other hiring constraints, FAA, air traffic control set, maintenance catch-up and supply chain issues. It turned out to be even more challenging than we thought. Two, and those operating environment challenge led directly to industry capacity plans, including our own coming down 3 points on average as carriers adopted to the new operating environment. For United, we made changes to our schedule and we closed out the year setting operational records. The improvements in Newark, in particular, are one of the most important accomplishments that we achieved last year. Brett will share more detail in just a moment, but the FAA waivers rightsize the airport and aerospace, to physical constraints that allowed us to run an operation that is performing better than ever in Newark. That's been good for our business, and it's been really good for our customers. Three, but as we predict the challenging operating environment led to cost pressures and cost conversions in the industry, to be fair, even we at United underestimated, the inflationary pressures that we would face primarily from labor, maintenance and supply chain issues, and that led to higher absolute CASM-ex than we were forecasting. But those same cost pressures are being [bogged] across the entire industry. And a year ago, when we talked -- we believe the industry-wide cost pressures will wind up as a pass-through, much like fuel have been in the past, or, and that is, in fact, exactly what happened. While industry cost pressures drove higher CASM-ex at United, we offset those higher-than-expected costs with higher-than-expected revenues. Five, which leads to the final point. while difficult to predict events like the fuel price spike, rising conflicts in the Middle East, fires in Mali, persisting inflationary pressure. So many other things that make it difficult to predict United's full year 2023 CASM in rather than 12 months in advance. The timing connection at United between CASM and RASM meant that we achieved our initial $10 to $12 EPS range despite those multiple headwinds around the globe. The link between RASM and CASM combined with the success of United Next, what made 2023 such a successful and important year in our history, and we expect 2024 to follow a similar path for the same reasons. This is just the new normal. The operational challenges remain. It will be years before the FAA is back to full staffing. We're still overlapping new labor agreements, which shows in our CASM and the supply chain challenges aren't going away anytime soon. That means capacity will continue to ratchet down out of necessities and cost convergence will continue. But revenues will adjust to the new cost reality, and you can expect United to maintain and grow EPS and margins. 2.5 years ago, we laid out our United Next growth strategy. In 2023, we demonstrated that the plan is working almost exactly as we expected in the future is bright. There have been and there will be more bumps in the road. But we continue to feel confident about our ability to grow earnings and margin over the long term because of the tighter connection between United's cost and United's revenue. Looking ahead to 2024, the United Next plan is working and no airline is better positioned to capitalize on industry and macroeconomic trends than United, and we're continuing to move aggressively to capitalize on emerging opportunities. We'll have more to share with you at our Investor Day later this spring. In the meantime, we're focused on delivering another great year for our employees and customers and our shareholders. And with that, I'll hand it over to Brett."", 'Brett J. Hart', ""Thank you, Scott, and good morning. As of Saturday, January 6, Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft has been grounded. We are currently the largest operator of the Boeing (inaudible) fleet type aircraft representing approximately 8% of our capacity in the first quarter. Our financial guidance assumes that United 79 MAX 9 aircraft is grounded since the start of January. I echo Scott's gratitude for all United who worked so hard (inaudible) travel plans were affected by the grounding of our MAX 9 fleet. I'm also extremely proud of our Tech Ops team, who we're working carefully to ensure the safety of our MAX 9 aircraft before we start flying them again. 2023 was a year of growth and restoration. And we closed out the year with strong record-breaking operational results, carrying a record 171 million customers.The fourth quarter consolidated customer D0, A0 and misconnect rate were the best for any quarter in our history. Not only did we set company records for the quarter, but we also (inaudible) record-setting operations during our busiest time of the year over Thanksgiving and Christmas. Thanksgiving and the entire fourth quarter had the highest NPS scores in our post-pandemic history. We wrapped up the year with our lowest ever cancel rate for the month of December. One of the largest challenges United and all airlines flying to and from New York have historically faced more flights than air traffics -- than the air traffic system can handle is now being addressed, thanks to proactive intervention by the FAA. Newark, United's largest hub has been operating with the best reliability on record since the FAA mandated that flight activity to be consistent with the aerospace and runway limitations of no more 77 operations per hour this fall. For United, that meant we reduced flight activity from Newark by about 10%. Expect to continue with those cuts for the remainder of 2024. Our customers and every passenger flying from New York are now benefiting and the cascade of delays that historically would flow across the United States from New York airspace has significantly improved. Our customer D0 from Newark the company record 76% in Q4 of 2023. We expect this level of performance to continue as long as the FAA continues to mandate the flat operations remain at 77 or fewer operations per hour going forward. United plans to continue to upgauge our Newark flying to ensure that there is plenty of capacity available for our customers even with fewer flights. 2023 was also a banner year for employee recruiting, hiring and retention at United. On the heels of hiring more than 21,000 people in 2022, we hired another 16,000 aviation professionals to our airline last year. We hire the best of the best. The skill and talent of our employees played a big role in our operational performance -- outperformance in the second half of the year. Our record-breaking customer scores during the holidays and our overall financial performance as an airline in 2023. We are a better, more successful airline because of our people. And I'm proud of the way we've gone about growing our team. I'm happy to announce we will be paying our eligible employees, $81 million in profit sharing next month. This is 5x higher than 2022, and over 2x higher than the average of the last 10 years. Our team will be the part of this airline profit sharing. I'll be sharing these impressive results today without them. With that, I will pass it over to Andrew."", 'Andrew P. Nocella', ""Thanks, Brett. As Scott mentioned, comp pressures led to healthy revenue trends in the quarter with stellar performance over the holidays. Total revenues in the fourth quarter increased 9.9% on a 14.7% increase in capacity. Consolidated TRASM was down 4.2% and PRASM was down 3.3% for the quarter. Domestic demand was strong in the quarter and PRASM results were slightly negative year-over-year, a nice improvement from the third quarter. Atlantic PRASM growth in Q4 of positive 3.8% was consistent with Q3 year-over-year growth of 4%. We also experienced a small but measurable demand weakness period across for Europe in Q4 triggered by the conflict of Israel, but that has now moderated. United increased Asia Pacific flying by 82% in the quarter. PRASM was down 11.6% year-over-year. In the quarter, we increased flying to China from 4 weekly flights to twice daily. Amongst many other changes we've now fully restored our capacity to pre-voted levels across the Pacific. Latin American unit revenues decreased by 11.6% in the quarter, pressured by record industry capacity levels and heavy fare discounting. Cargo revenues continue to adjust to their new city state post-pandemic state. For 2023, cargo revenues were $1.5 billion, 31% lower than 2022. Amongst all the revenue changes due to yields, not volumes. (technical difficulty) Turning to our outlook for the first quarter. We expect TRASM in Q1 to be approximately flat year-over-year, which is a nice sequential improvement versus the past few quarters. Domestic demand remains strong with increases in business traffic volumes year-over-year in addition to stronger pricing thus far this year, and we expect domestic year-over-year PRASM to be positive for the quarter. We see the best yield growth occurring on tickets purchased within a week of departure. Bookings and yields for Atlantic fly in early 2024 are also strong and we expect these trends to continue into the second and third quarters. Service to Tel Aviv will resume as soon as it's safe for our customers and crew but no sooner than February 15. We also saw a nice step-up in London Heathrow business demand in recent weeks, which has helped in Atlantic results in Q1 to date when combined with lower United capacity to London. We remain focused on slow growth across the Atlantic for 2024. Asia Pacific growth remains above normal as we head into Q1, we continue to absorb the incremental Asia Pacific capacity added in 2023. We expect all of United's new Asia capacity to produce strong margin results as we head into Q2 and Q3. Latin American RASM is expected to remain negative for Q1 year-over-year, a trend that's likely to continue into Q2. FAA imposed industry capacity limitations on New York for virtually all of 2024 and San Francisco for most of 2024 will limit capacity from either airport. We've prioritized international growth over domestic at both hubs. We're optimistic that the demand will catch up with supply in 2024 in these 2 United hubs that have lagged the recovery elsewhere. In summary, we expect strong unit revenue performance on domestic and Atlantic capacity in early 2024, with weaker results in Asia as we absorb 2023 growth and in Latin America due to record industry capacity growth levels. While we expect international RASMs will grow slower than domestic for a period, we also expect that international flying will have materially higher margins for United versus domestic in 2024, just less of a gap than in 2023. We, at United, have I think, created a really very durable commercial model that has diversified our revenue streams and our network and largely decommoditized our product versus just about every other airline in the U.S. maybe for the exception of one. Our commercial strategy has resulted in fair levels at United just in -- not only for changes in price of fuel, but also for the cost inputs at United allowing us to overcome the inflationary cost pressures larger than we expected in 2023. You can see this in our relative revenue performance quarter-to-quarter. United unique hub system in the largest U.S. cities and the network we have built over decades from these hubs underpins our outlook and gives United access to revenues and profitable flying others simply do not have or have not been able to replicate. The United Next fleet growth in recent years has allowed us to unlock the true value in our hub system, which you can see from our results today. Unique aircraft cabin and capacity plans continue to be a driver of our strong revenue performance, particularly as demand for premium products remains elevated. For example, domestic premium revenue grew 13% year-over-year in Q4, over double the rate of coach, another data point validating our strategy. While we remain focused on monetizing our growing premium capacity, we also remain committed to Basic Economy. Domestic Basic Economy revenue was up nearly 20% in the fourth quarter versus last year. Correcting a gauge deficits at United remains a key component of the future. We continue to believe we can add gauge to domestic flying while maintaining strong unit revenues. Since 2019, United has increased its North American gauge by 22%, while also leading in PRASM growth. For 2024, we intend to focus much of our domestic growth in our mid-con hubs in Washington, Dallas, as we had significant levels of new connectivity. This connectivity change is why we have confidence in the RASM being accretive in 2024. Diversified revenue streams across our global network remain key to our relative success as we implement our United Next plans. United's global network is a key structural advantage we will focus on in the coming years, and it differentiates us. With that, I wanted to say thanks to the entire United team and hand it over to Mike to discuss our financial results. Mike?"", 'Michael D. Leskinen', ""Thanks, Andrew, and thank you to the whole United team for closing up the year on a high note, both operationally and financially.I'm proud to report that in 2023, we delivered pretax income of $4.3 billion, a more than $3.2 billion improvement over 2022. We delivered earnings per share of $10.05 within our initial guidance range of $10 to $12, and well ahead of consensus expectations of about $6 at the beginning of the year. We achieved this despite significant industry headwinds and operational constraints that led to lower capacity.For the fourth quarter, we delivered pretax income of $845 million and earnings per share of $2, ahead of consensus and above the high end of our guidance range. Strong operational performance, robust revenue trends and a decrease in fuel prices supported these results.Fourth quarter CASM-ex was up 4.9% as we did not operate flight to Tel Aviv for the full quarter. Additionally, effective with the fourth quarter, we are now classifying certain commissions that has been classified as contra-revenue and distribution expense. This has no impact on net income or cash flow. This change added 1 point to our year-on-year fourth quarter CASM-ex and increased fourth quarter year-on-year unit revenue by 0.6 points. The change will also result in an approximate 1 point headwind to year-on-year CASM-ex in an approximate 0.6 point increase in RASM through the end of the third quarter of this year.Underlying unit costs trended favorably during the quarter as the completion factor came in better than planned due to our strong operational performance. Compared to 2019, our relative performance on CASM-ex was near the top of the industry. As Scott outlined, delivering strong relative cost performance remains critical to the successful execution of United Next.We have always ascertained the costs that are borne by the entire industry are passed along in prices with a lag. Historically, this relationship has been clear with jet fuel prices. More recently, the relationship has been clear for both higher labor and higher maintenance costs as well.Notably, our unit cost in 2023 were up 17.8% versus 2019 compared to ultra low-cost carriers unit costs that are expected to be up 25% on average. That more than 7-point cost convergence and costs occurred simultaneous with an emerging preference for United product. The top-tier operational reliability that United provides. The result is unsurprising. Our margins have dramatically and structurally improved, and we're only in the early innings of that journey. For the first quarter of 2024, we expect a loss per share between negative $0.35 and negative $0.85. While our core costs remain on track, our first quarter CASM-ex faces a few headwinds.First, the cancellations of the MAX 9 flights have reduced first quarter capacity. Due to the close in nature of these canceled assets, most of our expenses are fixed. And we also incurred additional interrupted trip expenses. We expect the combination of these items will increase CASM-ex by approximately 3 points.Second, as we mentioned that the contra-revenue reclassification in the distribution expense is the 1 point headwind.Third, the impact of new labor agreements as they annualize as an additional 3 to 4 points.And fourth, a higher volume of [engine] events and continued supply chain challenges lead to another 1 point of CASM-ex headwind.While the first 2 items I mentioned are United-specific headwinds, labor and maintenance are an industry-wide issue, and the primary drivers of the cost conversions that Scott described earlier. Most importantly, we're confident that the pace of inflation in our costs will continue to be favorable versus our historically lower cost competitors.Building off of our 2023 momentum, we expect full year 2024 earnings per share to be between $9 to $11. We are encouraged by the trends we are seeing and our United Next plan is working well. This is our guidance, but I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that our internal targets are higher. We plan to update our longer-term financial targets at our upcoming Investor Day.Looking ahead, we intend to take a different approach to guidance. As demonstrated in 2023 and just recently with the MAX grounding, we operate in a dynamic industry. With the no excuses philosophy, we intended to take United off the detailed quarterly metrics shortly after I joined and led the Investor Relations team. The pandemic interrupted those plans, but now that we're past the crisis, and as we deliver on our earnings per share target, you should expect us to remove TRASM, CASM-ex and capacity guidance and focus on earnings per share.We've provided RASM and TRASM for the first quarter, but this is likely the last time we will do so for our quarter. We will continue to provide fulsome commentary on the trends impacting our business. and we will continue to be transparent with our views of the longer-term future for both United and the industry that we're managing this business towards. We will earn your confidence by delivering bottom line results.Shifting gears to the fleet. In the fourth quarter, we took delivery of 20 Boeing MAX and 4 Airbus A321 aircraft. Looking ahead to 2024, we have a total of 107 aircraft scheduled to deliver, 31 of those being maximized. It is unrealistic at this time to believe all of those aircraft will deliver as currently planned.We also have 277 MAX 10 aircraft on order through the remainder of the decade and an additional 200 auctions for MAX 10 aircraft. We are monitoring Boeing's progress towards certification and acting closely. At this time, our current aircraft delivery schedule would lead to a total CapEx of approximately $9 billion in 2024. But given the MAX 9 grounding and the continued supply chain issues, there is a downward bias to our 2024 spend. We also expect a reduction in orders and deliveries from Boeing in 2025. This will require reworking of our fleet plan, and we will share the details when that work is complete.Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $16.1 billion in liquidity, including our undrawn revolver. Our adjusted net debt to EBITDAR was 2.9x, consistent with our leverage target of less than 3x provided at the start of the year. Managing the business towards positive free cash flow will be a top priority for our team over the coming years. Our stock is deeply undervalued, trading at less than 4x earnings despite the fact that we delivered 19.5% revenue growth and realized significant structural improvement in relative profitability in 2023.But we also understand the generating free cash flow consistently even while we execute our United Next strategy is an important component to increasing our valuation. 2023 marked the first full year of United Next plan. We are throwing some curve balls, but we adapted quickly and exited the year stronger than ever. It's clear that when customers are given a choice, they are choosing United. You can see it clearly in our revenue and margin performance relative to the industry.Finally, I'm happy to announce we will be hosting an Investor Day on May 1st in Chicago. We plan to provide an update on our progress with the United Next plan and introduce some of the United tailwinds that will drive continued margin expansion and sustainable free cash flow. I'm encouraged by our results in a relative momentum, and I'm looking forward to delivering another solid year for our employees, customers and shareholders.With that, I will pass it over to Kristina to start the Q&A."", 'Kristina Munoz Edwards', 'Thanks, Mike. We will now take questions from the analyst community. (Operator Instructions)', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) We will go to the first caller in queue. Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley.', 'Ravi Shanker', ""So maybe Scott, you said at the start that you saw pressure on your 2023 capacity and I think you kind of went through your order book and said there's downward pressure there expected as well. Does this want to make you look at the long-term United Next growth plans and kind of what can be practically achieved in the coming years? Is that something you can expect during the Investor Day?"", 'Michael D. Leskinen', ""Robbie, this is Mike. Look, the reality is that with the with the MAX grounding, this is the kind of straw that broke the camels back, with believing that the MAX 10 will deliver on the schedule we had hoped for. And so we're working through an alternate plan. We do expect our growth rate to slow in coming years.The United Next plan is firmly on track. It will take a little longer to get there. And we're working on alternate plans to see how much higher we can elevate the growth with the MAX 10 app. Now we're still counting on Boeing, and we're monitoring the MAX 10 closely, and we're rooting and we'll do everything we can to help that aircraft get certified. It's a great aircraft. But we can't count on it, and so we're working on alternate plans. The details we'll share when we have them. I hope we'll have more by the first quarter conference call, and we'll certainly have a fulsome update for you by our May 1 Investor Day."", 'Ravi Shanker', ""Very helpful. And maybe as a quick follow-up. I think you guys have said Asia can be pretty decent kind of as it comes back. I think you guys were profitable on the China routes prior to the pandemic. Correct me if I'm wrong. Do you think Asia margins can be better than before? And is that a temporary demand catch up? Or do you think that's sustainable kind of in the new normal?"", 'Andrew P. Nocella', ""It's Andrew. As we rebuilt Asia, we definitely wanted to rebuild it. So it has sustainably higher margins than it did pre-pandemic. And we've gone about that, I think, very carefully. We're back to our pre-pandemic size, which is nice at this point. And China was profitable for us pre-pandemic, although it was not our highest margin climb to be fair.As we bring it all back, our goal is to make sure that the Asia Pacific entity produces margins that are similar to that across the rest of our global network. And I think that at least in 2023, Asia Pacific is well ahead. I do expect things to move around a bit, particularly as more China flights come back online. But I think we're particularly bullish about what Asia looks like going forward. We added a lot of capacity in the quarter, we are absorbing it, and we expect in Q2 and Q3, that capacity is going to do very well. So very bullish about the long-term prospects in Asia post-pandemic."", 'Operator', 'Jamie Baker from JPMorgan Stanley.', 'Jamie Nathaniel Baker', ""Fair enough. Good morning, everybody. First one for Andrew. So you said the 20% revenue increase for Basic Economy. What can you tell us about the composition of that growth is -- with some percentage MileagePlus members trading down? Is some percentage stimulation of brand-new demand from scratch? Is some percentage share shift from LMAs. I guess the simpler question is who's driving the growth?"", 'Andrew P. Nocella', ""I think it's largely a share shift, Jamie. We developed Basic Economy numerous years ago now and have been refining how we sell it, how we distribute it and that product. And it's an important product in our lineup. We do focus a lot on premium, but we know we need to be competitive across the whole range of needs that are customers have in our hubs and that required a competitive Basic Economy product that we could do profitably.And as we look at the data, we think the biggest change here is as we've increased our gauge, we've been able to attract more and more market share across the board. But in particular, we've been able to attract more of it from some of the low-cost carriers out there. So we're really pleased with this development, and it's given us every indication that we should continue to push forward as our gauge increases, we'll be able to more effectively take on that traffic and grow our share base even more."", 'Jamie Nathaniel Baker', ""Okay. And then for Mike, it was a couple of years ago, in fact, it might have been, like, almost 2 years to the day that there were press reports that you are -- United was looking at monetizing a portion of MileagePlus. And then things subsequently went pretty quiet on that front. So a couple of questions. First is, is loyalty as important to United as it is to Delta? Delta's leading so hard into this topic on its calls. And second, any thoughts on how United or the broader industry might get investors to value this cash flow at a higher multiple? And if the answer is no, I'm happy to see the floor."", 'Michael D. Leskinen', ""Jamie, thank you. I appreciate the question. This is something I'm very passionate about. MileagePlus is a crown jewel in the businesses we have here at United Airlines. We've made some significant progress towards growing that business. We have a new leader in Richard Nunn.We have significant projects underway around data and how we can create a better customer experience and monetize that data, simultaneous. And you can expect a very fulsome update on the May 1 Investor Day. We do have ideas on how to bring the market attention up to the value and the higher premium multiple that those earnings should trade at. And we have several options, and we'll share more when we're ready to share more. But we've discussed some of those, some of those have been written about the analyst reports. And if the value is not recognized in our carriers, we will take actions to highlight that value in the future -- in the near future."", 'Operator', 'Michael Linenberg from Deutsche Bank.', 'Michael John Linenberg', ""Can you guys hear me now? Great. Just getting back to, I guess, Scott, on the issue with the MAX 10, at least, fortunately, in the case of United, you do have a choice. You're a very large operator of the Airbus product as well as the Boeing narrow-body product.As we think about the issues with supply chain and constraints across the OEM space, is there at some point where you're thinking that it's -- given the size of United that it would be prudent to consider a wide-body from another OEM. Right now, it looks like the 787 is the future for United from a wide-body perspective, but you still have that A350 order out there. Has your thinking on that changed?"", 'Michael D. Leskinen', ""Mike, thanks for the question. The A350 is an incredible aircraft. We have a significant order book for 787s right now, and we have a mix of 777 aircraft, some are relatively older and a subfleet is quite young. As we look into the 2030's, the A350 is an aircraft that we are looking at. We don't have any new news to share with you today, but the timing will be that early part of the next decade."", 'Michael John Linenberg', ""Great. And then just a quick follow-up back to what Jamie brought up on Basic Economy, the 20% increase is obviously pretty significant. But last quarter, you were up 50%. And the question is, is that just a function of a more difficult comp? Or did you actively pull back on inventory of Basic Economy just given the surge that we've seen on the cost side? And back to your point about sort of trying to maintain that gap between CASM and RASM?"", 'Andrew P. Nocella', ""It's Andrew. No, we didn't pull back on it for that reason. And remember, these are year-over-year comps, but you have to consider the math of what we did last year. We're very bullish about Basic. We're also very bullish about the premium. And the point is, we have a really great diversified revenue stream across all of our cabins as we try to decommoditize our product. We are really hopeful that we'll continue to drive increasing volumes in basic it seems to be having the appropriate P&L effect at United and competitive effect across the industry. So it's something we want to do more of, not less of. And so you should expect that."", 'Operator', 'Conor Cunningham from Melius Research.', 'Conor T. Cunningham', ""I'm a little confused on the comment between -- on the link between CASM and RASM. I would have thought that would have been the case before. So I'm just trying to understand what's changed. Is it that you're being -- like just better at predicting outcomes? Or is it really more of an industry comment that you're trying to drive from here?"", 'J. Scott Kirby', ""It's really an industry comment. In the past, if United had -- if any airline, including United, had CASM going up, while others had CASM going down, the price is the lowest common denominator. So it's an industry comment. As industry -- just like fuel. Anything that affects the whole industry is a pass-through. If it affects one airline, it's not, but if it affects all airlines, it's a pass through, that was -- we were sitting in this room a year ago, and maybe we didn't do it articulately, but that was the point we were trying to make, and that is exactly what happened. And it is what's going to happen going forward."", 'Conor T. Cunningham', ""Okay. I appreciate that. And then it was a little unclear in the prepared remarks. I'm just trying -- does your outlook for costs include accruals for open labor contracts? And just what are the risks that you see for the cost plan in 2024?"", 'Michael D. Leskinen', 'Conor, this is Mike. We include our expectations for all labor agreements in our pace.', 'Operator', ""Catherine O'Brien from Goldman Sachs."", ""Catherine Maureen O'Brien"", ""Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for the time. I might stick with the cost side, just following on Conor's quickly here. Versus your low single-digit ex-MAX impact CASM-ex guide for the first quarter. How do we think about the puts and takes through year-end versus that level of CASM-ex inflation?Before today, I was originally assuming growth would decelerate over course of the year, but CASM-ex comp fees, each quarter in my model ended up looking pretty similar on a year-over-year basis, ex-MAX impacting the 1Q. Is that a fair way to think about it? Or is there more lumpiness than that, that I'm missing? And then I guess, just to put a finer point on one question, does 1Q and full year EPS include any flight attendant accrual?"", 'Michael D. Leskinen', ""So Catie, let me take the last question first. We include our expectations for labor agreements in our guidance. Full stop.Regarding CASM trends in Q2 and 3 and 4, you would expect the MAX headwind to go away. We do think we're getting closer to seeing that aircraft fly. Again, you would see some United-specific tailwinds with some gauge increase, although with slowing deliveries, that gauge increase in '24 will be less than we would have expected. You will see continued pressure from labor of about 3 to 4 points. That's an industry headwind for CASM-ex, not unique to United. We expect it will lead to higher TRASM to offset, but you should continue to see that we will lap the majority of that as we enter into the fourth quarter.And then maintenance headwind of about 1 point, that's going to be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. As I sit here today, I think it's about 1 point in each of the quarters. this year. At some point, the supply chain will fix itself in aerospace, but we don't see that today. And I think it probably takes well beyond 2024. So you should think about -- to summarize, you should think about the labor and maintenance headwinds as being persistent."", ""Catherine Maureen O'Brien"", ""Got it. Very clear. And maybe just sticking with you, Mike, the $9 million CapEx figure that's tied to your contractual commitments, unless I've got that wrong. Even as of your last 10-Q before the MAX grounding, you were expecting 17% less aircraft than the contractual amount. I guess there's probably more downside reset today, given what's going on with the MAX, but in order of magnitude, does that delta between expected and contractual deliveries largely flipped how we should think about downside risk on a dollar basis versus that $9 billion?"", 'Andrew P. Nocella', ""That delta between contractual and expected is growing. And we don't know exactly where it's settled yet. That's what we're working through now. and we are working on an alternate strategy to mitigate some of the loss in growth. But yes, as you're thinking about CapEx coming below $9 billion this year, and the trajectory for maybe lower than what you would expect CapEx in '25 and beyond. That's how you should think about it."", 'Operator', 'Scott Group from Wolfe Research.', 'Scott H. Group', ""So Mike, I totally get your message that the plan is fluid and flexible. But as it stands today, I'm just wondering, do you think RASM is going to be positive this year? And then maybe just -- can you help us just think about shaping the year a little bit. So if I look at last year, had a pretty massive second quarter and then moderation in the second half of the year. Are you thinking a similar shape or maybe more back half weighted? Any color there would be helpful."", 'Michael D. Leskinen', ""Scott, I'll kick it off and say, yes, we think TRASM for the year will be positive, but the details will come from Andrew."", 'Andrew P. Nocella', ""Well, we're not giving exact guidance here other than, yes, we're very bullish on the year. I think I laid out a business case where domestic is starting the year incredibly strong. I think we've laid out a business case for where we're going to do with trans-Atlantic capacity. And I do expect Asia capacity to step down materially as we head into Q2 and then Q3, which is obviously going to bolster those numbers, too. So I remain bullish on the year."", 'Scott H. Group', ""Mike, I don't know if you had any thoughts on shaping the year for us, if you have any color. And then maybe just my other follow-up just for Andrew. Just on the point about domestic and international margins converging a little bit this year. Maybe just -- I just want to make sure I'm understanding it. Is this domestic getting better in international a little less good? Or is it they're both improving, but domestic is improving more? Just any additional color there would be great."", 'Andrew P. Nocella', ""Look, I think we're seeing -- I hate to say the word exceptional, but we're seeing really good strength in domestic right now, and I expect that's going to narrow the gap. International margins are well ahead of domestic margins in 2023, and they'll continue to be well ahead of domestic margins in 2024. But I do think that gap will narrow a bit based on the RASM outlook that I'm looking at, again, which is pretty darn good for domestic.Yes. Maybe I'll take the seasonal shape in as well. We're working very diligently to make Q1 a more profitable quarter for United. I think we are well on our way prior to the MAX grounding. And obviously, if you take that out, you can use that to update the estimates as to where we would have been in Q1, we made a lot of changes to how we fly in Q1, and we didn't talk about all those details. But when I look at our RASM trends, particularly in domestic, I am now confident that all those changes had the desired effect.As we continue to build and make sure that in the future, Q1 can -- well, it won't ever be our best quarter to be blunt, that it will be a much better relative quarter. But our global network, I have to say in Q2 and Q3 really stands out, and we expect it to be stellar again over those 6 months in 2024."", 'Michael D. Leskinen', ""Scott, just specifically asking about the shape of our quarterly earnings through the year. It's going to look like a normal seasonal pattern, albeit with a slightly bigger loss in the first quarter due to MAX 9 grounding."", 'Operator', 'Helane Becker of Cowen.', 'Helane Renee Becker', ""Great. So here's my 2 questions. The first question is, as you think about 2026 margins, and maybe you'll update us on May 1, how do we bridge from the roughly 8% at year-end '23 to, say, 12% to 14% in 2026?"", 'Michael D. Leskinen', ""Helane, thanks for the question. And we will update our longer-term margin targets at Investor Day. But the tailwinds that we expect from the United Next strategy, from the gauge, from the connectivity, from preference to fly United, we have proven, it used to be -- it was a strategy on a piece of paper. We have proven that it's working.And so as we think about '24, deliveries being a little less than '25 and '26, of reaccelerating into that United Next strategy, we see just continued momentum. And so as for the specific level of 12% to 14% pacing, we're going to have to update you on May 1st. But the strategy is working, and we're very confident in an upward trajectory to both earnings and margin."", 'Helane Renee Becker', ""Okay. And then just for my follow-up. Your -- I think, United Next targets, and obviously, you'll update them again, I suppose, $25 billion of adjusted net debt as of the end of last year, less than $18 billion for 2026. But the other thing is, how should we think about financing, let's just say, $9 billion is off the table for this year. Let's bring it down to $6 billion or $7 billion plus debt paydown. Like, how should we think about you getting to your target leverage over the next 1 to 3 years given the CapEx program, which might be $7 billion this year, but it might be $9 billion or $8 billion or $10 billion, '25 or '26."", 'Michael D. Leskinen', 'Yes. Let me try to give you a high-level view, Helane, and we can dig into more details in the future. But as I sit here today and I think about the changes in CapEx related to the delay in deliveries, I expect free cash to cover our CapEx in most years, if not all years.And as far as additional paydown of the balance sheet, we would expect that as our margins grow into that low double-digit low-teen area that free cash flow will be quite positive, allowing us to pay down that debt. Now the pacing will be dependent on how much that CapEx profile changes and how quickly we get to what we think is that on long run, higher level of margin.', 'Operator', 'Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore.', 'Duane Thomas Pfennigwerth', 'Just a couple for me. On international inbound, so basically international point available to the U.S. As you look across your network, how recovered is international inbound? How do you think about that growth of that demand set in 2024? And are there any markets that stick out from a recovery had room potential?', 'Andrew P. Nocella', ""Sure, Duane, it's Andrew. What I would say is during the entire recovery, U.S. outbound has been a stronger component of the traffic, really across the board, across the entire globe, and that continues today I think origin Europe, particularly core Europe, Germany continues to trail as well as Japan and Australia. And so we'll continue to monitor that. But the U.S. consumer has made up the difference in most regions of the world quite effectively and has resulted in very strong results over the last year.So I think the outlook is strong. But when the inbound customer profile starts to rebound, I think that's just further upside in the future. It hasn't happened consistently across the globe, but we'll see what 2024 brings."", 'Duane Thomas Pfennigwerth', 'Okay. Just following up there. Any specific markets, maybe San Francisco, Asia inbound. Any more kind of bullish recovery thoughts there?', 'Andrew P. Nocella', ""San Francisco is going to be very unique over the next 6 to 9 months. There is a significant amount of runway construction going on in San Francisco that has dramatically limited our ability to fly there. It's also consistent with a slower recovery in that city. So I think that is actually probably okay. But you will see us fly a much reduced domestic schedule in San Francisco, the international flying continues to be very strong. But the smaller domestic schedule, combined with where we are in the recovery, I think it's going to be just fine for San Francisco. In terms of profit contribution, in San Francisco, Asia continues to perform exceedingly well."", 'Operator', 'That will be Andrew Didora from Bank of America.', 'Andrew George Didora', ""So Andrew, I guess you mentioned this a little bit in your prepared remarks, but we've been hearing and seeing some data on corporate travel getting a bit better as well. Can -- could you maybe dig in and speak to maybe any particular markets or verticals where you see any sort of outsized corporate growth? And have you seen this corporate growth sort of broadening out to make it maybe at a more sustainable level today than at other points in the recovery?"", 'Andrew P. Nocella', 'Sure. We\'ve all sat on calls and predicted the recovery of business graphic more times than I can count over the last few years. And I will say, Q4 was okay. It wasn\'t spectacular in any way. But as we started January in the new budget season for all of our big corporate clients, we did notice a significant step-up.So it\'s really early. It\'s only been a few weeks, and I hesitate to say, ""Oh my gosh, it\'s fixed."" Because it\'s still well behind where it should be relative to GDP growth, of course, but look, it\'s a really nice step up. We\'re seeing close in yield gains as well that result from that. And I think that\'s one of the reasons our domestic RASM outlook is as strong as it is. And so hopefully, that continues. At the end of the quarter, of course, we\'ll report on that and let you know how it looks. But at least for the first 2 weeks of January, we\'ve gotten off to a really strong start, and it gives us increasing signs that this is going to be, I think, a very good year.', 'Andrew George Didora', ""Got it. That's helpful. And then for my second question, Mike, you have obviously a lot of talk on the call just on your real future free cash flow potential. Just when you're looking at your free cash flow, when do you anticipate you will become a cash taxpayer?"", 'Michael D. Leskinen', ""Andrew, I think it's a few years off still, let me get with my treasurer, Pam Hendry, and follow up with you all on the precise year. It does depend on -- are -- it does depend on how CapEx moderates, and it depends on that profitability, but it's still a few years off."", 'Operator', 'Brandon Oglenski from Barclays.', 'Brandon Robert Oglenski', ""Just keep it to one here at the end of the call. But maybe Scott or Mike, I mean coming back to the context that your stock is trading like 3 or 4x P/E probably for the second year here, and also giving you guys credit because I know a lot of us didn't think you could hit those United Next targets so many years out. But you are guiding to roughly flat margins at the midpoint this year. And I think what investors are worried about is things you can control or at least perceived control like costs that are going up for the industry here.Is this just a continued view that United is going to decouple from industry trends where you're going to be able to drive margin premium? And I guess what can you give investors confidence that, that is the path forward here?"", 'Michael D. Leskinen', ""Thanks, Brandon. Look, I think that it's a structural change in the industry, and we see a ton of evidence in this year, and I think eventually, the investment community, we'll see it as well. But there is -- an industry that has operated as a commodity industry and United and one of our legacy peers have clearly differentiated ourselves from the path. And that's leading customers to choose to fly our airlines, it's leading to the majority, if not all, of the revenue growth in the industry accruing to those 2 airlines, and that is happening simultaneous with cost convergence.That cost convergence, the whole reason that the low-cost carriers existed was for -- is because they had lower costs. Those lower costs no longer exist. And so that creates, I think, a permanence to the higher margin, a sustainability to that higher margin. And where that settles, we still -- (inaudible) exactly where that us. But it is higher and more stable and more resilient and that is not recognized by the capital markets today."", 'Operator', 'David Bernstein from -- David Vernon from Bernstein.', 'David Scott Vernon', ""So Andrew, I'd like to get some help from you if you can, in terms of helping to think through how some of the negative margin capacity that's going to be forced out of the industry is going to impact your fare ladder. Beyond the upward pressure sort of general maintenance, I'm just trying to like understand if we see a bunch of basic capacity rationalized because some of these negative margin unbundled carriers have to take capacity out.Is that -- how is that going to impact sort of basic fares versus economy fares, anything you could give us to help translate that impact of capacity shift into what sort of impact it's going to have on your fare ladder would be really helpful."", 'Andrew P. Nocella', ""I mean I think that's probably a lot more detail than I can do on a conference call, to be honest. But just generally, unproductive capacity has been leaving the system. I think that's been good for the system and good for United. And so we'll manage our RM like we normally do to take advantage of all of the opportunities.But I just want to reiterate that our choice to diversify our revenues at the top of Polaris and at the bottom of Basic Economy is not something we're going to be giving up on. The Basic Economy is an important part of the airline. It is what our customers want. We will continue to provide choice. And we expect to provide more and more of it as our gauge increases. The competitive dynamics are what they are, I can't predict them. I only really can talk for United, and we'll obviously maximize our returns and do the right thing.But again, the diversified revenue streams that we're putting out there are really working for us across not only the fare ladder but our geographic dispersion of our flying. And so we couldn't be more pleased with our revenue results quarter after quarter, by the way, not just in Q4 and not just last year, and the outlook we have. If the industry is dynamic, it's always changing, we'll change with it. But it is, I think, a good time to be at United Airlines and be an investor in United Airlines."", 'David Scott Vernon', ""And are you seeing any sort of benefit yet from some of that capacity rationalization as you look forward into to forward bookings?

Do you see them going down or up, just given all that?"", 'Andrew P. Nocella', ""David, what I would tell you is that we're prepared for an incredibly strong summer. We -- as I've said numerous times, we decided to go slow this year. We've tilted more of our capacity, particularly in Q1 to Southern Europe. And that's probably what I would say the biggest change is -- what we see with the consumer is that destinations in Spain and Italy have become more year-round destinations than seasonal. And that is new post-pandemic and we're reacting to it and moving more and more capacity out of Northern Europe, out of London Heathrow or Germany and into Southern Europe, and we'll probably do more of that again next year.In terms of the price points, I'm not going to exactly predict that at this point. We don't really talk about pricing. But I would just say, we expect a really strong summer across the Atlantic. Our capacity is not growing materially.

Also noteworthy is that these diagnostics, or multi-cancer early detection tests (MCEDs), can save hospitals and health insurers a great deal of money.', 'Given these points, I believe that the MCEDs will eventually be very profitable, once they become accepted by society and are deployed by healthcare professionals. Indeed, according to one estimate, liquid biopsies will generate $29.8 billion of annual revenue by 2035. Here are three of the best disease testing stocks.', 'Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock', 'In June, Baylor Scott & White, a massive hospital chain, agreed to administer about 50,000 of Exact Science’s (NASDAQ:EXAS) MCED tests to its patients. I believe that Baylor is administering these tests in an effort to determine if they can save it money.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'For example, if Baylor administers the test to an uninsured patient who regularly uses its ER for routine care, and the test shows that the patient is in the early stages of pancreatic cancer, Baylor can treat that patient much cheaper than if they arrive at the ER with late-stage pancreatic cancer. Moreover, Baylor can charge its wealthier patients a high price to obtain the test.', 'I believe that, later this year, Baylor will announce that the test has been a tremendous success. And order a large number of them from Exact Sciences, sparking a huge rally by EXAS stock. Moreover, I predict that that many other hospitals will ultimately follow Baylor’s lead, propelling Exact’s shares even higher and making it one of the best disease testing stocks to buy.', 'Source: shutterstock.com/JHVEPhoto', 'Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) owns GRAIL which has its own MCED test. However, due to regulatory issues, Illumina is being forced to either sell or divest GRAIL. ILMN stock has tumbled nearly 75% from its all-time highs, largely due to uncertainty over GRAIL’s fate, and the losses that GRAIL generated as a result of its high legal and R&D costs.', 'But if Illumina sells GRAIL, it expects to obtain $7 billion to $10 billion in the deal, while its current market capitalization is only $21.9 billion. Moreover, the transaction is expected to cause its operating margin to rise to 25% from its current 22.5% level. As a result, a sale of GRAIL is likely to tremendously boost ILMN stock.', 'Instead, Illumina may choose to retain a stake in GRAIL or conduct an IPO of the company. In that case, Illumina’s shareholders will eventually benefit from the large-scale utilization of GRAIL’s test by consumers and hospitals.', 'Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com', 'In 2021, Quest (NYSE:DGX) agreed to aid GRAIL in administering its liquid biopsy test. Consequently, I believe that DGX stock will get a big boost over the longer term from the widespread use of GRAIL’s tests by consumers. Eventually, Quest could make similar deals with other firms that have developed liquid biopsy tests.', 'The forward price-earnings ratio of DGX stock is an attractive 15, while analysts, on average, expect its earnings per share to climb to $9.03 in 2024 from $8.71 last year.', 'On the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in EXAS.

Primarily, the sector benefits from permanent relevance. It’s in a nation’s best interest to keep its citizenry healthy and productive, meaning that there will always be funds directed toward the broader health and wellness space.', 'Another factor that could bolster healthcare stocks is its relative insulation from the economy. Now, don’t get me wrong – virtually all sectors experience some impact from outside pressures. However, as stated earlier, health-related innovations command ongoing attention because of their holistic benefits. Put another way, research into treating the world’s most vexing diseases and conditions won’t fade away because the Dow Jones lost a few points.', 'Of course, like any other industry, the health and wellness ecosystem features a broad range of ideas, from the reliable to the downright speculative. Below are several compelling healthcare stocks to consider based on your risk-reward preferences.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: shutterstock.com/JHVEPhoto', 'A top-shelf biotechnology firm, Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) provides a line of products and services that cover the sequencing, genotyping, gene expression and proteomics markets. However, the drawback at the moment is ILMN’s volatility. In the trailing 52 weeks, shares lost a considerable amount of equity value. However, the bulls have been pushing back recently, attempting to reinvigorate sentiment.', 'For those willing to take a contrarian view on major healthcare stocks, Illumina presents an intriguing opportunity. According to MarketsandMarkets, the underlying global genomics market printed revenue of around $46.2 billion last year. Further, experts project that the segment could hit a valuation of $83.1 billion by 2028. If so, that would translate to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.4%.', 'To be fair, ILMN is priced at 132.32X forward earnings, which is very pricey. However, analysts overall are taking a longer-term view with Illumina, pegging its shares a consensus moderate buy. Also, the high-side target lands at $258, offering significant upside possibility.', 'Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com', 'A medical technology company, Hologic (NASDAQ:HOLX) mainly focuses on women’s health. Per its public profile, the company sells medical devices for diagnostics, surgery, and medical imaging. These solutions cover critical areas such as breast cancer screening, bone density assessments, and other women’s health conditions. To be fair, it printed a disappointing performance in the past 52 weeks. Still, recent momentum brings optimism to the table.', 'According to another MarketsandMarkets report, the global diagnostic imaging market printed revenue of $26.5 billion last year. Experts in the field believe that the segment could reach a valuation of $34.6 billion by 2028. If that turns out to be the case, we’re talking about a CAGR of 5.5%.', 'Even better for HOLX, the global mammography sector is presently worth $2.3 billion. However, the landing point for this arena could be an ecosystem worth $6.9 billion by 2033. That would come out to be a CAGR of 11.6%.', 'Analysts are hopeful, pegging shares a consensus moderate buy with a $79.30 price target. Therefore, it’s one of the top healthcare stocks to consider.', 'Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com', 'Following the spinoff of its consumer healthcare unit, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) now concentrates on its core pharmaceutical and medical technology divisions. While one of the most relevant healthcare stocks, JNJ incurred a soft performance last year. Still, analysts remain overall optimistic on JNJ, rating shares a consensus moderate buy with a price target of $178.08. Further, the high-side target comes in at $215.', 'Fundamentally, the case for J&J centers on its massive total addressable markets. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global medical devices market reached a valuation of $512.29 billion in 2022. Even better, experts believe that the segment could reach $799.67 by 2030, exhibiting a CAGR of 5.9%.', 'And that’s an appetizer. Per Acumen Research and Consulting, the global pharmaceutical market printed a value of $1.5 trillion in 2022. Those in the know believe the ecosystem could expand at a CAGR of 6.4% to 2032, resulting in a market size of $2.8 trillion.', 'If these stats weren’t enticing enough, J&J offers a dividend yield of 2.89%. Thus, it’s a sensible idea for healthcare stocks to buy.', 'Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com', 'Moving onto the riskier side of the spectrum, Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) brings an enticing narrative to the table. During the worst of the Covid-19 crisis, Moderna represented one of the top players developing a vaccine. Unsurprisingly, though, as fears of the SARS-CoV-2 virus faded, so too did the relevance of the vaccine storyline. Nevertheless, the company can leverage the underlying messenger-RNA technology to forward myriad other innovations.', 'In fact, it’s well on its way. According to Nature Medicine, Moderna is translating the lessons learned from developing the Covid vaccine to personalized anti-cancer vaccine. This involves a combination of mRNA and immunotherapy tested in a melanoma trial.', 'Adding to the enthusiasm, Grand View Research points out that the global cancer vaccine market size reached a valuation of $7.31 billion in 2022. Analysts see the segment expanding at a CAGR of 11.04% to 2030, culminating in a valuation of $16.84 billion.', 'Wall Street pegs MRNA stock a moderate buy with a $129.75 average price target. Further, the most optimistic target clocks in at $310.', 'Source: vxhal/ShutterStock.com', 'Walking further into the speculative arena, Editas Medicine (NASDAQ:EDIT) is really suited for investors who can tolerate extreme volatility. True, it’s one of the healthcare stocks that managed to land a positive return last year. However, just look at 2023’s chart. Shares have bounced all over the map, which will test almost anyone’s patience. Still, this small-capitalization play offers a tempting proposition.', 'A clinical-stage biotech firm, Editas specializes in developing therapies for rare diseases utilizing the CRISPR gene-editing platform. It’s a novel field, one with profound promise. According to Grand View Research, the global genome editing market reached a valuation of $6.39 billion in 2022. Moreover, analysts project that the sector could see a 17.8% CAGR expansion to 2030. At the forecast culmination, the arena could be worth $24.99 billion.', 'Now, if there is a glaring drawback, it’s that EDIT represents largely a narrative play. With six severe warnings against its financials, it’s no walk in the park. That said, analysts rate shares a moderate buy with a $14.33 average price target.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Verve Therapeutics (NASDAQ:VERV) presents a compelling case for healthcare stocks based purely on science. Per its website, Verve aims to protect the world from cardiovascular disease. Undergirding this directive is gene circuity technology, which offers the potential to regulate gene expression. If successful, Verve could provide the key to addressing chronic diseases like non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and type 2 diabetes.', 'To get an idea of the growth potential of VERV – assuming that all the stars align – Grand View Research notes that the related (global) gene synthesis market reached a valuation of $1.76 billion in 2022. Experts see a CAGR of 16.1% materializing between 2023 to 2030. At the forecast culmination, the segment could print revenue of $5.78 billion.', 'Where VERV gets tricky is in the financials. Though revenue growth is impressive on a percentage basis, nominally, it’s tiny. Further, the company suffers hefty net losses, presenting viability concerns. Still, analysts peg shares as a consensus strong buy with a $41 price target. If it gets there, we’re talking about more than tripling the time-of-writing market value.', 'Source: Dmytro Zinkevych / Shutterstock.com', 'Easily the riskiest idea on this list of healthcare stocks, Asensus Surgical (NYSEAMERICAN:ASXC) offers an extremely relevant product. Specializing in surgical robotics and medical devices, Asensus is developing and commercializing minimally invasive robotic surgery systems for laparoscopy. Through this tech, surgeons can more comfortably deliver critical services while also improving patient outcomes. That’s a win-win.', 'However, the not-so-winning ways involves ASXC’s market performance. Frankly, the performance in 2023 was just awful. Further, shares are priced in literal penny stock territory. And that’s not a surprise given that it’s market cap is noticeably less than $100 million at time of writing. If you’re betting on Asensus, it’s exactly that – a wager at a casino.', 'Still, for the extremely patient, the global surgical robots market size could print revenue of $7.42 billion by 2030. That would translate to a CAGR of 9.5% from 2024. Last year, the segment reached a valuation of $3.92 billion.', 'While terribly risky, it’s worth pointing out that analysts anticipate shares hitting $1.50.

These non-GAAP financial measures provide supplemental information and should not be considered replacements for results in accordance with GAAP. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures internally for planning and forecasting purposes and in its decision-making processes related to the operations of our company. We believe these measures provide meaningful information to us and investors because they enhance the understanding of our operating performance, ability to generate cash, and the trends of our business. Additionally, we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating our operations. The primary limitation of these measures is that they exclude the financial impact of items that would otherwise either increase or decrease our reported results. This limitation is best addressed by using these non-GAAP financial measures in combination with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in order to better understand the amounts, character, and impact of any increase or decrease in reported amounts. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies.', 'The following provides additional information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures:', ""Organic Net Sales Growth (Decline) – represents net sales growth (decline) (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, and acquisitions and divestitures that occurred in the preceding twelve months, if any. Organic Net Sales Growth (Decline) is a useful measure of our performance because it excludes items that are not completely under management's control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity. This measure is a significant component in our incentive compensation plans."", 'Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin – represent operating income and operating margin, respectively, (the most comparable GAAP financial measures) before special items including restructuring and other charges, acquisition-related charges, impairment of goodwill, and other income or charges, if any. We utilize these adjusted measures in combination with operating income and operating margin to assess segment level operating performance and to provide insight to management in evaluating segment operating plan execution and market conditions. Adjusted Operating Income is a significant component in our incentive compensation plans.', 'Adjusted Other Income (Expense), Net – represents net other income (expense) (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) before special items.', 'Adjusted Income Tax (Expense) Benefit and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate – represent income tax (expense) benefit and effective tax rate, respectively, (the most comparable GAAP financial measures) after adjusting for the tax effect of special items including restructuring and other charges, acquisition-related charges, impairment of goodwill, other income or charges, and certain significant tax items, if any.', 'Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations – represents income from continuing operations (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) before special items including restructuring and other charges, acquisition-related charges, impairment of goodwill, other income or charges, and certain significant tax items, if any, and, if applicable, the related tax effects.', 'Adjusted Earnings Per Share – represents diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) before special items including restructuring and other charges, acquisition-related charges, impairment of goodwill, other income or charges, and certain significant tax items, if any, and, if applicable, the related tax effects. This measure is a significant component in our incentive compensation plans.', ""Free Cash Flow (FCF) – is a useful measure of our ability to generate cash. The difference between net cash provided by operating activities (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) and Free Cash Flow consists mainly of significant cash outflows and inflows that we believe are useful to identify. We believe Free Cash Flow provides useful information to investors as it provides insight into the primary cash flow metric used by management to monitor and evaluate cash flows generated from our operations. Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities excluding voluntary pension contributions and the cash impact of special items, if any, minus net capital expenditures. Voluntary pension contributions are excluded from the GAAP financial measure because this activity is driven by economic financing decisions rather than operating activity. Certain special items, including cash paid (collected) pursuant to collateral requirements related to cross-currency swap contracts, are also excluded by management in evaluating Free Cash Flow. Net capital expenditures consist of capital expenditures less proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment. These items are subtracted because they represent long-term commitments. In the calculation of Free Cash Flow, we subtract certain cash items that are ultimately within management's and the Board of Directors' discretion to direct and may imply that there is less or more cash available for our programs than the most comparable GAAP financial measure indicates. It should not be inferred that the entire Free Cash Flow amount is available for future discretionary expenditures, as our definition of Free Cash Flow does not consider certain non-discretionary expenditures, such as debt payments. In addition, we may have other discretionary expenditures, such as discretionary dividends, share repurchases, and business acquisitions, that are not considered in the calculation of Free Cash Flow."", 'Forward-Looking StatementsThis release contains certain ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Athletic wear now comes with enhanced and unique characteristics, like moisture management, temperature controls, and other interesting specificities.

Today’s loyalty bottom line comes down to consumers’ deepest expectations, and how they feel which brand measures up best. Customer behavior and brand loyalty are now almost entirely governed by emotional values related to expectations and expectations grow constantly.”', 'Passikoff noted a few economic facts that substantiate the cost-and-effort effectiveness of brand loyalty strategies. For example, it costs 16 times more to recruit a new customer than keep an existing one. A 5 percent increase in loyalty lifts lifetime profits per customer by as much as 78 percent, and a 5 percent loyalty increase is equal to a 12 to 21 percent across-the-board cost-reduction program.', 'He noted that being a loyalty juggernaut moves brands beyond primacy of product, distribution, ad budgets, even pricing.

Shares of the big drugmaker have plunged more than 50% since the high set in late 2022."", ""Pfizer's revenue and earnings are sinking like a brick. Big hurdles for the company lie ahead. All in all, this big pharma stock might look like one that investors won't want to touch with a 10-foot pole."", ""However, I'm actually bullish about Pfizer over the long term. Here's why it's a much better stock than you might think."", ""Let me first acknowledge that there are some valid reasons behind the gloom and despair hanging over Pfizer like a dark cloud. We can't ignore the hard fact that the company's once high-flying COVID-19 franchise has been largely grounded."", 'Pfizer expects combined sales of COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty and oral antiviral pill Paxlovid to be around $8 billion in 2024.\xa0The two products generated combined sales of $37.8 billion in 2022 and in the ballpark of $12.5 billion in 2023.', 'The company also faces patent expirations before the end of the decade for several of its top-selling products. How big of a problem does this present to Pfizer? Just look at the following table:', 'Product', 'Patent Expiration Year', '2022 Sales', 'Eliquis', '2026', '$6.5 billion', 'Ibrance', '2027 (U.S.)', '2028 (E.U.)', '$5.1 billion', 'Inlyta', '2025', '$1 billion', 'Prevnar 13', '2026 (U.S.)', '$6.3 billion', 'Vyndaqel/Vyndamax/Vynmac', '2024 or 2028 (U.S., pending patent term extension)', '2026 (E.U.)', '$2.4 billion', 'Xalkori', '2029', '$455 million', 'Xtandi', '2027', '$1.2 billion', 'Data source: Pfizer 10-K.', ""The sales for these products won't evaporate overnight once their patents expire. Overall, though, Pfizer expects that the loss of exclusivity for its products losing patent protection in the coming years will reduce annual revenue by roughly $17 billion by 2030. With this looming loss of revenue combined with sinking demand for COVID-19 products, it's understandable why many might think that Pfizer faces almost insurmountable challenges."", ""Despite all this bad news, I believe Pfizer will have a much brighter future. The company's management certainly thinks so."", ""Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla mentioned at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference a few weeks ago that the company expects the utilization of its COVID-19 products to be similar in 2024 to the levels in 2023. However, Pfizer's guidance for this year is more conservative. It seems quite possible that 2024 will be a trough year for the drugmaker's COVID-19 sales."", 'Bourla also noted that Pfizer is developing a combination COVID/flu vaccine. He thinks the combo vaccine could have an especially big opportunity with younger people. This demographic group currently has a very low immunization rate for COVID-19.', ""What about the negative revenue impact from products losing exclusivity over the next few years? Those patent expirations aren't coming as a surprise to Pfizer. The company has been executing its strategy to address the problem for quite a while now. It has invested heavily in research and development and spent billions of dollars on business development deals."", 'As the chart above shows, the company thinks that by 2030, it will more than offset its lost revenue from products losing exclusivity through new product launches/new indications for existing products and new business development deals. As a result, it looks for a non-COVID revenue compound annual growth rate of close to 10% between 2025 and 2030.', 'Former President Ronald Reagan liked to use an old Russian proverb when talking about negotiations with the Soviet Union: ""Trust but verify."" That\'s pretty good advice for investors to follow when evaluating projections made by companies\' management teams. Are Pfizer\'s projections of a brighter future believable? I think so.', ""It makes sense to me that 2024 could be a trough year for Pfizer's COVID-19 revenue. Much of the uncertainty is now gone. The company has already transitioned from governments in the U.S. and some other countries buying COVID-19 vaccines to a commercial business. Pfizer is also moving past the overstocking issues experienced in 2023."", ""Is Bourla right that the younger demographic could be a big opportunity for Pfizer's COVID-flu combo vaccine? I'd say it's a definite maybe. Younger people are more likely to get a flu vaccine. For the same co-pay, they could potentially receive one injection that protects against flu and COVID-19. I suspect that Pfizer will, at minimum, receive a moderate sales boost from its combo vaccine."", ""Pfizer's opportunities to generate $45 billion in new revenue by 2030 also look realistic from my view. The company has already launched several new products that should help significantly, notably including multiple myeloma drug Elrexflo and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine Abrysvo."", ""The drugmaker's business development deals have already bolstered its product lineup and pipeline as well. For example, Pfizer's acquisition of Biohaven gave it up-and-coming migraine drugs Nurtec and Zavzpret. Its recent purchase of Seagen added four approved blood cancer therapies and a promising pipeline."", ""Pfizer's valuation doesn't reflect this brighter outlook. Shares currently trade at a forward price-to-sales ratio of around 2.7 based on the midpoint of its 2024 guidance range. That's lower than any of Pfizer's peers."", ""Now for the kicker. Even if we backed every penny of COVID-19 revenue out of the equation, Pfizer's forward price-to-sales multiple would still be well below any of the other big pharma stocks. Of course, Pfizer will almost certainly continue to make a boatload of money from its COVID-19 products, even if the revenue is much lower than in the past."", ""Most investors appear to be looking only at Pfizer's short-term picture, which is admittedly dismal. However, the company's long-term prospects are actually quite good. Sure, it will take a few years for Pfizer's growth to fully kick in. However, the big drugmaker will pay you handsomely to wait, with a dividend yield of close to 6%."", 'I stated at the outset that I could sum up Pfizer\'s stock performance over the last couple of years with one word (ugh). I think I can also use just one word with three letters to sum up the investment opportunity this stock presents.

But the drop in demand for those products last year, as we headed toward a post-pandemic world, meant a big decline from those revenue levels, and that's weighed on share performance. Pfizer shares have tumbled 37% over the past year."", ""At the same time, some of Pfizer's other blockbusters are set to lose exclusivity later this decade, further weighing on earnings. So, you may not imagine Pfizer as a stock that could help you retire a millionaire. But it may be worth taking a second look at this big pharma player, because, despite these challenges, a new era of growth might be just ahead. Let's find out more."", ""First, a closer look at Pfizer's path, from coronavirus peak revenue through today. The company's earnings took off as sales for vaccine Comirnaty and treatment Paxlovid soared in earlier pandemic days. Last year, those products together brought in peak revenue of $55 billion. Now, though, coronavirus cases and demand for covid products have declined -- and Pfizer is expecting significantly lower revenue for Comirnaty and Paxlovid in the future. The company predicts $8 billion in combined revenue this year."", 'Meanwhile, other top-selling products -- such as breast cancer drug Ibrance and blood thinner Eliquis -- are set to lose exclusivity this decade. Pfizer predicts patent expirations will result in lost sales of $17 billion from 2025 to 2030.', 'But Pfizer has been preparing for this moment by readying other products that should drive future revenue. In fact, the pharma giant is completing its biggest-ever series of product launches. It aimed to release 19 new products in a period of 18 months, products that should bring in $20 billion in revenue in 2030.', 'At the same time, Pfizer has made several acquisitions that also should boost revenue down the road. For example, it recently completed the purchase of Seagen, an oncology company specializing in antibody-drug conjugates. This type of product uses the power of antibodies to target tumors -- and deliver drugs directly to them.', ""Pfizer expects Seagen's products to deliver more than $3 billion to revenue this year and $10 billion in 2030. And Pfizer predicts business deals -- including the Seagen purchase -- should result in $25 billion in revenue by that time."", 'All of this means Pfizer is on the road to compensating for its patent expirations -- and growing beyond them too.', ""To track Pfizer's progress, it's important to look at sales prior to the launch of its covid products -- a pandemic is an uncommon situation, so it doesn't offer us a fair comparison point. In 2019, Pfizer reported sales of about $51 billion, and the company aims for $84 billion in sales in 2030 from non-covid products. On top of this, coronavirus products still could continue to bring in billion-dollar revenue, especially if the company successfully develops a combined coronavirus/flu vaccine -- the candidate now is in clinical trials."", ""Now, let's consider Pfizer's share performance. Its coronavirus product sales helped the share price to reach its highest ever, but it's since fallen 50% from that peak. The next few years may be challenging for the company as older products lose exclusivity -- and it will take some time to grow sales of newer products. So, the stock may not take off immediately. But, all of the moves Pfizer is making today could help the shares win over time -- meaning now makes a great moment for patient, long-term investors to buy Pfizer stock."", ""Could it help you retire a millionaire? If you invest only in Pfizer, it's very unlikely that move will do the trick. Even if the stock tripled, you would have to invest a fortune today to eventually reach the $1 million mark. And even compounding isn't likely to reach the goal. For example, if you add $100 per month to Pfizer stock from age 30 to 65, assuming a 10% rate of return, your investment would reach $325,229."", ""But, as part of a diversified portfolio, and through holding onto Pfizer and other promising stocks for the long term, Pfizer could help today's investor retire a millionaire -- especially since this healthcare giant may be heading for another era of growth down the road."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Pfizer right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Pfizer, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Pfizer wasn't one of them.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This drugmaker is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.19 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -116.7%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $14.35 billion, down 40.9% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.58% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out.

That's because while the formal bear market has ended, many portfolios took a serious hit over the last two years. Indeed, some investors might feel that a new all-time high is no time to buy stocks -- it's time to sell them. So, what's an investor to do?"", ""My advice to investors: Ignore the noise. Instead, let's explore what's happened in the market, how some stocks remain in bear market territory, and what investors should be focused on in 2024."", 'Time to get started.', 'If the stock market still feels under the weather to you, it might be because 2023 was the first time in over a decade that the S&P 500 failed to reach a new all-time high. Consider the chart below:', '^SPX data by YCharts', 'The yellow line represents an all-time high in the S&P 500.

Shares of the fintech company have fallen 80% from the stock's all-time high, set in 2021. Worse yet, they continue to trend lower; shares of PayPal are down 17% over the last six months."", ""Even some stocks that enjoyed bounce-back years in 2023 remain well off their 2021 highs.

By thinking of the current price as a discount or a sale, you may find it easier to double down on your investment. Every share bought today will cost roughly half of what it did in 2021. Better still, buying shares at today's prices will lower your cost basis -- in effect, your purchase price. By dollar-cost averaging, you can set a schedule to accumulate shares over the course of several weeks, months, or years."", 'That, in a nutshell, is following Lynch\'s advice about ""adopting a regular routine of investing and following it no matter what.""', ""Now, perhaps you're no longer bullish on Tesla or PayPal -- and maybe you never were.

It's why professional and everyday investors alike have attempted to mirror his investments for decades."", 'The good news on this front is that Berkshire Hathaway is required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission on a quarterly basis. A 13F provides a detailed snapshot of what money managers with at least $100 million in assets under management purchased and sold in the most recent quarter.', 'What Berkshire\'s 13Fs have taught investors over the past year and change is that the Oracle of Omaha is struggling to find good deals. Over the previous four quarters, ended in September 2023, Buffett and his investing ""lieutenants"" Ted Weschler and Todd Combs have been net sellers of equities.', ""Something else that's noteworthy about Berkshire's quarterly 13Fs is that they fail to tell the complete story."", ""In 1998, Buffett's company acquired General Re for $22 billion. Although the purpose of this acquisition was for Berkshire to get its hands on General Re's reinsurance operations, the company also owned a specialty investment firm at the time, New England Asset Management (NEAM). When Berkshire completed its General Re buyout, it became the owner of NEAM."", 'To be crystal clear, Warren Buffett isn\'t playing a role in the day-to-day investment activity of NEAM\'s roughly $610 million investment portfolio. Nevertheless, any security held by New England Asset Management is, ultimately, part of Berkshire Hathaway. This makes NEAM, which is also required to file quarterly 13Fs, Warren Buffett\'s ""secret"" portfolio.', 'Though New England Asset Management holds stakes in 111 various securities, including common stock, preferred stock, and exchange-traded funds, one of these 111 holdings stands out as a screaming buy in 2024.', 'Despite having $610 million invested across dozens of profitable, time-tested businesses, fintech industry leader PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) may be the smartest buy in the new year.', ""Shares of PayPal have declined by around 80% from their all-time high, which was achieved during the summer of 2021. Growing competition in the digital payment arena has been the primary concern of skeptics. With more brand-name businesses getting involved in digital payments, there's the potential for PayPal's margins to erode."", 'Historically high inflation has been another significant headwind for PayPal. Higher prices for goods and services threatened to sap the discretionary purchasing power of low earners. Since PayPal is primarily driven by fees, anything that could reduce the number of transactions on its platform would be bad news.', ""While both of these headwinds are genuine concerns, they're not what I'd consider game changers for PayPal, as evidenced by the underlying data."", 'The first thing for current and prospective investors to consider is the growth runway for digital payments. According to projections released in May 2023 by researchers at Boston Consulting Group, global fintech revenue is expected to grow by a factor of six, to $1.5 trillion in 2030.', ""Regardless of whether or not this estimate is a bit overzealous, it demonstrates how early in the growth cycle we still are for digital payment adoption. There's room for multiple companies to succeed, with PayPal continuing to lead the way."", ""PayPal's key performance indicators (KPIs) also suggest that a lengthy growth runway lies ahead. Total payment volume (TPV) traversing its network has consistently grown by a low double-digit percentage, sans currency movements, over the past couple of years. Even with historically high inflation and increased competition, TPV has sustained a double-digit, constant-currency growth rate. During long-winded periods of expansion, TPV may reapproach a 20% sustained growth rate as digital payment adoption increases."", ""What I'd argue is even more important, in terms of KPIs, is PayPal's ever-improving user engagement. At the end of 2020, the average active PayPal user was completing 40.9 transactions over the trailing-12-month (TTM) period. As of the end of September 2023, active accounts were averaging 56.6 transactions over the TTM."", ""As noted, PayPal is a transaction-driven operating model. As existing users become more engaged, they're going to help drive gross profit even higher."", ""Something else for investors to consider is the hiring of Alex Chriss as CEO. Chriss took over in late September after leading Intuit's Small Business segment for more than four years. Chriss has a keen understanding for how PayPal can appeal to small businesses, and he's not afraid to reduce expenses and bolster the company's operating margin."", ""To add to the above, PayPal's board has been aggressively rewarding its shareholders with stock buybacks. The company approved a $15 billion share repurchase program in 2022, which should provide a lift to the company's earnings per share."", ""Last but not least, PayPal's stock is historically cheap. Shares are currently trading for 12 times forward-year earnings, despite an expected annualized earnings growth rate of 18% over the next five years.

Chriss officially took over on Sept. 27. Now four months later, Chriss has scheduled a presentation for Jan. 25. And in an interview with CNBC, he said the presentation will ""shock the world.""', ""This was Chriss' first interview since taking over at PayPal, and it certainly made an impression with investors. Since Chriss promised to shock the world, PayPal stock is up more than 10%. For perspective, PayPal stock was down about 14% in 2023, underperforming the 24% gain for the S&P 500 index by a wide margin."", 'After a couple of years of lackluster results, can PayPal truly shock the world and finally turn things around for shareholders? The answer is surprisingly ""yes,"" with an important caveat.', 'According to Chriss, PayPal has been too slow to innovate, and that\'s why it\'s having an innovation-day presentation on Jan. 25. The new CEO said that the company is ""going to revolutionize commerce again through AI-driven personalization for both consumers and merchants.""', ""Let's unpack the possibilities here. First, the company ended the third quarter of 2023 with nearly 400 million active consumer accounts and around 35 million active merchant accounts. The scale of this business is massive, processing well over $1 trillion in annual payment volume. And that scale means it has a lot of valuable consumer data."", 'Way back in February 2021, then CEO Dan Schulman alluded to this fact by saying, ""We have a platform with hundreds of millions of consumers that are basically telling the merchant \'here\'s what I want\'."" The idea was to provide tools to leverage the consumer data that it had.', ""PayPal doesn't seem to have done this yet, or at least it hasn't done it well. But with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), perhaps the company's longtime vision is now closer to reality. After all, that's where AI is at its best: processing large datasets in search of insights that would otherwise go overlooked."", 'When asked how this helps PayPal, Chriss gave a surprisingly simple answer but one that I believe is on target. He basically said that if you provide a value proposition to users -- a reason to choose it over competitors -- then the business will grow.', 'Consumers are looking to save money, and merchants are looking to increase sales conversions. Chriss believes that AI can provide better personalization and better conversion, delivering a value proposition in this regard. Investors will learn more in the upcoming presentation.', ""In recent years, PayPal has lost focus, according to Chriss, by pursuing needless acquisitions and low-margin opportunities. And looking at the five-year chart, it's hard to disagree with that assessment. As the chart below shows, the company's growth rate has plunged, and its free cash flow is well below where it used to be."", ""For one acquisition example, remember that PayPal acquired browser extension Honey for $4 billion in 2020. Today the company barely even mentions its existence. And it has nearly $11 billion in overall goodwill, suggesting it's overpaid significantly for past acquisitions."", 'Turning to free cash flow, PayPal has been hurt by its buy now, pay later (BNPL) product. It had to supply some of its own cash to fund the loans.', ""According to Chriss, PayPal is going to be more focused. It's not going to pursue acquisitions and it will be funding BNPL through partners in the future. Therefore, it looks like it's correcting past mistakes. And Chriss says the focus will be on innovation to outcompete its rivals in the coming year and beyond."", 'Therefore, to circle back to the beginning, PayPal can turn things around for shareholders by correcting mistakes. And if the company winds up being a true innovator in the fintech space through AI, then I would wager that would shock the world -- right now, many view it as a laggard when it comes to being at the forefront of innovation.', 'However, the aforementioned caveat is this: Chriss is essentially pitching a turnaround plan for PayPal, and not all turnarounds pan out in the end.', ""For now, investors should take things at face value. It certainly sounds like PayPal is making good moves, and hopefully the company will unveil promising details to its innovation plan very soon. So there's reason to hold.

The stock trades at an eye-watering 119 times sales; I can't talk about profit-based valuation ratios because the quantum computing specialist isn't profitable."", ""So it's fair to ask if it might already be too late to buy IonQ stock. I would argue that it's way too early, actually. Let me explain what I mean."", ""In the context of IonQ's recent stock surge, a closer look reveals a valuation that might be more of a mirage than a miracle."", ""Trading at 119 times trailing sales, IonQ's valuation looks like a speculative bubble. This is particularly striking in the quantum computing sector, which is still in its early days as a serious business. Yes, IonQ has started to collect some revenues but each step forward on the top line has been accompanied by an even sharper uptick in expenses."", 'As a result, IonQ burns more and more cash over time. Management keeps the lights on largely by dipping into the cash reserves IonQ collected in its SPAC-style initial public offering three years ago. At this accelerating rate of quarterly cash burn, those coffers could be empty in two or three years.', ""What's more, IonQ's valuation surge seems to ignore the competitive landscape, where numerous other players are vying for dominance. Sure, some of the company's rivals are also small, underfunded, and hungry little start-ups. But others are deep-pocketed household names such as IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Honeywell (NASDAQ: HON). You can't walk into the same room as these world-class innovators and expect to win every contract."", ""Quantum computing is a promising technology with the potential to disrupt computing as we know it. IonQ is a leading researcher in the field, bravely attempting to commercialize its research projects in this early stage. I'm duly impressed by the company's actual system sales, including an order for two quantum computers from the U.S. Air Force. If it's good enough for military use, IonQ's quantum solutions have to be the real deal."", 'However, the company is nowhere near actually delivering these ordered systems to contracted customers yet. Management talks about an 18-month delivery process, which starts with actually building the thing. The Air Force and others are buying experimental system designs, and Silicon Valley is littered with the bankrupted remains of fast-growing upstarts that ran into manufacturing issues or research snags on the road to useful products.', ""I don't know for sure that IonQ will join that unfortunate group -- but I'm not sure that it won't, either. That's a deal-breaking level of uncertainty for me."", ""IonQ's inflated valuation, lacking support from concrete results or robust long-term contracts, suggests that investors might be jumping the gun, banking heavily on unproven potential. I guess that's alright as long as you keep your IonQ investment small. That modest investment might multiply many times over if IonQ delivers on its quantum computing promises while dodging challenges from much larger competitors, or it could go to absolute zero for a thousand different reasons."", ""I don't recommend making that bet unless you're prepared to lose the entire investment over time. IonQ should continue its technology development and contract-signing for a couple more years before I can take it seriously as an investment idea. In other words, I think it's too early to invest in IonQ today."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in IonQ right now?', 'Before you buy stock in IonQ, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and IonQ wasn't one of them.

We will also shed light on social mobility efforts of some companies. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Countries With the Highest Economic Mobility in the World.', 'There are certain aspects of life that are beyond human control. When, where, and to whom you are born, is one such example. The innate stratification of classes within this world is yet another reality of life that determines to some extent most people’s journey on earth. However, we build our lives on the premise that not everything is predestined and hard work and dedication can play a significant role in goal achievement. It is this drive then that propels people to continuously improve themselves, whether it be to move up the socioeconomic ladder or some other loftier objective.', ""Economic mobility can be defined as the ability of people to upgrade their economic status over time. The concept of inter-generational move to a higher income bracket is especially relevant here. Nevertheless, the question that demands further clarification is that, can simply a desire for elevation to an upper class be enough? There are numerous other factors that must be accounted for before this objective is accomplished, thereby, rendering it with complexities that the world is still unraveling. Globally, people have been seen tethered to their parent's status and we find developed countries with higher economic mobility as compared to developing, low-income nations. Some of the countries found at the lower end of social mobility spectrum include Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Pakistan and Bangladesh."", 'Furthermore, while richer economies are associated with higher economic mobility, this is not set in stone. Certain welfare states like Sweden, Norway, and Denmark etc. provide their citizens with many amenities of life with little or no cost as well as equal opportunities in education. They have low-income inequality and therefore, are among countries with high economic mobility. Interestingly, the United States -- a welfare state with an impressive economy -- has low social mobility as compared to other developed countries. Raj Chetty’s probing research in understanding low economic mobility for the US brings to the forefront the fact that there is much geographical dispersion within the country.', 'This was found to be especially true for children from poor households. The government, however, is aware of the need for constant efforts for uplifting the socioeconomic status of their people. The DollarWise Economic Mobility Campaign has distributed grants for economic and health well-being to their cities for a long time and continues to do so. It has also been ascertained that some factors like education, household structure, and savings can have an impact on economic mobility of\xa0 the Americans.', 'Humanity is grounded in the idea of equity between people and though the efforts for better social mobility definitely satisfies this condition, there are multifarious economic benefits that can be accrued as well. The World Economic Forum stipulates that a 10-point increase in the Global Social Mobility index of countries could lead to a potential $514 billion increase in global GDP.', 'Given the stress on economic and social mobility development, many companies are also playing their role, apart from the government. This includes big companies like Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), IBM (NYSE: IBM), and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN).', 'Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F), has established Ford Motor Company Fund that collaborates with non-profit firms to help disadvantaged people in various communities. For example, the Ford Resource and Engagement Center in Craiova, has only recently accepted 8 new entrepreneurship programs. These are supposed to provide employment opportunities for young people. Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) has also used the fund to invest $5 million in transportation for Detroit and other US cities. The aim is to ensure transportation for people who lack the facility, thereby, positively impacting their economic opportunities.', 'Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and IBM (NYSE: IBM) have been known to spend millions in the education system. One of IBM’s (NYSE: IBM) program, called SkillsBuild, is a free education program aimed at tech-low communities. This would allow them a chance to learn and develop technological skills and thus, help land better jobs. Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ: MSFT) YouthSpark Program is also a praiseworthy effort for building educational and career possibilities for children around the world.', 'Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) is also not behind other companies in promoting economic mobility. Chosen as one of the top 75 UK employers for the Social Mobility Employer Index 2023, they provide ample evidence of their serious attitude towards fostering an equitable and progressive environment. 85% success rate of Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) apprenticeship program as well as The JOBS Project and Career Choice are some of the examples that they can boast.', '15 Countries With Highest Economic Mobility In The World', 'To list the countries with the highest economic mobility in the world, we have taken two different metrics. Firstly, we used our list of 15 countries with the highest social mobility in the world. Secondly, we used the latest Heritage Foundation Economic Freedom Index, 2023. The idea is that easier access to economic opportunities would allow people to attain a better living standard, thereby, allowing them to move up the ladder.', 'We then took the rankings of each country from both these lists and averaged them and then ranked our final list based on those average rankings. The list is presented in descending order.', 'Please note that in the case of similar average ranks, a country with a higher social mobility index ranking was placed higher.', ""Note: The US's huge levels of income inequality prevented it from making it to the list. However, apart from that, the country is known for robust economic infrastructure and there are few regulatory obstacles to entrepreneurship."", 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

What is an even more dedicated effort on their part for ensuring well-being of people at all times, is the indexation wages and pensions with inflation. In fact, the government has recently enacted reforms to enable pensioners to life a sustainable lifestyle. In addition, their excellent healthcare system as well as the early retirement option, are both indicative of the government’s desire to facilitate a prosperous lifestyle. Such measures are bound to have a positive impact in inter-generational economic mobility as well as social mobility. Their free open market policies encourage international trade and investment, thereby, provide opportunities for growth. Thus, it is no wonder that Belgium is one of the countries with the highest economic mobility in the world.', 'Social Mobility: 9', 'Economic Freedom Index: 23', 'Average Rank: 16\xa0', 'While Austria has fallen short in certain aspects of social mobility scale, as compared to other OECD countries, their overall performance still earns them a place on the list of countries with the highest social as well as economic mobility in the world. They have low income inequality. Their early childhood education rate has been on the rise and they also provide targeted support for children struggling in education -- an established indicator for economic mobility. Moreover, their tax and benefit system is strong, cushioning people against sudden income shocks. Recent “long-term care” plan, provides further evidence of their commitment to ensuring a prosperous life for their people. On top of this, their attitude towards maintaining rule of law and transparent as well as competitive business environment, has also brought them to the 23rd place in the economic freedom index. Therefore, we find them among the 15 countries with the highest economic mobility in the world.', 'Social Mobility rank: 13', 'Economic Freedom Index rank: 16', 'Average Rank: 14.5', 'Canadian society is one of the most socially mobile in the world, both within and across generations. \xa0In fact, they are twice more socially mobile than the US. They are also ahead of United Kingdom. Research over the years have established that a child’s future in Canada is not linked to the financial status of their parents. 35% of their citizens have achieved a higher strata than their parents, depicting a clear trend towards economic mobility. Furthermore, strong rule of law, supporting environment for property rights, and proper implementation of commercial code, sustains a free economic situation in the country. Combined, these factors make Canada one of the countries with the highest economic mobility in the world.', 'Social Mobility rank: 11', 'Economic Freedom Index rank: 13', 'Average Rank: 12', 'While Australians have been identified with a fairly higher chance of inter-generational economic mobility as compared to other countries, the Treasury researchers are pessimistic about the future. Children born in the bottom fifth of the Australian households, have a 12.3% chance of moving up to the top five, in terms of income. However, this is still quoted as a 60% higher probability than that found in the US. Findings of a Treasury research report pointed to strong labor markets as a potential driver of economic mobility. Queensland and Western Australia were seen to depict this trend in the wake of the boom experienced by the mining industry. The economic freedom index also places Australia at a good place in the world ranking. Therefore, our average considers the country as one of the countries with the highest economic mobility.', 'Social Mobility rank: 5', 'Economic Freedom Index rank: 19', 'Average Rank: 12', 'Iceland is commended for various policies that center on equality and human rights protection. Their family policy, low gender disparity, low housing cost, technological reach, and internet freedom, are among the few that help label them as a highly progressive society. Combine this with an open-market system that fosters trade and investment, and you get one of the countries with the highest economic mobility in the world.', 'Social Mobility rank: 8', 'Economic Freedom Index rank: 14', 'Average Rank: 11', 'According to OECD, Germany has lower social mobility than other developed countries. Children of high-income households have a 50% chance of graduating high school, as compared to children born in low-income households. Researchers have also found that while mobility has been constant for the recent birth cohorts, there is substantial variation across regions within the country. The world ranking for Economic freedom Index has the country on the 14th place. They have an open-market policy and along with law and order supremacy, they enjoy a robust economy. Thus, these factors coupled together, we find Germany at the 10th position on our list of 15 countries with the highest economic mobility in the world.', 'Social Mobility rank: 15', 'Economic Freedom Index rank: 5', 'Average Rank: 10', 'New Zealand is a strong advocate of fair women representation at all job levels. The government supports mitigation of gender disparity and their top public service positions have been more than adequately filled by women. Furthermore, they engage in policy making that ensures economic growth of the low-income population in the country. This is evidenced by the Recognized Seasonal Employer (RSE) Scheme, which has directly contributed towards higher living standards. Furthermore, with a strong, stable economy and compliance with rules and regulations, New Zealand has quite an impressive economic freedom index ranking, making them stand out as an economically mobile society.', 'Social Mobility rank: 12', 'Economic Freedom Index rank: 7', 'Average Rank: 9.5', 'The Global Social Mobility Report, 2020, ranks Luxembourg at the 10th position. Not only does the country excel in the health sector, they are also performing well in the education quality and equity aspect.

Thus, it is no wonder that they make it to the list of the countries with the highest economic mobility in the world.', 'Social Mobility rank: 14', 'Economic Freedom Index rank: 3', 'Average Rank: 8.5', 'Ireland has recognized the necessity of educational uplift in order to promote and sustain social/economic mobility. A recent annual Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) conference brought many organizational leaders to the forum. Almost all of them were found to be keenly involved in pursuing educational programs that would foster social mobility. The country is also aware of the link between economic prosperity and social uplift.

Coors Light is running a 30-second spot in the first half of the game on Feb. 11, the company confirmed, resurrecting a silver bullet train concept introduced in 2005. The move looks to extend a recent run of sales momentum and court favor with newer Gen Z customers, executives said.', 'For its first appearance in a dozen years, the sleek locomotive dispensing cold beers and good vibes has been outfitted to address modern anxieties, embodying themes from the beer marketer’s ongoing “Made to Chill” platform centered on moments to kick back and relax. The overhaul comes with a fitting new name, the Coors Light Chill Train, and design touches such as train cars shaped like beer cans.', '“Since 2019, when we started the ‘Made to Chill’ campaign, we’ve added an emotional layer to our advertising,” said Marcelo Pascoa, vice president of marketing for the Coors family of brands, in an interview about the Chill Train’s return. “In this crazy, hectic world we live in, there is a subversive power in choosing to have that moment of chill.”', 'Along with the bigger emotional appeal, the Chill Train is getting upgraded with tech bells and whistles. With help from computer-generated imagery, Coors Light will digitally insert 100 fans into the vehicle’s cars during the commercial. Participants will have the chance to post their experience on social media to extend the effort to the increasingly important second screen and realm of user-generated content.', 'Since the Chill Train will fly by quickly during the broadcast — a press release claims the locomotive moves at 900 mph — Coors Light plans to release a slowed-down version on its YouTube channel on Super Bowl Sunday. That will give viewers a chance to comb through the passengers, with the inclusion of some surprise guests. The length of the slo-mo cut is to be determined, a spokesperson said.', '“Through social and digital, we’re going to be able to introduce people to different moments and allow them to enjoy all of the little Easter eggs,” said Pascoa.', 'Coors Light will tease its big game play during the NFC Championship on Sunday, Jan. 28. Those interested in jumping on the Chill Train can visit Coors Light’s website to reserve specific spots and upload a photo of themselves, with seats available in batches every day at 1 p.m. ET through Feb. 2. Winners will sign a contract and receive $500 in talent fees, along with limited-edition merchandise.', '“There is a special component toward being a part of a big spot,” said Pascoa of the compensation package. “We wanted to treat people accordingly.”', 'Coors Light debuted its branded train in the pre-iPhone, pre-streaming era, with splashy TV campaigns accompanied by The O’Jays hit single “Love Train” and cameos from celebrities like Ice-T. While the Chill Train’s engines have been left dormant for over a decade, the creative left an enduring impression.', 'For last year’s big game, Molson Coors partnered with DraftKings on a betting game that revealed 74% of participants believed the locomotive would make a comeback for Super Bowl LVII, according to Pascoa.\xa0While the appetite for the Chill Train to again hit the rails was clear, agency partner Droga5 was the first to raise the prospect of taking the strategy to the Super Bowl.', '“It was a surprise for us,” said Pascoa of the pitch process behind the campaign. “We didn’t tell the agency that we wanted the train to come back. They brought that idea to us.”', 'Bringing back the Chill Train could help Coors Light tap into the current marketing wave around 2000s nostalgia. But the Rocky Mountains-themed brewer has sights set on its “next generation” of fans as well with more Gen Zers coming of legal drinking age and consumers at large switching up their beverage preferences.', '“We are experiencing a level of momentum that is really unprecedented for us,” said Pascoa. “More people than ever are reaching for a Coors Light. If we’re going to deliver to all of those people, why not use the best delivery system we’ve ever had?”', 'Coors Light has benefited from chief competitor Bud Light getting swept up in controversy last year over a partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. The misfire, one of the highest profile instances of a brand becoming embattled in culture wars, has led Molson Coors to significantly ramp up marketing spending.', 'Coors Light stood as the fastest gainer in volume share among beer brands and the fastest-growing premium light beer offering in the U.S. in 2023, per Circana estimates cited in the announcement. Rather than run a multibrand Super Bowl ad, as in 2023, Molson Coors will keep the spotlight squarely on Coors Light for Feb. 11’s match-up at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas. Coors Light will additionally air a bespoke spot in Canada for the broadcast.', 'Regarding the game’s host city, Pascoa said the details of local Vegas activations are still being finalized. The executive also played coy about whether the Chill Train’s run will extend past Super Bowl LVIII into the rest of 2024.', '“What I can tell you is that this a very special, iconic element in our advertising history,” said Pascoa. “We’re committed to making the most of this moment. We’re committed to using the train as an element that can strengthen our emotional connection with our current fans and our new fans as well.”', 'This story was originally published on Marketing Dive.

In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.', 'It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.', 'By comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.', 'A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value or the stock is undervalued and, therefore, a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.', 'For example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.', 'But there is a warning. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.', 'Moreover, the P/B ratio is not without limitations. It is useful for businesses like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.', 'In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.', 'Price to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.', 'Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.', 'Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share — a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.', 'PEG less than 1: PEG links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company.

But striking the right chord each time is not easy unless blessed with Midas touch. When it comes to the investment market, experts consider value style as one of the most effective approaches. Value investing is essentially about selecting stocks that have good things going on for them, even at a time when they have been beaten down by some external factors.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength but a random selection of ratios cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, we recommend Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) as one of the key metrics. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis — the lower the number, the better. PVH Corp. PVH, Centene Corporation CNC, General Motors Company GM and Graphic Packaging Holding Company GPK boast a low P/CF ratio.', 'Questions may arise as to why we are considering the Price to Cash Flow valuation metric, when the most widely used metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, what makes P/CF stand out is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly reflecting the financial health of a company.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. It is net cash flow that reveals how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is putting the same to use.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, shell out for its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Then again, a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.', ""An investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and also consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Here are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to their peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening.PVH Corp., which operates as an apparel company, carries a Zacks Rank #2.

This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction)."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate.

However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss.

JetBlue is a mainline carrier that could have competed a whole lot better with those immediate 200 airplanes with United, Southwest, and Delta, and American."", ""- And Mike, I'll get you out of here on this.

So I don't see good news happening only because of the Boeing thing at Alaska, and JetBlue has to restructure now because they're not going to get those expansion airplanes they could have gotten and improved competition in America with that merger.""]"

(NASDAQ:UAL) shareholders, because the company has just released its latest annual results, and the shares gained 4.0% to US$40.49. United Airlines Holdings reported in line with analyst predictions, delivering revenues of US$54b and statutory earnings per share of US$7.89, suggesting the business is executing well and in line with its plan. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year."", ' View our latest analysis for United Airlines Holdings ', ""After the latest results, the 18 analysts covering United Airlines Holdings are now predicting revenues of US$56.4b in 2024. If met, this would reflect a modest 5.1% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to climb 14% to US$9.11. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$56.5b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$9.14 in 2024. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates."", ""It will come as no surprise then, to learn that the consensus price target is largely unchanged at US$60.90. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. Currently, the most bullish analyst values United Airlines Holdings at US$98.00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$35.00. As you can see the range of estimates is wide, with the lowest valuation coming in at less than half the most bullish estimate, suggesting there are some strongly diverging views on how analysts think this business will perform. With this in mind, we wouldn't rely too heavily the consensus price target, as it is just an average and analysts clearly have some deeply divergent views on the business."", ""Of course, another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. The period to the end of 2024 brings more of the same, according to the analysts, with revenue forecast to display 5.1% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 5.8% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry (in aggregate), which analyst estimates suggest will see revenues grow 7.5% annually. So although United Airlines Holdings is expected to maintain its revenue growth rate, it's forecast to grow slower than the wider industry."", ""The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. On the plus side, there were no major changes to revenue estimates; although forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$60.90, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets."", ""With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year.

Scott Kirby', ""Thank you, Kristina, and good morning to everyone on the call today. Despite the numerous geopolitical and other headwinds around the globe, 2023 really was a year that our plan for United Next came together. Our thesis at this time last year was that operational constraints and other factors were leading to cost converters, and those cost pressures in turn would lead to higher revenue. That is certainly true for United because our diversified revenue streams continued to differentiate us from other airlines. Another way of saying that is that we believe that a new link between United's CASM and RASM was being solidified. And while I'd be hard to get either a CASM or RASM forecast exactly correct, we could have higher confidence in forecasting the relationship between the 2, and therefore, we have higher confidence in our earnings and the margin forecast. And is by the year, build on the best that we could have never predicted. That's exactly what happened in 2023. And so I'd like to thank the 100,000 United team members around the world who worked so hard to make that. And those same 100,000 people continue to deliver in the face of huge impacts on our employees and customers from the MAX 9 aircraft. I'm proud of our tech ops team, who's taken the lead and has been working 18-hour days nonstop since January to ensure that the MAX 9 is 100% safe before we return it to service. I'd also like to thank the FAA for their professional leadership in this situation and also acknowledge that they too are also working long hours and weekends with us, in an effort to ensure that we know for sure what happens so that we'd be confident that the remediation prevents it from ever happening again. 2023 really sets the stage for what is likely to be a repeat in 2024. United financial performance was impressive, especially considered what analysts were expecting just 1 year ago. In 2023, we delivered full year earnings per share above $10, which was within the range of our initial United targets of $10 to $12. I want to spend some time today examining how we got there and why we think those trends will persist in 2024. One, we expect the operating environment to be challenging, driven by pilots and other hiring constraints, FAA, air traffic control set, maintenance catch-up and supply chain issues. It turned out to be even more challenging than we thought. Two, and those operating environment challenge led directly to industry capacity plans, including our own coming down 3 points on average as carriers adopted to the new operating environment. For United, we made changes to our schedule and we closed out the year setting operational records. The improvements in Newark, in particular, are one of the most important accomplishments that we achieved last year. Brett will share more detail in just a moment, but the FAA waivers rightsize the airport and aerospace, to physical constraints that allowed us to run an operation that is performing better than ever in Newark. That's been good for our business, and it's been really good for our customers. Three, but as we predict the challenging operating environment led to cost pressures and cost conversions in the industry, to be fair, even we at United underestimated, the inflationary pressures that we would face primarily from labor, maintenance and supply chain issues, and that led to higher absolute CASM-ex than we were forecasting. But those same cost pressures are being [bogged] across the entire industry. And a year ago, when we talked -- we believe the industry-wide cost pressures will wind up as a pass-through, much like fuel have been in the past, or, and that is, in fact, exactly what happened. While industry cost pressures drove higher CASM-ex at United, we offset those higher-than-expected costs with higher-than-expected revenues. Five, which leads to the final point. while difficult to predict events like the fuel price spike, rising conflicts in the Middle East, fires in Mali, persisting inflationary pressure. So many other things that make it difficult to predict United's full year 2023 CASM in rather than 12 months in advance. The timing connection at United between CASM and RASM meant that we achieved our initial $10 to $12 EPS range despite those multiple headwinds around the globe. The link between RASM and CASM combined with the success of United Next, what made 2023 such a successful and important year in our history, and we expect 2024 to follow a similar path for the same reasons. This is just the new normal. The operational challenges remain. It will be years before the FAA is back to full staffing. We're still overlapping new labor agreements, which shows in our CASM and the supply chain challenges aren't going away anytime soon. That means capacity will continue to ratchet down out of necessities and cost convergence will continue. But revenues will adjust to the new cost reality, and you can expect United to maintain and grow EPS and margins. 2.5 years ago, we laid out our United Next growth strategy. In 2023, we demonstrated that the plan is working almost exactly as we expected in the future is bright. There have been and there will be more bumps in the road. But we continue to feel confident about our ability to grow earnings and margin over the long term because of the tighter connection between United's cost and United's revenue. Looking ahead to 2024, the United Next plan is working and no airline is better positioned to capitalize on industry and macroeconomic trends than United, and we're continuing to move aggressively to capitalize on emerging opportunities. We'll have more to share with you at our Investor Day later this spring. In the meantime, we're focused on delivering another great year for our employees and customers and our shareholders. And with that, I'll hand it over to Brett."", 'Brett J. Hart', ""Thank you, Scott, and good morning. As of Saturday, January 6, Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft has been grounded. We are currently the largest operator of the Boeing (inaudible) fleet type aircraft representing approximately 8% of our capacity in the first quarter. Our financial guidance assumes that United 79 MAX 9 aircraft is grounded since the start of January. I echo Scott's gratitude for all United who worked so hard (inaudible) travel plans were affected by the grounding of our MAX 9 fleet. I'm also extremely proud of our Tech Ops team, who we're working carefully to ensure the safety of our MAX 9 aircraft before we start flying them again. 2023 was a year of growth and restoration. And we closed out the year with strong record-breaking operational results, carrying a record 171 million customers.The fourth quarter consolidated customer D0, A0 and misconnect rate were the best for any quarter in our history. Not only did we set company records for the quarter, but we also (inaudible) record-setting operations during our busiest time of the year over Thanksgiving and Christmas. Thanksgiving and the entire fourth quarter had the highest NPS scores in our post-pandemic history. We wrapped up the year with our lowest ever cancel rate for the month of December. One of the largest challenges United and all airlines flying to and from New York have historically faced more flights than air traffics -- than the air traffic system can handle is now being addressed, thanks to proactive intervention by the FAA. Newark, United's largest hub has been operating with the best reliability on record since the FAA mandated that flight activity to be consistent with the aerospace and runway limitations of no more 77 operations per hour this fall. For United, that meant we reduced flight activity from Newark by about 10%. Expect to continue with those cuts for the remainder of 2024. Our customers and every passenger flying from New York are now benefiting and the cascade of delays that historically would flow across the United States from New York airspace has significantly improved. Our customer D0 from Newark the company record 76% in Q4 of 2023. We expect this level of performance to continue as long as the FAA continues to mandate the flat operations remain at 77 or fewer operations per hour going forward. United plans to continue to upgauge our Newark flying to ensure that there is plenty of capacity available for our customers even with fewer flights. 2023 was also a banner year for employee recruiting, hiring and retention at United. On the heels of hiring more than 21,000 people in 2022, we hired another 16,000 aviation professionals to our airline last year. We hire the best of the best. The skill and talent of our employees played a big role in our operational performance -- outperformance in the second half of the year. Our record-breaking customer scores during the holidays and our overall financial performance as an airline in 2023. We are a better, more successful airline because of our people. And I'm proud of the way we've gone about growing our team. I'm happy to announce we will be paying our eligible employees, $81 million in profit sharing next month. This is 5x higher than 2022, and over 2x higher than the average of the last 10 years. Our team will be the part of this airline profit sharing. I'll be sharing these impressive results today without them. With that, I will pass it over to Andrew."", 'Andrew P. Nocella', ""Thanks, Brett. As Scott mentioned, comp pressures led to healthy revenue trends in the quarter with stellar performance over the holidays. Total revenues in the fourth quarter increased 9.9% on a 14.7% increase in capacity. Consolidated TRASM was down 4.2% and PRASM was down 3.3% for the quarter. Domestic demand was strong in the quarter and PRASM results were slightly negative year-over-year, a nice improvement from the third quarter. Atlantic PRASM growth in Q4 of positive 3.8% was consistent with Q3 year-over-year growth of 4%. We also experienced a small but measurable demand weakness period across for Europe in Q4 triggered by the conflict of Israel, but that has now moderated. United increased Asia Pacific flying by 82% in the quarter. PRASM was down 11.6% year-over-year. In the quarter, we increased flying to China from 4 weekly flights to twice daily. Amongst many other changes we've now fully restored our capacity to pre-voted levels across the Pacific. Latin American unit revenues decreased by 11.6% in the quarter, pressured by record industry capacity levels and heavy fare discounting. Cargo revenues continue to adjust to their new city state post-pandemic state. For 2023, cargo revenues were $1.5 billion, 31% lower than 2022. Amongst all the revenue changes due to yields, not volumes. (technical difficulty) Turning to our outlook for the first quarter. We expect TRASM in Q1 to be approximately flat year-over-year, which is a nice sequential improvement versus the past few quarters. Domestic demand remains strong with increases in business traffic volumes year-over-year in addition to stronger pricing thus far this year, and we expect domestic year-over-year PRASM to be positive for the quarter. We see the best yield growth occurring on tickets purchased within a week of departure. Bookings and yields for Atlantic fly in early 2024 are also strong and we expect these trends to continue into the second and third quarters. Service to Tel Aviv will resume as soon as it's safe for our customers and crew but no sooner than February 15. We also saw a nice step-up in London Heathrow business demand in recent weeks, which has helped in Atlantic results in Q1 to date when combined with lower United capacity to London. We remain focused on slow growth across the Atlantic for 2024. Asia Pacific growth remains above normal as we head into Q1, we continue to absorb the incremental Asia Pacific capacity added in 2023. We expect all of United's new Asia capacity to produce strong margin results as we head into Q2 and Q3. Latin American RASM is expected to remain negative for Q1 year-over-year, a trend that's likely to continue into Q2. FAA imposed industry capacity limitations on New York for virtually all of 2024 and San Francisco for most of 2024 will limit capacity from either airport. We've prioritized international growth over domestic at both hubs. We're optimistic that the demand will catch up with supply in 2024 in these 2 United hubs that have lagged the recovery elsewhere. In summary, we expect strong unit revenue performance on domestic and Atlantic capacity in early 2024, with weaker results in Asia as we absorb 2023 growth and in Latin America due to record industry capacity growth levels. While we expect international RASMs will grow slower than domestic for a period, we also expect that international flying will have materially higher margins for United versus domestic in 2024, just less of a gap than in 2023. We, at United, have I think, created a really very durable commercial model that has diversified our revenue streams and our network and largely decommoditized our product versus just about every other airline in the U.S. maybe for the exception of one. Our commercial strategy has resulted in fair levels at United just in -- not only for changes in price of fuel, but also for the cost inputs at United allowing us to overcome the inflationary cost pressures larger than we expected in 2023. You can see this in our relative revenue performance quarter-to-quarter. United unique hub system in the largest U.S. cities and the network we have built over decades from these hubs underpins our outlook and gives United access to revenues and profitable flying others simply do not have or have not been able to replicate. The United Next fleet growth in recent years has allowed us to unlock the true value in our hub system, which you can see from our results today. Unique aircraft cabin and capacity plans continue to be a driver of our strong revenue performance, particularly as demand for premium products remains elevated. For example, domestic premium revenue grew 13% year-over-year in Q4, over double the rate of coach, another data point validating our strategy. While we remain focused on monetizing our growing premium capacity, we also remain committed to Basic Economy. Domestic Basic Economy revenue was up nearly 20% in the fourth quarter versus last year. Correcting a gauge deficits at United remains a key component of the future. We continue to believe we can add gauge to domestic flying while maintaining strong unit revenues. Since 2019, United has increased its North American gauge by 22%, while also leading in PRASM growth. For 2024, we intend to focus much of our domestic growth in our mid-con hubs in Washington, Dallas, as we had significant levels of new connectivity. This connectivity change is why we have confidence in the RASM being accretive in 2024. Diversified revenue streams across our global network remain key to our relative success as we implement our United Next plans. United's global network is a key structural advantage we will focus on in the coming years, and it differentiates us. With that, I wanted to say thanks to the entire United team and hand it over to Mike to discuss our financial results. Mike?"", 'Michael D. Leskinen', ""Thanks, Andrew, and thank you to the whole United team for closing up the year on a high note, both operationally and financially.I'm proud to report that in 2023, we delivered pretax income of $4.3 billion, a more than $3.2 billion improvement over 2022. We delivered earnings per share of $10.05 within our initial guidance range of $10 to $12, and well ahead of consensus expectations of about $6 at the beginning of the year. We achieved this despite significant industry headwinds and operational constraints that led to lower capacity.For the fourth quarter, we delivered pretax income of $845 million and earnings per share of $2, ahead of consensus and above the high end of our guidance range. Strong operational performance, robust revenue trends and a decrease in fuel prices supported these results.Fourth quarter CASM-ex was up 4.9% as we did not operate flight to Tel Aviv for the full quarter. Additionally, effective with the fourth quarter, we are now classifying certain commissions that has been classified as contra-revenue and distribution expense. This has no impact on net income or cash flow. This change added 1 point to our year-on-year fourth quarter CASM-ex and increased fourth quarter year-on-year unit revenue by 0.6 points. The change will also result in an approximate 1 point headwind to year-on-year CASM-ex in an approximate 0.6 point increase in RASM through the end of the third quarter of this year.Underlying unit costs trended favorably during the quarter as the completion factor came in better than planned due to our strong operational performance. Compared to 2019, our relative performance on CASM-ex was near the top of the industry. As Scott outlined, delivering strong relative cost performance remains critical to the successful execution of United Next.We have always ascertained the costs that are borne by the entire industry are passed along in prices with a lag. Historically, this relationship has been clear with jet fuel prices. More recently, the relationship has been clear for both higher labor and higher maintenance costs as well.Notably, our unit cost in 2023 were up 17.8% versus 2019 compared to ultra low-cost carriers unit costs that are expected to be up 25% on average. That more than 7-point cost convergence and costs occurred simultaneous with an emerging preference for United product. The top-tier operational reliability that United provides. The result is unsurprising. Our margins have dramatically and structurally improved, and we're only in the early innings of that journey. For the first quarter of 2024, we expect a loss per share between negative $0.35 and negative $0.85. While our core costs remain on track, our first quarter CASM-ex faces a few headwinds.First, the cancellations of the MAX 9 flights have reduced first quarter capacity. Due to the close in nature of these canceled assets, most of our expenses are fixed. And we also incurred additional interrupted trip expenses. We expect the combination of these items will increase CASM-ex by approximately 3 points.Second, as we mentioned that the contra-revenue reclassification in the distribution expense is the 1 point headwind.Third, the impact of new labor agreements as they annualize as an additional 3 to 4 points.And fourth, a higher volume of [engine] events and continued supply chain challenges lead to another 1 point of CASM-ex headwind.While the first 2 items I mentioned are United-specific headwinds, labor and maintenance are an industry-wide issue, and the primary drivers of the cost conversions that Scott described earlier. Most importantly, we're confident that the pace of inflation in our costs will continue to be favorable versus our historically lower cost competitors.Building off of our 2023 momentum, we expect full year 2024 earnings per share to be between $9 to $11. We are encouraged by the trends we are seeing and our United Next plan is working well. This is our guidance, but I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that our internal targets are higher. We plan to update our longer-term financial targets at our upcoming Investor Day.Looking ahead, we intend to take a different approach to guidance. As demonstrated in 2023 and just recently with the MAX grounding, we operate in a dynamic industry. With the no excuses philosophy, we intended to take United off the detailed quarterly metrics shortly after I joined and led the Investor Relations team. The pandemic interrupted those plans, but now that we're past the crisis, and as we deliver on our earnings per share target, you should expect us to remove TRASM, CASM-ex and capacity guidance and focus on earnings per share.We've provided RASM and TRASM for the first quarter, but this is likely the last time we will do so for our quarter. We will continue to provide fulsome commentary on the trends impacting our business. and we will continue to be transparent with our views of the longer-term future for both United and the industry that we're managing this business towards. We will earn your confidence by delivering bottom line results.Shifting gears to the fleet. In the fourth quarter, we took delivery of 20 Boeing MAX and 4 Airbus A321 aircraft. Looking ahead to 2024, we have a total of 107 aircraft scheduled to deliver, 31 of those being maximized. It is unrealistic at this time to believe all of those aircraft will deliver as currently planned.We also have 277 MAX 10 aircraft on order through the remainder of the decade and an additional 200 auctions for MAX 10 aircraft. We are monitoring Boeing's progress towards certification and acting closely. At this time, our current aircraft delivery schedule would lead to a total CapEx of approximately $9 billion in 2024. But given the MAX 9 grounding and the continued supply chain issues, there is a downward bias to our 2024 spend. We also expect a reduction in orders and deliveries from Boeing in 2025. This will require reworking of our fleet plan, and we will share the details when that work is complete.Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $16.1 billion in liquidity, including our undrawn revolver. Our adjusted net debt to EBITDAR was 2.9x, consistent with our leverage target of less than 3x provided at the start of the year. Managing the business towards positive free cash flow will be a top priority for our team over the coming years. Our stock is deeply undervalued, trading at less than 4x earnings despite the fact that we delivered 19.5% revenue growth and realized significant structural improvement in relative profitability in 2023.But we also understand the generating free cash flow consistently even while we execute our United Next strategy is an important component to increasing our valuation. 2023 marked the first full year of United Next plan. We are throwing some curve balls, but we adapted quickly and exited the year stronger than ever. It's clear that when customers are given a choice, they are choosing United. You can see it clearly in our revenue and margin performance relative to the industry.Finally, I'm happy to announce we will be hosting an Investor Day on May 1st in Chicago. We plan to provide an update on our progress with the United Next plan and introduce some of the United tailwinds that will drive continued margin expansion and sustainable free cash flow. I'm encouraged by our results in a relative momentum, and I'm looking forward to delivering another solid year for our employees, customers and shareholders.With that, I will pass it over to Kristina to start the Q&A."", 'Kristina Munoz Edwards', 'Thanks, Mike. We will now take questions from the analyst community. (Operator Instructions)', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) We will go to the first caller in queue. Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley.', 'Ravi Shanker', ""So maybe Scott, you said at the start that you saw pressure on your 2023 capacity and I think you kind of went through your order book and said there's downward pressure there expected as well. Does this want to make you look at the long-term United Next growth plans and kind of what can be practically achieved in the coming years? Is that something you can expect during the Investor Day?"", 'Michael D. Leskinen', ""Robbie, this is Mike. Look, the reality is that with the with the MAX grounding, this is the kind of straw that broke the camels back, with believing that the MAX 10 will deliver on the schedule we had hoped for. And so we're working through an alternate plan. We do expect our growth rate to slow in coming years.The United Next plan is firmly on track. It will take a little longer to get there. And we're working on alternate plans to see how much higher we can elevate the growth with the MAX 10 app. Now we're still counting on Boeing, and we're monitoring the MAX 10 closely, and we're rooting and we'll do everything we can to help that aircraft get certified. It's a great aircraft. But we can't count on it, and so we're working on alternate plans. The details we'll share when we have them. I hope we'll have more by the first quarter conference call, and we'll certainly have a fulsome update for you by our May 1 Investor Day."", 'Ravi Shanker', ""Very helpful. And maybe as a quick follow-up. I think you guys have said Asia can be pretty decent kind of as it comes back. I think you guys were profitable on the China routes prior to the pandemic. Correct me if I'm wrong. Do you think Asia margins can be better than before? And is that a temporary demand catch up? Or do you think that's sustainable kind of in the new normal?"", 'Andrew P. Nocella', ""It's Andrew. As we rebuilt Asia, we definitely wanted to rebuild it. So it has sustainably higher margins than it did pre-pandemic. And we've gone about that, I think, very carefully. We're back to our pre-pandemic size, which is nice at this point. And China was profitable for us pre-pandemic, although it was not our highest margin climb to be fair.As we bring it all back, our goal is to make sure that the Asia Pacific entity produces margins that are similar to that across the rest of our global network. And I think that at least in 2023, Asia Pacific is well ahead. I do expect things to move around a bit, particularly as more China flights come back online. But I think we're particularly bullish about what Asia looks like going forward. We added a lot of capacity in the quarter, we are absorbing it, and we expect in Q2 and Q3, that capacity is going to do very well. So very bullish about the long-term prospects in Asia post-pandemic."", 'Operator', 'Jamie Baker from JPMorgan Stanley.', 'Jamie Nathaniel Baker', ""Fair enough. Good morning, everybody. First one for Andrew. So you said the 20% revenue increase for Basic Economy. What can you tell us about the composition of that growth is -- with some percentage MileagePlus members trading down? Is some percentage stimulation of brand-new demand from scratch? Is some percentage share shift from LMAs. I guess the simpler question is who's driving the growth?"", 'Andrew P. Nocella', ""I think it's largely a share shift, Jamie. We developed Basic Economy numerous years ago now and have been refining how we sell it, how we distribute it and that product. And it's an important product in our lineup. We do focus a lot on premium, but we know we need to be competitive across the whole range of needs that are customers have in our hubs and that required a competitive Basic Economy product that we could do profitably.And as we look at the data, we think the biggest change here is as we've increased our gauge, we've been able to attract more and more market share across the board. But in particular, we've been able to attract more of it from some of the low-cost carriers out there. So we're really pleased with this development, and it's given us every indication that we should continue to push forward as our gauge increases, we'll be able to more effectively take on that traffic and grow our share base even more."", 'Jamie Nathaniel Baker', ""Okay. And then for Mike, it was a couple of years ago, in fact, it might have been, like, almost 2 years to the day that there were press reports that you are -- United was looking at monetizing a portion of MileagePlus. And then things subsequently went pretty quiet on that front. So a couple of questions. First is, is loyalty as important to United as it is to Delta? Delta's leading so hard into this topic on its calls. And second, any thoughts on how United or the broader industry might get investors to value this cash flow at a higher multiple? And if the answer is no, I'm happy to see the floor."", 'Michael D. Leskinen', ""Jamie, thank you. I appreciate the question. This is something I'm very passionate about. MileagePlus is a crown jewel in the businesses we have here at United Airlines. We've made some significant progress towards growing that business. We have a new leader in Richard Nunn.We have significant projects underway around data and how we can create a better customer experience and monetize that data, simultaneous. And you can expect a very fulsome update on the May 1 Investor Day. We do have ideas on how to bring the market attention up to the value and the higher premium multiple that those earnings should trade at. And we have several options, and we'll share more when we're ready to share more. But we've discussed some of those, some of those have been written about the analyst reports. And if the value is not recognized in our carriers, we will take actions to highlight that value in the future -- in the near future."", 'Operator', 'Michael Linenberg from Deutsche Bank.', 'Michael John Linenberg', ""Can you guys hear me now? Great. Just getting back to, I guess, Scott, on the issue with the MAX 10, at least, fortunately, in the case of United, you do have a choice. You're a very large operator of the Airbus product as well as the Boeing narrow-body product.As we think about the issues with supply chain and constraints across the OEM space, is there at some point where you're thinking that it's -- given the size of United that it would be prudent to consider a wide-body from another OEM. Right now, it looks like the 787 is the future for United from a wide-body perspective, but you still have that A350 order out there. Has your thinking on that changed?"", 'Michael D. Leskinen', ""Mike, thanks for the question. The A350 is an incredible aircraft. We have a significant order book for 787s right now, and we have a mix of 777 aircraft, some are relatively older and a subfleet is quite young. As we look into the 2030's, the A350 is an aircraft that we are looking at. We don't have any new news to share with you today, but the timing will be that early part of the next decade."", 'Michael John Linenberg', ""Great. And then just a quick follow-up back to what Jamie brought up on Basic Economy, the 20% increase is obviously pretty significant. But last quarter, you were up 50%. And the question is, is that just a function of a more difficult comp? Or did you actively pull back on inventory of Basic Economy just given the surge that we've seen on the cost side? And back to your point about sort of trying to maintain that gap between CASM and RASM?"", 'Andrew P. Nocella', ""It's Andrew. No, we didn't pull back on it for that reason. And remember, these are year-over-year comps, but you have to consider the math of what we did last year. We're very bullish about Basic. We're also very bullish about the premium. And the point is, we have a really great diversified revenue stream across all of our cabins as we try to decommoditize our product. We are really hopeful that we'll continue to drive increasing volumes in basic it seems to be having the appropriate P&L effect at United and competitive effect across the industry. So it's something we want to do more of, not less of. And so you should expect that."", 'Operator', 'Conor Cunningham from Melius Research.', 'Conor T. Cunningham', ""I'm a little confused on the comment between -- on the link between CASM and RASM. I would have thought that would have been the case before. So I'm just trying to understand what's changed. Is it that you're being -- like just better at predicting outcomes? Or is it really more of an industry comment that you're trying to drive from here?"", 'J. Scott Kirby', ""It's really an industry comment. In the past, if United had -- if any airline, including United, had CASM going up, while others had CASM going down, the price is the lowest common denominator. So it's an industry comment. As industry -- just like fuel. Anything that affects the whole industry is a pass-through. If it affects one airline, it's not, but if it affects all airlines, it's a pass through, that was -- we were sitting in this room a year ago, and maybe we didn't do it articulately, but that was the point we were trying to make, and that is exactly what happened. And it is what's going to happen going forward."", 'Conor T. Cunningham', ""Okay. I appreciate that. And then it was a little unclear in the prepared remarks. I'm just trying -- does your outlook for costs include accruals for open labor contracts? And just what are the risks that you see for the cost plan in 2024?"", 'Michael D. Leskinen', 'Conor, this is Mike. We include our expectations for all labor agreements in our pace.', 'Operator', ""Catherine O'Brien from Goldman Sachs."", ""Catherine Maureen O'Brien"", ""Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for the time. I might stick with the cost side, just following on Conor's quickly here. Versus your low single-digit ex-MAX impact CASM-ex guide for the first quarter. How do we think about the puts and takes through year-end versus that level of CASM-ex inflation?Before today, I was originally assuming growth would decelerate over course of the year, but CASM-ex comp fees, each quarter in my model ended up looking pretty similar on a year-over-year basis, ex-MAX impacting the 1Q. Is that a fair way to think about it? Or is there more lumpiness than that, that I'm missing? And then I guess, just to put a finer point on one question, does 1Q and full year EPS include any flight attendant accrual?"", 'Michael D. Leskinen', ""So Catie, let me take the last question first. We include our expectations for labor agreements in our guidance. Full stop.Regarding CASM trends in Q2 and 3 and 4, you would expect the MAX headwind to go away. We do think we're getting closer to seeing that aircraft fly. Again, you would see some United-specific tailwinds with some gauge increase, although with slowing deliveries, that gauge increase in '24 will be less than we would have expected. You will see continued pressure from labor of about 3 to 4 points. That's an industry headwind for CASM-ex, not unique to United. We expect it will lead to higher TRASM to offset, but you should continue to see that we will lap the majority of that as we enter into the fourth quarter.And then maintenance headwind of about 1 point, that's going to be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. As I sit here today, I think it's about 1 point in each of the quarters. this year. At some point, the supply chain will fix itself in aerospace, but we don't see that today. And I think it probably takes well beyond 2024. So you should think about -- to summarize, you should think about the labor and maintenance headwinds as being persistent."", ""Catherine Maureen O'Brien"", ""Got it. Very clear. And maybe just sticking with you, Mike, the $9 million CapEx figure that's tied to your contractual commitments, unless I've got that wrong. Even as of your last 10-Q before the MAX grounding, you were expecting 17% less aircraft than the contractual amount. I guess there's probably more downside reset today, given what's going on with the MAX, but in order of magnitude, does that delta between expected and contractual deliveries largely flipped how we should think about downside risk on a dollar basis versus that $9 billion?"", 'Andrew P. Nocella', ""That delta between contractual and expected is growing. And we don't know exactly where it's settled yet. That's what we're working through now. and we are working on an alternate strategy to mitigate some of the loss in growth. But yes, as you're thinking about CapEx coming below $9 billion this year, and the trajectory for maybe lower than what you would expect CapEx in '25 and beyond. That's how you should think about it."", 'Operator', 'Scott Group from Wolfe Research.', 'Scott H. Group', ""So Mike, I totally get your message that the plan is fluid and flexible. But as it stands today, I'm just wondering, do you think RASM is going to be positive this year? And then maybe just -- can you help us just think about shaping the year a little bit. So if I look at last year, had a pretty massive second quarter and then moderation in the second half of the year. Are you thinking a similar shape or maybe more back half weighted? Any color there would be helpful."", 'Michael D. Leskinen', ""Scott, I'll kick it off and say, yes, we think TRASM for the year will be positive, but the details will come from Andrew."", 'Andrew P. Nocella', ""Well, we're not giving exact guidance here other than, yes, we're very bullish on the year. I think I laid out a business case where domestic is starting the year incredibly strong. I think we've laid out a business case for where we're going to do with trans-Atlantic capacity. And I do expect Asia capacity to step down materially as we head into Q2 and then Q3, which is obviously going to bolster those numbers, too. So I remain bullish on the year."", 'Scott H. Group', ""Mike, I don't know if you had any thoughts on shaping the year for us, if you have any color. And then maybe just my other follow-up just for Andrew. Just on the point about domestic and international margins converging a little bit this year. Maybe just -- I just want to make sure I'm understanding it. Is this domestic getting better in international a little less good? Or is it they're both improving, but domestic is improving more? Just any additional color there would be great."", 'Andrew P. Nocella', ""Look, I think we're seeing -- I hate to say the word exceptional, but we're seeing really good strength in domestic right now, and I expect that's going to narrow the gap. International margins are well ahead of domestic margins in 2023, and they'll continue to be well ahead of domestic margins in 2024. But I do think that gap will narrow a bit based on the RASM outlook that I'm looking at, again, which is pretty darn good for domestic.Yes. Maybe I'll take the seasonal shape in as well. We're working very diligently to make Q1 a more profitable quarter for United. I think we are well on our way prior to the MAX grounding. And obviously, if you take that out, you can use that to update the estimates as to where we would have been in Q1, we made a lot of changes to how we fly in Q1, and we didn't talk about all those details. But when I look at our RASM trends, particularly in domestic, I am now confident that all those changes had the desired effect.As we continue to build and make sure that in the future, Q1 can -- well, it won't ever be our best quarter to be blunt, that it will be a much better relative quarter. But our global network, I have to say in Q2 and Q3 really stands out, and we expect it to be stellar again over those 6 months in 2024."", 'Michael D. Leskinen', ""Scott, just specifically asking about the shape of our quarterly earnings through the year. It's going to look like a normal seasonal pattern, albeit with a slightly bigger loss in the first quarter due to MAX 9 grounding."", 'Operator', 'Helane Becker of Cowen.', 'Helane Renee Becker', ""Great. So here's my 2 questions. The first question is, as you think about 2026 margins, and maybe you'll update us on May 1, how do we bridge from the roughly 8% at year-end '23 to, say, 12% to 14% in 2026?"", 'Michael D. Leskinen', ""Helane, thanks for the question. And we will update our longer-term margin targets at Investor Day. But the tailwinds that we expect from the United Next strategy, from the gauge, from the connectivity, from preference to fly United, we have proven, it used to be -- it was a strategy on a piece of paper. We have proven that it's working.And so as we think about '24, deliveries being a little less than '25 and '26, of reaccelerating into that United Next strategy, we see just continued momentum. And so as for the specific level of 12% to 14% pacing, we're going to have to update you on May 1st. But the strategy is working, and we're very confident in an upward trajectory to both earnings and margin."", 'Helane Renee Becker', ""Okay. And then just for my follow-up. Your -- I think, United Next targets, and obviously, you'll update them again, I suppose, $25 billion of adjusted net debt as of the end of last year, less than $18 billion for 2026. But the other thing is, how should we think about financing, let's just say, $9 billion is off the table for this year. Let's bring it down to $6 billion or $7 billion plus debt paydown. Like, how should we think about you getting to your target leverage over the next 1 to 3 years given the CapEx program, which might be $7 billion this year, but it might be $9 billion or $8 billion or $10 billion, '25 or '26."", 'Michael D. Leskinen', 'Yes. Let me try to give you a high-level view, Helane, and we can dig into more details in the future. But as I sit here today and I think about the changes in CapEx related to the delay in deliveries, I expect free cash to cover our CapEx in most years, if not all years.And as far as additional paydown of the balance sheet, we would expect that as our margins grow into that low double-digit low-teen area that free cash flow will be quite positive, allowing us to pay down that debt. Now the pacing will be dependent on how much that CapEx profile changes and how quickly we get to what we think is that on long run, higher level of margin.', 'Operator', 'Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore.', 'Duane Thomas Pfennigwerth', 'Just a couple for me. On international inbound, so basically international point available to the U.S. As you look across your network, how recovered is international inbound? How do you think about that growth of that demand set in 2024? And are there any markets that stick out from a recovery had room potential?', 'Andrew P. Nocella', ""Sure, Duane, it's Andrew. What I would say is during the entire recovery, U.S. outbound has been a stronger component of the traffic, really across the board, across the entire globe, and that continues today I think origin Europe, particularly core Europe, Germany continues to trail as well as Japan and Australia. And so we'll continue to monitor that. But the U.S. consumer has made up the difference in most regions of the world quite effectively and has resulted in very strong results over the last year.So I think the outlook is strong. But when the inbound customer profile starts to rebound, I think that's just further upside in the future. It hasn't happened consistently across the globe, but we'll see what 2024 brings."", 'Duane Thomas Pfennigwerth', 'Okay. Just following up there. Any specific markets, maybe San Francisco, Asia inbound. Any more kind of bullish recovery thoughts there?', 'Andrew P. Nocella', ""San Francisco is going to be very unique over the next 6 to 9 months. There is a significant amount of runway construction going on in San Francisco that has dramatically limited our ability to fly there. It's also consistent with a slower recovery in that city. So I think that is actually probably okay. But you will see us fly a much reduced domestic schedule in San Francisco, the international flying continues to be very strong. But the smaller domestic schedule, combined with where we are in the recovery, I think it's going to be just fine for San Francisco. In terms of profit contribution, in San Francisco, Asia continues to perform exceedingly well."", 'Operator', 'That will be Andrew Didora from Bank of America.', 'Andrew George Didora', ""So Andrew, I guess you mentioned this a little bit in your prepared remarks, but we've been hearing and seeing some data on corporate travel getting a bit better as well. Can -- could you maybe dig in and speak to maybe any particular markets or verticals where you see any sort of outsized corporate growth? And have you seen this corporate growth sort of broadening out to make it maybe at a more sustainable level today than at other points in the recovery?"", 'Andrew P. Nocella', 'Sure. We\'ve all sat on calls and predicted the recovery of business graphic more times than I can count over the last few years. And I will say, Q4 was okay. It wasn\'t spectacular in any way. But as we started January in the new budget season for all of our big corporate clients, we did notice a significant step-up.So it\'s really early. It\'s only been a few weeks, and I hesitate to say, ""Oh my gosh, it\'s fixed."" Because it\'s still well behind where it should be relative to GDP growth, of course, but look, it\'s a really nice step up. We\'re seeing close in yield gains as well that result from that. And I think that\'s one of the reasons our domestic RASM outlook is as strong as it is. And so hopefully, that continues. At the end of the quarter, of course, we\'ll report on that and let you know how it looks. But at least for the first 2 weeks of January, we\'ve gotten off to a really strong start, and it gives us increasing signs that this is going to be, I think, a very good year.', 'Andrew George Didora', ""Got it. That's helpful. And then for my second question, Mike, you have obviously a lot of talk on the call just on your real future free cash flow potential. Just when you're looking at your free cash flow, when do you anticipate you will become a cash taxpayer?"", 'Michael D. Leskinen', ""Andrew, I think it's a few years off still, let me get with my treasurer, Pam Hendry, and follow up with you all on the precise year. It does depend on -- are -- it does depend on how CapEx moderates, and it depends on that profitability, but it's still a few years off."", 'Operator', 'Brandon Oglenski from Barclays.', 'Brandon Robert Oglenski', ""Just keep it to one here at the end of the call. But maybe Scott or Mike, I mean coming back to the context that your stock is trading like 3 or 4x P/E probably for the second year here, and also giving you guys credit because I know a lot of us didn't think you could hit those United Next targets so many years out. But you are guiding to roughly flat margins at the midpoint this year. And I think what investors are worried about is things you can control or at least perceived control like costs that are going up for the industry here.Is this just a continued view that United is going to decouple from industry trends where you're going to be able to drive margin premium? And I guess what can you give investors confidence that, that is the path forward here?"", 'Michael D. Leskinen', ""Thanks, Brandon. Look, I think that it's a structural change in the industry, and we see a ton of evidence in this year, and I think eventually, the investment community, we'll see it as well. But there is -- an industry that has operated as a commodity industry and United and one of our legacy peers have clearly differentiated ourselves from the path. And that's leading customers to choose to fly our airlines, it's leading to the majority, if not all, of the revenue growth in the industry accruing to those 2 airlines, and that is happening simultaneous with cost convergence.That cost convergence, the whole reason that the low-cost carriers existed was for -- is because they had lower costs. Those lower costs no longer exist. And so that creates, I think, a permanence to the higher margin, a sustainability to that higher margin. And where that settles, we still -- (inaudible) exactly where that us. But it is higher and more stable and more resilient and that is not recognized by the capital markets today."", 'Operator', 'David Bernstein from -- David Vernon from Bernstein.', 'David Scott Vernon', ""So Andrew, I'd like to get some help from you if you can, in terms of helping to think through how some of the negative margin capacity that's going to be forced out of the industry is going to impact your fare ladder. Beyond the upward pressure sort of general maintenance, I'm just trying to like understand if we see a bunch of basic capacity rationalized because some of these negative margin unbundled carriers have to take capacity out.Is that -- how is that going to impact sort of basic fares versus economy fares, anything you could give us to help translate that impact of capacity shift into what sort of impact it's going to have on your fare ladder would be really helpful."", 'Andrew P. Nocella', ""I mean I think that's probably a lot more detail than I can do on a conference call, to be honest. But just generally, unproductive capacity has been leaving the system. I think that's been good for the system and good for United. And so we'll manage our RM like we normally do to take advantage of all of the opportunities.But I just want to reiterate that our choice to diversify our revenues at the top of Polaris and at the bottom of Basic Economy is not something we're going to be giving up on. The Basic Economy is an important part of the airline. It is what our customers want. We will continue to provide choice. And we expect to provide more and more of it as our gauge increases. The competitive dynamics are what they are, I can't predict them. I only really can talk for United, and we'll obviously maximize our returns and do the right thing.But again, the diversified revenue streams that we're putting out there are really working for us across not only the fare ladder but our geographic dispersion of our flying. And so we couldn't be more pleased with our revenue results quarter after quarter, by the way, not just in Q4 and not just last year, and the outlook we have. If the industry is dynamic, it's always changing, we'll change with it. But it is, I think, a good time to be at United Airlines and be an investor in United Airlines."", 'David Scott Vernon', ""And are you seeing any sort of benefit yet from some of that capacity rationalization as you look forward into to forward bookings? Or do you think that's something that's going to develop as we get through the year?"", 'Andrew P.

I was wondering if you could talk a bit more from a consumer perspective. There's been some talk just about all the capacity across the Atlantic next summer. Do you see any impact on ticket prices? Do you see them going down or up, just given all that?"", 'Andrew P. Nocella', ""David, what I would tell you is that we're prepared for an incredibly strong summer. We -- as I've said numerous times, we decided to go slow this year. We've tilted more of our capacity, particularly in Q1 to Southern Europe. And that's probably what I would say the biggest change is -- what we see with the consumer is that destinations in Spain and Italy have become more year-round destinations than seasonal. And that is new post-pandemic and we're reacting to it and moving more and more capacity out of Northern Europe, out of London Heathrow or Germany and into Southern Europe, and we'll probably do more of that again next year.In terms of the price points, I'm not going to exactly predict that at this point. We don't really talk about pricing. But I would just say, we expect a really strong summer across the Atlantic. Our capacity is not growing materially.

The approach reflects the rise of curated wellness routines, which have gained steam on TikTok (#WellnessRoutine has nearly 190 million views on the platform).', '“Guests will find impactful wellness displays and endcaps throughout the store featuring dozens of wellness brands, from Lemme gummies to Bloom Nutrition,” said Cassandra Jones, senior vice president beauty and essentials at Target. “At the front of stores, guests will see a curated wellness destination, so they can easily shop top items across categories, including All in Motion activewear in colorful new hues that perfectly match a mix-and-match exclusive assortment of Stanley Tumblers and Bala Bangles. ”', 'In addition to Stanley cups and Bala Bangles, the retailer plans to emphasize nonalcoholic beverages from brands like Ghia, and beauty products from celeb-backed companies like Gwyneth Paltrow’s good.clean.goop, which recently launched, and Ashley Tisdale’s Being Frenshe.', '“Wellness has been redefined to encompass a more holistic way of living — and it’s also different for every person,” said Rick Gomez, executive vice president and chief food, essentials and beauty officer at Target, in a statement. “That’s why Target is delivering like no other retailer, offering guests the ultimate destination to support their wellness journey, whether that’s enjoying a nonalcoholic beverage from Sechey or stocking up on Bloom to get their daily greens.

Women’s health is a key area for growth within the supplements category, Jostein Solheim, chief executive officer of Unilever’s health and well-being division, previously told WWD.', '“We see an opportunity with proteins, greens and supplements to ensure that our guests are feeling seen and celebrated,” Jones said. “Whatever they need to confidently nurture themselves, it’s our goal to offer it at Target and at an affordable price, and this year we’re leaning heavily into the supplements area.”', 'As Target launches more wellness products, it is rearranging how consumers shop by launching specific wellness destinations in-store and online, similar to what Ulta Beauty has done over the past few years with its The Wellness Shop, which the retailer has continued to expand to additional doors. Other retailers, including Walgreen’s and Sephora, have also doubled down on wellness, expanding product offerings and creating specific in-store sections.', 'Online, the wellness initiative will live within “Health & Wellbeing,” and be broken down into key categories consumers can shop, including Exercise & Fitness, Vitamins & Supplements and Nutrition & Weight Management. On this hub, customers can also find discounts and content, like meal inspiration.', 'Target is also tapping into pet wellness and nontoxic products, with offerings that meet the Target Clean standards (and are formulated without chemicals of concern). The Target Clean symbol will denote these products both in-store and online. In stores, wellness displays will be featured throughout to highlight specific wellness categories and offerings.']"

And finally, we will host a question-and-answer session.And with that, I will turn it over to Gary."", 'Gary S. Guthart', ""Thank you for joining us today. I'll touch on our performance last quarter and for the full year 2023 and share our perspective on 2024. The past year was a good one for Intuitive with use of our platforms growing nicely, hospitals building additional system capacity to support that growth and increased average utilization per system per year for each of our platforms. Our teams have been delivering to meet customer demand, driving quality and availability improvements, running clinical trials and readying new products and services for the market. We'll touch on a few of those efforts on this call. Starting first with procedures. Growth for the full year was 22%. Areas of strength included general surgery in the United States, and regional performance in countries, including Germany, France, the U.K. and Ireland, to name a few. In the U.S., general surgery procedure growth was led by cholecystectomy, with foregut procedures rising as well. Colon and hernia procedure growth was also healthy for the year. Bariatric procedures grew year-over-year. However, we saw a continued deceleration of growth throughout 2023, likely the result of the uptake of GLP-1 drugs for obesity. Procedure growth outside the United States diversified beyond urology with nice growth in categories, including gynecology and general surgery. In flexible robotics, Ion procedures showed continued strength with 129% growth for the full year. ASP procedure growth was accretive in the year with 48% growth over full year driven by acceleration in the United States. On the capital front, we placed 1,313 multiport systems in the full year '23 compared with 1,241 multiport systems in 2022. Ion placements for the year were 213 versus 192 prior year, and SP placements were 57 for the full year versus 23 systems in the prior year. Globally, placements were strong in the United States and Japan in the year.The use of flexible financing arrangements was substantial in the quarter, particularly in the United States, as customers seek to build capacity balance their da Vinci system portfolios to improve access, and lastly, to allow flexibility to upgrade to future systems. Jamie will take you through placement dynamics in more detail later in the call. System utilization, defined as procedures per installed clinical system per quarter grew 9% globally year-over-year for our multiport platform, reaching a new high as customers adopt a broad mix of procedures on our systems. Utilization grew 15% for SP in the year, while it grew 6% for Ion over 2022. Utilization is an important indicator of customer health because it is correlated to patient demand, care team satisfaction and hospital financial health. The above performance reported revenue of $7.1 billion for the year, 14% growth over '22. Our capital and operating expenses were on the upper end of our spend guidance reflecting continued investments in R&D to support growth of our platforms and digital tools, expansion of our manufacturing and commercial footprints and capital amortization. Product margins were challenged in the full year as a result of higher-than-expected costs, primarily for our newer platforms. Jamie will take you through our financial performance in greater detail later in the call. Strength in procedures, growth in the clinical installed base and increased utilization signaled continued belief by our customers that our platforms make a difference in their efforts to pursue the quadruple aim. Better outcomes, better patient experiences, better care team experiences and lower total cost to treat per patient episode.As we look to 2024, I'd like to share with you that we have submitted to FDA our 510(k) application for our next-generation multiport platform, da Vinci 5. Our design priorities for our new platforms are as follows: First, we look for opportunities to bring better minimally invasive care to more patients. Second, we work to improve the performance of our platforms and existing procedures. Third, we seek to improve care team satisfaction through product utility, dependability and usability improvements. And finally, we strive to help lower the total cost to treat per patient episode. Once cleared, we believe da Vinci 5 will make a positive impact on each of these objectives through hundreds of design changes that respond to surgeon and care team inputs and fulfill our design priorities. As just one example, da Vinci 5 possesses 4 orders of magnitude greater processing power than our Generation 4 products. That means 10,000x the processing power to gather data, improve sensing and deliver better digital and analytic performance.Given the sophistication of the technologies involved, we plan a phased launch in the first several quarters after clearance, giving us time to mature our supply and manufacturing processes for the new system. da Vinci 5 will join our existing robotic surgical system portfolio alongside multiport systems, X and Xi, and single-port system SP, offering surgeons and hospitals their choice of highly capable, proven solutions from Intuitive. We have been in communication with FDA on da Vinci 5 for the past several quarters and have completed a comprehensive multicenter IDE trial. This trial finished accruing patients in May of 2023, and we submitted for our 510(k) to FDA for da Vinci 5 in August last year. We are currently responding to FDA's questions. The timing of the U.S. launch will depend on the time required to resolve these questions. So far, we believe the questions asked fall within normal expectations for a submission of this type.In addition to FDA, we have initiated conversations on da Vinci 5 with regulators in Japan and in Korea, and we'll report our progress towards commercialization in countries outside the United States as we know more. Once FDA cleared, we will communicate features and benefits in greater depth. We started 2023 focused on increased adoption of our priority procedures in countries through outstanding training, commercial and market access execution. We pursued expanded indications and launches for Ion and SP. We focus on excellence and continuity of supply, product quality and services provision as we emerge from pandemic stresses. And finally, we pursued increased productivity in our functions that benefit from scale. Taken together, our team made good progress against these objectives.As we enter 2024, our company priorities are as follows: First, we'll focus on innovation through expanded indication and launches of our new platforms by region, including our first phase of da Vinci 5 launch once cleared. Second, we'll pursue increased adoption for focused procedures by country through training, commercial activities, and market access efforts. Third, we will drive quality and gross margin improvements. And finally, we continue to focus on increasing our productivity, particularly in functions that benefit from industrial scale.I'll now turn the time over to Jamie."", 'Jamie E. Samath', 'Good afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis and will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website.Q4 and 2023 revenue procedures and system placements are in line with our preliminary press release of January 9. I will briefly review full year 2023 performance before describing our Q4 results in greater detail. 2023 procedures grew by 22% as compared to last year, or 17% on a 4-year compound annual growth rate basis. As we have discussed on previous calls, 2023 procedure growth was above our longer-term trend, primarily because of the need to address patient backlogs.During the year, we placed 1,370 systems with customers, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Excluding trading transactions, net new system placements for 2023 grew by 23% over the prior year, with the U.S. up 26%, driven primarily by customer need for additional capacity. Trading volumes declined by 105 systems to a total of 240 trading transactions for the year. Recurring revenue which is correlated to ongoing use of our products represented 83% of total revenue and grew 21% over the prior year. Total revenue of $7.1 billion increased 14% and for the first time, our advanced instrument portfolio of stapler and energy devices exceeded $1 billion in revenue, growing 21% in 2023.During the year, we repurchased $416 million of our stock or approximately 1.7 million shares at an average price of $241 per share. We have a remaining authorization to repurchase our shares of $1.1 billion. Given these results, pro forma earnings per share for 2023 grew 22% as compared to last year.Turning to Q4. Our core metrics were strong. da Vinci procedures grew 21%. The installed base of systems grew 14% to 8,606 systems, and average system utilization continues to be above long-term trends, increasing by 9% for the full year of 2023. Higher system utilization reflects both a higher mix of shorter duration benign procedures and the need to address patient backlogs.In Q4, U.S. procedures grew 17%, driven by growth in general surgery. Our U.S. procedures grew 29%, driven by strong performance in China, the U.K., Germany and Japan, with notable strength across multiple OUS markets in general surgery which grew 44% in Q4. As a reminder, procedures in China in the fourth quarter of last year were adversely impacted by increasing COVID cases, resulting in negative growth in Q4 of 2022.Turning to capital. We placed 415 systems in the fourth quarter, 12% higher than the 369 systems we placed in the fourth quarter of last year. In the U.S. we placed 209 systems in Q4, 28 more than last year, driven by capacity expansion for procedure growth and higher greenfield placements at existing IDN customers. We placed 70 systems in Japan with strength driven by greenfield placements and the customer use of remaining capital budgets. Consistent with last quarter, we have seen delayed tenders and lower system placements in China due to ongoing anticorruption efforts by the government. We expect system placements in China to be at lower levels, at least through the first half of 2024. Globally, there were 51 trading transactions in the quarter as compared to 110 last year. As of the end of Q4, there were approximately 375 SIs remaining in the installed base, 60 of which were in the U.S. Fourth quarter revenue was $1.93 billion, an increase of 17% from last year. On a constant currency basis, revenue growth was also 17%. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: Leasing represented 48% of Q4 placements compared with 42% last year. The increasing lease mix we have seen over time is primarily driven by customers in the U.S., particularly those who have acquired systems under usage-based arrangements. These arrangements provide customers greater financial flexibility to expand their robotics programs independent of capital budgets. These arrangements also incorporate technology obsolescence protection for next-generation technology. Q4 system average selling prices were $1.42 million as compared to $1.43 million last year. System ASPs were negatively impacted by regional mix, partially offset by lower trade-ins. We recognized $21 million of lease buyout revenue in the fourth quarter compared with $17 million last quarter and last year. da Vinci instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,800 compared with approximately $1,820 last year. The year-over-year decline in I&A per procedure is primarily a result of procedure mix in the U.S. given strong growth in cholecystectomy and lower growth in bariatrics and customer ordering patterns partially offset by the I&A price increase implemented mid-2023. Turning to Ion. There were approximately 16,500 Ion procedures in the fourth quarter, an increase of 108% as compared to last year. In Q4, we placed 44 Ion systems compared to 67 in Q4 of 2022 and 55 last quarter. We experienced supply challenges for our Ion catheter and vision probe and limited Ion system placements during the quarter to ensure customers could effectively launch their programs. There is strong customer demand for Ion, which contributed to backlog growth in the quarter. We are working hard and making progress to resolve these supply challenges. The installed base of Ion systems is now 534 systems, of which 214 are under operating lease arrangements.Our SP platform continued to make progress in 2023. Fourth quarter SP procedure growth accelerated to 58%. We placed 19 systems in Q4 and 57 for the year, up from 23 placements in 2022. Fourth quarter placements included 5 in Korea and 2 in Japan. Average system utilization for our SP platform grew 15% in 2023, reflecting increased usage by U.S. customers. We continue to make progress in expanding the opportunity for SP, including continued work on regulatory submissions in the U.S. for colorectal and thoracic indications and a system submission in China. In January, we received clearance for SP in Europe across a broad procedure set and are planning for a measured rollout as we build local KOLs and establish local proctoring and training capabilities. Moving on to the rest of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 68% compared with 68.2% for the fourth quarter of 2022. The year-over-year decline in pro forma gross margin reflects increased inventory reserves and a higher mix of new platform revenue that currently carry dilutive gross margins partially offset by the I&A price increase implemented mid last year.With respect to our manufacturing capabilities and capital investment plans, during the quarter, we initiated local Xi System production in China allowing us to participate in tenders that require a domestically produced system. We also completed the transfer of X System production to our East Coast hub near Atlanta, Georgia, and during 2024, we are planning to transfer Xi System production from California to our East Coast hub.Over the next 18 months, we expect to open new manufacturing facilities for da Vinci 5 and Ion system manufacturing in California and to complete line transfers for Ion and SP I&A to our Mexicali facility. We believe these activities will position Intuitive to serve our customers with best-in-class supply availability, product quality and product cost.Fourth quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 15% compared with last year, driven by increased head count and higher variable compensation. In addition, fourth quarter 2023 operating expenses included a $40 million contribution to the Intuitive Foundation. We did not make a contribution in 2022. Pro forma other income was $67.1 million for Q4, higher than $57.9 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to higher interest income.Our pro forma effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 15.9%, lower than prior quarters, primarily because of the release of certain tax reserves associated with the expiration of related statutes and a favorable earnings mix. Fourth quarter 2023 pro forma net income was $574 million or $1.60 per share compared with $439 million or $1.23 per share for the fourth quarter of last year.I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $606 million or $1.69 per share for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with GAAP net income of $325 million or $0.91 per share for the fourth quarter of 2022. Fourth quarter GAAP tax expense reflected onetime benefits of $159 million associated with an increase in deferred tax assets associated with the statutory rate increase in Switzerland and receipt of certain tax benefits associated with our Swiss operations.The adjustments. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website. We ended the year with cash investments of $7.3 billion compared with $7.5 billion at the end of Q3. The sequential reduction in cash and investments reflected capital expenditures of $435 million, partially offset by cash generated from operating activities.Let me take a moment to address the new multiple system that Gary highlighted and certain assumptions that may impact 2024 modeling. First, since we have not received FDA clearance for da Vinci 5, we cannot provide specificity on launch timing and pricing. Second, once cleared, we are planning a phased launch period over several quarters. Noting that we are at the end of the Si trading cycle and that da Vinci 5 will be in a phased rollout, we expect total trading volumes to be lower in 2024 than the prior year. Given that, and our procedure guidance of 13% to 16% growth, we also expect total system placements for 2024 to be lower than 2023.As a result of the phased rollout of da Vinci 5, we expect a higher proportion of Gen 4 systems will be leased as customers seek flexibility to upgrade to da Vinci 5 when supply allows. For those customers that prefer to purchase a Gen 4 system, we will offer a future trading right that can be exercised when there is sufficient da Vinci 5 supply. Purchase contracts containing a trading right result in a deferral of a portion of the purchase price negatively impacting systems revenue.Finally, consistent with our experience bringing 4 generations of platforms to market, new systems typically start at lower gross margins and rise over a multiyear period as we build volume and optimize design, manufacturing and supply chains. Brian will describe our gross margin guidance in more detail later in the call.Before I turn it over to Brian to discuss clinical highlights and our outlook for 2024, let me address operating margins. 2023 pro forma operating margin was 34% of revenue compared to 35% in the prior year. We expect operating margins to be under pressure in 2024, given the anticipated launch of da Vinci 5, increased depreciation expense and an adverse mix impact to gross margin from the growth in new platforms. However, as we look to the medium term, we see opportunity for operating margin expansion based on the following dynamics: One, moving to broad launching da Vinci 5, allowing customers the opportunity to upgrade their existing fleet to the latest technology; two, improving gross margin we aspire to be above the 70% level over time; and three, leveraging those functions that can take advantage of scale as we grow.Improvements to gross margin will be driven by the following actions: First, improving the product cost of new platforms, including da Vinci 5; second, growing into and eventually leveraging the incremental fixed costs from new manufacturing facilities; and third, the return of resources that have been deployed to supply continuity given the impact of the pandemic to returning to routine manufacturing and product cost reduction activities. We have the teams and capability to deliver on these efforts over the next several years. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian.', 'Brian King', 'Thank you, Jamie. Overall procedure growth for full year 2023 was 22% year-over-year compared to 18% for the full year of 2022. Overall procedure growth was comprised of 19% growth in the U.S. and 27% growth outside of the U.S. In the U.S., fourth quarter 2023 procedure growth was 17% year-over-year compared to 18% for the fourth quarter of 2022 and 17% last quarter. Fourth quarter growth was led by procedures within general surgery, with strength in cholecystectomy, colon resection and foregut procedures. As Gary noted, bariatric procedures continued to grow year-over-year, but growth moderated into the mid-single digits.Looking outside of the U.S., over the years, we have made investments in countries and international markets to support customers and their adoption of da Vinci procedures. Looking back over the past decade, OUS procedures have grown 20% on a compound annual growth basis and have consistently been accretive to total procedure growth. OUS procedures have grown from about 20% of total global procedures to now about 1/3. While market maturity and levels of adoption differ by region and country, broadly, we now see more than half of OUS growth being led by procedures beyond urology, reflecting customers\' growing adoption of general surgery, gynecology and thoracic procedures, the results of which I will highlight below. Focusing on the fourth quarter, OUS procedure volume grew 29% compared with 18% for the fourth quarter of 2022 and 24% last quarter. Growth was led by strength in colon resection followed by growth in hysterectomy and lung resection procedures. Growth in urology continued to be healthy, led by kidney procedures along with continued double-digit growth in prostatectomy.In Europe, Fourth quarter growth was led by general surgery and gynecology procedure categories. Germany, the U.K. and France procedure performance led the region. In Germany, we saw strong growth in colon resection and kidney procedures, in the U.K. from growth in hysterectomy and rectal resection and in France from growth in colorectal and lung resection procedures.In Asia, growth in the fourth quarter was led by China, reflecting a benefit from lower procedure volumes in the fourth quarter of 2022 due to COVID. In Japan, our third largest market by procedure volume, procedure growth was healthy and led by prostatectomy and colorectal procedures. We placed 70 systems in Japan reflecting the continued adoption of robotic surgery for a growing number of procedures and the availability of remaining capital budgets.India, while still in the early stage of adoption, saw continued strength in general surgery and gynecology procedures.Now turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable. However, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. In the fourth quarter, Dr. Nicola de\'Angelis from Beaujon University Hospital, along with multiple colleagues from the French Society of Parietal Surgery, Club Hernie, and French Society of Digestive and Visceral Surgery, published a systematic review and meta-analysis describing robotic surgery for inguinal and ventral hernias in surgical endoscopy. In this analysis, authors reviewed publications between September 2014 and July 2022 and published pooled outcomes comparing the robotic-assisted approach for both inguinal and ventral hernia repairs to both laparoscopy and the open approach.With regards to inguinal hernia, when compared to laparoscopy, the robotic-assisted approach was associated with a 46% lower risk of hernia recurrence. Furthermore, subjects undergoing a robotic-assisted approach were associated with a 54% lower rate of opioid use relative to the open approach. For ventral hernia repairs, the robotic-assisted approach had a 49% lower risk of conversion to open and 41% lower risk of intraoperative bowel injuries relative to laparoscopy. When comparing to an open repair for ventral hernias, the robotic-assisted approach was associated with a 3.4-day shorter length of stay, 34% lower risk of 30-day readmissions, 39% lower risk of overall complications, and more specifically, a 53% lower risk of surgical site infections.The authors concluded, ""the present systematic review and meta-analysis supports the use of robotic surgery for abdominal wall hernia repair. Pooled data analysis show improved outcomes over laparoscopy and open surgery, particularly for ventral hernia repair. Overall, these results based on 64 studies support robotic surgery as a safe, effective and viable alternative to traditional open and laparoscopic surgery for inguinal and ventral hernia repair. And may contribute to dismiss the residual skepticism and increase the interest towards this minimally invasive surgical technique"".I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2024. Starting with procedures. As described in our announcement earlier this month, total 2023 da Vinci procedures grew approximately 22% year-over-year to over 2,280,000 procedures performed worldwide. For 2024, we anticipate full year procedure growth within a range of 13% and 16%. Our overall procedure guidance range assumes that growth moderates from last year, given the elevated backlog benefit we experienced in 2023.The low end of the range assumes a modest decline in bariatric procedures along with challenges in China from increasing competition and anticorruption activities impacting capital placements, and therefore, procedure growth. We also assume there is no impact from patient backlog in the year.At the high end of the range, we assume bariatrics continues at current growth rates, and factors in China do not have a significant impact on our business. In addition, we assume any backlog of patients would decline throughout the year. Finally, we would expect that procedure seasonality will follow normalized historical patterns, resulting in a tough comparison for the first half of 2024, given the strong procedure growth in the first half of last year.Turning to gross profit. Our full year 2023 pro forma gross profit margin was 68%. In 2024, we expect our pro forma gross profit margin to be within 67% and 68% of net revenue. The lower estimate of pro forma gross profit margin in 2024 reflects the impact of growth in our newer products, and the impact of capital investments that will come on to support the growth of our business. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter-to-quarter depending largely on product, regional and trading mix impact of new product introductions and pricing.Turning to operating expenses. In 2023, our pro forma operating expenses grew 14%. In 2024, we expect pro forma operating expense growth to be between 11% and 15%. The operating expense growth reflects increased depreciation expense as we bring on new facilities and investments to drive our growth objectives. We expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between $680 million to $710 million in 2024. We expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income to total between $290 million and $320 million in 2024. With regard to capital expenditures, we expect the range to total between $1 billion to $1.2 billion, primarily for planned facility construction activities. With regard to income tax, in 2023, our pro forma income tax rate was 20.6%. As we look forward, we estimate our 2024 pro forma tax rate to be between 22% and 24% of pretax income. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Now first question will come from the line of Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Sir, your line is open now.', 'Lawrence H. Biegelsen', 'Can you hear me?', 'Gary S. Guthart', 'Yes, Larry.', 'Lawrence H. Biegelsen', ""So you can hear me. Great. Congrats on a nice end to the year here. Thanks for all the color on da Vinci 5. So obviously, a few questions on that. I'd love to start with just, Jamie, maybe a framework for how to think about the financial implications of a new system beyond 2024. Is the Xi launch a good analog from a pacing standpoint? And what are the ramifications of leasing? If a customer on the lease upgrade, will the lease get the ASP lift? We assume you'll have? And what will you do with returned Xi? And I had just one follow-up."", 'Jamie E. Samath', ""Yes. I would say the dynamics are quite different between when we launched Xi in 2014 versus where we are today. And I think the feature sets of da Vinci 5, which we haven't described I think an important context for you all, which we'll do once we have clearance. You look at relative penetration of da Vinci over that period.The extent to which leasing has changed significantly, our OUS penetration. I think there are a number of factors, Larry, where I would not use the kind of Xi ramp and progression as a reference point for how da Vinci 5 might progress. But I think that I would make any further comments on that once we get through clearance and are able to talk to you about the feature set."", 'Lawrence H. Biegelsen', 'There could be any color...', 'Jamie E. Samath', ""With respect to the lease. So I think there are a number of dynamics that in the end will motivate a customer to look at a trade even if they have an existing system under lease. If I hold everything else equal and just look at the fact that the asset is leased, I do think there is some benefit to the customer in so far as they can avoid a capital budget barrier to executing an upgrade. But I think you have to look at all of the other dynamics that we're yet to describe."", 'Lawrence H. Biegelsen', ""Okay. And then I guess on the new system, I'll try by luckier. Just lastly, do you expect the same indications on Xi upon launch? And Gary, is this more about improving outcomes in existing procedures or expanding addressable procedures?"", 'Gary S. Guthart', ""Yes. We submitted for a broad indications in the IDE trial, it was a broad indication trial. What that looks like in the end, will come down to how we answer some of the questions that come back and forth. So I'm not telling you what the endpoint is, but I can tell you what our starting point is.In terms of kind of breadth and depth, we think that it will allow for additional penetration into some of the categories we're in already and maybe an analogy is you could do some general surgery with Si, the earlier system. We had clearances there, but Xi had some product improvements and some really nice forward progress that allowed us for greater penetration depth. So there's opportunity for depth. We think over time, there's opportunity for additional indications. Those are unlikely to occur right out of the gate. And we think that there's some really nice indications to talk about or features to talk about in future calls."", 'Operator', ""We'll go to the next line. We go to Travis Steed, Bank of America."", 'Travis Lee Steed', 'Everybody, can you hear me okay?', 'Gary S. Guthart', 'Yes, Travis.', 'Travis Lee Steed', ""Maybe just high level, just like you were talking about da Vinci 5 having hundreds of design changes. When you just think about da Vinci 5 and kind of driving the quad aim, maybe just kind of talk about high level, more what you're trying to solve for with some of the design changes. What's different about da Vinci 5 versus da Vinci 4? And is it possible we could see a system in 2024? Or is it more likely in 2025?"", 'Gary S. Guthart', ""I laid out in the script kind of what our design methodology was. I am dying to tell you more about da Vinci 5, but I'll wait for clearance and for the final back and forth with FDA. So we can do that with a little more care. So that's kind of where we are. And that's it. We're excited about it. I think it is substantive. And I think some of the improvements that we can bring are going to be interesting and exciting.We are submitted, and we're in the back and forth with FDA. It is our hope that it is a '24 launch. They ultimately are the arbiters of when we get clearance. But what I'd say, based on past experience with them is that we're in a constructive conversation that we understand. And if that goes the way we want and certainly it's something we'd be excited about in '24. But I can't guarantee it because I don't have the clearance in hand."", 'Travis Lee Steed', ""That's helpful. And would you expect some sort of ASP uplift versus da Vinci 4? And maybe also talk about the manufacturing capacity, and how long will it take to get to scale on the manufacturing? And how would that look kind of versus the Xi launch? Can you do hundreds a year or thousands a year, just kind of curious where -- if that's a limiting factor and kind of the availability of these systems going forward."", 'Gary S. Guthart', ""Yes, I'll start with just a little bit of color on ASP and then I'll turn it over to Jamie. We won't call any ASP right now. We want to both get through the final clearances. What I will say is there are some differences relative to X, Xi, that make that discussion a little detailed. And it's important for it to be detailed and clear for the customer to understand what they're going to be buying. So we're going to pause that for now. With regard to manufacturing ramp, clearly, we're going to be in a phase launch. I think we'll be supply constrained in the early side of that kind of intentionally as we work through manufacturing process.But in terms of pacing of what that might feel like, Jamie, let me turn it over to you."", 'Jamie E. Samath', ""To some extent, it will obviously depend how that progresses both within our 4 walls and with our suppliers. Certainly, is several quarters. I would take several quarters to be something that's beyond the year, but I think you have to watch us make progress here, and we'll keep you updated."", 'Operator', ""And we'll go next to the line of Robbie Marcus, JPMorgan."", 'Robert Justin Marcus', ""Congrats on a really good quarter. I'm going to push my luck again. Gary, one of the things we talked about 2 weeks ago on stage was big data and the potential to integrate it into your systems. Maybe if we think about just philosophically da Vinci 5. Is this something we'll see a lot more software improvements rather than hardware improvements? I realize you're not giving specific details, but is software and the ability to add future software updates something we can be looking forward to?"", 'Gary S. Guthart', ""Yes. One of the things we talked about in the script is the increase in computational capability of the system, the rebaselining of that system. And one of the reasons for that is future programmability. Some of the things that we'll be able to bring out of the gate are pretty exciting, but it also gives us the opportunity to build on that base and sequential software releases. So it's a good pull-through, Robbie. The point you make is a good one, and we do want to pull through software capability. It will not just be software that we bring to market, but it's a starting point.Just to remind everybody back in the Xi launch period, Xi didn't have everything that we could possibly do with it at first year of launch either. It's something that as we build capability and build skill we can add to over time, and we've done that for years, we will do the same in dV 5 that is a platform upon which we can build for many years to come."", 'Robert Justin Marcus', ""Great. And maybe one for Jamie. OpEx stepping up with the new product launch, you talked about in the midterm, seeing operating margin expansion we're also seeing elevated CapEx this year, as you talked about all the manufacturing plants. Maybe addressing them both. How should we think about where all of these expenses are going, particularly in OpEx this year, R&D versus SG&A? And what types of activities in each? And then is 3 years a good time frame to think about for the midterm when we might see these spending trends moderate?"", 'Jamie E. Samath', ""Yes. Let me take CapEx first. In '23 and '24, the majority of those capital investments are for manufacturing facilities and to add manufacturing capacity in particular to our Mexicali factory. So a significant portion of the depreciation that comes with that will show up in cost of sales, and that's reflected in part in the '24 gross margin guidance. Some of it will show up in OpEx, and that will therefore be reflected in SG&A.If I look at the relative growth in R&D and SG&A in '24, I think it's relatively similar. Obviously, innovation in R&D is important to us. But you will have a little bit of an impact in '24 at least for incremental depreciation. We still see opportunity to leverage some of our enabling functions. There are some other functions that also can leverage as we scale and grow, and so we'll look to do that over the next couple of years.With respect to the kind of operating margin expansion opportunity that I described in my prepared remarks. And we said over the medium term, I'd kind of broadly say that's a 3- to 5-year horizon. We have a specific set of actions and plans that we need to execute. Those teams have those as goals. There's some variability, obviously, in terms of how they get executed and there's some interrelationship between set of actions that need to be completed. So there are dynamics there that can impact the speed at which that gets executed. And of course, we have to run our business in the meantime."", 'Operator', ""And we'll go over to the line of Rick Wise, Stifel."", 'Frederick Allen Wise', ""Everybody, and great to see the Gen 5 announcement. Maybe I'm going to go into a slightly different direction. Maybe we can get some updates and more details, more color on Ion and SP. SP, Gary, the strongest quarter ever. I'm just curious your thoughts about '24 and the next couple of years. What's next? How are you -- what are the team priorities for '24?And on the Ion side, maybe more for Jamie, you gave us some good color about demand strong and supply constraints continue. How are you thinking and what are you dialing into your thinking for '24 about resolution of the catheter and the vision probe limitations? When are you hoping that, that gets largely better result?"", 'Gary S. Guthart', ""Thanks, Rick. On the SP front, we're pleased with the step forward they took in '23. It was good. We're seeing more focused efforts in our commercial team in the U.S., which has been good. We're excited about its entry into Japan, and we're starting to see a build of activity in Japan, too. So that's been good. We expect to see it in Europe in '24, and that's another nice step. And I think that's a broader set of clinical indications as it was in Korea and Japan. So it gives us a little more freedom to operate, which is great. In the U.S., we have trials that had finished accrual and have been submitted or will be submitted soon in thoracic and colorectal that will give our U.S. customers more opportunity to use SP in a multiplatform -- multispecialty environment. So I think SP continues to be a nice build. So that looks good. And team has their marching orders and is working down that set of processes. We have a breast oncology trial that's ongoing that we're excited about also that will not make a big impact in '24, but starts to open additional opportunity for narrow access surgery thereafter. So that's kind of where we are in SP, so far, so good.I'll turn it over to Jamie and talk about Ion."", 'Jamie E. Samath', ""Not ready to be particularly specific yet on when the supply chain challenges are behind us. For catheter, you have 3 dynamics. So we had a specific supply constraint that impacted us. We are, at the same time, transferring a number of catheter lines to Mexicali. And we're doing that as the business is effectively doubling, so you're bringing on new staff, you're having to train them. So that's a real effort that takes some time. And I think there's a little bit of variability in terms of when we get to point where that's behind us. So I'm going to let us have another quarter before we talk about when that's resolved. The teams are making clear progress, but there's work still will be done. On the vision probe, I think it's a relatively simple problem for us to address. There isn't a supplier dependency within that particular area. It's really just us being able to execute, again, a line transfer as the business is doubling and the team are making great progress. But stay tuned."", 'Frederick Allen Wise', ""Got you. And just one follow-up on Gen 5 and what's next. You said, Jamie, and it makes sense that probably in the next couple of quarters or until you launch, customers probably will lean more toward the leases with an upgrade clause. If I understood you.But I was just reflecting on it, should we imagine that, that could accelerate this sort of leasing approach in the near term for Xi, and as people, I guess, preferentially, potentially possibly maybe line up to get Gen 5 and that puts them in a more favorable position. How does that all -- how are all those dynamics work? Is this good? Better for sales that this transition occurs? Or is it going to be more complicated?"", 'Jamie E. Samath', ""Well, I think the first effect is we'll see the operating lease proportion of placements increased from where it's been. And again, that's because customers are motivated to have the protection that's in those clauses so that they can upgrade da Vinci 5 when it becomes more broadly available. So that was the first kind of message we wanted to provide in terms of 2024 modeling.In terms of then how that gets upgraded, it's really a function of when does da Vinci 5 launch, which obviously we can't be specific about right now, and there's some things to work through with FDA. And then what's the period of time over which we then go from a constrained or phased launch to a full launch. And so I don't see that particularly as somehow a revenue benefit in '24. I think what we're saying is you'll have more of the placements that are leased, and therefore, that revenue is spread over time."", 'Gary S. Guthart', ""More likely to be a slight negative than a slight positive. And I think the things we've put in place for customer transparency, the ability to see it, work to mitigate the feeling of having to wait and they'll get a chance to put their hands on it and see it. But I don't see it as an accelerant."", 'Operator', ""And we'll go to the line of Adam Maeder, Piper Sandler."", 'Adam Carl Maeder', ""Congrats on a great year. I wanted to start on China and ask about the quota that went effective last summer as well as the anticorruption campaign. If I heard the commentary correct -- correctly, it sounds like you expect systems to be impacted -- system placements to be impacted through the first half of 2024. Does that mean there's some optimism that placements could get better in the back half of the year? And just any additional color on what you're seeing in that geography regarding anticorruption campaign would be very appreciated."", 'Jamie E. Samath', ""Indications so far have been that, that anticorruption effort is a year-long effort which would take us to the middle of '24. And so that's why we indicated that we would expect delayed tenders through the period in which that effort is ongoing. We don't have great visibility, frankly, beyond the first half of '24. And that's why in the prepared remarks, we said at least through the first half of '24. So yes, if that effort was to be resolved, and if things start to normalize in terms of the pace at which tenders occurred, then you could see some opportunity for that to recover. But we're not in a position where we can predict that at this point."", 'Adam Carl Maeder', ""That's helpful color, Jamie. And for the follow-up, I wanted to ask about the procedure growth guidance, the 13% to 16% for this year. Maybe you could flesh that out for a little bit, a little bit by geography, U.S. versus international. How you're thinking about that as well as, I guess, Europe versus Asia specifically. And just any color on quarterly cadence would be appreciated as well."", 'Jamie E. Samath', ""Let me start with seasonality. And I'm not going to be specific on quarterly cadence, but I do think I tried to emphasize in our prepared remarks that we believe that the first half will be a tougher comp versus last year. And so using that, the comparison from last year and then also thinking about our historical sort of cadence throughout the year, I think you can look at that history and just make an assumption on what that growth rate -- what those growth rates could be by quarter.Let's talk about factors in the procedure guidance. So those -- there's really 3 primary factors, right? You have -- we've called out bariatric growth rates, and that's primarily a U.S. factor. We talked a bit about from an OUS perspective, China, and then also backlog in the system. And so the backlog also being primarily a U.S. factor. But could still be broader.But -- so I'm not going to go into specifics as far as U.S. versus OUS. But I think I'd go back and just really center you on our comments around bariatric growth rates, right? Low end of the range assumes that there's some continued moderation in bariatric procedures and at the high end of the range that it assumes current growth rates. That there's some impact in China at the low end of the range just from the discussion that we had right now an anticorruption and how long that actually persists and then the benefit of backlog and how that will persist throughout the year."", 'Gary S. Guthart', ""In soft tissue surgery, I would just say, if you look at '23, the two primary growth drivers that we've called out is general surgery in the U.S., that grew 25% in 2023. And for OUS, beyond urology that grew 35% in '23. And at the core, we think those continue to be growth drivers for the business."", 'Operator', ""And we'll go to the next line. Go to the line of Drew Ranieri of Morgan Stanley."", 'Andrew Christopher Ranieri', ""Gary, just, maybe just broadly on da Vinci 5 and just the TAM that you kind of updated at the conference earlier this month. How are you -- could you maybe just update us maybe on how you're thinking about penetration today in general surgery, where you are with chole, hernia, colorectal bariatrics, just to help us level set because it sounds like this could be another progression in general surgery for the company? And then I had a follow-up."", 'Gary S. Guthart', ""Sure. Jamie, I'll let you take the kind of characterization of where we are in the adoption curves of general surgery, hernia, benign, chole and so on."", 'Jamie E. Samath', ""Yes. If you take a look at the U.S., and I'm going to put this in quartiles for a second in terms of where we are in the adoption curve, colorectal we're in the second quartile. Bariatrics, also the second quartile actually cholecystectomy and hernia all in the second quartile in terms of where they are along the adoption curve. And so that obviously gives us some continuing runway to grow, and that's a driver behind the U.S. general surgery growth rates that we've seen.In the international markets, by the way, just in terms of general surgery, for the most part -- in most of the larger markets, we're in the first quarter of adoption. It's early. What we're seeing is growth start to stick and those don't start to be on early growth rates. Particularly in the cancer procedures, colorectal and beyond general surgery in hysterectomy and thoracic."", 'Gary S. Guthart', ""With regard to dV 5, I won't call out what specific targeting has been. We'll talk about more about dV 5 when we get a chance to talk about clearance. We do think that it's something that can help improve outcomes in multiple places. And we look forward to talking to you about that when we have the opportunity. If you have one follow-up, Drew, I'll take the follow-up. Otherwise, we'll close the call. So Drew, you have one more?"", 'Andrew Christopher Ranieri', 'Sure. Yes. Just on da Vinci 5. Can you maybe just talk about how it might be able to improve access to hospitals. I know that you have many IDNs that have added more systems, but do you see that more as an opportunity? Or do you see just maybe better access for even smaller hospitals with having multiport systems in the portfolio?', 'Gary S. Guthart', ""Yes. Thank you for the question. We think that having a portfolio of choices makes a ton of sense for hospitals. And this will be a part of that portfolio. We talked about it in the prepared script. I ought to give people choice. Some of that choice will have to do with how they view their practice. Some of it may have to do with what their site of care looks like and feels like. So that gives us some optionality and gives our customers optionality. I think that's really healthy. So thank you, Drew. Appreciate the question.That was our last question. In closing, we continue to believe there is a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians and caregivers in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim. Better, more predictable patient outcomes, better experiences for patients, better experiences for their care teams and ultimately, a lower total cost to treat.We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and in their environment. At Intuitive, we envision a future of care that is less invasive and profoundly better where diseases are identified earlier and treated quickly so patients can get back to what matters most.Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey and we look forward to talking with you again in 3 months."", 'Operator', ""Thank you, everyone, for joining today's conference call. We do thank you for joining. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.""]"

The trouble is, that generally isn't how investing in the stock market works."", ""And while some investors try to time the market in pursuit of wealth, in reality, that strategy turns out to be much more like gambling than investing. Even if you get the timing right once, it's unlikely you'll be able to replicate that success in a way that delivers any meaningful outperformance. More likely than not, you'll miss out on the best market days because you're trying so hard to avoid the bad ones and fail to accrue a large share of the gains that you could have earned. It ends up creating a lot of complications."", ""Investing doesn't have to be that complicated. It boils down to consistently putting cash into great businesses and holding onto those stakes for three to five years at a bare minimum. Along the way you judiciously trim your losers and add to your winners, letting patience and time be your allies. These steps can help you yield steadier, more rewarding returns with time while removing the guesswork that comes with attempts to time the market."", ""If you're looking for fantastic growth stocks to buy and hold starting in 2024, here are two compelling names to consider for your buy list."", ""Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG) is a leader in surgical robotics, with its oldest system first approved over 20 years ago. Since that time, Intuitive Surgical's lineup of products has evolved as the adoption of robotics for minimally invasive surgery has expanded globally, and the incorporation of intertwined technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) looks poised to revolutionize this space in the years ahead."", 'Intuitive Surgical makes money in several ways. Its largest stream of revenue comes from recurring sales of instruments and accessories that accompany its systems. The company can earn as much as $3,500 in instruments and accessories revenue from each procedure performed using one of its surgical systems; the instruments can be used from 12 to 18 times before they must be replaced.', ""System sales are its second-largest source of revenue; a single robotic surgery suite can range in price from $500,000 to $2.5 million. Intuitive Surgical's customers (i.e., hospitals) purchase its systems via traditional sales or sales-type lease arrangements with fixed, upfront, or usage-based payments."", 'The company also earns money from services it sells to clients, and operating leases. Intuitive Surgical charges annual fees of $80,000 to $190,000 per year per system for service contracts. Its diversity of its revenue sources -- and its focus on recurring revenue sources -- have made it a profitable, cash-rich business. And it continues to dominate the surgical robotics space, generating profits of $1.2 billion in the first nine months of 2023 alone.', 'In its preliminary results for the fourth quarter and full 2023, Intuitive Surgical reported revenues of $1.9 billion and $7 billion, respectively. Those figures would equate to increases of 17% and 14% year over year. Those preliminary figures also reflected a 22% increase in da Vinci procedures performed in 2023 from the prior year (partly due to the resumption of procedures in key markets like Asia) and an 8% increase in da Vinci systems installed for customers.', 'Share prices of Intuitive Surgical are up about 50% over the last year and 12% since the start of 2024. Its solid business model, robust balance sheet, and strong foothold on its core target market are just several green flags for this business that could induce investors to open a position in the near future.', ""Upstart (NASDAQ: UPST) has had a rough several quarters -- let's get that out in the open first. The stock itself is up by about 100% over the past 12 months, partly because of short-selling by pessimistic investors and partly due to the fact that there is still interest in the future of the business, among other reasons."", ""Upstart uses AI and machine learning to inform more accurate, inclusive, and risk-favorable lending decisions. Its platform assesses more than 1,500 variables and leverages data on millions of repayment events to assess each person's creditworthiness instead of only relying on Fair Isaac's FICO score model. This accomplishes two goals: First, it gives lenders access to a wider swath of prospective borrowers, and second, it broadens credit access to consumers who had difficulty getting loans (or loans at reasonable rates) in the past because of how they were graded by the FICO model."", ""The current uncertain economic environment has meant that Upstart has had to carry more loans than usual on its balance sheet in recent quarters. Normally it approves the loans and then hands them off to a lending partner (various credit unions and banks) within six months, collecting a fee from the partner. Partners have been more hesitant of late to take on some of the loans. Also, there have been fewer loan applicants because of increased interest rates. Then there is the fact that Upstart's platform is constantly fine-tuning its assessments of the lending risks attached to the current macro environment as well as individual applicants, and fewer loans are being approved."", ""As a result, Upstart's top and bottom lines have taken a nosedive. Upstart was still carrying about $975 million in loans on its balance sheet as of the end of its most recently reported quarter. To remain solvent, it secured multiple funding agreements in 2023. Through the first nine months of 2023, Upstart funded about 13% of loans, while 53% were purchased through institutional investors and the remaining 34% were funded by the originated lending partners. Revenue for the third quarter totaled $135 million and adjusted earnings before taxes, interest, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) totaled approximately $2.3 million."", ""Upstart's core competitive advantage is its unique lending model. Loan approvals are expected to rise again once economic and consumer risk lessens. The company had 100 banks and credit unions in its partner network at last count, compared to just 10 when it went public in December 2020. Its auto lending software is used by enough auto dealers that it effectively has access to about 70% of the U.S. population. With 88% of all loan applications it processes being automated (a record percentage for Upstart), it's increasing its operating advantage over traditional lenders."", ""Patience will continue to be warranted with this stock for the foreseeable future, and it likely wouldn't be prudent to make it a significant portfolio position. However, as an addition to a broadly diversified portfolio of stocks, Upstart stock might be too good to pass up, given the long-term potential of its business as one of the few operating at its size and scale in the multitrillion-dollar lending industry."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Intuitive Surgical right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Intuitive Surgical, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Intuitive Surgical wasn't one of them.

And with that, I will turn it over to Gary."", 'Gary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Thank you for joining us today. I'll touch on our performance last quarter and for the full-year 2023 and share our perspective on 2024. The past year was a good one for Intuitive with use of our platforms growing nicely, hospitals building additional system capacity to support that growth, and increased average utilization persistent per year for each of our platforms. Our teams have been delivering to meet customer demand, driving quality and availability improvements, running clinical trials, and readying new products and services for the market. We'll touch on a few of those efforts on this call."", 'Starting first with procedures. Growth for the full year was 22%. Areas of strength included general surgery in the United States and regional performance in countries including Germany, France, the U.K., and Ireland to name a few. In the U.S. general surgery procedure growth was led by cholecystectomy with foregut procedures rising as well.', 'Colon -- colon and hernia procedure growth was also healthy for the year. Bariatric procedures grew year over year. However, we saw continued deceleration of growth throughout 2023, likely the result of the uptake of GLP-1 drugs for obesity. Procedure growth outside the United States diversify beyond urology with nice growth in categories including gynecology and general surgery. In flexible robotics, Ion procedures showed continued strength with 129% growth for the full year.', ""SP procedure growth was accretive in the year with 48% growth over the full year driven by acceleration in the United States. On the capital front, we placed 1,313 multi-port systems in the full-year '23, compared with 1,241 multi-port systems in 2022. Ion placements for the year were 213 versus 192 prior year, and SP placements were 57 for the full year versus 23 systems in the prior year. Globally, placements were strong in the United States and Japan in the year. The use of flexible financing arrangements was substantial in the quarter, particularly in the United States as customers seek to build capacity, balance their da Vinci system portfolios to improve access, and lastly, to allow flexibility to upgrade to future systems. Jamie will take you through placement dynamics in more detail later in the call. System utilization, defined as procedures per installed clinical system per quarter, grew 9% globally year over year for our multi-port platform, reaching a new high as customers adopt a broad mix of procedures on our systems."", ""Utilization grew 15% for SP in the year, while it grew 6% for Ion over 2022. Utilization is an important indicator of customer health because it is correlated to patient demand, care team satisfaction, and hospital financial health. The above performance reported revenue of 7.1 billion for the year, 14% growth over '22. Our capital and operating expenses were on the upper end of our spend guidance, reflecting continued investments in R&D to support growth of our platforms and digital tools, expansion of our manufacturing and commercial footprints, and capital amortization. Profit margins were challenged in the full year as a result of higher-than-expected costs primarily for our newer platforms."", ""Jamie will take you through our financial performance in greater detail later in the call. Strengthened procedures, growth in the clinical install base, and increased utilization signal continued belief by our customers that our platforms make a difference in their efforts to pursue the quadruple aim: better outcomes, better patient experiences, better care team experiences, and lower total cost to treat per patient episode. As we look to 2024, I'd like to share with you that we have submitted to FDA our 510(k) application for our next-generation multi-port platform, da Vinci 5. Our design priorities for our new platforms are as follows: First, we look for opportunities to bring better minimally invasive care to more patients."", 'Second, we work to improve the performance of our platforms and existing procedures. Third, we seek to improve care team satisfaction through product utility, dependability, and usability improvements. And finally, we strive to help lower the total cost to treat per patient episode. Once cleared, we believe da Vinci 5 will make a positive impact on each of these objectives through hundreds of design changes that respond to surgeon and care team inputs and fulfill our design priorities. As just one example, da Vinci 5 possesses four orders of magnitude greater processing power than our generation 4 products. That means 10,000 times the processing power to gather data, improve sensing, and deliver better digital and analytic performance.', ""Given the sophistication of the technologies involved, we plan a phased launch in the first several quarters after clearance, giving us time to mature our supply and manufacturing processes for the new system. Da Vinci 5 will join our existing robotic surgical system portfolio alongside multi-port systems X and Xi, and single-port system SP, offering surgeons and hospitals their choice of highly capable proven solutions from Intuitive. We have been in communication with FDA on da Vinci 5 for the past several quarters and have completed a comprehensive multi-center IDE trial. This trial finished accruing patients in May of 2023, and we submitted for our 510(k) to FDA for da Vinci 5 in August last year. We are currently responding to FDA's questions."", 'The timing of the U.S. launch will depend on the time required to resolve these questions. So, far we believe the questions asked fall within normal expectations for a submission of this type. In addition to FDA, we have initiated conversations on da Vinci 5 with regulators in Japan and in Korea and will report our progress toward commercialization in countries outside the United States as we know more. Once FDA cleared, we will communicate features and benefits in greater depth.', 'We started 2023 focused on increased adoption of our priority procedures and countries through outstanding training, commercial, and market access execution. We pursued expanded indications and launches for Ion and SP. We focused on excellence and continuity of supply, product quality, and services provision as we emerge from pandemic stresses. And finally, we pursued increased productivity in our functions that benefit from scale.', ""Taken together, our team made good progress against these objectives. As we enter 2024, our company priorities are as follows: First, we'll focus on innovation through expanded indication and launches of our new platforms by region, including our first phase of da Vinci 5 launch once cleared. Second, we'll pursue increased adoption for focused procedures by country through training, commercial activities, and market access efforts. Third, we will drive quality and gross margin improvements. And finally, we continue to focus on increasing our productivity, particularly in functions that benefit from industrial scale. I'll now turn -- I'll now turn the time over to Jamie."", 'Jamie Samath -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Good afternoon. I would describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or performer basis and also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. A reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website. Q4 and 2023 revenue procedures and system placements are in line with our preliminary press release of January 9th.', ""I will briefly review full-year 2023 performance before describing our Q4 results in greater detail. 2023 procedures grew by 22% as compared to last year, or 17% on a four-year compound-annual-growth-rate basis. As we've discussed on previous calls, 2023 procedure growth was above our longer-term trend primarily because of the need to address patient backlogs. During the year, we placed 1,370 systems with customers, an increase of 8% year over year. Excluding trade-in transactions, net new system placements for 2023 grew by 23% over the prior year, with the U.S. up 26% driven primarily by customer need for additional capacity."", 'Trading volumes declined by 105 systems to a total of 240 trading transactions for the year. Recurring revenue, which is correlated to ongoing use of our products, represented 83% of total revenue and grew 21% over the prior year. Total revenue of $7.1 billion increased 14%. And for the first time, our advanced instrument portfolio of stapler and energy devices exceeded $1 billion in revenue, growing 21% in 2023. During the year, we repurchased $416 million of our stock, or approximately 1.7 million shares at an average price of $241 per share. We have a remaining authorization to repurchase our shares of $1.1 billion.', 'Given these results, pro forma earnings per share for 2023 grew 22% as compared to last year. Turning to Q4, our core metrics were strong. Da Vinci procedures grew 21%. The installed base of systems grew 14% to 8,606 systems.', 'And average system utilization continue to be above long-term trends, increasing by 9% for the full year of 2023. Higher system utilization reflects both a higher mix of shorter-duration benign procedures and the need to address patient backlogs. In Q4, U.S. procedures grew 17% driven by growth in general surgery. OUS procedures grew 29% driven by strong performance in China, the U.K., Germany, and Japan, with notable strength across multiple OUS markets in general surgery, which grew 44% in Q4.', 'As a reminder, procedures in China in the fourth quarter of last year were adversely impacted by increasing COVID cases, resulting in negative growth in Q4 of 2022. Turning to capital. We placed 415 systems in the fourth quarter, 12% higher than the 369 systems we placed in the fourth quarter of last year. In the U.S., we placed 209 systems in Q4, 28 more than last year, driven by capacity expansion for procedure growth and higher greenfield placements at existing IDN customers. We placed 70 systems in Japan with strength -- strength driven by greenfield placements and customer use of remaining capital budgets. Consistent with last quarter, we have seen delayed tenders and lower system placements in China due to ongoing anti-corruption efforts by the government.', 'We expect system placements in China to be at lower levels at least through the first half of 2024. Globally, there were 51 trading transactions in the quarter, as compared to 110 last year. As of the end of Q4, there are approximately 375 Sis remaining in the installed base, 60 of which are in the U.S. Fourth-quarter revenue is $1.93 billion, an increase of 17% from last year.', 'On a constant-currency basis, revenue growth was also 17%. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows: Leasing represented 48% of Q4 placements, compared with 42% last year. The increasing lease mix we have seen over time is primarily driven by customers in the U.S., particularly those who have acquired systems under usage-based arrangements. These arrangements provide customers greater financial flexibility to expand their robotics programs independent of capital budgets. These arrangements also incorporate technology obsolescence protection for next-generation technology.', 'Q4 system average selling prices were $1.42 million, as compared to $1.43 million last year. System ASPs were negatively impacted by regional mix, partially offset by lower trade-ins. We recognized $21 million of lease buyout revenue in the fourth quarter, compared with $17 million last quarter and last year. Da Vinci instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,800, compared with approximately $1,820 last year. The year-over-year decline in I&A per procedure is primarily a result of procedure mix in the U.S. given strong growth in cholecystectomy and lower growth in bariatrics and customer ordering patterns, partially offset by the I&A price increase implemented in mid-2023.', 'Turning to Ion. There were approximately 16,500 Ion procedures in the fourth quarter, an increase of 108% as compared to last year. In Q4, we placed 44 Ion systems, compared to 67 in Q4 of 2022 and 55 last quarter. We experienced supply challenges for our Ion catheter and vision probe and limited Ion system placements during the quarter to ensure customers could effectively launch their programs. There is strong customer demand for Ion, which contributed to backlog growth in the quarter. We are working hard and making progress to resolve these supply challenges.', 'The install base of Ion systems is now 534 systems, of which 214 are under operating lease arrangements. Our SP platform continue to make progress in 2023. Fourth-quarter SP procedure growth accelerated to 58%. We placed 19 systems in Q4 and 57 for the year, up from 23 placements in 2022.', 'Fourth-quarter placements included five in Korea and two in Japan. Average system utilization for our SP platform grew 15% in 2023, reflecting increased usage by U.S. customers. We continue to make progress in expanding the opportunity for SP, including continued work on regulatory submissions in the U.S. for colorectal and thoracic indications and a system submission in China. In January, we received clearance for SP in Europe across a broad procedure set and are planning for a measured rollout as we build local KOLs and establish local proctoring and training capabilities.', 'Moving on to the rest of the P&L. Pro forma gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 68%, compared with 68.2% for the fourth quarter of 2022. The year-over-year decline in pro forma gross margin reflects increased inventory reserves and a higher mix of new platform revenue that currently carry dilutive gross margins, partially offset by the I&A price increase implemented mid-last year. With respect to our manufacturing capabilities and capital investment plans, during the quarter, we initiated local Xi system production in China, allowing us to participate in tenders that require a domestically produced system. We also completed the transfer of X system production to our East Coast hub near Atlanta, Georgia. And during 2024, we are planning to transfer Xi system production from California to our East Coast hub.', 'Over the next 18 months, we expect to open new manufacturing facilities for da Vinci 5 and Ion system manufacturing in California, and to complete line transfers for Ion and SP I&A to our Mexicali facility. We believe these activities will position Intuitive to serve our customers with best-in-class supply availability, product quality, and product cost. Fourth-quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 15% compared with last year driven by increased headcount and higher variable compensation. In addition, fourth-quarter 2023 operating expenses included a $40 million contribution to the Intuitive Foundation. We did not make a contribution in 2022. Pro forma other income was $67.1 million for Q4, higher than $57.9 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to higher interest income.', 'Our pro forma effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 15.9%, lower than prior quarters, primarily because of the release of certain tax reserves associated with the expiration of related statutes and a favorable earnings mix. Fourth-quarter 2023 pro forma net income was $574 million, or $1.60 per share, compared with $439 million, or $1.23 per share, for the fourth quarter of last year. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $606 million, or $1.69 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with GAAP net income of $325 million, or $0.91 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2022. Fourth-quarter GAAP tax expense reflected one-time benefits of $159 million associated with an increase in deferred tax assets associated with a statutory rate increase in Switzerland and receipt of certain tax benefits associated with our Swiss operations. The adjustments -- the adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website.', 'We ended the year with cash and investments of $7.3 billion, compared with $7.5 billion at the end of Q3. The sequential reduction in cash and investments reflected capital expenditures of $435 million, partially offset by cash generated from operating activities. Let me take a moment to address the new multi-port system that Gary highlighted and certain assumptions that may impact 2024 modeling. First, since we have not received FDA clearance for da Vinci 5, we cannot provide specificity on launch timing and pricing. Second, once cleared, we are planning a phased launch period over several quarters.', 'Noting that we are at the end of the Si trading cycle and that da Vinci 5 will be in a phased rollout, we expect total trading volumes to be lower in 2024 than the prior year. Given that and our procedure guidance of 13% to 16% growth, we also expect total system placements for 2024 to be lower than 2023. As a result of the phased rollout of da Vinci 5, we expect a higher proportion of gen 4 systems will be leased as customers seek flexibility to upgrade to da Vinci 5 when supply allows. For those customers that prefer to purchase a gen 4 system, we will offer a future trading rate that can be exercised when there is sufficient da Vinci 5 supply. Purchase contracts containing a trading rate result in a deferral of a portion of the purchase price, negatively impacting systems revenue.', 'Finally and consistent with our experience bringing four generations of platforms to market, new systems typically start at lower gross margins and rise over a multiyear period as we build volume and optimize design, manufacturing, and supply chains. Brian will describe our gross margin guidance in more detail later in the call. Before I turn it over to Brian to discuss clinical highlights and our outlook for 2024, let me address operating margins. 2023 pro forma operating margin was 34% of revenue, compared to 35% in the prior year. We expect operating margins to be under pressure in 2024 given the anticipated launch of da Vinci 5, increased depreciation expense, and an adverse mix impact to gross margin from the growth in new platforms.', 'However, as we look to the medium term, we see opportunity for operating margin expansion based on the following dynamics: one, moving to broad launch in da Vinci 5, allowing customers the opportunity to upgrade their existing fleet to the latest technology; two, improving gross margin, we aspire to be above the 70% level over time; and three, leveraging those functions that can take advantage of scale as we grow. Improvements to gross margin will be driven by the following actions: first, improving the product cost of new platforms including da Vinci 5; second, growing into and eventually leveraging the incremental fixed cost from new manufacturing facilities; and third, the return of resources that have been deployed to supply continuity given the impact of the pandemic to returning to routine manufacturing and product cost reduction activities. We have the teams and capability to deliver on these efforts over the next several years. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian.', 'Brian King -- Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations', 'Thank you, Jamie. Overall procedure growth for full-year 2023 was 22% year over year, compared to 18% for the full year of 2022. Overall procedure growth was comprised of 19% growth in the U.S. and 27% growth outside of the U.S.', 'In the U.S., fourth-quarter 2023 procedure growth was 17% year over year, compared to 18% for the fourth quarter of 2022 and 17% last quarter. Fourth-quarter growth was led by procedures within general surgery with strength in cholecystectomy, colon resection, and foregut procedures. As Gary noted, bariatric procedures continued to grow year over year but growth moderated into the mid-single digits. Looking outside of the U.S., over the years, we have made investments in countries and international markets to support customers and their adoption of da Vinci procedures. Looking back over the past decade, OUS procedures have grown 20% on a compound-annual-growth basis and have consistently been accretive to total procedure growth. OUS procedures have grown from about 20% of total global procedures to now about a third.', 'While market maturity and levels of adoption differ by region and country, broadly, we now see more than half of OUS growth being led by procedures beyond urology, reflecting customers growing adoption of general surgery, gynecology, and thoracic procedures, the results of which I will highlight below. Focusing on the fourth quarter, OUS procedure volume grew 29%, compared with 18% for the fourth quarter of 2022 and 24% last quarter. Growth was led by strength in colon resection, followed by growth in hysterectomy and lung resection procedures. Growth in urology continued to be healthy, led by kidney procedures, along with continued double-digit growth in prostatectomy. In Europe, fourth-quarter growth was led by general surgery and gynecology procedure categories. Germany, the U.K., and France procedure performance led the region.', 'In Germany, we saw strong growth in colon resection and kidney procedures; in the U.K., from growth in hysterectomy and rectal resection; and in France, from growth in colorectal and lung resection procedures. In Asia, growth in the fourth quarter was led by China, reflecting a benefit from lower procedure volumes in the fourth quarter of 2022 due to COVID. In Japan, our third-largest market by procedure volume, procedure growth was healthy and led by prostatectomy and colorectal procedures. We placed 70 systems in Japan, reflecting the continued adoption of robotic surgery for a growing number of procedures and availability of remaining capital budgets. India, while still in the early stages of adoption, saw continued strength in general surgery and gynecology procedures. Now, turning to the clinical side of our business.', ""Each quarter, on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable; however, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. In the fourth quarter, Dr. Nicola De'Angelis from [Inaudible] University Hospital, along with multiple colleagues from the French Society of Parietal Surgery for Hernia and French Society of Digestive and Visceral Surgery published a systematic review and meta-analysis describing robotic surgery for inguinal and ventral hernias in surgical endoscopy. In this analysis, authors reviewed publications between September 2014 and July 2022 and published pooled outcomes comparing the robotic-assisted approach for both inguinal and ventral hernia repairs to both laparoscopy and the open approach. With regards to inguinal hernia, when compared to laparoscopy, the robotic-assisted approach was associated with a 46% lower risk of hernia recurrence. Furthermore, subjects undergoing a robotic-assisted approach were associated with a 54% lower rate of opioid use relative to the open approach. For ventral hernia repairs, the robotic-assisted approach had a 49% lower risk of conversion to open and 41% lower risk of intraoperative bowel injuries relative to laparoscopy. When comparing to an open repair for ventral hernias, the robotic-assisted approach was associated with a 3.4-day shorter length of stay, 34% lower risk of 30-day readmissions, 39% lower risk of overall complications, and more specifically, a 53% lower risk of surgical site infections."", 'The authors concluded, ""The present systematic review and meta-analysis supports the use of robotic surgery for abdominal wall hernia repair. Pooled data analyses show improved outcomes over laparoscopy and open surgery, particularly for ventral hernia repair. Overall, these results, based on 64 studies, support robotic surgery as a safe, effective, and viable alternative to traditional open and laparoscopic surgery for inguinal and ventral hernia repair and may contribute to dismiss the residual skepticism and increase the interest toward this minimally invasive surgical technique."" I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2024. Starting with procedures. As described in our announcement earlier this month, total 2023 da Vinci procedures grew approximately 22% year over year to over 2,280,000 procedures performed worldwide.', 'For 2024, we anticipate full-year procedure growth within a range of 13% and 16%. Our overall procedure guidance range assumes that growth moderates from last year given the elevated backlog benefit we experienced in 2023. The low end of the range assumes a modest decline in bariatric procedures, along with challenges in China from increasing competition and anti-corruption activities impacting capital placements, and therefore, procedure growth. We also assume there is no impact from patient backlog in the year. At the high end of the range, we assume bariatrics continues at current growth rates and factors in China do not have a significant impact on our business.', 'In addition, we assume any backlog of patients with decline throughout the year. Finally, we would expect that procedure seasonality will follow normalized historical patterns, resulting in a tough comparison for the first half of 2024 given the strong procedure growth in the first half of last year. Turning to gross profit. Our full-year 2023 pro forma gross profit margin was 68%.', 'In 2024, We expect our pro forma gross profit margin to be within 67% and 68% of net revenue. The lower estimate of pro forma gross profit margin in 2024 reflects the impact of growth in our newer products and the impact of capital investments that will come on to support the growth of our business. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter to quarter, depending largely on product, regional, and trade-in mix, impact of new product introductions, and pricing. Turning to operating expenses. In 2023, our pro forma operating expenses grew 14%.', 'In 2024, we expect pro forma operating expense growth to be between 11% and 15%. The operating expense growth reflects increased depreciation expense as we bring on new facilities and investments to drive our growth objectives. We expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between 680 million to 710 million in 2024. We expect other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between 290 million and 320 million in 2024. With regard to capital expenditures, we expect the range to total between $1 billion to $1.2 billion, primarily for planned facility construction activities. With regard to income tax, in 2023, our pro forma income tax rate was 20.6%.', 'As we look forward, we estimate our 2024 pro forma tax rate to be between 22% and 24% of pre-tax income. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.', '', 'Operator', 'Thank you. [Operator instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. OK, sir, your line is open now.', 'Larry Biegelsen -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', 'Can you hear me?', 'Gary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Yes.', 'Jamie Samath -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Hey, Larry.', 'Larry Biegelsen -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', 'Oh, you can hear me. Great. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on a nice end to the year here.', ""Thanks for all the color on da Vinci 5. So, obviously, a few questions on that. I'd love to start with just, Jamie, maybe a framework for how to think about the financial implications of a new system. Beyond 2024, is the Xi launch a good analog from a pacing standpoint? And what are the ramifications of leasing? You know, if a customer is up on lease upgrades, you know, will the lease get the ASP lift, you know, we assume you'll have? And what will you do with the returned Xis? And I had just one follow-up."", 'Jamie Samath -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah, I would say the -- the dynamics are quite different between when we launched Xi in 2014 versus where we are today. And I think the -- the feature sets of da Vinci 5, which we haven't described, I think are important context for you all, which we'll do once we have clearance. You look at relative penetration of da Vinci over that period. The extent to which leasing has -- has changed significantly our U.S."", 'penetration, I think there are a number of factors, Larry, where I would not use the kind of Xi ramp and progression as a -- as a reference point for how da Vinci 5 might progress. But I think that I would make any further comments on that once we get through clearance and are able to talk to you about the feature set. So, there is --', 'Larry Biegelsen -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', 'Do you have any color -- yeah, Jamie, please?', 'Jamie Samath -- Chief Financial Officer', ""With respect to these leases, so, I think there are a number of dynamics that, in the end, will motivate a customer to look at a trade even if they have an existing system under lease. If I -- if I hold everything else equal and just look at the fact that the asset is leased, I do think there is some benefit to the customer insofar as they can avoid a capital budget barrier to executing a -- an upgrade. But -- but I think you have to look at all of the other dynamics that we're yet to describe."", 'Larry Biegelsen -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', ""OK, and then, I guess on the new system, you know, I'll try my luck here. You know, just lastly, do you expect the same indications on -- as Xi upon launch? And, Gary, is this more about improving outcomes in existing procedures or expanding addressable procedures? Thank you."", 'Gary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah, we submitted for broad indications. And in the IDE trial, it was a broad indication trial. What that looks like in the end will -- will come down to how we answer some of the questions that come back and forth. So, I'm not telling you what the endpoint is, but I can tell you what our starting point is."", ""In terms of kind of breadth and depth, we think that it will allow for additional penetration into some of the categories we're in already. And maybe an analogy is you could do some general surgery with Si, the earlier system, we had clearances there, but Xi had some product improvements and -- and some really nice forward progress that allowed us for greater penetration depth. So, there's opportunity for depth. We think, over time, there's opportunity for additional indications. Those are unlikely to occur right out of the gate."", 'And we think that there are some really nice indications to -- to talk about in -- or features to talk about in future calls.', 'Larry Biegelsen -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', ""OK, we'll go to the next line. We go to Travis Steed, Bank of America. Please go ahead."", 'Travis Steed -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Hey, everybody. Can you hear me OK?', 'Gary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Yeah. Hi, Travis.', 'Travis Steed -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""All right, great. Maybe just high level, just like you were talking about da Vinci 5 having hundreds of design changes, when you just think about da Vinci 5 and, you know, kind of driving the quad aim, maybe just kind of talk about high level more what you're trying to solve for with some of those design changes. You know, what's different about da Vinci 5 versus da Vinci 4? And is it possible we could see a system in 2024, or is it more likely in 2025?"", 'Gary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer', ""You know, I laid out in the script kind of what our design methodology was. I am dying to tell you more about da Vinci 5, but I'll -- but I'll wait for -- for clearance and for the final back and forth with FDA, so we can do that with a little more care. So, that's kind of where we are in that set. We're excited about it."", ""I think it is substantive, and I think some of the improvements that we can bring are going to be interesting and exciting. We are submitted and we're in the back and forth with FDA. It is our hope that it is a '24 launch. They ultimately are the arbiters of when we get the clearance."", ""But what I would say, based on past experience with them, is that we're in a constructive conversation that we understand. And if that goes the way we want, then -- then certainly, it's something we'd be excited about in '24. But I can't guarantee it because I don't have the clearance in hand."", 'Travis Steed -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""That's helpful. And would you expect some sort of ASP uplift versus da Vinci 4? And -- and maybe also talk about the manufacturing capacity. You know, how -- how long will it take to -- to get to scale on the manufacturing? And you know, how would that look kind of versus the -- the Xi launch? Can you do hundreds a year or thousands a year? Just kind of curious where -- if that's a limiting factor in kind of the availability of these systems going forward. Thanks a lot."", 'Gary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah, I'll start with the -- just a little bit of color on ASP, and then -- and then I'll turn it over to Jamie. We won't -- we won't call any ASP right now. We want to both get through the final clearances. What I will say is there are some differences relative to -- to X, Xi that make that discussion a little detailed."", ""And it's important for it to be detailed and clear for the customer to understand what they're going to be buying. So, we're going to pause that for now. With regard to manufacturing ramp, clearly, we're going to be in a phased launch. I think we'll be supply constrained in the early side of that, kind of intentionally as we work through manufacturing process. But in terms of pacing and what that might feel like, Jamie, let me turn it over to you."", 'Jamie Samath -- Chief Financial Officer', ""To some extent, it will obviously depend how that progresses both within our four walls and with our suppliers. Certainly, is several quarters -- would take several quarters as to be something that's beyond a year, but I think you have to watch us make progress here and we'll keep you updated."", 'Travis Steed -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'All right, great. Thanks a lot and congrats.', 'Gary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', ""And we'll go next to the line of Robbie Marcus, J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead."", 'Robbie Marcus -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', ""Great. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on a really good quarter. I'm going to -- I'm going to push my luck again."", ""Gary, you know, one of the things we talked about two weeks ago on stage was big data and, you know, the potential to integrate it into your systems. You know, maybe if we think about just, you know, philosophically, da Vinci 5, you know, is this something we'll see a lot more software improvements rather than hardware improvements? I realize you're not giving specific details, but is software and the ability to add future software updates something we can be looking forward to?"", 'Gary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah, you know, one of the things we talked about in the script is the -- is the increase in computational capability of the system, the rebaselining of that system. And one of the reasons for that is future programmability. Some of the things that we'll be able to bring out of the gate are pretty exciting, but it also gives us the opportunity to build on that base in sequential software releases. So, it's a good pull-through, Robbie."", ""The point you make is a good one, and we do -- we do want to pull through software capability. It will not just be software that we bring to market, but it's -- it's a starting point. Just to remind everybody, back in the Xi launch period, Xi didn't have everything that we could possibly do with it at -- at first year of launch either. It's something that as we -- as we build capability and build scale, we can add to over time, and we've done that for years. We will do the same in DV 5."", 'That is a platform upon which we can build for many years to come.', 'Robbie Marcus -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', ""Great. And maybe one for Jamie. You know, opex stepping up with the new product launch, you talked about, you know, in the mid-term seeing operating margin expansion. We're also seeing elevated capex this year, as you talked about, in all the manufacturing plants."", 'Maybe addressing them both, you know, how should we think about where all of these expenses are going, particularly in opex this year, R&D versus SG&A, and what types of activities in each? And then, you know, is three years a good time frame to think about for the midterm when we might see these spending trends moderate? Thanks a lot.', 'Jamie Samath -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah, let me take capex first. In '23 and '24, the majority of those capital investments are for manufacturing facilities and to add manufacturing capacity, in particular, to our Mexicali factory. So, a significant portion of the depreciation that comes with that will show up in cost of sales, and that's reflected in part in the -- in the '24 gross margin guidance. Some of it will show up in opex, and that will therefore be reflected in -- in SG&A. If I look at the relative growth in R&D and SG&A in '24, I think it's -- it's relatively similar."", ""Obviously, innovation and R&D is important to us, but you will have a little bit of an impact in -- in '24 at least for incremental depreciation. We still see opportunity to leverage some of our enabling functions. There are some other functions that also can leverage as we scale and grow. And so, we'll look to do that over the next couple of years. With respect to the kind of operating margin expansion opportunity that I described in my prepared remarks, we said, over the medium term, I'd kind of broadly say that's a three- to five-year horizon, we have a specific set of actions and plans that we need to execute."", ""Those -- those teams have those as goals. There's some variability obviously in terms of how that gets executed, and there's some interrelationship between the set of actions that need to be completed. So, there are dynamics there that can -- can impact the speed at which that gets executed. And of course, we have to run our business in the meantime."", 'Robbie Marcus -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'Great. Thanks for the thoughts.', 'Operator', ""And we'll go over to the line of Rick Wise, Stifel. Please go ahead."", 'Rick Wise -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst', ""Hey, everybody, and great to see the gen 5 announcement. Maybe I'm going to go in a slightly different direction. Maybe we can get some updates and more details -- more color on Ion and SP. SP, Gary, the strongest quarter ever."", ""I'm just curious, your thoughts about '24 and the next couple of years. What's next, you know? How are you -- what are the team priorities for '24? And on the Ion side, maybe more for Jamie, you -- you gave us some good color about demand's strong and supply constraints continue. How are you thinking and what are you dialing into your thinking for '24 about resolution of the catheter and the vision probe limitations? When are you hoping that that gets largely better result?"", 'Gary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah, thanks -- thanks, Rick. On the SP front, we're pleased with the step forward they took in '23. It was good. We're seeing more of focused efforts in our commercial team in -- in the U.S., which have been good."", ""We're excited about its entry into Japan, and we're starting to see a build of activity in Japan too. So, that's been good. We expect to see it in Europe in -- in '24, and that's another nice step. And I think that's a broader set of clinical indications, as -- as it was in Korea and Japan. So, it gives a little more freedom to operate, which is great."", 'In the U.S., we have trials that had finished accrual and have been submitted -- or will be submitted soon in thoracic and colorectal. That will give our U.S. customers more opportunity to use SP in a multi-platform -- multi-specialty environment. So, I think SP continues to be a nice build. So, that -- that looks good.', ""And the team has their marching orders and is working down that set of processes. We have a breast oncology trial that's ongoing that we're excited about. Also, that will not make a big impact in '24 but starts to open additional opportunity for narrow access surgery thereafter. So, that's kind of where we are in SP. So far, so good."", ""I'll turn it over to Jamie and talk about Ion."", 'Jamie Samath -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Not ready to be particularly specific yet on when the supply chain challenges are behind us. For catheter, you have three dynamics. So, we had a specific supplier constraint that impacted us. We are, at the same time, transferring a number of catheter lines to Mexicali, and we're doing that as the business is effectively doubling. So, you're bringing on new staff, you're having to train them."", ""So, that's a real effort that takes some time. And I think that's a little bit of variability in terms of when we get to the point where -- where that's behind us. So, I'm going to -- I'm going to let us have another quarter before we talk about when that's resolved. The teams are making clear progress, but there's work still to be done. On the vision probe, I think it's a relatively simpler problem for us to address."", ""There isn't a supplier dependency within -- within that particular area. It's really just us being able to execute again a line transfer as the business is doubling and the teams are making great progress. But stay tuned."", 'Rick Wise -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst', ""Got you. And just one follow-up on gen 5 and what's next, you said, Jamie, and it makes sense, that probably in the next couple of quarters or until you launch, customers probably will lean more toward the leases with an upgrade clause, if I understood you. But I was just reflecting on it. Should we imagine that that could accelerate, this -- you know, this sort of leasing approach in the near term for Xi? And -- and as people, I guess, preferentially potentially -- possibly maybe line up to get gen 5 and that puts them in a more favorable position, how does that all parallel -- those dynamics, work? Is this good, better for sales that this transition occurs, or is it going to be more complicated?"", 'Jamie Samath -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Well, I think the first effect is we'll see the operating lease proportion of placements increase from where it's been. And again, that's because customer -- customers are motivated to have the protection that's in those clauses so that they can upgrade to da Vinci 5 when it becomes more broadly available. So, that was the first kind of message we wanted to provide in terms of 2024 modeling. In terms of then how that gets upgraded, it's really a function of when does da Vinci 5 launch which, obviously, we can't be specific about right now and there's some things to work through with FDA, and then, what's the period of time over which we then go from a constrained or phased launch to -- to a full launch."", ""So, I don't -- I don't see that particularly as somehow a revenue benefit in -- in '24. I think what we're saying is you'll have more of the placements that are leased, and therefore, that revenue is spread over time."", 'Gary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer', ""It's more -- more likely to be a slight negative than a slight positive. And I think the things we've put in place for customer transparency, the ability to see it, work to mitigate the feeling of having to wait, and they'll get a chance to put their hands on it and see it. But -- but I don't see it as an accelerant."", 'Rick Wise -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', ""OK, and we'll go to the line of Adam Maeder, Piper Sandler. Please go ahead."", 'Adam Maeder -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst', ""Hi, good afternoon, and thank you for taking the questions, and congrats on a great year. I wanted to start on China and ask about the quota that went effective last summer, as well as the anti-corruption campaign. If I heard the commentary correctly, it sounds like you expect systems to be impacted -- system placements would be impacted through the first half of 2024. Does that mean there's some optimism that placements could get better in the back half of the year? And just any additional color on what you're seeing, you know, in that geography regarding anti-corruption campaign would be -- would be very appreciated. Thank you."", 'Jamie Samath -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Indications, so far, have been that -- that anti-corruption effort is a year-long effort, which would take us to the middle of '24. And so, that's -- that's why we indicated that we would expect delayed tenders through the period in which that effort is ongoing. We don't have great visibility, frankly, beyond the first half of '24, and that's why in the prepared remarks we said at least through the first half of '24. So, yes, if that effort was to be resolved and if things started to normalize in terms of the pace at which tenders occurred, then you could see some opportunity for that to recover. But we're not at a position where we can predict that at this point."", 'Adam Maeder -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst', ""That's helpful color, Jamie. Thanks for that. And for the follow-up, wanted to ask about the procedure growth guidance, the 13% to 16% for this year. Maybe you could flesh that out for a little bit -- a little bit by geography, U.S."", ""versus international, how you're thinking about that, as well as, I guess, Europe versus Asia specifically. And just any color on quarterly cadence would be appreciated as well. Thanks again."", 'Brian King -- Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations', ""Let me start with seasonality, and I'm not going to be specific on quarterly cadence, but I do think I try to emphasize in our prepared remarks that we believe that the first half will be a tougher comp versus, you know -- versus last year. And so, using that, the comparison from last year and then also thinking about our historical sort of cadence throughout the year, I think you can look at that history and just make an assumption on -- on what that growth rates -- what those growth rates could be by quarter. Let's talk about factors in the procedure guidance. So, there's really three primary factors, right? You have -- we've called out bariatric growth rates, and that's primarily a U.S."", ""factor. We talked a bit about, from an OUS perspective, China and then also backlog in -- in -- in the system. And so, backlog also being primarily a U.S. factor but could still be broader. But so, I'm not going to go into specifics as far as U.S."", ""versus OUS. But I think I'd go back and -- and just really center you on our comments around bariatric growth rates, right? Low end of the range assumes that there's some continued moderation in bariatric procedures. And at the high end of the range that it assumes current growth rates, that there are some impact in China at the low end of the range, just from the discussion that you had right now on anti-corruption and how long that actually persists, and then the benefit of backlog and how that will persist throughout the year."", 'Jamie Samath -- Chief Financial Officer', ""In soft tissue surgery, I would just say, if you look at -- if you look at '23, the two primary growth drivers that we've called out is general surgery in the U.S. that grew 25% in -- in 2023. And for OUS, beyond urology, that grew 35% in '23. And at the core, we think those continue to be growth drivers for the business."", 'Adam Maeder -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst', 'Thanks very much.', 'Operator', ""And we'll go to the next line. We'll go to the line of Drew Ranieri, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead."", 'Drew Ranieri -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', ""I think, Gary, just maybe just broadly on da Vinci 5 and just the TAM that you kind of updated at a conference earlier this month, how are you -- could you maybe just update us maybe on how you're thinking about penetration today in general surgery, where you are with chole, hernia, colorectal, bariatric just to help us level set? Because it sounds like this could be a -- another progression in general surgery for -- for the company. And then, I had a follow-up."", 'Gary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure. I'll -- Jamie, I'll let you take the kind of characterization of where we are in the adoption curves of -- of general surgery, hernia, benign, chole, and so on."", 'Jamie Samath -- Chief Financial Officer', ""If you -- if you take a look at the U.S., and I'm going to put this in quartiles for a second in terms of where we are in the adoption curve, colorectal, we're in the second quartile; bariatric, also the second quartile; actually, cholecystectomy and hernia all in the second quartile all in terms of where they are along the adoption curve. So, that obviously gives us some continuing runway to -- to grow and as a driver behind the U.S. general surgery growth rates that we've seen. In the international markets, by the way, just in terms of general surgery, for the most part, in most of the larger markets, we're in the first quarter of adoption. It's early. What we're seeing is growth start to stick and those start to be on early growth rates, particularly in the cancer procedures, colorectal, and beyond general surgery, in hysterectomy and thoracic."", 'Gary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer', ""With regard to DV 5, I won't call out, you know, what a specific targeting has been. We'll talk about more about DV 5 when we get a chance to talk about clearance. We do think that it's something that can help improve outcomes in multiple places. And we'll look forward to talking to you about that when we have the opportunity. If you have one follow-up, Drew, I'll take the follow-up."", ""Otherwise, we'll close the call. So, Drew, do you have one more?"", 'Drew Ranieri -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', 'Sure, yeah. Just on da Vinci 5, can you maybe just talk about how it might be able to improve access to -- to hospitals? I know that you have many IDNs that have added more and more systems, but do you see that more as an opportunity? Or do you see just maybe better access for even smaller hospitals with having multi -- multi -- multi-port systems in the portfolio? Thanks.', 'Gary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Yeah, thank you for the question. We -- we think that having a portfolio of choices makes a ton of sense for hospitals. And this will be a part of that portfolio, we talked about it in the prepared script, that will give people choice. Some of that choice will have to do with how they view their practice. Some of it may -- may have to do with what their side of care looks like and feels like.', ""So, that gives us some optionality and gives our customers optionality. I think that's really healthy. So, thank you, Drew, appreciate the question. That was our last question."", 'And in closing, we continue to believe there is a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery in acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians, and care team in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim: better, more predictable patient outcomes; better experiences for patients; better experiences for the care teams; and ultimately, a lower total cost to treat. We believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs and in their environment. At Intuitive, we envision a future of care that is less invasive and profoundly better, where diseases are identified earlier and treated quickly so patients can get back to what matters most.

Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release and which are based on current expectations and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict, including those risk factors identified under the heading “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\xa031, 2022 and the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September\xa030, 2023, as updated by the Company’s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company’s actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statement, and the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or release any revisions to these forward-looking statements, except as required by law.', '*About Non-GAAP Financial Measures', 'To supplement its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), the Company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc., and non-GAAP net income per diluted share attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (“EPS”). The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.', 'The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance by excluding items such as amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation (“SBC”) and long-term incentive plan expenses, and other special items. Long-term incentive plan expense relates to phantom share awards granted in China by the Company’s Intuitive-Fosun joint venture to its employees that vest over four years and can remain outstanding for seven to ten years. These awards are valued based on certain key performance metrics. Accordingly, they are subject to significant volatility based on the performance of these metrics and are not tied to performance of the Company’s business within the period. The Company believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to its historical performance. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors, because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, and (2) they are used by institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the performance of the Company’s business.', 'Non-GAAP gross profit. The Company defines non-GAAP gross profit as gross profit, excluding amortization of intangible assets and SBC and long-term incentive plan expenses.', 'Non-GAAP income from operations. The Company defines non-GAAP income from operations as income from operations, excluding amortization of intangible assets, SBC and long-term incentive plan expenses, a facilities asset abandonment charge, litigation charges and recoveries, and a gain on the sale of a business.', 'Non-GAAP net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. and EPS. The Company defines non-GAAP net income as net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc., excluding amortization of intangible assets, SBC and long-term incentive plan expenses, a facilities asset abandonment charge, litigation charges and recoveries, a gain on the sale of a business, gains (losses) on strategic investments, adjustments attributable to noncontrolling interest in joint venture, net of the related tax effects, and tax adjustments, including the excess tax benefits or deficiencies associated with SBC arrangements, a one-time tax benefit from re-measurement of Swiss deferred tax assets, a one-time tax benefit from receipt of certain tax assets by our Swiss entity, and the net tax effects related to intra-entity transfers of non-inventory assets. The Company excludes the excess tax benefits or deficiencies associated with SBC arrangements as well as the tax effects associated with non-cash amortization of deferred tax assets related to intra-entity non-inventory transfers, because the Company does not believe these items correlate with the on-going results of its core operations. The tax effects of the non-GAAP items are determined by applying a calculated non-GAAP effective tax rate, which is commonly referred to as the with-and-without method. Without excluding these tax effects, investors would only see the gross effect that these non-GAAP adjustments had on the Company’s operating results. The Company’s calculated non-GAAP effective tax rate is generally higher than its GAAP effective tax rate. The Company defines non-GAAP EPS as non-GAAP net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. divided by diluted shares outstanding, which are calculated as GAAP weighted-average outstanding shares plus dilutive potential shares outstanding during the period.', 'There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP measures versus measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc., and non-GAAP EPS exclude items such as amortization of intangible assets, SBC and long-term incentive plan expenses, excess tax benefits or deficiencies associated with SBC arrangements, and non-cash amortization of deferred tax assets related to intra-entity transfer of non-inventory assets, which are primarily recurring items. SBC expense has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense in the Company’s business. In addition, the components of the costs that the Company excludes in its calculation of non-GAAP net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. and non-GAAP EPS may differ from the components that its peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations. Management addresses these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. and non-GAAP EPS and evaluating non-GAAP net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. and non-GAAP EPS together with net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. and net income per share attributable to

Welcome to Regions fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. John and David will provide high-level commentary regarding our results. Earnings documents, which include our forward-looking statement disclaimers and non-GAAP information, are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. These disclosures cover our presentation materials, prepared comments and Q&A. I will now turn the call over to John.', 'John Turner: Thank you, Dana, and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. This morning, we reported full year 2023 earnings of $2 billion, reflecting record pre-tax pre-provision income of $3.2 billion and one of the best returns on average tangible common equity in our peer group at 22%. Our results speak to and underscore the comprehensive work that’s taken place over the past decade to position the company to generate consistent, sustainable earnings regardless of the economic environment we are experiencing. We have enhanced our credit and interest rate risk management processes and platforms while sharpening our focus on risk-adjusted returns and capital allocation. Although the industry continues to face headwinds from lingering economic and geopolitical uncertainty, as well as the continued evolution of the regulatory framework, we feel confident about our positioning and adaptability heading into 2024.', 'We will continue to benefit from our strong and diverse balance sheet, solid capital and liquidity and prudent credit risk management. Our proactive hedging strategies continue to position us for success in an array of economic conditions. In our desirable footprint, granular deposit base and relationship banking approach will continue to serve us well. Our strategic plan continues to deliver consistent, sustainable long-term performance as we focus on soundness, profitability and growth. In closing, I am excited to work alongside the 20,000 Regions associates who put customers and their needs at the center of all we do and focus on doing the right things the right way everyday. Now, Dave will provide some highlights regarding the quarter.', 'David Turner: Thank you, John. Let’s start with the balance sheet. Average and ending loans decreased modestly on a sequential quarter basis, while ending loans grew a little over 1% compared to the prior year. Within the business portfolio, average and ending loans declined 1% quarter-over-quarter. We are remaining judicious reserving capital for business where we can have a full relationship. Loan demand remains soft as clients continue to exhibit cautious behavior. We are seeing clients make long-term investments when they have to, but if they can defer, they are holding off. In general, sentiment varies across industries with some continuing to expect growth, while others have a more muted outlook. Average and ending consumer loans remained relatively stable as growth in mortgage and EnerBank was partially offset by declines in home equity and the GreenSky exit portfolio sale we completed this quarter.', 'Looking forward, we expect 2024 average loan growth to be in the low single-digits. From a deposit standpoint, deposits increased modestly on an average and ending basis primarily due to increases in interest-bearing business products, which we expect will partially reverse with tax season in the first quarter. Across all three businesses, we continue to experience remixing from non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing deposits. However, the pace of remixing has slowed. Within consumer, we continue to see balanced normalization, but we believe the pace of remixing will continue to slow as short-term market rates appear to have peaked and the relationship of checking balances to spending levels is getting closer to pre-pandemic levels. Our overall views on deposit balances and rates are unchanged.', 'We expect incremental remixing out of low-cost savings and checking products of between $2 billion and $3 billion and total balances stabilizing by midyear. This results in a non-interest-bearing mix percentage remaining in the low 30% range. So let’s shift to net interest income. Net interest income declined by approximately 4.5% in the quarter driven mostly by deposit cost and mix normalization as well as the start of the active period on $3 billion of incremental hedging. Asset yields benefited from the maturity and replacement of lower yielding fixed rate loans and securities. Notably, during the quarter, we returned to full reinvestment of pay-downs in the securities portfolio and added $500 million over and above that to the portfolio balance taking advantage of attractive market rate and spread levels.', 'Interest-bearing deposit costs were 2.14% in the quarter, representing a 39% rising rate cycle beta. Growth in higher cost corporate deposits increased our reported deposit betas by approximately 1%, but allowed for the termination of all outstanding FHLB advances. This and a more pronounced slowing in the pace of rate-seeking behavior by retail customers drove modest net interest income outperformance compared to expectations. As we look to 2024, we expect net interest income trends to stabilize over the first half of the year and grow over the back half of the year. $3 billion of additional 4 starting hedges in the first quarter and further late-cycle deposit remixing will be a headwind. However, we expect deposit trends to continue to improve with interest-bearing betas peaking in the mid-40% range.', 'The benefits of fixed rate asset turnover will persist, overcoming the headwinds and driving net interest income growth in the second half of the year. With respect to outlook, we expect full year 2024 net interest income to be between $4.7 billion and $4.8 billion. Our guidance assumes for 25 basis point rate cuts with long-term rates remaining stable from year-end. However, the path for net interest income is well insulated from changes in market interest rates. The primary driver of net interest income in 2024 will be deposit performance. The lower end of our expected 2024 net interest income range assumes a 25% beta as rates fall, while the higher end assumes a deposit beta similar to what we have experienced during the rising rate environment.', 'In a falling rate environment, we are prepared to manage deposit costs lower to protect the margin. A relatively small portion of interest-bearing deposit balances is responsible for the majority of the deposit cost increase in the cycle. These market price deposits include index and other high beta corporate deposit types that will reprice immediately with Fed funds. The other primary contributor is CDs with a 7-month average maturity. While these products will lag in a falling rate environment, we are positioned to offset this cost. So, let’s take a look at fee revenue and expense. Adjusted non-interest income increased 2% during the quarter as a sequential decline in capital markets was offset by modest increases in most other categories.', 'Full year adjusted non-interest income declined 5%, primarily due to reductions in capital markets and mortgage income as well as the impact of the company’s overdraft grace feature implemented late in the second quarter. Partially offsetting these declines were new records in 2023 for both treasury management and wealth management revenue. With respect to outlook, we expect full year 2024 adjusted non-interest income to be between $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion. Let’s move on to non-interest expense. Reported non-interest expense increased 8% compared to the prior quarter, but included two significant adjusted items: $119 million for the FDIC special assessment and $28 million in severance-related costs. Adjusted non-interest expense decreased 5%, driven primarily by lower operational losses.', 'Full year adjusted non-interest expense increased 9.7% or approximately 6%, excluding elevated operational losses experienced primarily in the second and third quarters. We remain committed to prudently managing expenses to fund investments in our business. We will continue focusing on our largest expense categories, which include salaries and benefits, occupancy, and vendor spend. We expect full year 2024 adjusted non-interest expenses to be approximately $4.1 billion. From an asset quality standpoint, overall credit performance continues to normalize as expected. Reported annualized net charge-offs for the fourth quarter increased 14 basis points. However, excluding the impact of the GreenSky loan sale, adjusted net charge-offs decreased 1 basis point versus the prior quarter to 39 basis points.', 'Full year adjusted net charge-offs were 37 basis points. Total non-performing loans and business services criticized loans increased during the quarter. Non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans increased to 82 basis points due primarily to downgrades within industries previously identified as higher risk. Keep in mind, between 2013 and 2019, our average NPL ratio was 107 basis points. We expect to see further normalization towards these levels in 2024. Provision expense was $155 million or $23 million in excess of net charge-offs and includes an $8 million net provision expense related to the consumer loan sale. The allowance for credit loss ratio increased 3 basis points to 1.73%. Excluding the loan portfolio sold during the quarter, the allowance for credit loss ratio would have increased 6 basis points.', 'The increase to our allowance was primarily due to adverse risk migration and continued credit quality normalization as well as higher qualitative adjustments for incremental risk in certain higher risk portfolios. Our average net charge-offs from 2013 to 2019 were 46 basis points. We’ve seen modest acceleration towards these normalized levels in recent quarters. As a result, we expect our full year 2024 net charge-off ratio to be between 40 and 50 basis points. Turning to capital and liquidity. Given the evolution of the regulatory environment, we expect to maintain our common equity Tier 1 ratio around 10% over the near-term. This level will provide sufficient flexibility to meet the proposed changes along the implementation timeline while supporting strategic growth objectives and allow us to continue to increase the dividend commensurate with earnings.', 'We ended the year with an estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.2%, while executing $252 million in share repurchases and $223 million in common dividends during the quarter. With that, we’ll move to the Q&A portion of the call.', 'See also 20 Countries with the Lowest Income Tax Rates in the World and 15 Largest Insurance Companies In The US by Market Cap.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

It's also been bullish, with the market seemingly helping push more companies to that mark, and then viewing them in a different light once they've gotten there. It is a boon to a corporation's status and stature."", ""With that as the backdrop, here's a rundown of three high-growth stocks that could reach market capitalizations of $1 trillion within the next decade. They may even reach that target much sooner than 2034. This prospective market cap growth, of course, translates into opportunity for interested investors."", ""Folks familiar with the hardware sliver of the technology sector probably know Nvidia's been the centerpiece of several of the industry's evolutions. Its GeForce 256 graphics card released in 1999 arguably marks the beginning of home computers serving as high-powered media devices. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) were heavily used in mining cryptocurrencies when doing so was all the rage several years ago. Now, Nvidia's tech dominates the artificial hardware computing market."", ""There's been a second-place contender following in Nvidia's footsteps for most of this time though, and while it's been a distant-second, it's still a name worth adding to your watchlist if not your portfolio. That company? Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD)."", ""Truly, it's no Nvidia -- by several different measures. Its GPU market is regularly a fraction of Nvidia's, for instance, while its current market cap of $275 billion is only one-fifth of Nvidia's. Its much bigger rival has been able to hold its lead largely because it's, well, bigger -- and that allows it to fund more research and development."", ""The underpinnings of Nvidia's most recent growth are finally starting to favor Advanced Micro Devices as well, however. Namely, AMD is now making high-performance, purpose-built artificial intelligence processors. Facebook parent Meta Platforms and Microsoft, for example, have selected its new MI300X silicon as a cost-effective alternative to power their latest AI efforts."", ""Advanced Micro Devices' Ryzen 8040 chip also turns ordinary laptops into self-contained AI-capable devices. And these are just a couple of examples of how AMD is finally a serious contender in the artificial intelligence market."", ""It matters simply because this market still has such a long and steep growth runway ahead. Precedence Research estimates the annual AI hardware market alone will swell from around $600 million now to nearly $2.6 trillion by 2032. Even capturing less than its fair share of this growth could drive AMD shares much, much higher from where they're trading now."", ""You've almost certainly heard of Visa (NYSE: V). It's the world's biggest credit card middleman, processing more than 270 billion transactions every year worth a sum total of around $15 trillion. Over 4 billion cardholders can use their Visa cards at more than 130 million places peppered across the planet. In other words, it's pretty much everywhere."", ""Simply being everywhere alone, however, isn't necessarily enough to push the underlying company's market cap to $1 trillion. What's going to make that happen here is Visa's unwavering forward progress. With the exception of the advent of the pandemic in 2020, Visa hasn't failed to produce year-over-year profit growth in any quarter since 2010, just a couple of years after it went public. Profit growth has been almost as reliable. That's impressive to be sure."", ""How? This persistent growth reflect the way Visa and its peers have turned card-based spending into a top payment choice, and even a lifestyle choice. Think about it. Older investors may recall a time when credit cards were only used for the occasional big-ticket purchase. Now they're used to facilitate the purchases of everyday things as simple as a cup of coffee, lunch, or the regular splurge at Amazon.com."", 'Look at the numbers. As recently as 10 years ago, cash was used to make 40% of U.S. consumer purchases, according to the Federal Reserve, while credit and debit cards were used a similar 42% of the time. Now cash takes care of only 17% of payments within the United States, while cards facilitate 60% of purchases.', ""We're seeing similar trends overseas as well. All of them favor Visa, which of course keeps a few cents' worth of each of these transaction's value. Cards are just too convenient to utilize these days, leaving the remainder of commerce up for grabs. And that's still a lot of remaining commerce. Ever-rising prices will help boost growth too."", ""Granted, with its current market capitalization of over $500 billion, Visa is already more than halfway to the trillion-dollar mark. Given its tailwind though, there's little reason to think it won't get there in a decade or less."", 'Last but not least, add PDD Holdings (NASDAQ: PDD) to your list of high-growth stocks that could become $1 trillion powerhouses within the coming 10 years.', ""You may be more familiar with this organization than you realize. This is the company behind Temu, the international version of China's e-commerce platform Pinduoduo. It was conceived as a means of connecting China's produce farmers (yes, fruits and vegetables) directly with consumers. As it turns out, though, the tech and premise work well for a variety of products in a variety of settings."", ""Some even argue that it's redefining, even disrupting, the online retailing business by bypassing wholesaling and giving manufacturers direct access to shoppers. More important, the model is working. PDD's third-quarter revenue was up a hefty 94% year over year, driving operating profit up 60%. Those numbers not only extend lengthening growth trends but accelerate them."", ""And the analyst community predicts comparable growth. Last year's projected top line of $33 billion is expected to be three times bigger within the next five years. Within 10 years, when Temu and Pinduoduo are everything they could be, this organization's revenue could twice be tripled."", ""Of the three stocks in question, this one's the furthest from reaching a $1 trillion market. Even with last year's heroic run-up, this company's still only worth a little less than $200 billion. It's got a long way to go.

First, companies that steadily grow their cash distributions to shareholders often sport high-quality businesses with strong fundamentals, a wide economic moat, and stellar management. Second, shareholders who faithfully hold onto dividend-grower stocks and reinvest the dividend every quarter benefit from the power of compounding.', 'Which dividend-growth stocks are attractive right now?

The two-year U.S. Treasury note, on the other hand, only gained 2.54% in the past five years. Visa, therefore, has outperformed these two common benchmarks.', 'Visa seems well positioned to continue its upward trajectory for the foreseeable future. It has a dominant position in a growing market that is projected to grow by double digits annually until 2032, driven by the increasing adoption of digital payments worldwide.

It operates three main segments: cloud and license; hardware; and services. The cloud and license segment is the most significant, contributing 83% of the total revenue in the last four quarters.

Surprisingly, the stock still appears pretty attractive at this level."", ""Verizon earned $1.08 on an adjusted basis during the quarter, down from $1.19 in the year-ago period. Though this non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share figure aligned with analysts' estimates, revenue of $35.1 billion for the period was well beyond an average forecast of approximately $34.6 billion."", 'More important than the company\'s reported financials for the period was management\'s update on its momentum with customers.

Looking ahead, Verizon expects ""to deliver positive consumer postpaid phone net adds in full-year 2024 as we execute on our strategy of growing our subscriber base while being financially disciplined,"" said Verizon Chief Financial Officer Tony Skiadas during the company\'s fourth-quarter earnings call.', ""This momentum has management guiding for total wireless service revenue growth of 2% to 3.5% in 2024.

In September of last year, the company announced a 2% increase to its quarterly dividend, adding to its long history of dividend growth. Verizon has now boosted its dividend every year for 17 years straight."", ""Investors shouldn't underestimate the value of such a robust dividend. The cash payout helps de-risk some of the volatility associated with the stock since investors can expect substantial cash payments every quarter. Not only do these large payments help mitigate stock price volatility compared to many other stocks, but they also mean shareholders get to collect highly predictable cash payments while holding the stock."", ""Of course, one of the biggest risks is that the dividend gets cut or even suspended. However, this is unlikely because one of the company's top capital allocation priorities is to continue raising its dividend yearly. Additionally, Verizon's peak capital expenditures associated with rolling out its C-band network are now in the rearview mirror. This leaves more of the company's capital expenditures to pay down debt and pay dividends.

I hope you all had a great start of 2024. I'm pleased to report that Verizon closed out the year with a strong fourth quarter, finishing off a year of solid operation and financial performance. For us, 2023 was a year of continuous improvement and important actions across the business. We made significant changes to how we operate and to our team, and those changes paid off. We stabilized our core business and positioned the company for renewed growth and profitability. We built strong momentum quarter after quarter, culminating in a very good holiday season. And finally, we met the guidance that we provided to you in each of our key performance indicators. Entering 2024, Verizon stands ready to further unlock our performance potential at an accelerating rate. We now have all the assets, the best team in the business and a focus on continued operational excellence to deliver even better results going forward. Let me share some full year highlights with you. Wireless service revenue for 2023 was $76.7 billion, a 3.2% year-over-year increase. We delivered outstanding volumes during a healthy fourth quarter where our customers clearly embraced our offerings. Full year adjusted EBITDA was $47.8 billion, contributing to a very strong free cash flow of $18.7 billion, reflecting our disciplined and strategic approach to profitable growth. As a result of our financial strength, we raised our dividend for the 17th year in a row with a healthy free cash flow dividend payout ratio of approximately 59%. We also reduced our year-over-year leverage while continuing to bring CapEx back towards business as usual levels. This aligns with the capital allocation priorities we have shared in recent years. These results provide a solid foundation with Verizon's journey and future success. And I'm pleased that we put the leadership and team in place last year that will serve Verizon stakeholders well in both the short and long term. We, as a team, have focused on capturing the market opportunity, and I'm proud of our progress in 2023. Just two weeks ago, Leslie Berland joined Verizon as our Chief Marketing Officer. I'm excited to bring her on board and have a great confidence in her ability to continue shaping Verizon's premium brand perception and story. We started 2023 determined to differentiate ourselves by investing even more in profitable growth while transforming Verizon to make the company more efficient and effective. Seeing the continued strength of the U.S. consumer, busy holiday store traffic and rising demand for mobility, broadband and private networks, we also took actions to fuel growth during the fourth quarter, and it showed in our results. A standout milestone in 2023 was our launch of myPlan, which was designed from extensive customer research to be the most flexible plan available to U.S. consumers from any wireless company. myPlan has been a great success that has seen stellar adoption. Introduced in May, we already have 13.1 million myPlan subscribers. And these customers are choosing premium packages and our unique perks driving ARPA. Other changes we made in 2023 include establishing a regional distribution model, tailing our approach to every market, revamping sales composition to support productivity and introducing new price plans and promotions in Consumer and Business. Verizon Business also partnered with HCLTech to be more efficient to deliver post-sale implementation and customer support from managed network services, enhancing our customer service while saving Verizon money. These actions paired with all of our assets sets us up very well for 2024. We are now working from an effective model, and this is just a start. Overall, the wireless industry is strong as we head into 2024, and we are confident in our strategy. We have great offerings with optionality to meet the needs of customers of any budget on the best network in the country. Now let me share a bit more how each of our service performed in the fourth quarter. Starting with Mobility. We had 449,000 postpaid phone net adds, driven by improving net adds in Consumer and a continued sustainable performance in Verizon Business. Our disciplined and segmented market approach is working with customers and creating great economics for our shareholders. In Consumer, you can see the pattern of continuous improvement from the start of the year. In the fourth quarter, we delivered our best postpaid phone gross adds performance since 2019 and our best net adds in two years. We added 318,000 postpaid phone customers in the fourth quarter, and our gross adds were up almost 17% year-over-year. It is clear that we have momentum in Consumer as we move into 2024, and we'll continue to work to get our fair share of new business. Our customer-centric offers are resonating in the market, and we're just getting started. By leveraging Verizon's large subscriber base and key partnership, we can deliver exclusive discount offers like Netflix and Max for just $10 a month, underscoring our industry leadership in value-driven content offerings. With our vast network coverage and the largest base of loyal customers, we're uniquely positioned to provide targeted high-value deals that deepen relationships across connected devices, streaming and more. Within the value business, which includes our prepaid offerings like TracFone, Visible and Total by Verizon, we still have work do, but are making progress. Moving to Verizon Business. The team continued to deliver on Mobility with total postpaid phone net adds of 131,000 for the fourth quarter 2023, marking our tenth consecutive quarter of postpaid phone net adds above 125,000. For the full year, business added 562,000 phone net adds, an outstanding result. Our Business customers are prioritizing mobility and value the optionality we offer with highly tailored plans on the best network in the country. Now let's turn to Broadband. For the year, we had more than 1.7 million Broadband net adds with more than 1.5 million net adds from fixed wireless access and 248,000 net adds from Fios, a nice increase over 2022. On fixed wireless access, we're consistently adding more than 350,000 subscribers per quarter, which is part of our plan for steady, sustainable growth that exceeds what we expected at launch. Just three years of the launch, we serve more than 3 million fixed wireless access customers, well ahead of our stated goal of 4 million to 5 million subscribers by the end of 2025. With fixed wireless access, we're expanding into new markets and proving the value of Verizon's connectivity. Customers are finding strong reliability and speed in fixed wireless access, and that shows in our results, including a very strong Net Promoter Score. For a product that still is in the beginning, the pace of adoption has the team super excited. We expect this will be a long-term source of recurring revenue for Verizon, and we're entering this year with a strong base for continued growth. Turning to the private networks and our 5G business solutions. We continue to see interest from large enterprises running complex logistics and operations like ports, automotive and heavy industries. In November, Norfolk International Terminal contracted us to build a second private 5G network for them. All the already one of our partners in smart car development has contracted us to build a private network for their automotive tech testing environment. And Nucor, one of the country's largest steel companies, has us building private networks for three of its sites with more to come over the next year. Strategically, we are building a new source of revenue expansion where we are the clear leader. Last year, we also expanded existing 5G private network partnerships with NFL to bring new spectator and retail experience to fans everywhere. When we build relationships with these large enterprises, and they see what our network can do for them, there is always potential for more business. And our network is just getting better and better every day. With full access to our spectrum as of the end of third quarter last year, our mission is to optimize experience in every market and expand into suburban and rural markets, where we know our Consumer and Business customers are eager to take up our offerings. We have been expanding and improving our network in key markets through 2023 and into this year. I have said it before, and I will say it again, our network is the foundation of how we offer the best value and premium experience to our customers. And we are now seeing our investment in C-Band paying off in terms of customer experience and loyalty. Where we have C-Band, we see higher gross adds, lower churn and more step-ups to premium services. We also see increased uptake of customers taking both mobility and broadband services. Meanwhile, millimeter wave, which we have now deployed in many urban areas and all 30 NFL stadiums, sets Verizon apart with an outstanding performance at high-density areas and public event spaces. And for the 32nd consecutive time, Verizon was the most awarded company in the country for wireless network quality with the first place rankings in each of J.D. Power's 6 regions. We are the network that America relies on, and we take that commitment very seriously. Looking ahead, our priority for 2024 are crystal clear. We remain laser-focused on growing wireless service revenue and expanding our adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow to allow for a meaningful debt reduction in the year ahead. This is what our whole team is working towards and what you, our shareholders and our Board want us to focus on. Tony will have more details for you, but we anticipate strong wireless service revenue growth of 2% to 3.5% in 2024, which reflects our ability to sustain the top line of our business as we continue to pursue the right balance or profitability and customer growth. Our adjusted EBITDA profile will continue to improve as we become even more efficient with growth, cost saving measures and our disciplined promotional spending. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent. And as we lower our capital intensity from the C-Band build-out and our new business structure, we expect to see continued strong free cash flow generation going forward. That will enable our Board to continue to raise our dividend and also enable us to bring down leverage. Now Tony will discuss the quarter as well as our operations and guidance in more detail."", 'Anthony T. Skiadas', ""Thanks, Hans, and good morning. Executing on our plan, we finished the year strong and delivered on our financial guidance. We exited the year with good momentum and remain committed to our three priorities of growing wireless service revenue, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. In 2023, we set out to improve our operational performance while sustaining financial discipline. Our fourth quarter and full year results confirm that our strategy is working and that we can deliver strong financials and improve key operating metrics. Consumer postpaid phone net adds totaled 318,000 for the quarter, a substantial improvement of 369,000 sequentially and 277,000 compared to the prior year. Our Consumer postpaid phone churn of 0.88% represents a stable result even after we implemented over $1 billion of annualized pricing actions in 2023. While we do not provide specific guidance on volumes, we wanted to share a couple of items as we look into 2024. In the first quarter, we are taking additional targeted pricing actions that we expect will result in incremental pressure on Consumer postpaid phone churn in the period. However, we expect to deliver positive Consumer postpaid phone net adds in full year 2024 as we execute on our strategy of growing our subscriber base while being financially disciplined. Postpaid phone gross adds in the quarter were up nearly 17% year-over-year. This represents our best quarterly consumer gross add performance in four years. Our attractive myPlan offers combined with our segmented approach to the market, regional sales structure and disciplined promotional strategy continued to deliver strong results. Additionally, postpaid upgrades remained lower as compared to the prior year. The Consumer postpaid upgrade rate was 4.4% in the fourth quarter, down 120 basis points year-over-year as a result of approximately 19% fewer upgrades. As Hans said, we continue to see better performance in markets where we have deployed C-Band. In our first 76 C-Band markets, fourth quarter Consumer postpaid phone gross add growth was 8 percentage points better than in non-C-Band markets. Additionally, Consumer postpaid phone churn and C-Band markets was 4 basis points better than in non-C-Band markets. The strong momentum in the quarter, combined with the continued deployment of our C-Band network positions us well in 2024. The quality of the business we are writing in Consumer remains high as myPlan continues to drive premium plan adoption. The premium take rate in C-Band markets for the quarter was more than 10 percentage points higher than in non-C-Band markets. Consumer ARPA of $134.10 represents an increase of 4.7% year-over-year. This was driven by new customer additions, premium plan adoption and fixed wireless subscriber growth. We expect continued and healthy organic ARPA growth in 2024. Our prepaid results remained challenged in the fourth quarter. This is in part to seasonally weaker national retail sales volumes, which is the primary sales channel for our TracFone brands. We also continue to see pricing pressures from low-end postpaid offerings. Prepaid net losses for the quarter were 289,000. During the quarter, we saw continued strong growth within the Visible and Total by Verizon brands, which we will continue to scale. The team is also focused on our partnerships to improve the performance of the Straight Talk brand. We believe we're taking the right steps to better position our offerings in the market and expect to see some stabilization in 2024. Verizon Business delivered another strong quarter with 131,000 phone net adds which, as Hans mentioned, is our tenth consecutive quarter above 125,000. The Business Markets Group had its best phone net add performance in the last two years, demonstrating how our value proposition is resonating with small and medium businesses. Similar to Consumer, we are taking pricing actions in the first quarter in Business that could result in elevated phone churn in the period. However, we are confident that we will continue to deliver strong Business volumes in 2024. Moving on to broadband. We delivered 413,000 net additions in the quarter, continuing the pace of over 400,000 broadband net adds for the fifth consecutive quarter. We see strong demand for both our fiber and fixed wireless offerings, and we continue to see positive responses from customers regarding the quality and reliability of our services. In fixed wireless, we delivered 375,000 net adds for the quarter, growing the base to over 3 million subscribers. We launched C-Band in early 2022 and our fixed wireless success in the last two years reflects the strong demand for high-quality broadband and the strength and reliability of our product. Notably, in the fourth quarter, over 80% of our consumer fixed wireless gross adds came from C-Band markets. The growth trajectory for fixed wireless continues to be robust, and we are ahead of schedule to achieve our 4 million to 5 million subscriber goal by year-end 2025. Fios Internet net adds were 55,000, down 4,000 year-over-year. We are pleased with the success of Fios with strong gross adds and retention, reflecting the quality and overall value of the product. We expect broadband subscriber momentum to extend into 2024 as we continue deployment of our C-Band spectrum, further expand our Fios footprint and bring new products and offers to the market. Let's now look at our financials. Consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter was $35.1 billion, down 0.3% year-over-year. This change can be attributed to the wireless equipment revenue, which was approximately 2% lower than the prior year as total postpaid upgrades declined by approximately 18%. Total wireless service revenue was $19.4 billion, up 3.2% year-over-year. Strong revenue benefited from targeted pricing actions, more customers selecting premium unlimited plans and growth in fixed wireless access. This was partially offset by pressure from prepaid, which reduced total wireless service revenue growth by approximately 70 basis points year-over-year as well as promo amortization. Consolidated adjusted EBIT in the quarter was $11.7 billion, a decrease of 0.6% compared to the prior year. Higher wireless service revenue and the benefits of lower upgrades were more than offset by higher marketing and bad debt expense and ongoing declines in business wireline revenue. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 33.2% was relatively flat year-over-year. In 2023, we implemented transformations within our Consumer customer care group as well as Business managed services. We are pleased with what we have achieved this year, and our cost-saving measures are meeting our expectations. We expect further progress on our cost efficiency program in 2024. Adjusted EPS was $1.08 in the quarter, resulting in full year adjusted EPS of $4.71. Turning to our cash flow summary. Cash flow from operating activities for the fourth quarter was $8.7 billion, bringing the total for 2023 to $37.5 billion. This marks the year-over-year improvement of over $300 million, primarily due to working capital improvements. CapEx for the quarter came in at $4.6 billion compared to $7.3 billion in the prior year. The full year CapEx totaled $18.8 billion, which represents a more than $4 billion reduction in capital spending from 2022 as we come down from our peak C-Band spending level. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was $4.1 billion, bringing our year-to-date total to $18.7 billion, a $4.7 billion increase over the prior year, driven by operational improvements and the lower CapEx spending that we previously noted. We are pleased to have delivered on our guidance of more than $18 billion of free cash flow for the full year, which reflects our balanced and strategic approach to delivering profitable growth. Net unsecured debt at the end of the quarter was $126.4 billion, a $1.6 billion improvement year-over-year. Net unsecured debt increased sequentially primarily due to settling the $3.7 billion in incentive payments to satellite operators for our remaining C-Band spectrum. Our net unsecured debt consolidated adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.6x as of the end of the fourth quarter, in line with the prior two quarters. We expect deleveraging of the balance sheet to accelerate in 2024 as CapEx comes down to BAU levels, and we continue to generate strong cash flow. Additionally, we continue to benefit from our approach to managing long-term debt and have only $3.6 billion of unsecured debt maturing in 2024. Overall, I'm pleased with our momentum exiting the year and our performance in 2023, delivering an improved operational profile while also meeting our financial guidance. Now I want to take a few moments to look ahead and walk through our 2024 guidance. Our 2024 guidance demonstrates our expectations for accelerating wireless service revenue growth. As a reminder, the reported 2023 wireless service revenue growth of 3.2% included approximately 190 basis points of benefit from a reallocation of other revenues. Excluding this reallocation, the 2023 wireless service revenue growth was 1.3%. For 2024, we expect total wireless service revenue to grow between 2% and 3.5%. This will be driven by anticipated positive postpaid phone additions to both Consumer and Business, continued fixed wireless access subscriber growth, further adoption of premium unlimited plans, growth in products and services and pricing action benefits. We expect consolidated adjusted EBITDA to grow by 1% to 3% versus the prior year. This outlook reflects expected higher wireless service revenue and the impact of our cost transformation initiatives, partially offset by continued pressure in Business wireline revenues and increased wireless network operating expenses. Full year adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $4.50 to $4.70. As noted, we expect adjusted EBITDA to grow in 2024, offset by certain below-the-line impacts. Specifically, higher interest expense is expected to impact adjusted EPS by $0.16 to $0.19, over 75% of which is driven by the continued reduction in capitalized interest related to the C-Band licenses being placed into service. In addition, EPS is expected to be impacted by approximately $0.07 to $0.09, of higher pension and OPEB expense, primarily due to the expiration of certain credits. This impact will flow through the other income and expense line on our income statement. We expect depreciation and amortization to be relatively flat in 2024 compared to 2023. Our adjusted effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 22.5% to 24% based on current legislation. As discussed in prior quarters, capital spending for the full year is expected to be between $17 billion and $17.5 billion, down from $18.8 billion in 2023. While we are not providing guidance on 2024 free cash flow, we wanted to provide some additional color to aid with your analysis. Tailwinds to free cash flow will come from our adjusted EBITDA growth outlook as well as the expected $1.5 billion reduction in CapEx in 2024 based on the midpoint of our guided CapEx range. Offsets will be higher interest expense and higher cash taxes. As a reminder, the majority of the higher interest expense relates to reductions in capitalized interest. Such interest was recognized in cash flow from investing prior to placing the C-Band spectrum into service. The higher cash taxes are primarily related to the continued phaseout of bonus depreciation in 2024 based on current legislation. Overall, we expect a strong free cash flow profile that will support our capital allocation priorities and position us for meaningful unsecured debt reduction in 2024, which we expect to come in the latter half of the year. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Hans for his closing thoughts."", 'Hans E. Vestberg', ""Thank you, Tony. As you've heard today, we are confident and well positioned to deliver a solid 2024. Thanks to our best-in-class network, which is only getting better, we offer the mobile and broadband services that customers value and need the most. Our industry is critical to the next wave of innovation, and Verizon is ready to capitalize on the opportunity of the AI economy to bring this technology to live for all our stakeholders. As I said in the beginning, we have the right team in place to execute the next chapter in Verizon's history. I'm proud of the work our team accomplished in 2023 and are excited what we will deliver in 2024. Our results in C-Band market speaks for themselves and support our investment decisions, and we're going to lean in further as we expand into suburban and rural markets while maintaining the financial discipline you come to expect from us. We will continue to stay very close to our customers to understand their needs and preferences so that we can offer the right promotions at the right times in the right markets. We have the right people, the right assets and the right strategy. Our focus for 2024 is on execution. It's a winning combination, and we are very confident heading into this year. Finally, I want to remind you that we are hosting an investor event on February 5 and encourage everyone to tune in to the webcast. Given the financial update today, next month will be more of an operational and strategic update on the company. Now Brady, we are ready to take questions."", 'Brady Connor', ""Thanks, Hans. Brad, we're ready for the first question."", 'Operator', 'We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) The first question will come from John Hodulik of UBS.', 'John Christopher Hodulik', ""I'd love to drill down on a couple of things. First, the sub trends, 17% growth is some real momentum. I know, Hans, you talked about a number of sort of potential drivers. But if there's anything you could sort of be specific and sort of talk about what drove that in the quarter? And is that likely to continue, also the account growth, is that likely to continue? And then you talked about some churn on the price increase. Anything you could say about sort of the net add momentum as we look into '24? That's first. And maybe for Tony, nice service revenue growth. Any additional info you can give us to sort of unpack that in terms of the price increase impact versus last year and what you're seeing in terms of Tier, that would be great."", 'Hans E. Vestberg', ""John, thank you for the question. So let me start about the subs then. On the Business side, tenth quarter in a row, more than 125,000, Kyle and the team is doing a great job where our network is performing so well. So our customers just continue to buy in with us, not only that. Our offerings in our go-to-market is as strong as ever. So we feel really good about what Kyle and the team is doing. On the Consumer side, yes, we had a good fourth quarter. But you have seen also all through the year that we have sequentially improved all the time. Everything started where -- we started with a new offering myPlan, which resonates with the market, very much consumer insights in it. Then on top of that, Sampath has done a lot of changes in our structure all the way from the go-to-market, the incentives in our stores and our decentralization of it. So it hangs together all the way. So I think the most important, we have the right offerings in the market, and that has really resonated on the Consumer side. So I'm really happy with the team. We will continue to execute on the plan we have, and we have started."", 'Anthony T. Skiadas', ""John, it's Tony. So just to add on to what Hans mentioned. We did really well in Tier 1 markets. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, about 8 percentage points better and we were also net add positive in both Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets as well. We improved our competitive positioning against all providers. We continue to build out C-Band, as we said earlier in suburban and rural markets, and we see further opportunity there. And as Hans mentioned, we had strong momentum in the VBG side as well, on both mobility and FWA, so good results. And then on your question on service revenue. So we feel really good about the shape of service revenue in 2024. The guidance that we gave of 2% to 3.5% reflects accelerated growth, and we talked about the jump-off point of 1.3% in the prepared remarks. The midpoint of our guidance range implies over $2 billion of service revenue growth. If we think about the assumptions in the guide in terms of tailwinds, as you know, we've executed a number of pricing actions, both in the back half of 2023 that do carry into 2024 as well as in recent weeks, we've taken further pricing actions in both Consumer and Business that provide a tailwind. We also have an improving volume profile in our Consumer business. As we said in the prepared remarks, we expect to have positive phone net adds in consumer in 2024 and stable business volumes as well. And then the third tailwind I'd point to is an increasing contribution from fixed wireless access. We have really good momentum and over 3 million subs in the base. In terms of headwinds, prepaid, has been a drag on service revenue both in the fourth quarter and the full year was about $142 million in the fourth quarter, and we expect the prepaid headwinds to continue into 2024 as we stabilize that business. And then on promo amortization, that continues to be a headwind with the increase in 2024, similar to the increase we experienced in 2023. But when you put that all together, we like the trajectory of service revenue."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.', 'Simon William Flannery', 'Just following up there on the fixed wireless. Could you just give us a little bit of color around how the churn is performing? What are you seeing in terms of those cohorts that have had this service for some time and any comments on sort of capacity and so forth. And also, are you seeing emerging seasonality in this product driven by strong back-to-school in Q3 and then maybe a little bit softer in Q4. And then anything you can -- color you can provide on your exposure to ACP and how that may affect you and your latest thoughts on the BEAD program.', 'Hans E. Vestberg', ""Okay. Thank you. On the fixed wireless access, I think the product is maturing. We're now past 3 million subs, both on the Business side and Consumer together. Clearly, the rollout and the product is unique. It has -- it resonates so good in the market, simplicity of the product and installing it, which was the -- which was our idea. And even if we took out the discount that we had in the third quarter, we haven't seen any slowdown. The product is resonating so well. We are constantly improving it. The NPS is really high on the product. And as I said so many times before, for us, is to keep the same volume right now because that -- we are demanding our capacity, or our capital in the best way. It's the most efficient way. So we will continue to be in these levels, and we think they are very important. And hoping that, of course, that our consumers using fixed wireless access that, they are using the network as anybody else. And as I said before, we have dimensioned the network to handle it, so that's not the challenge. And the most important for us is that we have fiberized all our network, and so we can transport all the data. The guys are doing a great job on fixed wireless access across the board."", 'Anthony T. Skiadas', ""Yes. And then just one additional point there. So the longer-dated churn, Simon, is very strong, and we're very pleased with the progress thus far. On your other question on ACP, just maybe a few points to make here. The guidance assumes that the ACP funding remains intact. In the event the funding goes away, we have plans to address it, and we'll see what happens there. The majority of the exposure on ACP is in our prepaid business. We have about 1.2 million prepaid subs that benefit from the ACP program, and that's less than 10% of our prepaid base. On the postpaid side, we have minimal exposure to ACP, both Fios and postpaid wireless. And the margin exposure from ACP is very, very small."", 'Hans E. Vestberg', 'And on the BEAD program, we will participate when that comes out in the market where we see we can compete and where we see good return on investment. We have already won a couple in the early stages, but we expect that this will roll out over years to come. And -- but again, we will see that we participate when it makes sense for us, usually -- or not usually, always with financial discipline.', 'Simon William Flannery', 'Great. And just one follow-up on the fiber build, is that again about 500,000 homes passed this year?', 'Anthony T. Skiadas', 'Yes, Simon, it will be a little bit over 400,000 next year.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan.', 'Philip A. Cusick', ""I think you said you expect postpaid phone positive for the year. What's the durability of Consumer growth? Could that also be positive for 2024? And remind us the impact that price increases tend to have on churn over the last couple of years. And then second, maybe you could just dig into where your gross adds are coming from, the improvements as you're doing better there. Churn has sort of been in line, but gross add is doing a lot better. If you could dig into that. Is there any significant shift in where customers are coming from, maybe from myPlan?"", 'Hans E. Vestberg', ""I can just start by saying but I'm going to hand it over to Tony. I think you're spot on. On myPlan, and I said it in my opening remarks, stellar performance so far on myPlan. But it's not only that the plan is good, it's both flexible, you have cost control and our customers get value of it. And I think that goes back to the -- what I talked about for years, disciplined approach, but also very segmented. And that's what's happening right now, and we can see that we allocate money to the right product to the right customer in the right market. So there's a lot of that. But Tony will give you a little bit of rundown on the numbers."", 'Anthony T. Skiadas', ""Sure. So just, Phil, on the churn. I mean, obviously, we'll see a little bit of an uptick from the pricing changes we made in both Consumer and in Business. And those changes were announced in the last few weeks. And then as Hans mentioned, we really had good performance in Consumer. You saw the gross add number at 17% and 10% for the full year, and that's despite being in a much lower upgrade environment as well, so we feel really good. Like I said earlier, the Tier 1 markets were very strong, and we see further opportunity as we build out C-Band, the churn profile is much better. The ARPA is much better. So we're very comfortable with what we're seeing so far with C-Band and the performance."", 'Philip A. Cusick', 'And in terms of the durability of postpaid and growth there?', 'Anthony T. Skiadas', ""Yes. Look, we said we're going to be postpaid phone positive in Consumer in 2024, and we'll also continue to see strong momentum in Business as well. We did 562,000 net adds this year. And Kyle and the team did a great job, and we expect continued solid growth from the Business side as well."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi.', 'Michael Ian Rollins', ""Just one more on wireless pricing. Can you provide some additional context on how you're seeing the competitive landscape evolve with respect to pricing? And how Verizon is trying to balance the volume versus price equation as you look out from the recent pricing actions that you've taken? And then second, can you provide an update on how much the cost-cutting program yielded in '23 and how much you can capture it in '24 relative to the previously articulated target?"", 'Hans E. Vestberg', ""Thanks, Mike. I think when it comes to our pricing and our promotions, I think we look more about we are the leader in the market. We look at the different segments we have to see that we have the right offerings for our right customer with the right value. That's the focus we have had for, I would say, the last two years, very much focused on our customer base and the consumers and the customers we can attract the Verizon. And so far, that disciplined approach we have, you saw the fourth quarter, for example, we invested in a little bit more because we have really good momentum. So sometimes, we're going to invest more, but it's always going to be with a return on investment in mind to see that we're doing the right for all our stakeholders. So that's the focus we have on the pricing we have, both on broadband and on wireless. On the cost program, '23 was a big year for us. You probably are following all our press releases, but we did a lot in customer care. We did a lot with managed services without sourcing the HCL, we implemented some really large IT systems and application that's going to be a fantastic platform. We continue to deploy our offshore centers and being even stronger and using that as a platform on the basis that we created Verizon Global Services, the 1st of January '23. So I'm really pleased with the platforms, and that means we're on track for the savings we talked about, going into '24. It's more about the same. Tony?"", 'Anthony T. Skiadas', ""Sure. So just to add a couple of things here. So on 2023, we delivered about $300 million to $400 million in savings. And as Hans mentioned, we expect the program to ramp in 2024, and the savings are contemplated in the guide. Portion will hit the bottom line while also giving us the flexibility to invest in the business. And I think you saw that in the fourth quarter and the results speak for themselves. We're not going to give specific cost targets, but what -- in addition to what Hans mentioned, we have work going on in IT platform transformation, in real estate and fleet optimization and we're also opening up shared service center in Ireland. So we feel really good about the cost actions that are driving the EBITDA improvements that you see in the guidance for this year."", 'Michael Ian Rollins', 'And just one other. Where are you in the process of restructuring of the Business wireline operations? And how close are you to an inflection where that segment can stabilize financially or potentially, eventually grow at some point?', 'Hans E. Vestberg', ""Thank you, Mike. No, that's a big focus for us. We have the secular decline, and we've had that for quite a while. So there's nothing new and nothing new to that story. But our cost efficiency is, of course, happening very, very quickly. And the team is doing a great job. Not only that, we also see that we have the right pricing for our customers and also seeing where we don't have great contract we have decided to walk away from them. So very much tackling, blocking and tackling to see that we'll continue to improve. And of course, our target is to get that to sort of being neutral to our P&L over time. And that is one of the important pieces for getting the 25% of the Verizon Business Group in EBITDA, but not only that, of course, we're offsetting that by growing our wireless business and our broadband business. So typical management of a product portfolio, and I would say Kyle and the team is doing a great job with the full support from Tony and me."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Frank Louthan of Raymond James.', 'Frank Garrett Louthan', ""So you've made a lot of changes in the last year to kind of retail marketing to correct some of the past periods. You now got a new CMO. What can we expect her to be doing differently? Should we see this as another reset or change of direction? How should we think about that adjustment?"", 'Hans E. Vestberg', ""You're right. Last year, we did a lot of changes. But looking at the result, I think many of the changes was absolutely right, all the way from our structural changes to go to market, the products. And also, we did quite a lot of management changes, getting the -- many of the executive new positions, including the recruiting a new CMO, Leslie Berland. We are excited to have her on. I think where we are with our brand and with our offerings, we're in a great place. But you cannot see still here, and that's why we recruited Leslie. Leslie will work with the full team to see how we continue to refine the leadership in the brand because we are the number one brand in the market, we're just going to refine that. But we're not going to sit still. So I think Leslie has been over two weeks. So I see a lot of great initiatives and ideas, and we will work together with her, to make this company even better."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America.', 'David William Barden', ""A couple, if I could. Just the first, you went out of your way to highlight how well fixed wireless access is doing in the C-Band markets. These are kind of the main markets, probably the densest markets. Obviously, we're going to see the C-Band deployment expand both in terms of spectrum density and in terms of geography. 350 has been kind of the baseline expectation for fixed wireless access adds in the current C-Band deployment. Would you be willing to put a stake in the ground? Where could that go? Could that double by the time we get the full C-Band deployment out there by the end of next year? That's the first question. And I guess the second question. Tony, you gave us the kind of moving parts, the EBITDA growth 2%. That's about $0.75 billion after tax. Interest expense at $0.175, that's about $3 billion -- $0.75 billion after tax, $1.5 billion CapEx savings. So the big moving part that none of us really know is the cash tax and how that might impact free cash flow, whether free cash flow could be up a little bit, down a little bit. Could you be more transparent around that moving part?"", 'Hans E. Vestberg', ""Thank you, David. When it comes to fixed wireless access, yes, when we got the C-Band, the initial chunk of spectrum got was in urban places. Now since the end of the third quarter, we got the suburban and rural areas. But we continue at the end of the year to strengthen our urban area. So now we're sort of deploying much more in the suburban and rural. That creates a new opportunity for us, both from our strength in wireless in many of those markets together with our fixed wireless access. But I said it many times before, for us, it's very important to have a certain volume and a certain cadence because we can optimize our resources, our capital, et cetera. So Tony and I feel really good about being around 400,000 net adds for broadband in total, including Fios. That has sort of been a mantra, that can be, of course, coming up and down a little bit, but it's not like we are forcing a lot of capital and resources in the quarter and then doing less, that's not efficient in a company like ours. We are very financially disciplined, as you know. And that's best for our customers and for our stakeholders, like shareholders. So that's what you're going to expect from us."", 'Anthony T. Skiadas', ""And Dave, just on your -- question on cash taxes. So we said we're going to be pressured by the phaseout of bonus. We did see a tax benefit in 2023 from the spectrum clearing payments. And if you think about the headwind, we'd see it at about $2 billion right now, and we'll have to see how things play out with what the proposed legislation is."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson.', 'Craig Eder Moffett', ""I wonder if you could talk about your market growth expectations for postpaid coming into the year. I know you're the first one to report. So we haven't seen the results from anyone else yet. But what's your sense of what we can expect in terms of total postpaid and maybe total phone growth for 2024 market-wide?"", 'Hans E. Vestberg', ""Thank you, Craig. If I think about this year, I mean, first of all, mobility in broadband is two of the most important infrastructure in the country. And I don't think it's any one company, person or organization can live without those services. We are the number one in basically everything we're doing. I think it's a healthy industry. It's an important product we have, then it can come up and down. So I cannot give you a percentage of what's going to happen. I think our offering is great. I think the product is so important, both mobility and broadband for all parts of our society. I wouldn't like to be in any other business, and it's sort of so important for our society that mobility and broadband is working."", 'Craig Eder Moffett', ""And can I just maybe drill down a little bit though? I mean the growth numbers we've seen have been as high as 6 million plus, is that a feasible growth rate? Population growth, including immigration is more like 3 million. Is your sense as you go into -- your own expectations for the year, that we'll see some deceleration? Or is your sense that there's still something going on that's keeping growth so far in excess of population growth?"", 'Hans E. Vestberg', ""I think that we're going to -- whatever number is going to be, we're going to get our fair share of it and that's what we are aiming for. But you're right, of course, immigration is lower. So the pool is smaller, but we've also seen a really good uptake between value segment to postpaid. So there's a lot of factors coming in. And then, of course, what we have done when we think about offerings, we have myPlan, we're adding the perks for example, in Netflix and Max. We are expanding also ARPA because we have such a great offering to our customers. So this is a new time. But again, the product is so important for the market and for each and every one of us. So I feel really good about coming into this year, what we have done and where we go, and let's see where we end up."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays.', 'Kannan Venkateshwar', ""So maybe a couple. I guess, firstly, on the fiber side, Hans, as you think about the base of fixed wireless subscribers. By next year, you'll have a pretty big critical mass overall of 5 million-plus potentially. And it's not too far away from where your Fios base is. And you have deep money coming in, potentially, there's more interest from private equity funds and so on and so forth. And I know you've talked about being a lot more disciplined on fiber, but does your breakeven threshold change just given the kind of critical mass you get to in fixed wireless and also the kind of capital alternatives that we are starting to see in the market? That's one. And secondly, on the wireless side, over the last two or three years, I mean, obviously, there's been a pretty big tailwind to service revenue from prices and explicit price increases. So your thoughts on how long that can continue. And when does mix take over and become a bigger component overall from a service revenue growth perspective? And how we should expect that transition to happen would be helpful."", 'Hans E. Vestberg', ""Thank you, Kannan. Yes, I have to go back a little bit when it comes to our broadband strategy. We have a multipurpose network. We build the network once and we have multiple options at the edge. That was sort of the infancy of the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network. From the data center to the edge, we have harmonized everything. We have fiber in between everything. We have multi routers. We have one transport network. That is super important, it's sort of the brain of the network. Then at the edge, we have optionality, what type of access we have. In the ILEC, of course, we're going to continue with our success in Fios and outside, we're doing fixed wireless access. But it gives us optionality over time. I like honest economics. I think that, that makes us very competitive in pricing and offerings to our customers. There are, of course, a lot of offerings from people that want to ship in capital. But ultimately, it has paid off for us to be very, very prudent in financial discipline with our own money. But you can never outrule, but that's really my view on it. But I'm creating optionality with the network and Joe and his team are super agile if we need to be within that. On the wireless, I would say, I mean, if you look at our Business side, they have great offerings in the market. They have taken the fair share over 10 quarters, and then have also made new offerings so they can expand. So I think they both have done quantity and value. And wireless, of course, on the Consumer side, they have historically have more ARPA increase with new offerings, new pricing, new products, rather than volumes. But you have seen us performing in the last part of the year. And I think Sampath and his team, they have said that they want to increase the part of getting new customers. But again, it will be financial discipline, and we should get the right customers. And if you look at our quality of our Consumer base, it's just amazing, and we will continue to be financially prudent on that. But clearly, we want to have more volumes and -- but not to any cost, we will do it with the right cost and the right product to our customers."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Peter Supino of Wolfe Research.', 'Peter Lawler Supino', ""On the subject of consumption and network utilization, I wondered if you could update us on the number of gigabytes per month that postpaid phone customers are consuming nowadays and extending that thought over the next few years, does that growth and the robust FWA business that you're building suggests that we should prepare for densification or other radio access network or spectrum costs for capacity over the next several years, certainly not a 2024 question."", 'Hans E. Vestberg', ""Yes. I'll go back to how we build the network because building the network is so very important because the biggest challenge with a lot of traffic is, of course, transporting it in an efficient way, having your own fiber and that we've already built. When it comes to the growth in the network, yes, everybody is using the network more. It's no different between fixed wireless access and Fios. And of course, wireless consumers are using the network more as well. But we have built a very stable network all the way from the data centers to the edge. And then, of course, we have assets that nobody else has. We have a lot of our traffic on millimeter wave, which is the cheapest way to deliver data in the market by far and we have our C-Band just coming out. So -- and we have our best engineers. So I feel really good with that people and customers are using our network more. That's what this was intended for, and we have designed it like that."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Bryan Kraft of Deutsche Bank.', 'Bryan D. Kraft', ""I had two, if I could. First, following up on John's earlier question, can you give us a sense for how much of the year-over-year improvement in gross adds in the fourth quarter was the result of healthy industry volumes versus the improved execution and product that you've got in the market now? And additionally on that, did you see stronger performance in December versus the rest of the quarter? I asked because I think your last public presentation was in early December, and your results seem to even more positive than your tone back then. So it seems like maybe you picked up momentum as the quarter progressed. And then I just had a separate question on the issue of lead cables. I was wondering if you would comment on the latest media report that the EPA has conducted its own testing, some of your lead sheet cables that have shown lead levels above EPA standard for safety. Any sense for whether these reports are accurate? And if so, how you're thinking about the potential impact at this point around this issue?"", 'Hans E. Vestberg', ""Yes. Thank you, Bryan. Let me start with the market in the fourth quarter. We don't know. I mean the others haven't reported. We only know that we have performed really well. And -- but that has been -- it's not a one quarter phenomenon. If you think about from the second quarter, third quarter, even in the first quarter, we were sequentially improving all the time, and we have done that in a disciplined ways with a lot of actions and that we need to keep up. So -- and then the comment on how the quarter shaped so you probably talk about consumer more than anything else. I think we're solid through the quarter, there was nothing sort of different during the month in the quarter. We were solid through the quarter, doing well performance. On the lead. As I said before, we take that very seriously. I cannot comment what media is doing. We work with all the agencies and see that we are following this up and we have revealed all the information we have. So we don't have any more. We have also disclosed how much lead cable we have in the network, which is very little. But again, we take it seriously and we work with all the agencies."", 'Operator', 'Your last question will come from Walter Piecyk of LightShed.', 'Walter Paul Piecyk', ""Hans, this is -- I apologize, probably the fourth time you're coming back to the gross add question. But I think earlier, you made mention of kind of the change in structure from nationalization to localization. I think that was something that Sampath had kind of stated as one of his specific things and probably something that maybe, could be more sustainable than just a change in a rate plan that obviously could be replicated or just addresses the market. So just a couple of questions on that. First, if you think about kind of the ramp in fourth quarter, I know this is kind of a soft question, but like the impact of localization, and that's change in the structure of the sales organization versus myPlan, which had a larger impact. And then, I guess, more importantly, the sustainability, meaning that, yes, you typically do see sequential growth seasonally around this time of the year. Obviously, more pronounced this year than past. But are we going to see even more sequential growth or more abnormal growth in the first half of the year as some of the implementation of that localization continues? Or have we largely already seen that impact as we go into 2024?"", 'Hans E. Vestberg', ""Walt, I think that was -- it's a good question. So the whole -- remember, we started with the network as the C-Band is sort of rolling out in different ZIP codes all the time, we are engaging locally. The same we did with the Consumer group to be much more local, to be able to do local marketing, cater forward the local market, have local flavors of our marketing. We worked with a sports league like NFL and the teams in different markets to see that happen. So of course, I'm going to attribute part of our growth during the year to the decentralization. But we just got started to see that we have that team in place and Sampath and the team are working with them with his market precedent -- make it. But it's also a sign of where the market is going. You need to be local, and you need to be on the ground in the different societies in order to perform and be knowledge. And Verizon is most visible in all the grounds and now we're taking next step with our structure. So very pleased with what I've seen so far, but more to be done."", 'Anthony T. Skiadas', ""Yes, Walt. I'll just add on to what Hans said. The regional structure is a lot closer to the customer, and we've run the business this way for many, many years. And we can do things like different promos for different markets and local resources and decision-making and the localization offset some of the price up as well. So we feel really good about where we're heading, especially with the Tier 2 and Tier 3 rollouts with C-Band and the opportunity that provides."", 'Walter Paul Piecyk', ""Tony, can you also remind us when the Board considers share repurchase as it relates to leverage? And I think the leverage that you mentioned earlier in the call excludes the unsecured debt because you were referencing a 2.6 number. So assuming we're basing it off the 2.6 number, I think your target -- your long-term target was 2.0. So clearly, you wouldn't let it go below 2.0 before you start buying stock back, but is there a consideration under 2.5 where the Board starts to consider share repurchase?"", 'Hans E. Vestberg', ""Thank you, Walt. I think this is something that we are being very disciplined. Our capital allocation priority is clear. Number one, money to the business, basically our CapEx; number two, continue to put the Board in a place so they can continue to increase our dividend and then number three paying down debt. When we come down to 2.25 we have said we will start considering buybacks, but our ultimate long-term goal is to get around 2. So yes, that's the plan. But of course, it will play in where the market is, where the interest rates are, where the capital is and where our equity is. But clearly, that's the plan we have right now, and the Board is fully tuned to that plan."", 'Brady Connor', 'Yes. Thanks, Walt. Brad, back to you.', 'Operator', 'Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services.

Finding dividend aristocrats worth investing in today should balance three criteria: market stability (considering the current economic landscape), growth and expansion opportunities, and yield. Staking your cash on just one of those three parameters isn’t always enough. For example, 3M Co (NYSE:MMM) is one of the highest-yielding dividend aristocrats around.

Though the company’s total yield consistently clocks in at or above 3%, its payout ratio is remarkably low (42.27% as of this writing). This is notable because GPC is notoriously debt-averse. Instead, the company relies heavily on cash flow rather than leverage to fuel operational growth and return value to shareholders.

Growth is all relative. So are investors' gains."", ""In reality, however, joining the trillion-dollar market cap club has been something of a badge of honor since Apple first achieved the feat back in 2018. It's also been bullish, with the market seemingly helping push more companies to that mark, and then viewing them in a different light once they've gotten there. It is a boon to a corporation's status and stature."", ""With that as the backdrop, here's a rundown of three high-growth stocks that could reach market capitalizations of $1 trillion within the next decade. They may even reach that target much sooner than 2034. This prospective market cap growth, of course, translates into opportunity for interested investors."", ""Folks familiar with the hardware sliver of the technology sector probably know Nvidia's been the centerpiece of several of the industry's evolutions. Its GeForce 256 graphics card released in 1999 arguably marks the beginning of home computers serving as high-powered media devices. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) were heavily used in mining cryptocurrencies when doing so was all the rage several years ago. Now, Nvidia's tech dominates the artificial hardware computing market."", ""There's been a second-place contender following in Nvidia's footsteps for most of this time though, and while it's been a distant-second, it's still a name worth adding to your watchlist if not your portfolio. That company? Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD)."", ""Truly, it's no Nvidia -- by several different measures. Its GPU market is regularly a fraction of Nvidia's, for instance, while its current market cap of $275 billion is only one-fifth of Nvidia's. Its much bigger rival has been able to hold its lead largely because it's, well, bigger -- and that allows it to fund more research and development."", ""The underpinnings of Nvidia's most recent growth are finally starting to favor Advanced Micro Devices as well, however. Namely, AMD is now making high-performance, purpose-built artificial intelligence processors. Facebook parent Meta Platforms and Microsoft, for example, have selected its new MI300X silicon as a cost-effective alternative to power their latest AI efforts."", ""Advanced Micro Devices' Ryzen 8040 chip also turns ordinary laptops into self-contained AI-capable devices. And these are just a couple of examples of how AMD is finally a serious contender in the artificial intelligence market."", ""It matters simply because this market still has such a long and steep growth runway ahead. Precedence Research estimates the annual AI hardware market alone will swell from around $600 million now to nearly $2.6 trillion by 2032. Even capturing less than its fair share of this growth could drive AMD shares much, much higher from where they're trading now."", ""You've almost certainly heard of Visa (NYSE: V). It's the world's biggest credit card middleman, processing more than 270 billion transactions every year worth a sum total of around $15 trillion. Over 4 billion cardholders can use their Visa cards at more than 130 million places peppered across the planet. In other words, it's pretty much everywhere."", ""Simply being everywhere alone, however, isn't necessarily enough to push the underlying company's market cap to $1 trillion. What's going to make that happen here is Visa's unwavering forward progress. With the exception of the advent of the pandemic in 2020, Visa hasn't failed to produce year-over-year profit growth in any quarter since 2010, just a couple of years after it went public. Profit growth has been almost as reliable. That's impressive to be sure."", ""How? This persistent growth reflect the way Visa and its peers have turned card-based spending into a top payment choice, and even a lifestyle choice. Think about it. Older investors may recall a time when credit cards were only used for the occasional big-ticket purchase. Now they're used to facilitate the purchases of everyday things as simple as a cup of coffee, lunch, or the regular splurge at Amazon.com."", 'Look at the numbers. As recently as 10 years ago, cash was used to make 40% of U.S. consumer purchases, according to the Federal Reserve, while credit and debit cards were used a similar 42% of the time. Now cash takes care of only 17% of payments within the United States, while cards facilitate 60% of purchases.', ""We're seeing similar trends overseas as well. All of them favor Visa, which of course keeps a few cents' worth of each of these transaction's value. Cards are just too convenient to utilize these days, leaving the remainder of commerce up for grabs. And that's still a lot of remaining commerce. Ever-rising prices will help boost growth too."", ""Granted, with its current market capitalization of over $500 billion, Visa is already more than halfway to the trillion-dollar mark. Given its tailwind though, there's little reason to think it won't get there in a decade or less."", 'Last but not least, add PDD Holdings (NASDAQ: PDD) to your list of high-growth stocks that could become $1 trillion powerhouses within the coming 10 years.', ""You may be more familiar with this organization than you realize. This is the company behind Temu, the international version of China's e-commerce platform Pinduoduo. It was conceived as a means of connecting China's produce farmers (yes, fruits and vegetables) directly with consumers. As it turns out, though, the tech and premise work well for a variety of products in a variety of settings."", ""Some even argue that it's redefining, even disrupting, the online retailing business by bypassing wholesaling and giving manufacturers direct access to shoppers. More important, the model is working. PDD's third-quarter revenue was up a hefty 94% year over year, driving operating profit up 60%. Those numbers not only extend lengthening growth trends but accelerate them."", ""And the analyst community predicts comparable growth. Last year's projected top line of $33 billion is expected to be three times bigger within the next five years. Within 10 years, when Temu and Pinduoduo are everything they could be, this organization's revenue could twice be tripled."", ""Of the three stocks in question, this one's the furthest from reaching a $1 trillion market. Even with last year's heroic run-up, this company's still only worth a little less than $200 billion. It's got a long way to go.

It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. As with many other companies NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) makes use of debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?"", 'Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.', ' See our latest analysis for NVIDIA ', 'You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that NVIDIA had US$9.71b of debt in October 2023, down from US$11.0b, one year before. However, its balance sheet shows it holds US$18.3b in cash, so it actually has US$8.58b net cash.', 'We can see from the most recent balance sheet that NVIDIA had liabilities of US$9.10b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$11.8b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$18.3b in cash and US$8.31b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it can boast US$5.71b more liquid assets than total liabilities.', ""This state of affairs indicates that NVIDIA's balance sheet looks quite solid, as its total liabilities are just about equal to its liquid assets. So it's very unlikely that the US$1.47t company is short on cash, but still worth keeping an eye on the balance sheet. Succinctly put, NVIDIA boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!"", ""Even more impressive was the fact that NVIDIA grew its EBIT by 182% over twelve months. If maintained that growth will make the debt even more manageable in the years ahead. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine NVIDIA's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts."", ""Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. NVIDIA may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. Over the last three years, NVIDIA recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 81% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so."", ""While it is always sensible to investigate a company's debt, in this case NVIDIA has US$8.58b in net cash and a decent-looking balance sheet. And it impressed us with free cash flow of US$18b, being 81% of its EBIT. So is NVIDIA's debt a risk? It doesn't seem so to us. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for NVIDIA that you should be aware of before investing here."", ""If you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet."", 'Have feedback on this article?

AT&T (NYSE:T), Realty Income (NYSE:O), Exxon Mobile (NYSE:XOM) — these are some of the common names investors flock to when finding income-generating options for their portfolio.', 'But these names aren’t the only game in town and, in some cases, aren’t worth the investment beyond a little cash generation. Finding dividend aristocrats worth investing in today should balance three criteria: market stability (considering the current economic landscape), growth and expansion opportunities, and yield. Staking your cash on just one of those three parameters isn’t always enough. For example, 3M Co (NYSE:MMM) is one of the highest-yielding dividend aristocrats around. But if you’re chasing the stock for yield alone, you could get blindsided by a mountain of lawsuits affecting the stock’s bottom line.', 'That’s why yield isn’t the be-all-end-all. By comparison, these stocks have a long, fruitful future ahead while offering consistent distributions typical of the best dividend aristocrats around.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: ricochet64 / Shutterstock.com', 'Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE:SWK) is a giant among the home improvement and hardware set, owning industry notables that include DeWalt, Craftsman, and (of course) Stanley and Black & Decker. In fact, if you go to your local hardware store for power tools, chances are you’re walking out with a SWK product.', 'SWK faced some headwinds in recent months, as tightening construction markets and reduced DIY enthusiasm put a damper on product sales. But the company embarked on an aggressive series of cost-cutting initiatives, including divestitures, that should prove effective when its Q4 earnings drop early next month.', 'Those initiatives are already bearing fruit, as its Q3 earnings (released last October) saw margins climb 4% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) and an end-of-year EPS adjustment upwards to $1.40 per share at the high end. The company’s inventory management attempts also proved successful as it trimmed $300 million from its balance sheet even amid flat sales.', 'If SWK hits even the low end of its adjusted EPS range for 2023 — $1.10 — expect this dividend aristocrat to rebound in a big way.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Genuine Parts Co (NYSE:GPC) is a juggernaut in the automotive and industrial spaces, capturing two-thirds of total sales in the first category and one-third in the second. If that stat doesn’t scream stability, I don’t know what does. But, trading at just 0.86x sales, there’s a strong argument to be made that the dividend aristocrat is materially undervalued despite its sector strength.', 'The company’s last report showed decent year-over-year (YoY) revenue growth of 2.6%, but the real story was in its income expansion, which clocked in at 12.4% YoY. Likewise, management revised its end-of-year income estimate upward to $9.30 per share.', 'But beyond quarterly financials, GPC’s strength lies in its ongoing strategic capital management. Though the company’s total yield consistently clocks in at or above 3%, its payout ratio is remarkably low (42.27% as of this writing). This is notable because GPC is notoriously debt-averse. Instead, the company relies heavily on cash flow rather than leverage to fuel operational growth and return value to shareholders. This might seem like standard practice, but with many companies assuming hefty debt loads to snatch up shares in buybacks or pay off investors, GPC’s “old school” capital structure is a breath of fresh air.', 'Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com', 'In my mind, there’s no better mix of stability and growth opportunities than you’ll find with Medtronic (NYSE:MDT). I’m a healthcare mega-bull. I think it’s one of the few broad sectors worth throwing the bulk of your capital at if you can understand some of the company-specific complexities. After all, there will always be demand for healthcare, and today’s top companies usually prove adept at navigating changing trends and tech. Medtronic is no exception and truly stands out as one of the best dividend aristocrats positioned to take the leap into the next era of investments.', 'That sentiment is evident from Medtronic’s partnership with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to develop an AI-powered diagnostic platform, but it doesn’t end there. Earlier this month, CEO Geoff Martha told conference attendees, “We’re harnessing the power of AI today for use in clinical decision support, creating new indications, and delivering personalized treatments” and that Medtronic is “uniquely positioned to advance AI and medtech.”', 'Medtronic’s current total yield sits at 3.39%, with most of that coming from distributions.

The board has a scheduled monthly meeting Wednesday."", ""“There is a very, very, very politically motivated board, and I know we try not to acknowledge that, but that is a huge reason why a lot of people are leaving,” Erin O'Donnell, the district's public records administrator, said in a deposition, sections of which were filed in court last week. “Other people may have had their own issues with leadership ... but a lot of people have left just due to the entire shakeup of the district.”"", 'The governing district provides municipal services such as planning, mosquito control and firefighting in the roughly 40 square miles (100 square kilometers) in central Florida that make up Disney World.', ""DeSantis and the GOP-controlled Florida Legislature took control of the district's board last year, almost a year after Disney publicly opposed the state’s so-called don’t say gay law, which bans classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades.

The judge previously granted a delay last year at Disney's request for the same reason."", ""In court papers, Disney said DeSantis' office hadn't produced a single requested document and “relied on excuses that are as inconsistent as they are unbelievable.” Nick Meros, an attorney for the governor's office, said Tuesday that his office doesn't comment on pending litigation. In an email to Disney attorneys, filed in court papers, he said Disney's requests were “broad and unwieldy.”"", ""O'Donnell's testimony provides insight into the turmoil since the takeover of the district, which previously was controlled by Disney supporters. The departure of longtime senior leaders has hampered day-to-day operations, and morale has taken a hit, she said."", 'Some procedures that had been ad hoc have been formalized by the new leadership, she added, but the attention given to the shakeup and the backgrounds of the DeSantis appointees have been distracting.

Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 11% in the last 90 days."", ""With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies."", ' See our latest analysis for Exelon ', ""To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time."", ""Looking back five years, both Exelon's share price and EPS declined; the latter at a rate of 11% per year.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price."", 'The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 30, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This oil and gas well-drilling contractor is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.69 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -37.8%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $661.54 million, down 8.1% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 5.14% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Helmerich & Payne?', ""For Helmerich & Payne, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.24%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.', 'So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Helmerich & Payne will beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Helmerich & Payne would post earnings of $0.72 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.69, delivering a surprise of -4.17%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", ""Helmerich & Payne doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

While that’s one angle, these derivative trades can also provide income opportunities on otherwise boring stocks like Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL). Indeed, the boring and predictable nature of the consumer goods giant makes it an interesting idea for options trading. I am bullish on CL stock because it offers a little something for everyone.', 'For much of last year, most investors likely earmarked a select few enterprises that offered recession resistance. That’s not much of a controversial statement. Early in 2023, the regional banking crisis shook the market, causing even the most bullish investors to rethink their approach. Anyone interested in staying in the market during this tumultuous cycle may have turned to CL stock for obvious reasons.', 'Fundamentally, the underlying business offered permanently relevant products. No matter what’s going on with the economy, people won’t give up their oral care routine. As well, basic hygiene is a must for personal and business endeavors. Therefore, CL stock made sense no matter what the situation. And with the Federal Reserve hinting at lower interest rates later this year, Colgate could see a relevance lift.', 'Basically, should borrowing costs decline, then newly-issued government bonds (with lower yields) won’t be as attractive. Stated differently, bonds will compete less with publicly-traded securities that offer dividends. Still, the Fed would have to be extremely dovish for CL stock to look resoundingly attractive on a passive income basis.', 'Instead, Colgate is arguably most attractive for its predictable, recession-resistant business. However, the act of lowering rates implies that the Fed is satisfied with wider economic conditions. So, a good chunk of CL’s relevance has been moderately diminished.', 'At the same time, this is where options trading can come in handy. At the elementary level, retail investors can choose to take directional bets on CL stock with bought calls or puts — calls if you anticipate higher prices or puts if you anticipate lower prices.', 'However, looking at its performance since 2020, CL stock has been arguably net flat for the most part. Yes, it gyrates, but the price action tends to revert to the mean. That makes selling (writing) options quite attractive.', 'Generally, the concept of buying options is intuitive. In exchange for the right to buy (call) or the right to sell (call) the underlying security at the listed strike price, you pay a premium (the price of the option). Selling options is the same principle but in reverse. In exchange for underwriting the risk that shares can rise (sold calls) or fall (sold puts), you receive a premium.', 'That’s where the income part comes into play. For example, someone may want to place a bet with you that a certain security will rise above a defined price by a predetermined date. You believe otherwise. However, as the seller of the options (in this case, call options), you’re obligated to fulfill the terms of the contract under exercise; that is, sell 100 shares of the target security per each contract.', 'Of course, that’s a big risk to underwrite. To agree to the deal, you require an upfront payment (i.e. the premium). By logical deduction, the likelier it is that an option contract will be in the money (ITM), the higher the premium.', 'Now, in volatile securities, writing options – especially uncovered call options where you don’t already have the underlying security to cover the obligation under exercise – can be wildly risky. However, for something like CL stock, the risk is significantly mitigated. Currently, CL features a 60-month beta of only 0.44, far lower than the volatility of the benchmark equities index.', 'Therefore, astute investors can write options with a high degree of confidence that their positions won’t get blown up by unforeseen extreme volatility. For instance, on October 26 of last year, options flow data recorded 2,000 contracts of the CL Jan 17 ’25 80.00 call being sold by a major trader (or traders). The premium received for this transaction came out to just over $1 million.', 'At the time of the trade, CL stock exchanged hands at around $73.16. Now, shares are at $81.41. Sure, Colgate shares rose, but not nearly enough to cause the call writers severe anxiety.', 'While writing call options is generally a high-risk proposition due to the potential for uncapped losses (if the position is uncovered), Colgate’s financials represent another reason why such a trade could be appealing for CL stock. In particular, shares trade at a lofty trailing-year earnings multiple of 42.1x. That’s well above the household and personal products sector’s average multiple of 26.6x.', 'In fairness, Colgate’s multiple is rich in large part because of the underlying predictability. If you’re seeking a stout enterprise that can tackle recessionary storms, CL stock is it. It’s a great idea for conservative, risk-averse investors. However, because it’s so appropriate for such types, CL is ironically useful for market gamblers wanting to scalp some income.', 'Basically, Colgate probably won’t shoot to the moon. However, it also likely will not leave a massive crater should it encounter turbulence. Such consistency can be exploited – and that’s exactly what the smart money is doing.', 'Turning to Wall Street, CL stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on eight Buys, three Holds, and zero Sell ratings. The average CL stock price target is $87.33, implying 7.3% upside potential.', 'Typically, the approach to an enterprise like Colgate-Palmolive is to acquire shares as part of a reliable holding that can withstand various economic pressures, and that’s reasonable. However, with options trading, investors can also leverage the underlying predictability to generate income for relatively limited risk. Therefore, CL stock has something for everyone.', 'Disclosure']"

We have also discussed the global dental industry and its key players. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the Top 5 Countries for Dental Tourism.\xa0', 'Dental tourism, a growing trend in healthcare, involves individuals traveling to foreign countries to obtain dental services at a lower cost than in their home countries. This phenomenon is usually driven by the major disparities in dental treatment expenses across the globe, with some countries offering high-quality services at a fraction of the price. Before diving into our list of the best countries for dental tourism, we shall study the global dental industry market.\xa0', 'The global dental industry market, valued at $34,245 million in 2022, per Straits Research, is projected to witness a strong growth, reaching\xa0 $55,351 million by 2031, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.48% during the forecast period. The key drivers fueling this growth include the rising prevalence of dental diseases and increased expenditure on dental healthcare. Dental disorders, such as dental caries and periodontitis, affect a large percentage of the population, driving demand for dental products and consumables. Moreover, the dental industry benefits from the fourth-highest oral healthcare expenditure globally, amounting to $110 billion annually in the United States alone.', 'However, there are challenges like the high cost of dental care, especially in developing countries, leading to limited accessibility for low- and middle-income groups. Limited reimbursements and the expense associated with advanced dental procedures contribute to this market restraint. Despite these challenges, some opportunities arise from technological development. Geographically, the Americas dominate the market, with North America being the largest regional market and growing at a CAGR of 5.13%, fueled by a high demand for dental procedures and government initiatives supporting dental health.', 'While the United States is generally considered the best country for dentistry, Sweden is the most advanced country in dentistry while Canada is one of the countries with highest demand for dentists. Moreover, Switzerland is the country with the most expensive dental care in the world.\xa0', 'With global dentistry growing at an unprecedented pace, advancements in technology and collaborative efforts between industry leaders are reshaping the way professionals operate. For example, Dentsply Sirona Inc (NASDAQ:XRAY) and 3Shape have announced expanded workflow integrations to improve digital dentistry for professionals.

At this time, marketers must look for outside-the-box solutions to extract conversion data from offline media. TV has taken a secondary role in most marketing strategies due to the growing influence of digital marketing. Many marketers are increasing ad spending on digital mediums due to their unmatched ability to deliver personalized messages that are easy to measure.

That matches analysts\' expectations for 21% growth and would represent an acceleration from its 9% decline in 2023 -- which was caused mainly by the broader slowdown of the semiconductor market.', 'TSMC expects those headwinds to dissipate in 2024 as the company ramps up production of its latest 3nm chips, continues to sell high-end 5nm chips to a wide range of markets, and benefits from the rapid expansion of the\xa0artificial intelligence (AI) market. Analysts expect its earnings per American depositary share to grow 21% in USD terms. Those are remarkable growth rates for a stock that trades at just 18 times forward earnings.', ""TSMC remains one to two chip generations ahead of Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) in the process race to manufacture smaller, denser, and more power-efficient chips, so TSMC should remain the linchpin of the semiconductor market for the foreseeable future. That makes it one of the simplest ways to invest in the sector's long-term growth."", ""One of TSMC's top customers is Intel's rival, AMD. Unlike Intel, which manufactures most of its own chips at its own foundries, AMD outsources the production of its chips to TSMC -- and that relationship enabled it to pull ahead of Intel with more advanced chips over the past several years."", ""AMD more than doubled its share of the x86 CPU market from 17.8% to 36.3% between the fourth quarters of 2016 and 2023, according to PassMark Software, as Intel's share fell from 82.2% to 61%."", ""Analysts expect AMD's revenue to dip 4% in 2023 as it laps its acquisition of programmable chipmaker Xilinx and struggles with slower PC sales. But in 2024, they expect its revenue and earnings to rise 18% and 44%, respectively, as the PC market recovers, it sells more Instinct GPUs for data centers to counter Nvidia\xa0in the AI market, and it launches the next-gen Ryzen 8000 chips for PCs."", ""AMD's stock isn't cheap, at 47 times forward earnings after its recent rally, but it remains a promising long-term play on the growth of the PC, data center, and AI markets."", ""Micron is one of the world's leading producers of DRAM and NAND memory chips. It controls a smaller share of the memory market than Samsung and SK Hynix, but it produces denser and more power-efficient chips than the two Korean chipmakers. That's why premium device makers such as Apple\xa0use its chips."", ""Micron's revenue plunged 49% in fiscal 2023, which ended last August, as the economic headwinds intensified, its core markets cooled and some its chips were banned from key infrastructure projects across China. The company also racked up a net loss for the full year. That slowdown caused the memory chip shortage -- which had lasted throughout most of 2020 and 2022 -- to become a supply glut throughout 2023."", ""But for fiscal 2024, analysts expect Micron's revenue to rise 46% as the company significantly narrows its net loss. The company expects the PC market to stabilize and the expansion of generative AI to drive that growth."", ""For fiscal 2024, analysts expect Micron's revenue to grow 41% as it returns to profitability. Based on those expectations, Micron still seems like a bargain at 13 times its fiscal 2025 earnings -- and the company is well poised to profit from the market's insatiable appetite for more advanced memory chips across a wide range of industries."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn't one of them.

For devising an enhanced digital solutions suite, industry players often rely on mergers and acquisitions or technology investments. Favorable employment rates provide an impetus to consumer spending, which, in turn, drives transaction volumes. However, continued inflationary challenges are concerning. A significant increase in travel is likely to boost cross-border volumes of the industry participants. Companies like Visa Inc. V, Mastercard Incorporated MA, Fiserv, Inc. FI, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. FIS and Equifax Inc. EFX are well-placed to gain from the industry’s encouraging growth prospects.', 'About the Industry ', 'The Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry is part of the Financial Technology or the FinTech space, which includes companies with varying natures of businesses. The industry comprises card and payment processing, and other solutions providers, ATM services and money remittance service providers, and providers of investment solutions to financial advisors. Players in this segment operate their unique and proprietary global payment networks that link issuers and acquirers around the globe to facilitate the switching of transactions, permitting account holders to use their products at millions of acceptance locations. Monetary transactions are effectuated through these networks, offering a convenient, quick and secure payment method in several currencies across the globe. The industry is benefiting from the ongoing digitization movement triggered by the pandemic.', '4 Trends Shaping the Fate of Financial Transaction Services Space', 'Widespread Adoption of Digital Payment Methods: Owing to the growing uptake of digital means across every sphere of life, financial transaction service players came up with advanced payment solutions, such as cryptocurrency, biometrics, QR codes and buy now, pay later solutions. The hassle-free and cost-effective nature of digital payments will continue to sustain its robust hold over the global payments market in the days ahead. In addition to benefiting consumers, the growing digitization provides an opportunity for industry participants to benefit from higher transaction volumes and, subsequently, an increased revenue base. A lucrative digital solutions suite does not only aim to simplify online payments but also ensures safety in such payments by rolling out fraud-prevention services. A higher Internet penetration rate and greater use of smartphones are expected to sustain the solid demand for digital payment methods in the days ahead. Per the market and consumer data provider Statista, the Digital Payments market is anticipated to strike a total transaction value of $11.55 trillion in 2024 and see a CAGR of 9.5% over 2024-2028. This provides the perfect ground for the industry participants to capitalize on. ', 'Resilient Consumer Spending: Continued consumer spending implies increased utilization of product and service offerings of financial transaction services players. This, in turn, earns them higher revenues. Employment gains and the benefits of e-commerce shopping also drive consumer spending. In 2023, U.S. consumer spending fared well despite lingering inflation pressures. Further, favorable consumer spending boosted holiday sales in 2023, as furnished in MA’s SpendingPulse report. U.S. retail sales, excluding automotive, improved 3.1% year over year during the 2023 holiday season. Restaurant spending also climbed 7.8% year over year. These positive trends of consumer spending are creating a ray of hope for the industry participants in 2024 amid continued inflationary headwinds.Pursuit of M&A Strategies: Apart from pursuing technology investments, merger and acquisition (M&A) strategies often become the means for devising a digital solutions suite. The strategy also gives an opportunity to the industry participants to foray into new markets, expand their foothold in existing ones, broaden partner networks and increase customer base. With the Fed signaling rate cuts in 2024, borrowing costs are likely to decrease, which will make it easier for financial transaction service players to opt for loans to enter M&A deals and continually upgrade their portfolios.', 'Solid Cross-Border Volumes: Increased travel by individuals, whether for business or recreational purposes, will likely boost cross-border volumes of companies in the financial transaction services space. With industrial and business activities back on track, the strong demand for international travel is likely to sustain in the days ahead. The industry participants, having exposure to the cross-border business, devise platforms, backed by an interconnected banking network and proven expertise in the seamless processing of digital payments. Industry participants also have efficient business travel solutions in place, which make flight bookings simpler.', 'Zacks Industry Rank Instills Optimism', 'The group’s\xa0 Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects.

Harrie, Brice, Ken and I will update you on a record fourth quarter and full year 2023 results as well as other business highlights. PACCAR's outstanding employees delivered the excellent results by providing our customers with the highest quality trucks and transportation solutions in the industry. In 2023, PACCAR achieved annual revenues of $35.1 billion, net income of $4.6 billion and an after-tax return on revenue of 13.1%. All 3 were records. PACCAR's strong financial performance benefited from record deliveries of DAF, Kenworth and Peterbilt's innovative trucks, record results in our parts division and strong financial services performance. PACCAR shareholders and customers benefited from the $7.8 billion invested over the past 10 years in new products, world-class facilities and state-of-the-art technologies. PACCAR achieved 85 consecutive years of net income and has paid a dividend every year since 1941. In 2023, PACCAR declared a record $4.24 per share in dividends, including an extra cash dividend of $3.20 per share. PACCAR's fourth quarter revenues were $9 billion. Quarterly net income was a record $1.42 billion, which was 54% higher than the prior year. Fourth quarter net income included a $120 million tax provision release in Brazil. PACCAR Parts achieved fourth quarter revenues of $1.61 billion and pretax profits of $432 million. In the fourth quarter of 2023, PACCAR delivered 51,000 trucks and for the first quarter of 2024, deliveries are forecast to be around 48,000. Last year, U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck retail sales were 297,000 units. Kenworth and Peterbilt's full year deliveries increased from 96,000 to 109,000. In 2024, the U.S. economy is projected to expand within the truck sector, the vocational, less than truckload and medium-duty segments are experiencing strong demand and customers are benefiting from the superior performance of new Kenworth and Peterbilt truck models. The 2024 U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck market is forecast to be in a range of 260,000 to 300,000 vehicles. European above 16-tonne truck registrations were 343,000 last year. DAF's 2023 European deliveries increased to a record 63,000 trucks. DAF's customers appreciate the industry-leading fuel efficiency and driver comfort of DAF's premium trucks. These trucks have a unique competitive advantage in the European market due to an innovative aerodynamic design that features the largest and most luxurious cab interior. In 2024, the European economy is forecast to grow modestly. We expect the above 16-tonne truck registrations to be in the range of 260,000 to 300,000. Last year, the South American above 16-tonne truck market was 110,000 vehicles and is expected to be similar this year. In Brazil, DAF achieved a record 10.2% share, up from 6.9% last year. DAF Brazil makes a growing contribution to PACCAR's global success. PACCAR full year truck parts and other gross margins were 19.3% and were 19.4% in the fourth quarter reflecting strong truck deliveries and excellent parts business. We estimate PACCAR's worldwide first quarter truck and parts gross margins to remain strong and be in the range of 18.5% to 19%. 2023 was another great year for PACCAR with many highlights, including revenue and net income records. PACCAR announced a joint venture to manufacture commercial vehicle batteries. DAF opened a new electric truck assembly plant and earned the Green Truck award as the most fuel-efficient truck in Europe. PACCAR Parts celebrated its 50th anniversary and Kenworth celebrated its 100-year anniversary. We're looking forward to 2024 being another excellent year. Harrie Schippers will now provide an update on PACCAR Parts, PACCAR Financial Services and other business highlights. Harrie?"", 'Harrie C. A. M. Schippers', ""Thank you, Preston. In 2023, PACCAR Parts set new records for revenues and profits. Annual revenues increased by 11% to $6.4 billion and pretax profit increased by 18% to $1.7 billion. Parts gross margins climbed to 31.9%, up from 30.4% in the prior year. We estimate parts sales to grow by 3% to 5% in the first quarter of this year compared to the record first quarter last year. PACCAR Parts' excellent long-term growth reflects the benefits of investments that increase vehicle uptime and convenience for customers. PACCAR's aftermarket parts and connected services businesses provide strong profitability through all phases of the business cycle. PACCAR Parts has 18 Parts Distribution Centers or PDCs worldwide and is expanding its global distribution network with the construction of a new PDC in Massbach, Germany, which will open later this year. PACCAR Financial Services achieved a fourth quarter pretax income of $113 million. Annual pretax income was $540 million and portfolio assets increased to $21 billion. The used truck market normalized in 2023. PACCAR continues to experience good sales volumes of its premium used trucks. PACCAR Financial continues to perform well with low past dues, the larger portfolio and excellent credit quality. Last year, PACCAR invested $698 million in capital projects and $411 million in research and development. PACCAR's return on invested capital increased to an industry-leading 38%. In 2024, we're planning capital investments in the range of $700 million to $750 million and R&D expenses in the range of $460 million to $500 million as we continue to invest in key technology and innovation projects. These include next-generation, clean combustion engines, battery and hydrogen, electric powertrains, advanced driver assistance systems and new connected vehicle services. PACCAR is also investing in additional manufacturing capacity, to support future growth, including truck factory expansions at PACCAR Mexico and Kenworth Chillicothe, Ohio. A new engine remanufacturing facility in Columbus, Mississippi and (inaudible) battery cell factory joint venture. We're excited about the new Peterbilt Model 589, which began production this month. PACCAR's independent Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF dealers continue to invest in their businesses, enhancing our industry-leading distribution network and making a significant contribution to PACCAR's long-term success. PACCAR had an outstanding year in 2023 and this year it's off to a very good start. Thank you. We'd be pleased to answer your questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question today is from Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank.', 'Nicole Sheree DeBlase', 'Maybe just starting with the outlook for 1Q deliveries. Could you just talk a little bit about the implied sequential step down? Is that kind of across all regions. And then I guess is your expectation that 1Q is the high point of the year for builds given that we started to see orders fall in December?', 'R. Preston Feight', ""Well, let me take that one for the time being and say that I think what we see is strong global markets, right, Australia is doing really well. Mexico is doing really well. South America is doing really well. North America is steady at very high levels and we've seen normalization in Europe, which is probably we said the market in 2024 is 260,000 to 300,000 which is 15% to 20% lower and that's kind of what we see in our deliveries in Europe. As far as the slowdown in orders, I'm not sure I can recognize that in our major North American markets. We see good order intake and good visibility."", 'Nicole Sheree DeBlase', ""Okay. Got it. And then just from a pricing perspective, can you guys just talk a little bit about what you're seeing with respect to industry pricing and any expectations for what you guys should realize in price for 2024?"", 'R. Preston Feight', ""I mean I think what we have going on is -- and we've shared this many times but it's worth repeating is, we have refreshed our entire product lineup in the last few years. We have really high-performing products that are delivering excellent results for the customers. And I think that the latest recognition of that is the Green Truck award in Europe, for the new DAF products that were awarded as the most fuel-efficient product in Europe. As a result of that kind of performance of product, we're seeing good pricing realization for the trucks around the world for PACCAR."", 'Operator', 'Our next question today is from Angel Castillo from Morgan Stanley.', 'Angel Castillo', ""Congrats on the strong quarter. So maybe just to dig in a little bit more on kind of the pricing dynamic. I was wondering if you could kind of expand that into more of a price/cost and give a sense for how you're kind of thinking about decrementals and just underlying kind of margins for 2024 overall. I think you guided to 18.5% to 19% for the first quarter on gross margins. So maybe if you could again give a little bit more color on the full year and how we should see that progressing?"", 'R. Preston Feight', ""Yes. Well, first of all, thanks for the comment on the year. I think our team deserves an incredible amount of credit all around the world for the wonderful performance. And we see that continuing right now. On the price, cost level standpoint, Angel, we think that we have good price against cost right now. We expect that to continue as we look forward. Obviously, there's a little bit of normalization in the market sizes. That's really the only thing we see going on, both Europe -- with Europe, as I mentioned already and North America in the single digits, 5% to 10% lower market size. But we expect see good markets and good price versus cost performance. And as you know, we don't share information on the full year. We'll get to the quarter-by-quarter analysis of things as we get further into the year."", 'Angel Castillo', ""Understood. And maybe just switching over to parts a little bit. The 3% to 5% that you guided to for 2024. Just curious if you could break that down a little bit more into pieces of what you're seeing in terms of price, volume kind of assumptions."", 'Harrie C. A. M. Schippers', ""Yes, the increase was 3% to 5%. And so we see that mostly around the world. It compares to a record quarter -- first quarter last year. So at parts, we continue to see that strong performance also this year. And for the full year, we're thinking parts would grow 4% to 8% compared to the record year last year. So -- and that also reflects favorable pricing and some cost increases."", 'Operator', 'Our next question today is from Tami Zakaria from JPMorgan.', 'Tami Zakaria', 'So my first question is, I think your outlook for Europe is weaker than the U.S. and Canada this year. So can you remind us how is the margin profile for your business in those 2 regions? Is it weaker, Europe negative from a mix perspective, given the last couple of years of DAF model launches?', 'R. Preston Feight', ""Well, I don't think I would characterize it as weaker, Tami. I think I would say that in 2023, Europe was 343,000 units, which was a very, very high year, in fact, a record year for us, right, by a lot. And I think if we estimate the market at a midpoint to be 280,000, that's a nice year. I think that what we see is, obviously, the normalization of sales in that range but we still have these new products, which are providing great margins for us in the European theater."", 'Tami Zakaria', ""Got it. So are the 2 regions similar in terms of margin profile? That's basically what I'm trying to understand."", 'Harrie C. A. M. Schippers', ""Yes, more or less similar. I think Europe is a little softer, so you'd expect some effect from that in Europe. But also in Europe, the new DAF continues its premium position. And as a result, we get excellent margins on those trucks."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Chad Dillard from AllianceBernstein.', 'Charles Albert Edward Dillard', ""I was hoping you could unpack your gross margin guide of 18.5% to 19%. Maybe you can give some puts and takes of trucks versus parts. And then as you're thinking about like the full year, it sounds like parts are going to grow by mid-single digits. Should we expect gross margins in that business to continue that upward path?"", 'R. Preston Feight', ""Well, I think what we would -- and unpack, I like your term, what I would share with you is the parts business continues to do really well. Last year was a record, as we mentioned or Harrie mentioned in his comments and we expect them to have a fantastic year this year as well. So even in truck market sizes that may moderate a little bit, we see the parts business doing a fantastic job. And that's because of the expansion in new PDCs. It's because of the connectivity that we're providing in the trucks. It's because of our great dealer network. And I think all of the benefits we provide to our customers. So I expect parts to continue to hum. And on the truck side, again, great new trucks are providing good margin performance and obviously, doing a fantastic job for our customers. That's what we see out there. And that's contributing to the strong truck margins."", 'Charles Albert Edward Dillard', ""And just a second question, just on your fin co profitability. Just trying to think through the moving parts in '24, do you expect that profitability to grow. To what extent are you contemplating any buydowns or any additional reserves, given just what you're seeing in the truck market?"", 'Harrie C. A. M. Schippers', 'We saw some more normalized used truck prices in the fourth quarter. And as a result, the good performance of PACCAR Financial at $113 million for the quarter. And if we now look at this year, we expect PACCAR Financial to continue that good performance also in the quarters of this year.', 'Operator', 'Our next question today is from David Raso from Evercore ISI.', 'David Michael Raso', ""Kind of looking beyond '24, the notion of a prebuy. I'm just curious, conversations you're having today, now that we're in '24, on customers' thoughts of any pulling forward of, say, second half '26, '27 into next year. Anything at all about timing of orders to maybe reflect if we do see a prebuy in '25. Just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about that concept moving forward."", 'R. Preston Feight', ""Sure, sure. I mean let me start by saying that it's not just a truckload carrier market out there. And in the LTL, the medium duty and the vocational markets, we're seeing strong performance of the products and strong interest from the customers with good order intake. I'd also say that from an overall PACCAR standpoint, as I mentioned, our global markets are doing quite well for us. But to dial in a little bit to your question, David, what I think is happening is the good operators, the ones that are thinking clearly about long term are continuing to buy trucks. And so they're looking to keep their fleet at a reasonable age and buying trucks and continuing that pattern. And then they're managing that against the fact that contract rates and spot rates are lower than they were and trying to maintain that balance of fleet age with capital spending. And we think that's going to continue. We think that there's an emissions change in 2027 and that the sophisticated buyers are conscious of that and take that into consideration as they make their purchase plans. And that will have an increasing effect as we move forward."", 'David Michael Raso', ""But just to be clear on timing, do you think some of that desire to buy in front of that would show up in orders in '24 at all? Or is that a little premature?"", 'R. Preston Feight', ""I think it's fleet dependent. I think it depends on where they're at and what they're hauling and I think how they're doing and how many trucks they need in their fleet. So I think generalizing that into '24 might be a little much but the premise of your conversation or our conversation about does that feature into the -- later this year or next year or the year after? I think there's some truth in that. I think we see positive benefit from that."", 'Operator', 'Our next question today is from Jeff Kauffman from Vertical Research Partners.', 'Jeffrey Asher Kauffman', 'Well, first of all, congratulations, fantastic year.', 'R. Preston Feight', 'Jeff, thank you for that. Our team appreciates it.', 'Jeffrey Asher Kauffman', ""You guys crushed it. I want to ask about 2 kind of oddities, if I can. I don't want to focus on the tail wagging the dog but I think they're relevant questions. The first has to do with what's going on with electric vehicles right now. And it seemed like there was this big push for EV and you're still seeing that in some of the lighter duty models but a little bit of a pullback on the heavy side. But we are moving forward with the EV plan for batteries and we're moving forward with investment. What is your feeling about the state of the EV market? And is this a surprise at all? Is this expected? How should we be thinking about framing EV demand for commercial vehicles? ."", 'R. Preston Feight', ""Jeff, I think you nailed it. Actually, I think that there was maybe a lot of enthusiasm, maybe too much enthusiasm. I think it's something that is going to happen. It's going to happen gradually rather than rapidly. There's a lot of things that have to come along with it, energy and infrastructure from a PACCAR standpoint. It's been our approach all along. As we've shared with you over the years, it's right. We'd start in the 10s, move to the hundreds, go to the thousands, that's the progression we're in. We continue to make prudent investments that will be timed to what we think the adoption rates are going to be. We felt in 2023 was the right time to make sure that looking into the future, we could begin the journey of creating our own batteries. So that we had the most cost-efficient, high-performing batteries when the time was right. So I think as we talked about in the last call, building a battery cell factory in a joint venture manner will give us sufficient volume to supply our needs throughout the rest of the decade as we gradually adopt. And it puts PACCAR in a really good position to offer our customers the best products they can get when they're looking for EVs and keep up with the regulatory and also take a thoughtful approach to the adoption."", 'Jeffrey Asher Kauffman', ""And then the second one, I'm expecting kind of a no comment on this one but I'm going to ask anyway. The last time we had a certain Republican President, there were some EPA mandates that ended up being canceled and rolled back and who knows what the future holds. But I think there's a industry think that there is a certainty about a massive 2026 prebuy. And I think everyone is kind of thinking about that. I know it was part of David Raso's question earlier. Do your political people think there's any risk if there's a Republican victory and we get a certain presidential candidate back that any of these EPA mandates might be at risk or CARB mandates might be at risk?"", 'R. Preston Feight', 'Jeff, I think you nailed it. We have no comment on that. All I can say is that -- we feel really good about PACCAR either way.', 'Jeffrey Asher Kauffman', ""Exactly. We're going to drive the road we see in front of us. I get it."", 'Operator', 'Our next question today is from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.', 'Jerry David Revich', ""I'm wondering if you could just talk about the record gross margin performance you folks had in '23, was despite really significant supply chain disruptions continuing. Can you talk about just directionally where your labor hours per unit today versus their targets? And is there a potential for things like factory overhead expense, et cetera, to turn to be a tailwind on a year-over-year basis as surety of deliveries ramp up and maybe productivity ramps up?"", 'R. Preston Feight', ""Yes. It's a fun conversation to have with you. I think first of all, our hats off to the supply base. They've done a really good job of trying to work through the challenges. And I think as you note, things have become improved, maybe not perfect but improved, which is good. We're used to that.And I think as we look at it, smoother factories are more efficient factories. And so as we look into '24, if we have a smoother supply provided to the factories, we will have benefits in that regard. So it could be a tailwind as you word it."", 'Jerry David Revich', ""Very interesting. And another area where you folks have worked through even as you put up record margins is higher warranty costs because of higher per repair cost trends, can you talk about whether you expect to return to that 1.5% warranty accrual rate in '24? Or are there still things that you're working on in terms of per-unit repair costs or other moving pieces in the warranty provisions?"", 'R. Preston Feight', ""Well, I can say that we have a great group of analysts who understand our business well because I think that your question is salient and is true. Like we've seen increasing truck complexity over the decades as an industry, with more electronics on them, that contributes to more opportunities. But we do think that the trucks are performing well and we'll be in that kind of normal range again."", 'Jerry David Revich', ""Okay. Super. And lastly, on parts, really strong performance in the fourth quarter and the outlook for the first quarter is certainly higher than what we had in our model and what we're seeing for other companies. Can you just touch on how you folks have managed the parts delivery time frame in the first quarter of '23 because I think for most companies, the first quarter is going to be a really tough comp that saw inventory stocking in the first quarter of '23. It doesn't sound like you folks have faced that but can you just spend a minute just addressing how you folks were able to avoid stocking in the first quarter of last year?"", 'Harrie C. A. M. Schippers', ""So you're spot on, Jerry. We've -- 3% to 5% growth this quarter compared to the record quarter last year, is a nice performance. It reflects, really reflects all the fantastic things our parts team is doing. They're focusing on technology that makes it easy to the buy from us, the e-commerce technology, the MDI, where we manage the dealer's inventory and make sure the parts are available when needed. Our continuous investments in parts distribution centers. The strong performance of the PACCAR engine that provide us more proprietary parts. So it just all adds up and we've been seeing some nice trends on parts over the years as a result of these and we expect those to continue into this year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Steven Fisher from UBS.', 'Steven Fisher', 'Just as we think about 2024, how much visibility do you have on the truck outlook? Like how well are you booked into Q1 and Q2. I imagine Q1 is pretty solidly booked and maybe even Q2 at this point but curious also about the second half. And what are your customers kind of telling you about later in the year?', 'R. Preston Feight', ""Yes, as you know, Q1 is effectively full and Q2 is filling in very nicely. As we look out, there's obviously customers -- lots of customers buy full year with spread delivery. So we see some growing backlog in the second half as well and things feel pretty healthy."", 'Steven Fisher', ""Okay. Great. And then can you talk about the cost inflation that you're seeing, both on the direct and the indirect side. Is it safe to assume that, that maybe in line with the overall inflation in the economy, maybe you still have some puts and takes in various directions but it kind of nets out to the overall level of inflation in the economy. And then if that's the case, is the pricing strategy to sort of just cover those costs? Or do you have maybe some additional cost reduction programs aimed at sort of trying to preserve margins in 2024? I know you always have some efficiency things that you have going on but I'm curious if this is a year to sort of step up the cost reductions if you're only able to cover inflation with your pricing."", 'R. Preston Feight', ""I think inflationary, we're experiencing the same things as most people are with inflation, as it's moderated some and we do see inflationary costs. And obviously, we try to acknowledge that in our pricing and we do focus on reducing cost on the product, that's a continuous thing we do. And our teams are fully focused on it and I think going to do a good job on it this year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Tim Thein from Citigroup.', 'Timothy W. Thein', ""Just one for me and it's just on the truck business and specifically on mix. And there was one asked earlier about geographic mix. But I'm curious about from the standpoint of kind of product and customer from an environment where you're selling more straight trucks which is probably additive but also medium duty and sleepers. If that -- those become a bigger percentage of the deliveries relative to the sleepers, is there a -- is there much of a -- should we think about that as being accretive, headwind to margin neutral? Any comment on that? And then I guess just, I guess, part B of that is from a customer standpoint, if you have a dynamic where your larger carriers are representing more of the order board in '24. How too does that -- should we think about that -- presumably more of a headwind but any way to kind of think about those 2 factors?"", 'R. Preston Feight', ""Tim, what I think is going on is, we're seeing that over the last couple of years, we've probably been, as an industry not able to supply everyone the trucks they needed. And I think that there's a strong vocational market, a strong LTL market, a strong medium-duty market. So we're now kind of able to build those trucks and we're seeing that as a different percentage and increased percentage in our backlog. I wouldn't differentiate them in margin. They can both be good margin products for us. On a percentage basis, yes. And then I think that as far as the larger carriers and the impact of it, I think that it's really not that different than many years, right? It's not substantially different. So we don't see anything dramatically affecting our model. We've had some of the biggest carriers ordering a lot of trucks and we've had some small carriers ordering trucks. But it's all kind of within the normal boundary."", 'Operator', 'Our next question today is from Matt Elkott from TD Cowen.', 'Matthew Youssef Elkott', 'If I can go back to the order question, the demand question, it seems you guys continue to see stronger demand and stronger orders in North America than the industry orders we see on a monthly basis. Is this still primarily a function of your higher vocational mix? Or are you gaining tractions in other areas that were not super aware of?', 'R. Preston Feight', ""We are the vocational market leader. So there is some benefit in that. And as I mentioned too, I think our teams have done a great job over the last several years developing a new product lineup, which is the newest in the industry, which is helpful to us and I think has given us good backlog. If you think about it, at the fundamental level, we tied up in a lot of different things. But at the fundamental level, our goal is to build great trucks for our customers to provide them the lowest total cost of ownership. And when they do that, then they order the trucks. And we think we're doing that well. The products are performing well. They're the best in the industry and that's contributing to our order visibility."", 'Matthew Youssef Elkott', ""And just one follow-up question. As we look into a mild decline in production this year, do you think you'll do more vertical integration of engines to kind of cut costs? Or is that something that is independent of the cycle?"", 'Harrie C. A. M. Schippers', ""Yes. With the -- we've built a record number of trucks last year. MX engines that is for North America, Europe worldwide, I would say. Yes and the investments that we've been continuing to make in our engine manufacturing capacity. We -- that will help us to grow engine penetration in North America this year. That's very good position to grow that percentage this year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Scott Group from Wolfe Research.', 'Scott H. Group', ""So you talked about used prices normalizing in Q4. I'm just curious your outlook for used prices from here, if you think we're bottoming yet or if you think there's further risk on used."", 'R. Preston Feight', 'Harrie, do you have any thoughts on that?', 'Harrie C. A. M. Schippers', ""Used truck prices did come down in North America and Europe during the year. Right now, I think in the fourth quarter, North America came down low single digit. And we do see some stabilization happening at these levels. That's why we expect things to continue at a normal level that where used trucks are maybe at breakeven, that kind of level. That's a reasonable projection, I think."", 'R. Preston Feight', ""The only thing I'll add is that volumes continue to be good in that space as well. So we watch both price and volume and it seems like it's a big change from what it was but it's still not at a bad level."", 'Harrie C. A. M. Schippers', ""It's more normal now."", 'R. Preston Feight', 'Yes.', 'Scott H. Group', ""Okay. And then just more theoretical on this sort of record gross margin, price/cost spread. I totally understand when you guys are saying with new products but it also just strikes me, this is a pretty consolidated market. And in an environment like we've seen in the last couple of years with heightened inflation, is it just that maybe you and others just got enlightened to the fact that you maybe had more pricing power than maybe you previously thought? Is that right? Is that what's happening? And ultimately, is that -- do you think that's sustainable? Is this ultimately just a new range of gross margin?"", 'R. Preston Feight', ""My view is that the team of PACCAR people around the world, whether in the factories or the engineers or the controllers, organizations over the last several years have done a fantastic job of building a really robust business. And it's lean, it's efficient and it produces great products for our customers. And I think that's the driving force between the margins that were generated as parts business, it's the truck business. That strength and focus of serving our customers and our shareholders are working really well."", 'Scott H. Group', 'So in your mind, the high teens is the new sort of normal?', 'R. Preston Feight', ""Well, what we shared with you is, the first quarter we think is 18.5% to 19%. And that's pretty darn good."", 'Scott H. Group', 'Yes, for sure.', 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Michael Feniger from Bank of America.', 'Michael J. Feniger', ""Obviously, the pricing in 2023 was very impressive. I know you talked a little bit about the used market. I'm curious when we look at the spread between your price increases for 2024 relative to what you're seeing in the used market with trade-ins, was that spread widening? Just any commentary that you're seeing in the used market that kind of informs 2024? Because obviously, the used market was very strong few years ago. It seems like there's some cooling. But I'm just curious how we think about that spread between the new pricing they use and how to kind of think about that for 2024."", 'R. Preston Feight', ""Well, I think what's -- maybe one of the things you could throw into your factors of consideration is the fact that in those high point markets where contract rates were at all-time high, spot rates were at all-time high, some people got into the trucking business and some of those people are getting out and that's contributing to the spread between new and used pricing, as you have -- some of those people exiting the market is normalizing the used truck pricing. So I think there is a bit of a larger differential between new and used and I think that will reset itself over time."", 'Michael J. Feniger', 'And just to follow up. Another different customers in the transportation market who buy your trucks, you put up excellent truck deliveries in 2023 at a time where spot freight rates were actually falling. And now that we see spot freight rates potentially bottoming and maybe picking up through 2024, how do we kind of think about what happened in 2023 and how that might potentially play out in 2024 and how that kind of translates to demand for your trucks?', 'R. Preston Feight', ""Well, one of the underlying contemplation should be that what's the economy doing? And as we noted in our commentary, we see economic growth in 2024, which we think, as the most fundamental principles should be good for the truck market, especially as we continue through the year. And you put that economic growth against that spot rate bottoming that you talked about and it should set us up for a good year in 2024."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Guillermo Herrera from Gabelli Funds.', 'Guillermo Herrera', ""So maybe more of a high-level one here than the ones we've been talking through so far. But -- you've been doing a great job generating cash and there's a sizable cash position on the balance sheet right now. I'm curious, aside from dividend payouts, how should we think about how you might deploy some of that cash? And maybe just to get a little bit more specific here, could you provide us sort of any commentary on the M&A space and whether longer term, you might be considering inorganic growth as part of the growth story."", 'R. Preston Feight', ""Sure thing. We're really pleased with how the company has performed financially. We have a strong history of dividend payouts of around 50% of net income. We continue to do that. We noted in our comments, record dividend payouts in 2023. We think our shareholders are happy with that approach. We'll continue to do that. We do have uses for cash. Obviously, we are doing this joint venture, which will be something we fund out of cash. PACCAR has got a long history of making strategic acquisitions when they make sense and we continue to make those evaluations at all times. And having the cash gives us that flexibility to build an even more robust company as we move forward into the future."", 'Operator', 'Our last question today is from Daniel Johansson from Pan Advisors. Daniel, please can you check if you unmuted lately.', 'Daniel Johansson', 'Can you hear me?', 'R. Preston Feight', 'Yes, we can, Daniel.', 'Daniel Johansson', ""Sorry, maybe this has already been discussed. And I guess the question is, has a lot of different levels to think about. But thinking about your cost per unit and how that has been going up a little bit here over the last few years? I mean, there's mix, there is more content per unit, et cetera, et cetera. But how to think about that going forward? And especially so given that you had pretty high capacity utilization last year."", 'R. Preston Feight', ""Well, I think about costs in terms of -- there's the normal inflationary side of it. I think the other side of it to contemplate is, we're building trucks that are more efficient than they ever have been for our customers. Sometimes that efficiency comes with higher purchase price but as a percentage of their total operating costs, the purchase price is not significant compared to the fuel utilization. So it's beneficial to PACCAR in that way and beneficial to our customers to have high-performing products that are very efficient even if that drives up purchase price. And then another element to that is, of course, regulatory. As you anticipate future regulatory changes, those typically come with added componentry to meet emission standards, which is also a factor in increasing cost and price. So those are some of the things that go into that cost equation for us. And we've seen price more than keep up with that."", 'Daniel Johansson', 'And should we expect cost per unit to continue to go up, you think, even in a very good volume scenario?', 'R. Preston Feight', ""I think they could. It depends on the inflationary state. It depends on the state of competition and whether there's more added content that has to be added to the trucks."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. This is the end of the Q&A session. So I'd now like to hand back for any further or closing remarks."", 'Ken Hastings', ""We'd like to thank everyone for joining the call and thank you, operator."", 'Operator', ""Thank you, everyone, for joining today's call.

The consensus mark remained stable over the past week. The consensus estimate for fourth-quarter revenues of $16 billion indicates a 13.1% jump from the year-ago reported figure.', 'American Express beat the consensus estimate for earnings in two of the trailing four quarters and missed twice, with the average surprise being 0.1%. This is depicted in the graph below:', 'American Express Company price-eps-surprise | American Express Company Quote', 'Before we get into what to expect for the to-be-reported quarter in detail, it’s worth taking a look at AXP’s previous-quarter performance first.', 'In the last reported quarter, the globally integrated payments company’s adjusted earnings per share of $3.30 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.5%, thanks to continued business momentum, better volumes and higher card member spending. Increased compensation costs and higher operating and customer engagement costs partially offset the positives.', 'Now, let’s see how things have shaped up before the fourth-quarter earnings announcement.', 'American Express is expected to have experienced strengthened network volumes in the fourth quarter, extending a trend observed over the past several quarters. This increase is likely attributable to increased total billed business and processed volumes. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter total network volumes indicates 6.9% year-over-year growth from $413.3 billion.', 'Discount revenues, a significant revenue driver for AmEx, are likely to have been supported by a relatively resilient consumer spending level. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter Discount revenues indicates 7.4% year-over-year growth.', 'In the fourth quarter, Travel and Entertainment (T&E) is anticipated to have sustained its growth trend, resulting in increased T&E-related spending. Further, fees, commissions and other revenues are expected to have improved, driven by an upturn in travel-related income. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter International Card Services pre-tax income is pegged at $146 million, a significant improvement from the year-ago period’s loss of $15 million.', 'Cards-in-force is likely to have witnessed an uptick in the quarter under review. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter total cards-in-force indicates a 5.4% year-over-year increase. The consensus mark for the average fee per card indicates 15.8% year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. The consensus estimate for average Worldwide Card Member Loans also implies 17.1% year-over-year growth.', 'AmEx’s interest income, the second-largest revenue contributor, is likely to have risen on higher loan disbursements. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AXP’s interest income suggests an upside of almost 37.5% from the year-ago reported figure of almost $4 billion. Also, the consensus mark for Global Merchant and Network Services’ pre-tax income indicates a 22.2% year-over-year increase.', 'The factors mentioned above are expected to have positioned American Express for significant year-over-year growth. However, an increase in expenses, card member rewards, marketing and business development costs are likely to have dampened profit margins, somewhat offsetting the positive aspects.', 'Fourth-quarter client engagement costs are likely to have increased due to higher network volumes, along with rising compensation and service costs, making an earnings beat uncertain. The consensus estimate for average proprietary basic card member spending in commercial services indicates a 3.5% year-over-year decline. Also, a hefty provision for credit losses is likely to have impacted the results. We expect rainy-day funds to have significantly increased in the fourth quarter.', 'Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for American Express this time around.

', 'Last year, the medtech industry benefited from a “huge backlog of patients and pent-up demand, particularly for knee and hip replacements,” said Ryan Zimmerman, an analyst with BTIG. The year also brought big spine mergers, including the $3.1 billion tie-up between Globus Medical and Nuvasive, as well as planned spinoffs in the sector. ', 'Going into 2024, orthopedics companies face questions about whether they expect the procedure backlog to continue, how they’re pricing equipment amid inflation and tight hospital budgets, and how new technologies will shape the market. ', 'MedTech Dive interviewed orthopedics executives and surgeons about their expectations for this year. Here are five trends they’re watching:', 'Orthopedic procedures were delayed during the pandemic, as they were considered elective surgeries. The resulting backlog has led to strong demand for knee replacements, hip replacements and other surgeries, benefiting companies including Stryker and Zimmer Biomet last year. ', 'Whether that backlog continues through 2024 remains to be seen, but companies said they are not including it in their forecasts. Zimmer CEO Ivan Tornos expects a “wonky” first quarter, and “as we think about the rest of the year, we don’t count on backlog,” he told investors at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco earlier this month. ', '“For a while, [the backlog] was massive. Patients were coming in every day... I still think we are seeing some of it.”', 'Michael Ast', 'Orthopedic surgeon and chief medical innovation officer at HSS', ""“We don't think it is as meaningful as other people expect,” Tornos said. “It’s not that you can bring all of those patients every quarter.” "", 'Aldo Denti, group chairman for Johnson & Johnson’s Depuy Synthes, also expects the backlog to be less of a factor later in the year.', '“In orthopaedics, we see tailwinds in the first few quarters of the year but expect procedural volumes to normalize towards the back half of the year,” Denti wrote in an email to MedTech Dive. ', 'Michael Ast, an orthopedic surgeon and chief medical innovation officer at the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) in New York, said that the backlog has slowed down. ', '“For a while it was massive. Patients were coming in every day,” Ast said. “I still think we are seeing some of it.” ', 'The high freight expenses, supply chain instability and inflationary pressures that drove up costs last year have started to stabilize, BTIG’s Zimmerman said. ', '“A lot of companies have put pricing increases in place to account for the inflationary impact that we’ve seen,” he said in an interview. ', 'Sometimes, companies have been able to push back on providers or offer new products that have a higher average sale price, which investors view as a positive, Zimmerman added. ', 'Brad Cannon, global president of orthopaedics for Smith & Nephew, said inflation has affected every part of the industry. ', '“Sometimes, your prices are being increased and sometimes you’re passing them along,” Cannon said. “You just want to be really diligent and conscientious about it.” ', 'The company is focused on solutions that can help facilities with productivity and reduce costs. But when it comes to outright price, that’s tied to the market, according to Cannon. ', ""“We're doing a lot of work with our suppliers to try to take cost out of the system to make sure that there are fewer costs to pass along. But the reality is there's tremendous, tremendous pressure still and inflationary pressure that we're having to absorb and or make plans for.”"", 'Brad Cannon', 'Global president of orthopaedics for Smith & Nephew', 'On the provider side, that results in difficult decisions about what types of devices to pursue. Bill Ritchie, a surgeon with New Mexico Orthopaedic Associates, recently had a meeting about a new implant to assist with rotator cuff tears. ', '“It is so expensive that the company themselves tells us that if you want to do this, do it at the hospital, where the reimbursement is higher,” Ritchie said. ', 'At a physician-owned ambulatory surgery center, “not only could I not get this by our exec board, but I wouldn’t want to lose money on it.” ', 'HSS’ Ast said rising costs and pressure from insurers also puts pressure on device companies. ', '“It’s not like manufacturers can go sell to someone else,” Ast said. “The problem is, if you show up at the hospital and ask for a 40% increase in price because it costs you more to do, those products will never get to the patients, because the hospitals simply can’t afford it.” ', 'The onus is on device manufacturers to prove that the extra expense of a new technology is worth it, Ast added. ', 'Orthopedics companies currently offer surgical robots for knee, hip and spine procedures, and are working on expanding into other indications. Zimmer and Stryker are both working on robotic systems for shoulder replacements.', 'Stryker executives said in September that they expect to have the shoulder indication by the end of 2024. Zimmer hasn’t provided a specific timeline but has “repeatedly expressed a commitment to being the first company with a robotic shoulder system in the U.S.,” BTIG’s Zimmerman wrote in a research note. ', 'Currently, Stryker holds the majority share in shoulder replacements at 27%, followed by Zimmer (17%) and J&J (14%), Zimmerman wrote. ', 'J&J’s Denti said the company is working on developing new applications for its Velys robot for spine and partial knee replacement, and he expects the latter to “address many unmet needs our competitor systems are not addressing.” ', 'Since J&J launched its Velys robot in the U.S. in 2021, about 13% of Attune primary knees have been robotically enabled, Denti said, making the system “an indispensable enabler of growth for our business.” ', 'Another company, called Canary Medical, has been partnering with Zimmer to put sensors in knee implants that can measure patients’ gait, steps and range of motion. The “smart” knee implant has been in a limited launch since it was cleared by the FDA in 2021, as the companies collect enough data to show where a patient is in their recovery using these metrics and flag physicians if a patient seems to be falling behind. ', 'In the future, Canary CEO Bill Hunter sees the potential for preoperative monitoring, robotics and postoperative technology to work together. ', ""“Someday our knee needs to talk to the Rosa robot and influence whether or not you do a particular procedure,” Hunter said. “I think that's what you're going to see over the next few years, is that all these interesting technologies … need to be meshed together in order to harness the true power of all this data collection.” "", 'HSS’ Ast described this ability to help patients achieve their goals using this data, from deciding on the type of surgery to the positioning of the implant, as the “holy grail of orthopedic procedures.” ', '“What excites me more than any particular technology or particular implant is the ability to start quantifying what we do, gathering data in aggregate and starting to learn how to make better decisions for patients over time,” Ast said. ', 'Today, more hip and knee replacements are done in hospital outpatient departments and ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs). The shift has been driven in part by the pandemic and changes to Medicare payment policies. ', 'At a hospital like HSS, for example, about 30% of hip and knee surgeries are done outpatient, said Ast, who does the majority of his surgeries in that setting. Before the pandemic, that number was closer to 1%. ', 'Eventually, Ast expects about half of hip and knee replacements will be done outpatient. The exception is revision surgeries, which require complex medical care. ', 'Ritchie, whose practice has a partial ownership stake in an ASC called New Mexico Surgery Center Orthopaedics, also expects the number of procedures done in surgery centers to increase over time. ', 'Ritchie said procedures “are substantially up,” and have been increasing every year — except for 2020.', '“In our group, probably close to 90% of knee replacements are done at the surgery center,” Ritchie said. “I think shoulders will grow fairly close to that.” ', 'Last year, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services added total shoulder replacements to its ASC-approved list, meaning Medicare started covering the procedure in that setting in January. ', ""“I've been doing a fair number of [shoulders] outpatient, but not a majority,” Ritchie said. He expects that to change. "", 'Device makers have been catering to ASCs with dedicated sales teams. Zimmer’s Tornos said the company has more than 500 contracts with ASCs around the U.S. About 10%-15% of the company’s sales are in an ASC, and about a third of robots are placed in an ASC. ', 'J&J’s Denti expects upwards of 20%-30% of all orthopedic procedures to be done in ASCs in the next decade. ', '“We estimate up to 15-20% of our Joint Reconstruction procedures are already occurring in the ASC setting,” he wrote in an email. “We believe that the hip and knee penetration in ASCs is 10-15% currently and that will continue to climb over the next 3-5 years.” ', 'Michael Carter, general manager of Medtronic spine and biologics, also expects the shift of spine procedures into ASCs to “continue at a moderate pace.” ', 'Most of those procedures are in the cervical spine space, while fewer are in thoracic and lumbar, Carter wrote in an email. ', 'Last year brought several changes to the spine market as companies announced planned mergers and divestments. Globus completed its $3.1 billion purchase of Nuvasive, Orthofix and SeaSpine merged, and Zimvie announced plans to sell its spine business for $375 million less than two years after spinning out of Zimmer. ', 'The changes have “created opportunity for many other players who are seen as more stable,” Zimmerman said in an interview. He listed Medtronic’s spine business and Alphatec Spine as two companies that have been able to capitalize on the disruption.', ""“It's not just a shuffling of the deck. There is consolidation going on in larger players who would offer enabling technology and ecosystems,” Zimmerman said. "", 'Medtronic Spine has gained market share in the past two years, and “our trajectory points towards further solidifying our position as a market leader throughout 2024 and beyond,” Carter wrote in an email. ', 'He added that “It is a really exciting time in Spine and we welcome all the dynamic changes that we are seeing in the market.” ', 'This story was originally published on MedTech Dive.

We're not going to walk away from that.”"", 'Lawton cited the most recent American Customer Satisfaction Index survey, which showed Tractor Supply and Ace Hardware tied for the highest level of customer satisfaction in their segment.', '“We want to double down on that and increase our customer service levels even more,” he said.', 'A decade ago, Tractor Supply developed a tech assistant dubbed “Gura,” which stands for “greet, uncover, recommend and ask.” With the help of Microsoft’s Azure, Gura has evolved into a knowledge tool that can respond to a store associate who needs information in the moment, much like Apple’s Siri or Amazon’s Alexa.', 'Lawton witnessed the tool in action during a store visit in Georgia, when a customer asked about pet food for dogs with sensitive skin. Gura let the store associate know which dog foods might work for the customer, and which were in inventory at that store. The associate can then ask questions that might narrow down the choice, and get SKU and price information.', ""“So they can then do a consultative sale and show that to the customer if they'd like,” Lawton said. “But [it] became a huge, almost immediate win with our team members.”"", 'Similarly, about a quarter of the company’s 2,200 or so stores are getting smart camera upgrades. That will allow the devices to not only monitor for theft, but also let associates know if a customer needs assistance or a checkout line has grown long.', ""“It's monitoring a customer's dwell time, it's monitoring their activity,” he said, noting that the tech will let associates know if a customer is looking at a riding lawn mower brochure or looking under the hood and may be ready for a consultation."", 'Tractor Supply, which has grown from a farm supply catalog to a chain that caters to a range of customers,\xa0is also expanding in more old-fashioned ways, Lawton said.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on navigating the dynamic landscape of the growing US chocolate industry, you may go to 5 Highest Quality Chocolate Brands in the US. ', 'The US chocolate industry currently stands at an estimated $26 billion as affirmed by a\xa0report by Bloomberg. Volumes were forecast to increase by 1.9% by the end of 2023 according to Euromonitor International Ltd. This rise in chocolate spending seems to be counter-intuitive given that as that White House affirms, most predictors were expecting the economy to face a recession in 2023.', 'However, in reality, the US economy picked up significantly in the third quarter of 2023 and ended up with a 2.6% real growth rate. This rise in growth rate has come with a rise in prices for most goods, and chocolate is no exception to this. The same report by Bloomberg affirmed data by Nielson which highlighted that despite volumes of chocolate sold being down 4%, there has been a rise of 10% in overall sales. This indicates a rise in prices and consumers purchasing chocolate despite it.', '“Chocolate plays a really special role for people — as an indulgence, as a treat and as a reward. The emotional value that the category (chocolate) brings to consumers is one that justifies the additional price increases.”', '-Global head of insights at Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ)', 'The above quote indicates that any competitor looking to position itself well in the chocolate industry of the US may not be bothered as much by pricing. To that end, while we know the US chocolate industry boasts a large market size and is resiliently growing, the question then is: how can a chocolate brand differentiate itself from other brands and take a sizeable chunk of this market? One answer to this question is quality. It is estimated that there are already around 3000 chocolate production businesses in the US, which means consumers have no scarcity of options when they go out looking for quality chocolates. Especially as we look at the premium chocolate categories, consumers are ever-concerned for finding the best sweet money can buy.', 'In addition, while previously these consumers may have viewed chocolate as a sweet reward to indulge in with some guilt of its health harms, there is an increasingly popular view that chocolate, with high enough quality, may be good for you. This report by the National Institute of Health establishes that chocolate may be associated with a short-term reduction in blood pressure and cholesterol, and improvement of insulin sensitivity. However, it remains clear that the purity and quality of ingredients used in the chocolate play an important role in this link.', 'Various chocolate aficionados know good chocolate when they see it. Good chocolate does not taste frozen or spicy, and breaks off with a crisp. However, in getting more specific with defining good chocolate, we should first note that it needs very little ingredients for its quality to be good. Tim Spector, a famous British epidemiologist and author of the book “Food For Life” highlights that choosing the best quality dark chocolate with high levels of cocoa and only three or four ingredients is your best bet for getting the highest quality of chocolate. “The purest form of dark chocolate is made simply by mixing cocoa solids and cocoa butter with sugar.”', 'A close-up of hands deftly moulding a bar of chocolate.', 'This understanding of the significance of quality in the chocolate market of US led us towards trying to systematically rank its 15 highest quality chocolate brands. To this end, we used the ‘cocoa percentage’ or the measurement of total weight of the chocolate bar that comes from actual cocoa beans (including cocoa liquor and cocoa butter) to rank the brands given below. The highest cocoa percentage variety is used from each brand. As a secondary metric if two chocolates ranked equally in cocoa percentage, we then decided rankings based on the chocolate’s popularity by noting the brands annual revenue (in years 2022-2023).', 'Note: All of these brands are not necessarily US-based. But all of these maintain a meaningful market presence in the US.', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY) also boasts an impressive portfolio of more than 90 products ranging from sugar-free chocolate bars to their bite-sized Hershey’s Kisses. However, from this impressive portfolio, the highest percentage of cocoa is found in their Extra Dark Chocolate Bar which allows it to earn its place as the 14th highest-quality chocolate available in America according to our research.', 'Cocoa Percentage: 62%', 'Whittaker’s is one of the oldest brands of modern-day chocolate bars. Established in 1896 and operating from New Zealand, this chocolate giant has found a market in the confectionary’s aficionados in America. Those that know of Whittaker’s, know of their attention to quality and the brand is ordered online even when it is not found in on-ground stores. Their Dark Cocoa is the highest cocoa percentage variant in their chocolate portfolio and helps it rank 13th on our list.', 'Cocoa Percentage: 70%', 'Hu Kitchen started off as a premium snacks and confectionaries brand in 2018.\xa0Hu made such an impact by its quality of chocolates that Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) , arguably one of the biggest confectionary conglomerates of the world took a minority stake in it initially in 2019 and then acquired it later in 2021. Regardless of this acquisition, the Hu Kitchen brand has maintained their quality in dark chocolates which earns them their high position on our list.', 'Cocoa Percentage: 70%', 'Cadbury and Hu Kitchen, although different brands, belong to the same parent company of Mondelez International, Inc.

Retailers that wish to keep or grow their current market share by becoming leading omni-channel players need to launch eGrocery offerings early to gain the necessary expertise. The research and survey responses underscore that online grocery retailing will progressively penetrate the traditional market in the coming decade. Although brick-and-mortar stores will retain a substantial market share, their revenue, and profitability will face erosion as consumers increasingly embrace the convenience of new digital services.

However, a potential bright spot in this uncertainty is the growing popularity of private label items.

As an investor, you can snag a piece of the action in these businesses and benefit from their growth trajectory through the decades.', ""Investors don't need to have a huge wad of cash to start buying great stocks, either. Even if it's a few hundred dollars a month, steadily putting cash into stocks and consistently growing their positions can help investors generate meaningful returns over time."", 'Here are two such super stocks that disappointed investors in five years will look back on and wish they had bought shares in.', 'Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) continues to strengthen its foothold in the rare disease treatment industry with a robust lineup of drugs as well as a promising pipeline that could dominate multiple underserved markets. The company already has a chokehold on the cystic fibrosis treatment space, a market set to reach a valuation of $37 billion by 2030, according to some analyst estimates.', ""The reason for Vertex's dominance in this space is very simple: The company is the only one that has approved drugs on the market that treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis. It has four drugs that serve this function, which brought in combined revenue of $8.9 billion in 2022, $7.6 billion in 2021, and $6.2 billion in 2020. These four drugs have also enabled Vertex to grow its annual profits by more than 40% in the trailing three-year period alone."", ""The expansion of its drugs' use cases to younger and younger cohorts of patients has opened up Vertex's opportunity within the vast addressable market for cystic fibrosis treatments. The company is developing a cystic fibrosis drug with Moderna that's designed specifically for patients who can't take drugs in its existing lineup, a cohort of individuals that management currently numbers at around 5,000."", 'Vertex is also working on stem cell therapies for diabetes, a non-opioid drug for acute pain ailments that could disrupt the existing pain management market, and a drug for patients with the genetic illness APOL1-mediated kidney disease, which if it gets the regulatory green light, would be the first drug approved to treat the underlying cause of this disease. The biggest news that investors should be following with this stock right now, though, is the ongoing approvals for Casgevy, the gene-editing therapy it developed with CRISPR Therapeutics.', ""Casgevy was recently approved in the U.S. and the U.K. for transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (TDT) and sickle cell disease (SCD), and approvals are ongoing in other key markets. The European Union's regulatory decision for Casgevy is expected in the coming months. Both TDT and SCD are potentially deadly diseases for which the pre-existing care standard has been a range of ongoing treatments including regular blood transfusions. Casgevy poses a functional cure for both TDT and SCD, so the market opportunity here is extensive."", 'The rollout of this drug will be a gradual process, and Vertex is working with hospitals to establish authorized treatment centers where qualifying patients can receive these therapies. Moreover, because Casgevy is a gene-editing therapy, the process for each patient receiving the treatment is highly intensive. The patient has stem cells taken from them, edited, and infused back, while also undergoing chemotherapy to condition the cells for the infusion. Then comes a lengthy recovery process.', ""Casgevy is approved in the U.S. as a one-time therapy for patients 12 and up who either have TDT and require habitual blood transfusions or have SCD that causes them regular vaso-occlusive crises, which is a common and painful complication that SCD patients experience when the sickled cells obstruct blood flow. Under the Food and Drug Administration's approval, this means that 1,000 patients are eligible for this treatment at the time of this writing."", ""Still, this is only the beginning of the potential market opportunity for this drug. There are over 100,000 patients with SCD in the U.S. alone. And the drug is going to run with a target cost of $2.2 million per patient. Vertex Pharmaceuticals has a lot of room to run in the rare disease drug market. Investors who want to follow the stock's journey in the years ahead may want to consider putting some cash to work in this promising profit powerhouse of a healthcare business."", 'Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has been a mainstay in the tech industry for nearly five decades. The company has proven its ability to continuously innovate and refine its offerings through the years while remaining true to its core lineup of businesses. Even as the company has invested billions of dollars into artificial intelligence (AI), and is infusing this technology into virtually every corner of its business, it still rakes in eye-popping revenue and profits from some of its oldest products.', 'The company has an incredibly well-diversified business that spans tools and solutions including productivity software, cloud computing services; operating systems; computer, gaming, and mobile hardware; and gaming platforms. This extensive lineup of digital and physical products and services raked in a mouth-watering $57 billion in revenue in the most recent quarter, a 13% hike from the same period in the prior year.', ""Microsoft's operating income for the quarter totaled $27 billion, while net income came in at $22 billion. These two quarterly figures represented respective increases of 25% and 27% on a year-over-year basis. The company also had a staggering $144 billion in cash and investments on its balance sheet at the end of the quarter."", ""Microsoft Cloud revenue was a major driver of this growth, with sales totaling $32 billion, a 24% hike from the year-ago period. Broken down by segment, revenue from Microsoft's productivity and business processes segment, which includes products and services like Office and LinkedIn, and its intelligent cloud segment, which includes server products and Azure, clocked revenue increases of 13% and 19%, respectively, from one year ago."", ""Perhaps a lesser-known side of Microsoft for some investors is its advertising business. The company's revenue from search and news advertising, which features properties like Microsoft Edge, Microsoft News, and Bing, rose 10% year over year in the most recent quarter. Bear in mind, Microsoft's advertising business brought in $12 billion in revenue in 2023, and the company was chosen as the exclusive tech and sales partner for Netflix's newly launched ad-supported tier."", 'Meanwhile, Microsoft continues to incorporate AI into everything from its productivity software to its Bing search engine (which features certain ChatGPT tools) to LinkedIn to newly launched products. The company recently introduced an AI assistant called Copilot that integrates with software like Teams, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, along with its search engines Edge and Bing, and it is already being used by 40% of the Fortune 100 through an early access program.', ""The company's AI-powered cybersecurity solution, Security Copilot, is currently being used by entities like Fidelity National Financial, Bridgewater, and the government of Alberta, Canada, in an early launch as part of its enterprise defense suite Microsoft Defender. Then there's LinkedIn, which has just shy of 1 billion members worldwide and is now leveraging generative AI technology like AI-assisted messages for recruiters."", ""When it comes to finding great stocks that can stand the test of time and build wealth in your portfolio, you don't always have to look for the newest and shiniest toy.

Between the fruits of its ongoing commercialization process and a quickly expanding development pipeline, it's certainly true that it has more than one opportunity at impressing the market and enriching its shareholders."", ""Still, even the most successful companies experience setbacks from time to time, and this biotech is no exception. So let's learn about what just happened, why it matters, and what this player is going to focus on to keep growing in the long term in light of everything else."", ""As well-informed investors know, CRISPR Therapeutics wouldn't be what it is today without the help of collaboration partner and benefactor Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX). Vertex chipped in to cover 60% of the costs associated with developing and commercializing CRISPR's recently approved gene therapy Casgevy, and it also paid the biotech $900 million in 2021."", ""Now that Casgevy is commercialized for both sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion dependent beta thalassemia (TDT), Vertex captures 60% of the profits, and the two companies continue to work together to make the therapy a success. But as of January 8, Vertex isn't keen on playing ball with one of the biotech's earlier-stage programs."", ""Specifically, Vertex pulled out of a cell therapy program to treat diabetes using genetically edited stem cells. The program, called CTX211, is in phase 1 clinical trials, so it isn't as though commercialization is around the corner, or even within the next few years. Investors haven't even had a chance to see a full readout of safety or efficacy data yet. But it's possible that leaders at Vertex weren't impressed by what they saw in their earliest clinical-stage glimpses."", ""While the pair will continue to collaborate on other early-stage projects, including in diabetes, it's undeniable that the deal's collapse is a setback for CRISPR. Though the company has a whopping $1.9 billion in cash and equivalents, its trailing 12-month research and development (R&D) expenditures alone are $396 million. Costs related to CTX211 likely only represent a tiny sliver of that sum, but every dollar counts, especially when that dollar is contributed to the cause by someone else."", ""Still, this bump in the road is a very minor one in the grand scheme of things, and it's unlikely to derail the business in any significant way."", ""Separately from CTX211, CRISPR has a new opportunity that's likely to influence the value of its stock over the next couple of years. Now that its gene therapy Casgevy is approved for both of the indications it sought, the company can turn its attention to bolstering its pipeline via business development activity. Since late last year management has been on the lookout for potential new collaboration partners, attractive pharmaceutical assets for purchasing, and perhaps even promising young biotechs to buy outright."", ""Based on comments by company leaders, it's reasonable to assume that finding partners for CRISPR's early-stage programs is highly likely, particularly within the domains of treatments for auto-immune diseases and advanced cell therapies for cancer. Such moves typically trade custody of clinical development and commercialization responsibilities in exchange for the rights to royalty payments."", ""Doing so is favorable when a business doesn't have the resources it thinks it needs to advance a program, or when a program is no longer considered to be within the core focus of its platform. After all, it's better to have the chance to capture some royalty payments from a medicine's commercialization by another company rather than nothing at all."", ""But don't be too surprised if CRISPR acquires pharmaceutical assets or other other biotechs if management thinks there's something the company can use to bolster its capabilities. Anything that could help to address its pain points in cell therapy manufacturing would be particularly appealing. And don't forget: It has plenty of money on hand to cut deals, though with its $242 million in debt it probably won't be borrowing much to make bigger acquisitions."", ""In short, this biotech's future is bright, and having the opportunity to go on a dealmaking spree means that shareholders are exposed to a whole set of potential catalysts."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in CRISPR Therapeutics right now?', 'Before you buy stock in CRISPR Therapeutics, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and CRISPR Therapeutics wasn't one of them.

(NYSE:TXT), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 86% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.', 'Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.', ""Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Textron."", ' See our latest analysis for Textron ', 'Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.', ""Textron already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Textron's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story."", ""Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Textron. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding. T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 10% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 8.6% of the company stock."", 'We also observed that the top 10 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.', 'While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.', 'The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.', 'Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.', 'Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Textron Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$73m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. ', ""The general public-- including retail investors -- own 14% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies."", 'I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)."", 'ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.', ' See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola ', 'The formula for return on equity is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Coca-Cola is:', '39% = US$11b ÷ US$28b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.39."", ""Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Coca-Cola has a superior ROE than the average (16%) in the Beverage industry."", ""That's clearly a positive. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk ."", 'Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.', ""It's worth noting the high use of debt by Coca-Cola, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.50. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it."", 'Return on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.', 'But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.', 'But note: Coca-Cola may not be the best stock to buy.

Companies are expected to gain from the expansion into newer categories and adjacent categories, including capturing market share in the Ready-to-Drink (“RTD”) alcoholic beverage category through collaborations. Players like The Coca-Cola Company KO, PepsiCo Inc. PEP, Monster Beverage Corporation MNST, Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. KOF and Dutch Bros BROS are poised for growth on these actions.However, players in the industry have been witnessing continued pressure from cost inflation, including transportation and commodity costs, particularly steel and aluminum.

Elevated operating expenses related to increased spending on marketing and advertising to capture a share are likely to strain margins in the near term.', 'About the Industry', 'The Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry comprises companies that manufacture, source, develop, market and sell non-alcoholic beverages.

The players have been committed to product launches and innovation. Expansion into newer markets has been a critical focus for soft drink makers to boost market share. The companies are expected to reap the benefits of digital and technology-driven investments based on the shifting consumer preference for online shopping. Companies in the industry have been accelerating investments to build strong digital capabilities by piloting numerous digital-enabled fulfillment options. They have been expanding digital offerings and investing in loyalty programs to capture online demand. These investments are likely to position soft drink companies for long-term growth.Evolving Trends: One of the notable trends in the U.S. beverage soft drinks industry is the increasing demand for healthier options. Consumers are becoming more health-conscious, driving a shift toward beverages with natural ingredients, lower sugar content and functional benefits, while staying excited for varied flavors and better taste experiences. Plant-based beverages have gained significant traction as consumers seek alternatives to traditional soft drinks. Plant-based ingredients, such as botanical extracts and non-dairy milk alternatives, are becoming popular choices for those looking to reduce their environmental impacts and make healthier choices. Additionally, functional beverages that offer specific health benefits, such as enhanced hydration, energy boosters, and mood enhancers, are carving out a niche in the market. Companies in the industry are expected to benefit from the expansion into newer and adjacent categories, including capturing market share in the fast-growing RTD alcoholic beverage category through collaborations. RTD has emerged as the fastest-growing category since 2018. The industry players are also exploring CBD-infused drinks, which have been gaining popularity lately.Raw Material Cost Inflation and Supply Constraints: The beverage industry has been troubled by higher costs, including rising commodity input costs and transportation expenses. Raw material cost inflation, particularly steel and aluminum, has increased packaging costs. The ongoing supply constraints in the aluminum can industry have been other headwinds. The companies are also witnessing delays in procuring certain ingredients, domestically and internationally, leading to shortages of some goods. The industry players have been facing freight inefficiencies, and significant increases in domestic and international freight costs. Logistic issues, higher input costs and freight inefficiencies have led to higher sales and operating expenses, impacting the gross and operating margins.

Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period.

Nonetheless, operational excellence improvements and disciplined capital allocation moves are expected to have partly offset the negatives.Meanwhile, forestry and road expenses, higher fiber costs, along with higher raw material costs have been a headwind for the business. Higher raw material costs for OSB web stock, resin and veneer may also have been a pressing concern.In December 2023, WY updated its expectations for the fourth quarter. WY lowered its fourth-quarter Wood Products EBITDA forecast due to lower-than-expected lumber results. The company now expects fourth-quarter Wood Products EBITDA to be approximately $30 million below the third-quarter level, excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and OSB, given lower lumber sales volumes and higher unit manufacturing costs. Overall, WY is on track to generate about $154 million in Wood Products EBITDA. Lower sales volume and higher unit manufacturing costs are expected to have impacted the lumber results. This is due to lower production levels, driven by holiday downtime taken at Pacific Northwest mills.Our model predicts Wood Products segment revenues (which accounted for approximately 76% of third-quarter 2023 revenues) to increase 3.4% year over year but decrease 10.5% sequentially to $1,375.8 million in the quarter.

In the western region, the company anticipates that fee harvest volumes, sales prices, and forestry and road expenses will show similar performance compared with the prior quarter. However, per-unit log and haul costs are expected to be slightly elevated. In the southern region, the company foresees that fee harvest volumes, sales prices, and per-unit log and haul costs will remain consistent with those in the third quarter. Nevertheless, forestry and road expenses are projected to be somewhat reduced.We expect the Timberland segment net sales (which accounted for 25.8% of third-quarter net sales) to drop 9.8% year over year and 5.1% sequentially to $494.2 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to decline 4.7% from a year ago and is almost comparable to the third-quarter level at $142.9 million.\xa0Meanwhile, in the Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment, Weyerhaeuser expects earnings and adjusted EBITDA to be lower compared with the third quarter, thanks to the timing and mix of sales.Our model predicts the Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment (which accounted for 3.8% of third-quarter net sales) net sales to be $70.8 million, up 28.7% year over year but down 32.6% sequentially.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed.

However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think DaVita (NYSE:DVA) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be."", ""For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business.

So don't be surprised if DaVita doesn't end up being a multi-bagger in a few years time."", 'On a side note, DaVita has done well to reduce current liabilities to 15% of total assets over the last five years. This can eliminate some of the risks inherent in the operations because the business has less outstanding obligations to their suppliers and or short-term creditors than they did previously.', ""In summary, DaVita isn't compounding its earnings but is generating stable returns on the same amount of capital employed.

Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don\'t necessarily bear these characteristics.', ""When you first look at it, Ingersoll Rand's ROE doesn't look that attractive. Next, when compared to the average industry ROE of 15%, the company's ROE leaves us feeling even less enthusiastic. However, we we're pleasantly surprised to see that Ingersoll Rand grew its net income at a significant rate of 33% in the last five years. Therefore, there could be other reasons behind this growth.

This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know."", ""Ingersoll Rand's ' three-year median payout ratio is on the lower side at 3.6% implying that it is retaining a higher percentage (96%) of its profits. So it looks like Ingersoll Rand is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth."", ""Along with seeing a growth in earnings, Ingersoll Rand only recently started paying dividends. Its quite possible that the company was looking to impress its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 2.9% of its profits over the next three years. Regardless, the future ROE for Ingersoll Rand is predicted to rise to 12% despite there being not much change expected in its payout ratio."", ""In total, it does look like Ingersoll Rand has some positive aspects to its business.

Many of the statements we're making are forward-looking and based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and website, those elements may change as the world changes. Over to Larry."", 'H. Lawrence Culp', ""Steve, thank you and good morning, everyone. GE made tremendous progress in 2023 with excellent operating results, the successful spin of GE HealthCare and the ongoing lean transformation of our company. 2024 will be a momentous year as we launch GE Aerospace and GE Vernova in early April. Looking at our results, we more than tripled our earnings and generated almost 70% more free cash flow in 2023. GE Aerospace drove double-digit revenue, profit and cash growth with continued strength in commercial engines and services. GE Vernova delivered meaningfully better results as Renewable Energy and Power together generated positive profit and free cash flow. In the year ahead, we expect both GE Aerospace and GE Vernova to continue on their respective upward trajectories. Let me spend a moment on each. GE Aerospace is an exceptional franchise with our fleet of 44,000 commercial engines and 26,000 rotorcraft and combat engines, plus extensive aftermarket services representing 70% of revenue. We live our purpose each day to invent the future of flight, lift people up and bring them home safely. It's a responsibility we take very seriously and our teams are focused on safety, quality, delivery and cost, in that order in everything we do to support our customers in the industry. Strategically, today, we're executing to meet customer needs for engines and services. Despite the challenged supply chain environment, in the quarter, total engine deliveries were up 11% sequentially, including defense, up over 60%. We delivered 1,570 LEAP engines, representing 38% growth, yet with more to do going forward. As part of our lean transformation, we're developing connected flow using model lines to improve deliveries. By focusing on key constraints, we've reduced lead times, for example, over 40% on our ceramic matrix composite components. And in services, we've improved LEAP shop visit turnaround times by double digits. Lean is not only helping us with delivery but more importantly, when it comes to safety and quality. The team in Rutland, Vermont used lean problem-solving fundamentals to address recurring defects in our GEnx low-pressure turbine blades. This improved first-time yield by more than 50%. Lean actions like these within our plants and in partnership with suppliers are driving improvements across GE Aerospace. For tomorrow, we're building our $150 billion plus backlog. At the Dubai Airshow, GE Aerospace, along with our partners received over 450 engine commitments and several service agreements across both widebodies and narrowbodies. This included an Emirates order for 202 GE9X engines and spares and a long-term services agreement to power its upcoming Boeing 777X fleet. And we're keeping our customers' fleets flying with durability and maintenance enhancements such as our LEAP 1A fuel nozzle cooling system that's on its way to fleet introduction. And for the future, we're investing in R&D and developing next-generation technologies. Recently, NASA selected GE Aerospace for phase 2 of the Hybrid Thermally Efficient Core program, which will significantly enhance fuel efficiency and reduce emissions, improvements we'll leverage in our RISE program. And the National Defense Authorization Act authorized funding for the adaptive engine transition program and the next-generation advanced propulsion program, which will help provide cutting-edge future military capabilities. All said, GE Aerospace is accelerating our progress with lean and driving value long term, all in service of our customers who carry the 3 billion people traveling with our engines under wing each year. Over to GE Vernova, our ambition is to electrify and decarbonize the world with our technologies helping to generate approximately 30% of the world's electricity and where services represent 65% of our backlog, our incumbency and scale position us to lead. We've made a lot of progress at Vernova. I'll give you the high-level framing and Scott's here today with additional color. Power delivered strong growth, profit and free cash. Grid was profitable for the full year. And onshore delivered another quarter of profitability. Offshore remained challenging but I really like the way we're lean along with better commercial selectivity and underwriting to improve our outlook. GE Vernova will stand on its own soon. I'm proud of the team's work to strengthen these businesses. And on a more personal note, I met Scott during my very first GE site visit. I have seen his leadership in action, as he's led the team in executing the impressive turnaround at Gas Power and now the strong momentum building with our onshore and grid businesses. Importantly, Scott is an ardent student of lean and I'm highly confident that he is the right person to lead GE Vernova into the future. Turning to Slide 3 with our stronger, more valuable businesses delivering now, GE Aerospace and GE Vernova are ready to go. We've assembled 2 extraordinary Boards, bringing together domain expertise, diverse perspectives and leadership experience to help GE Aerospace and GE Vernova rise to their sharper, more focused missions. We've also further simplified and strengthened our balance sheet, fully exiting our AerCap equity stake. Looking ahead, GE Vernova plans to publicly file its Form-10 next month. Then GE Vernova and GE Aerospace will host Investor Days on March 6 and 7, respectively, in New York City. Both teams are excited to share how we'll create greater value for our customers and shareholders alike. We hope to see many of you there. Now over to Rahul."", 'Rahul Ghai', ""Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 4. We will speak to results on an organic basis. We closed out the year with another solid quarter. Orders were up across all segments driven by services up 24%. Revenue increased 13% with all segments up double digits. Adjusted operating profit was up 20%, supporting margin expansion of 50 basis points, driven by volume and price, net of inflation. This was partially offset by negative mix from higher equipment and investments in growth. Adjusted EPS was $1.03, up 56%. Free cash flow was $3 billion from stronger earnings and positive working capital largely driven by progress collections, including recent sizable orders. This was partially offset by payables, including the actions we have taken to support our suppliers. For the full year, revenue increased 17%. Aerospace and renewables led the way, benefiting from robust demand, better execution and pricing. Services was up 15% and equipment up 19%. Profit, EPS and cash, all finished above the high end of our guidance. Adjusted operating profit increased $2.5 billion to $5.7 billion. Adjusted margin expanded by over 300 basis points, driven by aerospace growth, sizable renewables improvement and price across the 3 businesses, partially offset by inflation on long lead items and investments in growth. Adjusted EPS increased more than $2 supported by strong profit growth and lower interest from debt reduction. Free cash flow was up over $2 billion to $5.2 billion, driven by significantly better earnings. In 2023, working capital was a $1.6 billion source of cash from progress collections, partially offset by inventory build given robust growth and continued supply chain challenges. A moment on corporate. We ended the year with just over $1 billion of cash use and adjusted costs of roughly $460 million. This improved year-over-year due to lower functional expenses and higher interest income. Overall, it represents significant progress since 2021 when costs were $1.2 billion. We are pleased to see Digital turn profitable as the team prepares to firmly join GE Vernova. Our industry-leading software helps utilities, grid operators and others address the growing complexity of energy transition. And GE Aerospace and GE Vernova are ready to go. The teams are fully staffed and corporate headcount, which was close to 5,000 just a few years ago, stands at less than 200 people, who will be with us into second quarter to execute the final spin. This temporary cost in the first half of 2024 is embedded in GE Aerospace's full year guidance. Stepping back, we are pleased with our performance in 2023. In 2024, on a stand-alone basis, we expect GE Aerospace and GE Vernova to grow revenue, profit and cash. We will share more on business guidance shortly. Now turning to GE Aerospace. This quarter, demand remained robust with GE and CFM departures growing high teens year-over-year. Orders were up 10% with solid services and commercial engine orders. Revenue was up 12%, driven by commercial, up 15%. Profit was up 8%, benefiting from increased services volume and pricing, net of inflation. This was partially offset by unfavorable equipment mix from the expected higher install and over spare engine deliveries and higher investments. Reported margins were roughly flat year-over-year and down 70 basis points organically as unfavorable mix and investments offset higher volume and price, net of inflation. In commercial, services revenue was up 23% from higher volume, pricing and heavier work scopes. External spare parts increased with higher LEAP volume and internal shop visits were up slightly. Lean is enabling us to create new capacity to meet higher demand and decrease turnaround time and cost. For example, our MRO team in Prestwick, Scotland used lean to remove 76 hours of waste from their engine disassembly process, which will help them to go from servicing 3.5 engines a week to 5 engines a week. Revenue grew 1% with LEAP deliveries up 22%. As expected, our mix continues to shift towards installations. In Defense, book-to-bill was 1x, underscoring solid demand and the quality of our franchises. Revenue was down 1%, driven by lower services while equipment grew double digits from higher combat engine deliveries. For the year, revenue was up 22%. Commercial services increased 30% with external spare parts up significantly and internal shop visits up 10%. Commercial engines grew 21%, with total engine deliveries up 25% and spare engine ratio consistent with 2022. Defense grew 7% with book-to-bill of approximately 1.2x for the second consecutive year and orders were up 9%. Profit was $6.1 billion, increasing over $1 billion or 25% from services growth and pricing, net of inflation. This was more than offset -- this more than offset negative mix from higher LEAP volume and investments. Margins of 19.2% expanded 90 basis points on a reported basis and 50 basis points on an organic basis. Free cash flow of $5.7 billion increased approximately $800 million with improving earnings and working capital more than offsetting AD&A pressure. Now I'll hand it to Scott, who will cover GE Vernova."", 'Scott L. Strazik', ""Thanks, Rahul. It's a pleasure to join you, Larry and Steve, on the last GE earnings call before we launch GE Vernova, a purpose-built company that's enabling electrification and decarbonization. We've built a strong, experienced leadership team and we're excited to welcome Jessica Uhl to our leadership team as President, overseeing technology, innovation and growth. I'm encouraged by what our team accomplished in 2023 as we deliver meaningfully better results now. Our Renewable Energy and Power businesses combined drove double-digit revenue growth. We're slightly profitable, improving profit over $1 billion and generated $600 million of cash this year. At renewable energy, our operational turnaround produced sizable improvement. In the fourth quarter, orders were just over $5 billion, including the cancellation of a large offshore order that was originally booked in 2Q '23. Excluding this cancellation, orders grew over 20% led by stronger onshore equipment and repower. We also secured a record 2.4 gigawatt order to support Pattern Energy's SunZia wind project expected to be the largest wind project in U.S. history. Revenue increased double digits. Grid grew double digits for the fifth consecutive quarter. Offshore more than doubled as we deliver our existing backlog. And onshore grew, driven by North America equipment volume. Profit improved over $100 million as onshore and grid more than offset pressure at offshore. Looking at the year. Orders were $23 billion, up over 50% with revenue up 17%. Profit improved roughly $1 billion driven by price, quality and productivity in onshore and grid plus the absence of last year's largely onshore-related charges. Free cash flow was negative $1.5 billion, which improved by over $0.5 billion from better earnings and higher down payments. Looking closer at the businesses. At grid, price and higher volume enabled full year profitability following 3 consecutive quarters of profit, while our backlog more than doubled to over $12 billion with average margins and backlog increasing approximately 5 points. Lean is core here. Take our Pennsylvania facility that makes transmission circuit breakers. We increased flow and doubled production capacity, helping reduce product lead times by about 35%. This will speed up delivery to customers at a time when demand is rising. Onshore has been profitable for 2 consecutive quarters. North America equipment orders increased more than 70%. We've grown our global onshore equipment backlog roughly 40% to nearly $9 billion and approximately 70% of the backlog is North America. Importantly, margins in our total onshore equipment backlog expanded over 10 points due to continued selectivity and pricing. We're delivering reliable, high-performing fleets with roughly 60% of our proactive enhancement in the field completed with more to come. We streamlined our product lineup, focusing on higher-quality workhorse products, roughly 70% of 2023 volume. And we're still increasing productivity and lowering fixed costs significantly. Offshore wind was challenging with losses of roughly $1.1 billion in '23. We're executing the existing backlog, improving productivity with lean. We're starting 2024 with an equipment backlog down to roughly $4 billion, which we expect to largely complete over the next 2 years. Longer term, offshore wind should play a key role in the energy transition. The industry is beginning to reset and while it does, we'll be highly selective on adding to the backlog. Turning to Power. We delivered another strong year, led by Gas Power. Looking at the quarter, orders increased 4% with gas services growing double digits. Equipment orders declined largely as we exit steam new build, partially offset by higher aeroderivatives. Revenue was up 12% driven by gas. Equipment revenue grew, driven by aeroderivative and heavy-duty gas turbines. Services were strong with higher contractual outages and upgrades. Profit was over $750 million with low double-digit margins driven by services strength. As expected, margins contracted given higher equipment volume. In an individual quarter, additional units may weigh on margins but this drives long-term growth in higher-margin services and we're always focused on price and productivity to offset inflation. For the year, revenue grew 7%. We delivered 58 heavy-duty gas turbines with 14 HA. Services were strong, up mid-single digits, led by gas. Profit of roughly $1.4 billion grew by 10%. Importantly, gas achieved double-digit margins this year. Here, lean is enabling higher productivity and growth. For example, our gas repairs team in Mexico created standard work to reduce cycle time and cost, decreasing lead time by 75% and operating hours per unit by 44%. This is helping us deliver faster for our customers. Free cash flow is over $2 billion, up roughly $200 million. Power continues to be a strong, reliable source of cash generation. We're pleased with Power's performance, a strong growing business where higher-margin services comprise around 80% of the backlog. Now I'll turn it back to Rahul to discuss guidance."", 'Rahul Ghai', ""Thanks, Scott. With the spin just around the corner, first quarter will be the last time are reporting combined GE results, including GE Aerospace and GE Vernova. For this first quarter, we expect high single-digit revenue growth driven by GE Aerospace. Adjusted EPS of $0.60 to $0.65, more than doubling year-over-year, driven by profit improvement and the absence of preferred stock dividend and free cash flow growth in line with net income growth. Our 2024 annual guidance reflects each business operating independently for the full year, incorporating stand-alone and other impacts that each will incur separately. I'll now hand it over to Scott and Larry to share the overall GE Vernova and GE Aerospace guides and we will provide further details for both businesses in March. Scott, back to you."", 'Scott L. Strazik', ""Thanks, Rahul. GE Vernova is building momentum, expecting substantial profit and free cash flow growth in 2024. We see solid organic growth with revenue between $34 billion to $35 billion, up low- to mid-single digits from 2023 and adjusted EBITDA margin at the higher end of the mid-single digits range, up from low single-digit EBITDA margin in '23. Supporting this outlook is continued price, productivity and benefits from restructuring efforts. A few highlights. We expect Gas Power to remain strong with continued services growth and low double-digit margins. Onshore will continue to improve significantly, achieving high single-digit margins on roughly flat revenue from better mix, price and cost out. Offshore will continue to execute our current backlog with slight year-over-year improvement. Finally, grid will expand to mid-single-digit margins, primarily from higher volume and price. Our guidance assumes roughly $200 million of stand-alone and $100 million of other ongoing carve-out costs. When converting from this year's expected operating profit margin for Power and renewables, combined to adjusted EBITDA margin for GE Vernova, including these costs plus D&A, the difference is roughly $0.5 billion or 1.5 points. On free cash flow. We expect $700 million to $1.1 billion from higher EBITDA and better working capital on a stand-alone basis, which includes absorbing our portion of the GE pension. Given the multi-decade secular tailwinds and stronger financial trajectory ahead, we are excited to launch GE Vernova and partner with our customers to lead the energy transition forward. With that, back to Larry."", 'H. Lawrence Culp', ""At GE Aerospace, we're also excited about 2024. We expect another year of solid revenue growth, up at least low double digits, including mid- to high teens growth in commercial, which includes high teens growth in engines and mid-teens growth in services; mid- to high single-digit growth for Defense & Systems, including our Propulsion and Additive Technologies business.On our current reporting basis, the guidance implies $6.6 billion to $7.1 billion of operating profit, improving double digits at the midpoint of the range. On a stand-alone basis, including roughly $600 million of corporate and other stand-alone costs, this comes to approximately $6 billion to $6.5 billion of profit and implies flat margins year-over-year, given the growth in LEAP, initial 9X shipments for the 777X platform and other growth investments. For free cash flow, we expect to generate over $5 billion, which remains well above 100% conversion, including stand-alone impacts. Our teams are looking forward to sharing additional insights in detail with you at our March Investor Days. In closing, 2023 was an excellent year. GE Aerospace drove double-digit growth and GE Vernova delivered substantially better results. Both are on track for continued growth in 2024. While our sights are on the future, we're proud of what we've accomplished with over $100 billion of debt reduction behind us and $7 billion returned to shareholders in 2023, we remain fully focused day in and day out on using lean to improve how we serve our customers and deliver value for shareholders. Underpinning all of this is the GE team. My sincere thanks to all of you for the important work you did in 2023. I've never been more confident in the path ahead. We've created industry leaders that will carry GE's commitment to innovation and continuous improvement while grounded in vital missions. At GE Aerospace, inventing the future of flight and at GE Vernova, electrifying and decarbonizing the world. We're ready to go. Steve? Over to you."", 'Steven Eric Winoker', ""Thanks, Larry. Before we open the line, Liz, I'd ask everyone in the queue to consider your fellow analysts and ask 1 question, so we can get to as many people as possible in the next 20 to 25 minutes. Please open the line."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research.', 'Myles Alexander Walton', ""I was hoping to dig in a little bit on the commercial engines' high-teens growth. And maybe if you could break down a little bit, does it still include about 2,000 LEAP deliveries? And also, is the spares ratio similar to '23? I know you mentioned '23 was similar to '22."", 'H. Lawrence Culp', ""Myles, I think from a CES or commercial engines and services perspective, we're going to see engines lead the way. Engines will be up high teens plus. I think you're going to see services in the mid-teens area.Specific to your question, from a LEAP perspective, what we anticipate right now is a 20% to 25% increase in unit growth. I think we'll see installs get ahead of spares. So that spares ratio will begin to moderate more in line with the historic average of a typical life cycle. So that's really where we are with respect to the narrowbody specifics you have there."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.', 'Joseph Alfred Ritchie', ""Feels like the end of an era. Yes. As I just said feels like the end of an era. Way to go out on a good note. So my one question is for Scott. So Scott, I'm just trying to bridge the free cash flow comments, 2023 to 2024. Clearly, you guys have some numbers out on the slides but the 2023 numbers look like it's not apples-to-apples, right, like not burden for corporate. It looks like you're expecting a pretty meaningful pickup in 2024. So maybe just talk to us about the puts and takes and what's embedded in the low and the high end of the guide for '24."", 'Scott L. Strazik', ""Joe, at the start. I mean, we're proud of the $600 million of free cash flow that we generated with Power and Renewable segments in 2023. Now as we get to an apples-and-apples basis, we need to back out from that reportable free cash flow of $600 million, our stand-alone and carve-out costs of approximately $300 million. In addition to pension and some variables, we're working through with taxes that will all be clear in the Form 10 filing in the middle of February. Jumping off of that starting point, we expect to see real EBITDA growth that will drive free cash flow with it from low single-digit EBITDA growth to the high end of the mid-single-digit EBITDA range that we're talking about, in addition to working capital continuing to be a source of cash that drives us up towards that $700 million to $1.1 billion of positive free cash flow at Vernova. Now the real drivers of the variability in that range come down primarily to 2 things. One is Offshore Wind execution and how quickly we install the wind turbines in both the Atlantic and the North Sea, proud of the fact that we've got 14-megawatt wind turbines in both cases connected to the grid today. And really the EDF timing of the transaction close on Steam, as the 2 largest variables for us on that $700 million to $1.1 billion guide but with a lot of confidence that we go into '24 expecting to see substantial improvement off of 2023."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from the line of Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets.', 'Kenneth George Herbert', 'Maybe, Larry, for the 2024 mid-teens commercial services outlook, can you provide any more granularity on the implied assumptions maybe for spare parts and price compared to other services? And then within that maybe some comments on how much improvement in the LEAP turnaround times are embedded in the guide?', 'H. Lawrence Culp', ""I think that what we're anticipating on the services side is, in effect, mid-single-digit departure growth really being the foundation. We will see, I think, internal shop visits grow more rapidly than we're likely to see spare parts. We're going to get pricing benefit. We're going to see work scope improvements. And that's really how you ladder up from that departures number to what we would expect to see in terms of mid-teens services growth. Rahul?"", 'Rahul Ghai', 'Ken, just to add a couple of dot points to that response. As Larry said, departures are up 6%. We are entering 2024 with some catch-up to do on our shop visits. Given the supply chain challenges in 2023, we could not get as many shop visits completed as we would have liked. So as we enter 2024, given the demand outlook, given the increase in traffic, we are expecting our shop visits to be up kind of low double digits to mid-teens. And adding to what Larry said on scope and pricing, that pushes our revenue from shop visits kind of towards the higher end of their teens. And then spares growth kind of moderates and the spares growth will be below that of the shop visit growth. But you combine all that, you get to that mid-teens services growth that we just mentioned.', 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.', 'Julian C.H. Mitchell', ""Just a question maybe for Scott on the free cash flow again for Vernova. So I just wanted to try and understand, I think working capital is assumed as a source. So maybe help us understand kind of what the orders intake assumption is for Vernova this year. I think it was up 25%, the orders in 2023. So just trying to see how much sort of orders growth this year or what kind of working capital inflow from orders you're expecting?And on that free cash flow point separately, there must be some assumption for sort of interest expense and so forth within that cash guide. So just any framing around that, please?"", 'Rahul Ghai', ""Julian, let me just kick it off and let me start with the second part first and then I'll hand it to Scott on the orders. As you think about the free cash flow guide for Vernova, we'll definitely provide more details as Form-10 comes out and then we have the Investor Days. But just keep in mind, as we've previously discussed, vast, vast majority of the GE debt will retain with GE Aerospace. So there's not a lot of interest impact on GE Vernova. So that's the way to think about the free cash flow for next year. More details to come on the capital structure. But Scott, do you want to take the orders part?"", 'Scott L. Strazik', ""You bet, Rahul. And Julian, I think to your point, to begin with, we had a big SunZia order with onshore wind in the fourth quarter. Across grid, there were a number of large HVDC orders with TenneT, as an example and you can expect in every year, in any quarter specifically that we're going to see those types of transactions. So those, we don't expect to see a repeat in '24 versus '23. But with Onshore Wind, as an example, our largest renewables business, we see our customers actively investing and replenishing their project book right now. I mean they really utilized all the projects they had prior to having clarity on the PTC. And we do think the orders profile in '24, much like the revenue and shipments profile will be more back-end loaded than first half loaded an Onshore Wind. But with very active individual projects, orders are going to be more flattish than up in onshore. On grid, the one point I'd make is, although we aren't going to expect as much in large HVDC orders to the extent we had with TenneT in 2023, the reality is, even if you back out the HVDC orders in grid, our second largest renewables business, our orders in grid grew by over 20% in 2023. Power transformers as an example, a business we don't talk about as much, grew orders by 40%. And we expect to continue to see that strength. So there may be less headline orders of the magnitude of a SunZia or the TenneT HVDC projects but there's a lot of healthy demand across renewables that we expect to continue into 2024 that contributes towards our free cash flow generation, continue to be greater than 100% and that significant free cash flow growth that we just talked about."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.', 'Sheila Karin Kahyaoglu', ""Larry, this one's for you. Maybe if you could just offer your perspective on the quality lapses we've seen across the industry. How does it change your approach in regards to ensuring the integrity of your own supply chains as the industry grapples with the lead challenges, obviously but you also mentioned initial GE9X production in 2024. How does that flow into your assumptions on free cash flow for things like inventory build?"", 'H. Lawrence Culp', ""Sheila, there's a lot there. I think from a -- let's take safety first. I'm strongly of the view that the industry, not to speak for the industry but having been close to this business for almost 2 years, everybody understands the solemn responsibility we have the world over. I think from a GE Aerospace perspective, as you and I have talked, the operating framework, the lean transformation that's been underway here is very much rooted in an SQDC approach, safety, first and foremost, before quality, before delivery, before cost. And we not only talk that way, we work hard to make sure we operate that way day in and day out. Fortunately, at GE Aerospace, we have a long history of being hyper focused on safety. You go back, for example, to I think 2013, our safety management system was really the first of its kind. We were the first OEM to implement such a scheme well before the FAA required the industry to do so. And we have been building on that. But that approach never assumes perfection, right? So we layer in all sorts of checks and audits, process capabilities to make sure that we're doing all that we possibly can to deliver safety, to deliver quality over time. And that applies in the commercial realm, it applies on the defense side, legacy platforms, new platforms like LEAP and 9X.And I'd also say that when we talk about our leadership behaviors of humility and transparency and focus, that really helps undergird all of that work because if we have an opportunity to improve, if we miss something, we want folks to come forward, share that with us so we can get after it, get to root cause and lay in corrective action. So that's really the general approach. From a 9X perspective, we do know that, that will be a pressure on us in 2024. We're assuming EIS May of '25, will begin to ship engines in the back half of '24. It's really the beginning of the life cycle for that platform. We're thrilled to be underwing on the 777X. It's an exciting platform but it will be a financial headwind for us for the foreseeable future as we ramp not only the volumes but obviously improve the overall cost structure of that business with an eye toward building the installed base and the service annuities that will come over time."", 'Rahul Ghai', ""Sheila, just to add to that. On the free cash flow part of your question, we've -- 9X has been a headwind on free cash flow even in 2023, as we start bringing in inventory to start shipping this year, as Larry said, towards the back half of this year. So it will continue to impact our free cash flow negatively to some extent. But it's not a material driver overall, as you've seen greater than $5 billion of free cash flow for 2024, including absorption of the corporate pension, the interest expense, so -- that you saw. So still feel pretty good about the free cash flow for 2024, and the 9X is not a material driver of the free cash flow for the year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America.', 'Andrew Burris Obin', 'Just one last time for me for GE. But yes, a question for Rahul. Maybe just if -- you gave us an overview for the company into the first quarter. But maybe just detail by business for GE into the first quarter, a little bit more color.', 'Rahul Ghai', ""Sure, Andrew. So if you look at the first quarter guide, Aerospace is going to start the year strong. Revenue up mid-teens with the commercial growth rates in the first quarter, kind of in line with what we are projecting for full year. And the margins on a business as usual kind of pre all the stand-alone expenses, we do expect margins to be flat to slightly up for the first quarter on a year-over-year basis for Aerospace. For renewables, as Scott said, there will be profit improvement during the year but that improvement will be more back-end loaded. As we start converting the higher-margin onshore wind orders that Scott referenced in his prepared remarks, we'll start shipping those orders that we got in '23 into the second half of 2024. So there's a little bit of lag between order to revenue conversion. And so the renewables improvement will be more back-end loaded. The first quarter for renewables will look a lot like the fourth quarter for renewables. So think about roughly in the same zone. And for, typical seasonality with low single-digit growth, some margin expansion year-over-year in the first quarter. But just one other point I want to make on the first quarter is that given that both Vernova and Aerospace team are fully staffed up to become stand-alone public companies and we are operating with a very, very small corporate staff. And the historic corporate expense will now be fully absorbed in the 2 businesses. And the corporate expense in first quarter will be effectively zero. So majority of that expense is going to Aerospace and the balance to Vernova. But the way to think about first quarter margins for both companies is just as we think through after absorption of incremental cost and just given in line with the reported margin guidance that we provided for full year. So that's the way to think about the first quarter margins."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.', 'Seth Michael Seifman', ""I don't want to kind of -- you've just given us the 2024 guidance, so I apologize for jumping ahead here. But when we think about margin cadence in Aerospace, apples-to-apples kind of flattish as we go from '23 to '24. When you think about going to kind of the 20%-ish that you talked about for '25, how do we think about the key drivers as we bridge that?"", 'Rahul Ghai', ""Yes. Seth, so listen, let's start with a really strong '23, right? $1.3 billion of profit growth, 90 basis points of margin expansion and better than what we said back in March, right, when we were expecting $5.5 billion of profit, flat margins year-over-year. So 2023 shaped up a lot better than what we initially expected back in March. Now as you look forward to '24, I know you kind of skipped over that here but double-digit profit growth in 2024, with the OE ramp, 9X introduction pressuring the margin rate but it is exactly the steps that we had thought in our minds on how 2024 would look when we were sitting back in March, right? And we had said, hey, '24 will be a step along the way to '25. Now as we get to '25, the biggest driver to profit growth between '24 to '25 will be the benefit from top line improvement and that is in line with what we've previously said, pricing that offsets inflation and productivity. But mix will continue to be an issue. LEAP OE volume ramps, LEAP services ramps. And even though LEAP services becomes profitable in '24, it's still a margin headwind and then 9X volume ramps in '25 as well. So if you think about '25, recall, we had said $7.5 billion, $7.6 billion to $8 billion of profit on the current GE reporting, which translates to roughly about 20% margins. And layering in about $0.5 billion of stand-alone public company expenses, EH&S cost, all the other things, we are thinking $7.1 billion to $7.6 billion of profit for 2025, which is in line with what we said back in March, just adjusted for the incremental expenses. And we'll come back to that and talk more in March."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup.', 'Andrew Alec Kaplowitz', ""Scott, maybe in terms of your 2024 margin expectations for Vernova, could you give us a little more color on the components? I think you mentioned onshore can reach high single-digit margins with the second half ramp up, which would I think be meaningfully better performance than your initial expectations you set for the business in '24 last year. So does that assume you get through most of your product reliability issues? And as price versus cost just been a bigger driver than you would have thought?"", 'Scott L. Strazik', ""Andy, you bet. I mean, if we go back to our original guide in '24, going back to March, I mean, we're largely in line with the expectations there. But if we take a step back, Gas Power is stronger than our expectations in March. Onshore Wind and Grid are both stronger. And to your point, we talked today about Onshore Wind being high single-digit margins in '24 and Grid being mid-single-digit margins. Now gas has already gotten to low double-digit margins and will continue to accrete but offshore is tougher than where we were in March. And that's challenging a little bit of that strength in our 3 largest businesses with gas, grid and onshore representing about 80% of our revenue today. But also taking into account that tough offshore backlog, we've got 2 more years to execute through that. So when you think about our 3 largest businesses continuing to be stronger than where we were, while we really reduce our offshore backlog from $6 billion to approximately $4 billion and approximately 2 years to go, we see a clear pathway in '24 to accrete margin but also then to continue to accrete margin beyond as we liquidate the rest of the tough economics with offshore in '25 and then find the oxygen to really share with you some of our smaller businesses we don't talk about as much. But you heard Rahul mention earlier the fact that our digital business returned to profitability and we're really excited about some of those areas like grid software that we'll share more with you when we get to March 6. So those really are the key dynamics of '23 to '24 and looking a little bit further out than even that."", 'Steven Eric Winoker', 'Liz, we have time for one last question.', 'Operator', 'This question will come from the line of Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank.', 'Scott Deuschle', ""Rahul, you touched on a bit in your answer to Seth's question but can you give a bit more detail on the flat margins implied for GE Aerospace in '24? And then for Larry, I was hoping you can give an update on your capital allocation priorities for '24, including how share repurchases fit in relative to debt paydown?"", 'Rahul Ghai', ""Yes. Sure, Scott. So as we look forward to 2024, I think it's going to be another strong year, right? We've guided to 6.5 -- $6.6 billion to $7.1 billion of profit on a current basis and then $6 billion to $6.5 billion on a stand-alone basis. This is after including EH&S, other public company expenses. Including, about $100 million to support the wind down of GE corporate office, which will now be with us kind of through second quarter. So this implies about a $750 million of profit growth or low double digit at the midpoint of that growth. Margins, we do expect that those margins to be flat, about 2 points of margin pressure that we're expecting. More than 0.5 point of that is coming from LEAP OE ramp, introduction of 9X engines and the strong LEAP services growth. And as I said to Seth earlier, even though LEAP services is turning profitable, just as we would have expected, it is still negatively impacting the margins. And the rest of that 2-point headwind is coming from incremental R&D to support -- improve -- further improvement in LEAP durability, introduction of 9X and then develop the next generation of products for the future of flight. This margin pressure is completely offset with benefit from volume, productivity, the strong services growth that we are expecting. So overall, again, it's a step that it is in line with our expectations that we had laid out for the medium-term outlook in March of '23. Larry?"", 'H. Lawrence Culp', ""Scott, I don't know if you asked that relative to my GE role or my Aerospace role, I suspect the latter. But just with the GE hat on for a moment, really no change at this point. We really want to make sure we see through the spin, as I think both Rahul and Scott talked at the outset, feeling very good about Vernova's prospects here to be investment grade, confident in that outlook and we want to see that through, set out both businesses. We will, in early March in New York, share more at each of the Investor Days as to how we're thinking about the -- not only the capital structures but the capital allocation strategies for both businesses. I think in Aerospace, so you should assume that we're going to have a compelling dividend, that buybacks are going to be an important part of that overall effort beyond just covering dilution and we'll certainly look to do meaningful value-accretive M&A. The mix, the timing, those details to come. I really want the GE Aerospace Board to have more time with those important questions. But we're looking forward to moving beyond deleveraging and playing more offense at Aerospace. And I think while Scott's got a different hand to play, they're going to look to continue to certainly invest inorganically in the opportunities that they have around the energy transition."", 'Steven Eric Winoker', ""Liz, before we wrap, I want to remind folks that GE Aerospace will report GE's first quarter results in late April, with GE Vernova holding a separate call. As a result, like we did with GE HealthCare, we'll focus our comments in late April on Aerospace leaving GE Vernova commentary to Scott and his team. Larry, any final comments?"", 'H. Lawrence Culp', ""Steve, thanks. Just to close the call, again, the teams delivered in 2023, both Aerospace and Vernova. We're really looking forward to what's ahead for both companies as independent entities. Before that day in early April, we hope to see many of you at the Investor Days in March. We appreciate your time today, your investment and support of GE."", 'Operator', ""Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.""]"

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), by way of a worked example."", 'ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies ', 'ROE can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Estée Lauder Companies is:', '9.0% = US$556m ÷ US$6.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.09 in profit."", 'One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Estée Lauder Companies has a lower ROE than the average (13%) in the Personal Products industry classification.', ""That's not what we like to see. That being said, a low ROE is not always a bad thing, especially if the company has low leverage as this still leaves room for improvement if the company were to take on more debt. A high debt company having a low ROE is a different story altogether and a risky investment in our books. You can see the 4 risks we have identified for Estée Lauder Companies by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here."", ""Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking."", ""It's worth noting the high use of debt by Estée Lauder Companies, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.34. With a fairly low ROE, and significant use of debt, it's hard to get excited about this business at the moment. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it."", 'Return on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.', 'But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings.

Joining me on the call today are Jon Moeller, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. I'll start with an overview of results for the October to December quarter. Jon will add perspective on our recent results and strategic focus areas and capabilities. We'll close with guidance for fiscal '24 and then take your questions. October to December was another strong quarter. Execution of our integrated strategy drove solid sales and market share results and another quarter of strong margin progress delivering strong earnings and cash results for the quarter. The strong results we've delivered in the first half of fiscal '24 enabled us to raise our outlook for core earnings per share and keep us on track to deliver within our fiscal year guidance ranges for organic sales growth, cash productivity and cash return to shareowners. We continue to see the upper range on organic sales and core EPS as likely outcome for fiscal '23, '24. So moving to second quarter numbers. Organic sales grew 4%. Volume rounded down to a decline of 1 point as continued volume acceleration in North America and Europe focused markets was offset by softer shipments in Greater China, Eastern Europe and Middle East Africa regions due to local issues in select markets. Pricing contributed 4 points to sales growth, consistent with the guidance we provided. Mix was neutral to organic sales growth. Growth across categories continues to be broad-based with 8 of 10 product categories holding or growing organic sales this quarter. Home Care, Hair Care and Grooming grew sales high single digits. Fabric Care, Family Care, feminine Care and Oral Care were up mid-single digits. Baby Care was in line with prior year. Personal Health care was down low singles against a very tough comp and a late developing cold and flu season this year. Skin and Personal Care was down mid-singles due to SK-II in China. Growth was also broad-based across geographies with North America, Europe, Asia Pacific focus markets and Latin America and Europe enterprise markets, each growing organic sales. Focus markets grew 3% for the quarter and Enterprise markets grew 7%. Organic sales in North America grew 5% with 4 points of volume growth. Over the last 5 quarters, volume growth in North America has been minus 3, flat, then 2% growth, plus 3% and now plus 4%. Strong acceleration well ahead of the underlying market trends. Europe focus markets were up 7% with 3 points of volume growth. As expected, both regions saw a step down in pricing contribution to sales growth as a large portion of price increases from last year have annualized. Importantly, volume accelerated in both regions to partially offset the pricing impact. Latin America delivered another very strong quarter with 17% organic sales growth, continued strong results in these regions. There are some targeted issues affecting other markets. Greater China organic sales were down minus 15% versus prior year. Underlying market growth was down mid- to high single digits as consumer confidence weakened further. The SK-II brand in Greater China was down 34% due to soft market conditions and a temporary headwind for Japanese brands in the market. Our consumer research indicates SK-II brand sentiment is improving, and we expect to see sequential improvement in the back half. Underlying market trends have softened in some Europe enterprise and Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa countries, such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey following multiple rounds of pricing to offset inflation and due to heightened tensions in the Middle East. Global aggregate value share was up 40 basis points versus prior year, with 28 of our top 50 category country combinations holding or growing share. In the U.S., all outlet value share was up 20 basis points versus prior year. U.S. volume share was up 50 basis points, reflecting strong volume growth. Value share in European focus markets was up 90 basis points over the past 3 months. In summary, North America, Europe focused markets, Asia Pacific focused markets and Latin America, which combined represent 3/4 of company sales, delivered over 6% of organic sales growth in quarter 2 with 3 points of volume growth and 3 points of price mix. The same markets grew 9% in quarter 1 with around 2 points of volume growth and 7 points of price/mix, continued strong organic sales growth with accelerating volume growth to mitigate the anticipated annualization of pricing consistent with our guidance. The balance 25% of company sales, including Greater China, Eastern Europe and Middle East Africa were impacted by local market issues we described. Quarter 2 organic sales for this group were down 5 points versus prior year. We expect most of these effects in these regions to be temporary or annualizing. SK-II consumption is sequentially improving. We continue to expect China market growth to improve and over time, return to mid-singles and we expect market pressures in the Middle East and Turkey to ease over time. Moving to the bottom line. Core earnings per share were $1.84, up 16% versus prior year. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS increased 18%. Core operating margin increased 400 basis points at 520 basis points of gross margin expansion were partially offset by increased marketing investments wage and benefit inflation and foreign exchange impacts in SG&A. Currency-neutral core operating margin increased 470 basis points. Productivity improvements were very strong 340 basis points help to the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 95%. We returned $3.3 billion of cash to shareowners, approximately $2.3 billion in dividends and $1 billion in share repurchase. In summary, against what continues to be a challenging and volatile operating environment, strong overall progress in the first half of the year, keeping us on track for our fiscal year guidance ranges. Now I'll pass it over to Jon for his perspective."", 'Jon R. Moeller', ""Thanks, Andre, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by underscoring a few points Andre made in his discussion of the top line trends. Overall, continued strong top line progress, 22nd consecutive quarter of 4% or better organic sales growth, volume acceleration in key markets, increases in aggregate market shares. This, despite several notable headwinds, which should be temporary, tensions in the Middle East will hopefully ease. Enterprise market volume impacts following price increases are usually temporary. While we can't talk specifics of future pricing in any market, more stable foreign exchange and commodity costs will ideally reduce the need for additional large price increases. I spent 6 days in China with the team 2 weeks ago. I met with consumers in their homes with retail CEOs with our team and with several government officials. In my view, the long-term China opportunity remains intact. The near term is likely to present some challenges. We'll see what happens with the global cough/cold season as a soft start to the season either reverses or eventually annualizes. No guarantee of immediate bounce back in any of these, but reason to believe they will improve over time. In addition to continued aggregate top line progress of very strong bottom line, mid-teens core earnings per share growth 2 quarters in a row, while increasing investments in innovation, brand building and market growth. Our team continues to execute our strategy with excellence, enabling strong results over each of the past 5 years, pre-COVID, during COVID and through a historic inflationary and pricing cycle. I want to thank them both for what they delivered and for what they're working to continue to accomplish. Our integrated strategy is unchanged. A focused portfolio of products in daily use categories where performance drives brand choice. The portfolio is performing, delivering broad-based growth across nearly all categories in most geographies for several years. The announcements we made in December to change our go-to-market approach in Argentina and Nigeria will further sharpen our focus and strengthen our value creation potential. A good example of dynamic nature of our strategy and our desire to aggressively allocate resources to where they create the most shareowner value. Next strategy element. Ongoing commitment to an investment in irresistible superiority. Through innovation across the 5 vectors of product package, brand communication, retail execution and value holistically defined. Leveraging that superiority to grow markets and our share in them to jointly create value with retail partners. The plans across the businesses are broader and stronger than at any time in the recent past as each team works to increase their margin of superiority and consumer delight. Superior innovations that are driven by deep consumer insights. Communicated to consumers with more effective and efficient marketing programs, executed in stores and online in conjunction with retailer strategies to grow categories and our brands. Price to deliver superior value across each price tier where we compete. Smooth [Terra] Charmin ultrasoft with Scallop Edge perforations, a great example of consumer insights driving innovation to improve the end-use experience. Consumer response to the new product has been overwhelmingly positive and is driving word-of-mouth recommendations on social media. Gillette's superior propositions like the GilletteLabs razor with an exfoliated bar that removes dirt and debris before the blades continue to drive growth in the global grooming category. GilletteLabs has reached shares greater than 20% in markets like Spain and France and is building momentum in the U.S. and China. The global grooming category is on track for $1 billion of retail sales growth this fiscal year with Gillette driving 2/3 of the increase, well ahead of our global share. Superior innovations like Dawn Powerwash and Dawn EZ-Squeeze in the U.S.; and Fairy Power Spray and Fairy Max in Europe are disproportionately driving market growth in hand dishwashing with value share in the U.S. approaching 67%, nearly 50% across Europe Focus markets. Third, strategy element, productivity. Improvement in all of our operations to fund investments in innovation, brand building and market growth to mitigate costs and currency challenges and to expand margins and generate cash. We're reaccelerating productivity back to pre-COVID levels with an objective for gross savings in cost of goods of up to $1.5 billion before tax. Visibility to more savings opportunity is increasing enabled by platform programs with global application across categories like Supply Chain 3.0. We're working in a new way with retailers on the totality of the supply chain end to end versus simply to optimize each piece. One example, using data and machine learning algorithms to optimize truck scheduling, to minimize idle time for drives. We're also using AI tools to optimize fill rates and for dynamic routing sourcing optimization, $200 million to $300 million of savings opportunity across these areas. We have line of sight to savings from improved marketing productivity, more efficiency and greater effectiveness, avoiding excess frequency and reducing waste while increasing reach. We're taking targeted steps to reduce overhead as we digitize more of our operations. The team has delivered strong cost savings in the first half of the year and plans to build on this momentum. Next, constructive disruption of ourselves in our industry, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends, technologies and capabilities that will shape the future of our industry and extend our competitive advantage. We continue to be a constructive disruptor of brand building, in-housing more of the media planning and placement activity using our proprietary tools and consumer data to increase effectiveness and efficiency of our communication. We're disrupting traditional lab-based innovation models to dramatically increase the speed and breadth of discovery. Last but clearly not least, we've designed and continue to refine and empowered, agile and accountable organization model, also an increasingly diverse organization, enabling us to better serve an increasingly diverse set of consumers. So strong progress across all strategic pillars with significant opportunity ahead of us. No reason to standstill as illustrated by the 4 focus areas we've outlined previously. Supply Chain 3.0 is delivering productivity as we just talked. We're also driving improved capacity plan, greater supply agility, flexibility, data transparency, scale and resilience, all the way up and down the supply chain, inclusive of our retail partners. All of this is driving higher quality, increased supply assurance and higher on-shelf availability of our products and of course, better cash and cost structures. These programs improve superiority with consumers and further strengthen what is already the top ranked supply chain by our retail partners and third-party industry surveys. Environmental sustainability, superior propositions for consumers, customers and share owners that are sustainable, driving sales and profitability while reducing the footprint of our operations, enabling consumers to reduce their footprint and innovating to deliver cross-industry solutions for some of our most pressing challenges. A good example is the 4-chamber aerial platinum pods innovation that we launched in a new cardboard package, extending our superiority advantage in product performance while improving sustainability by enabling great wash results even in cold water, already contributing to a 2-degree celsius reduction in wash temperatures in Europe against a 5-degree target also extending packaging superiority with a more attractive and more sustainable cardboard box. Digital acumen, leveraging data and digitization to delight consumers, streamline the supply chain, increase quality, drive productivity, all driving shareowner value. Fourth, the superior value equation for all employees inclusive of all genders, races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, ages and abilities for all roles to ensure we continue to attract, retain and develop the best talent and are best positioned to serve all consumers. These 4 focus areas are not new and separate strategies. They simply strengthen our ability to execute the strategy. Our strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization reinforce and build on each other. We continue to believe that there is merit and doubling down on this integrated strategy, starting with the commitment to deliver irresistibly superior propositions to consumers and retail partners fueled by productivity. We remain as confident as ever in our strategy and our ability to drive market growth and to deliver balanced growth and value creation to delight consumers, customers, employees, society and shareowners. Now back to Andre for guidance."", 'Andre Schulten', ""Thanks, Jon. As I mentioned, we expect the environment around us to continue to be volatile and challenging from input costs to currencies to consumer, retailer and geopolitical dynamics. However, our strong first half results enable us to raise or maintain key guidance metrics for the year. We're maintaining our guidance range for organic sales growth of 4% to 5% for the fiscal year. This outlook includes a normalization in underlying market growth rates that we began to see in our second quarter results as the market laps the last wave of cost recovery pricing. For P&G, we expect the pricing contribution to top line growth to reduce by an additional 1 to 2 points in the back half of the year. We will continue to price for new innovations when warranted and to mitigate FX impacts. On the bottom line, enabled by very strong earnings growth in the first half of the year, we're raising our outlook for fiscal '24 core earnings per share from a range of 6% to 9% to a range of 8% to 9% growth versus last fiscal year. This guidance implies slower bottom line growth in the second half -- as we highlighted last quarter, the second half of the fiscal year will see less pricing benefit as we annualize more prior year increases. We will also see less commodity cost benefit in the second half. Wage and benefit inflation continues throughout the supply chain and our direct costs and FX headwinds will increase versus the first half of the fiscal year. As I mentioned, we continue to expect organic sales and core EPS growth towards the upper end of the renewed guidance ranges. We estimate commodities will be a tailwind of around $800 million after tax in fiscal '24 based on current spot prices. This is consistent with the outlook we provided last quarter. We continue to expect foreign exchange will be a headwind of approximately $1 billion after tax for the fiscal year. The vast majority of this impact is driven by Argentina and is heavily skewed towards the back half of the year. This outlook is based on a forecast for continued significant devaluation of the Argentine peso, which we expect to largely offset with appropriate price increases. We now expect higher net interest expense of approximately $100 million after tax versus prior year, general inflation and higher wage and benefit costs are also earnings headwinds for the year. We expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90%. We expect to pay more than $9 billion in dividends and to repurchase $5 billion up to $6 billion in common stock combined a plan to return $14 billion to $15 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruptions or major production stoppages are not anticipated within the guidance ranges. Finally, we'll be closely watching the more volatile regions we mentioned earlier, including the health of the China market, and we'll be keeping close watch of competitive dynamics to ensure P&G brands remain a superior value for consumers and retailers. Now I'll hand it back to Jon for closing thoughts."", 'Jon R. Moeller', ""We continue to be very pleased with the strong results P&G people are delivering and a challenging operating and competitive environment, continued excellent execution of an integrated market-constructive strategy. I want to thank each of them for that. While we expect volatile consumer and macro dynamics to continue, we remain confident that the best path forward is to delve down on the strategy that has enabled strong results and remain committed to delivering balanced top and bottom line growth and value creation for shareowners. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.', 'Dara Warren Mohsenian', ""So just wanted to focus on the back half. Clearly, the 4% Q2 core sales growth result wasn't as strong as the 7% Q1 delivery, which is very robust results. So obviously, some quarterly volatility here. Can you just give us some perspective for the fiscal back half relative to Q2? And why that first half volatility as you think through some of the key geographies and volume versus price/mix and some of the temporary impacts Jon mentioned. And then just same question on EPS basically. Obviously, very strong first half that continued in Q2. Full year guidance implies a more muted second half. So is there some conservatism baked in there? Help us understand that. I know Andre touched on it, but maybe give us a bit more detail there on the back half from an earnings perspective. ."", 'Andre Schulten', ""Dara, let me start and Jon will add. On the top line, if you look at the first half, we are right in line with what we're projecting for the year, an average of 5%, and we obviously then expect about 5% for the back half. We see volatility, as you had pointed out in some geographies that we mentioned in the script. I think the core point though is the core geography, 75% of the sales are performing very well. We continue to see acceleration in volume growth in North America with 4% volume growth, 5% sales growth. Europe is very strong. Latin America, very strong. We continue to see volume acceleration in most places. So that gives us confidence that, that projects well for the second half of the year. We also expect some of the volatility that we experienced in quarter 2 to disappear or at least improve in the second half. The SK-II sentiment is improving based on our consumer research in China. And we are continuing to drive innovation, equity investment and really relying on our most loyal and passionate user base to help amplify that messaging, which is working well. So we expect the effects to improve year-over-year -- quarter-over-quarter. From an enterprise market standpoint, we also view the pricing impacts that are impacting some of the markets like Turkey, to disappear over time as pricing in the market is established, competitive pricing catches up. And then the impact of the tensions in the Middle East certainly, hopefully, will improve as well. So very strong continued performance on the core markets, which are 75% of the sales, and we expect somewhat improving trends and stabilization in the other 25%. On the EPS side, very strong performance in the front half, 17% in quarter 1, 16% in quarter 2 sets us up well for the upper end of the guidance range, which is reflected in the tightening of the guidance. However, to keep in mind, we see a reversal of a number of effects that have supported the half 1 results. We saw the majority of the commodity help flow through in the first half, and this is part of the improvement in quarter 2 EPS. We see the flow-through happening faster than we would have anticipated in some instances. So that leaves less of a contribution for the second half. We also have the majority of the foreign exchange hurt in the second half. About 75% of FX hurt of the $1 billion will hit the second half. As we indicated, the majority of that is Argentina. So we will try to offset the appropriate pricing. Nevertheless, the growth impact is tilted towards the back half. Price/mix contribution will ease. We saw still significant contribution in the first half. That will lower by 1 to 2 points in the back half, which also has an impact on EPS growth. And lastly, we continue to see wage inflation in our own operations as well as in our supply chain flowing through. Now that being said, if everything goes well, could there be upside? Sure. But we believe that guidance is appropriately reflecting the potential variability here. So those are the core drivers. John, any perspective on that."", 'John T. Chevalier', ""I have nothing to add on Andre's bottom line perspective. I would just reiterate one thing and add one thing on the top line. There are 2 questions that we've been discussing as we've gone through the first half of the year. The first relates to our ability to reaccelerate volume, which we've talked about several times in this conversation this morning. And I just want to reiterate how encouraging that progress has been. We've said it before, but it's worth saying again, in our largest market, North America, past 5 quarters, minus 30, plus 2, plus 3, plus 4, Europe, which tends to be fairly price-sensitive volumes plus 3. So that gives us confidence in terms of the momentum of the business on a forward basis. The other thing I would just call out that adds to this discussion is the breadth of the top line progress that the team has been making. 8 out of 10 categories held or grew sales in the quarter that we just completed. 21 of our top 25 brands did the same. And if you look at our top 12 brands, 9 of those are growing at high singles or better rates. And that's inclusive of all the challenges that we're managing around the world. So that gives us confidence that the top line growth that we've been delivering should continue, just as Andre said. And that should provide the ability to continue to deliver decent levels of bottom line growth as well."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.', 'Bryan Douglass Spillane', ""I just -- I want a clarification, Andre to your answer to Dara's question and then I have a question. So the clarification, I think when you responded regarding organic sales growth for the back half and tacking to the year, the 5%, is it -- is it that Procter is tracking to 5% organic sales for the year? Or were you seeing an expectation for 5% organic sales growth for the back half? I wasn't quite sure if you were talking full year or specifically about the back half."", 'Andre Schulten', ""Bryan. No, what I was talking was the full year expectation. So again, we reiterate the range of 4 to 5, but we see the possibility and strong probability that we'll be able to deliver towards the upper end of that range for the fiscal year."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.', 'Lauren Rae Lieberman', ""Great. So with the very sizable gross margin delivery this quarter and the outlook for the full year, there's a ton of reinvestment going back in the P&L, right? And this quarter, you called out the specifics, but I think also that's pretty well implied for the second half as well. So I was just curious if you could talk a little bit about incremental areas of reinvestment because the basis points are big and the dollars are even bigger. And so it just -- I don't know, like it might sound ridiculous, but it gets to a point where you start to worry externally? Is there excessive amount of reinvestment. So I'd love it, John, if you could talk through your perspective on that on making sure there's not money effectively being spent less efficiently in the P&L simply because you have that much flexibility."", 'Andre Schulten', 'Are you saying, Lauren, that you want 30% core earnings per share growth, just kidding.', 'Lauren Rae Lieberman', ""So that's kind of what I'm getting at, right? Yes."", 'John T. Chevalier', ""I'll speak first on this, and I'm sure Andre has some perspective as well. But if you look at the amount of innovation that's coming to market, both currently and in the future, and if you look at the opportunity to fully penetrate households with that innovation, in ways that delight them and improves their lives. Now is not the time to be pulling back on investments in marketing or commercialization efforts of that innovation. And that's where the majority of the incremental spend is -- has come from and will come from. We look very carefully. I don't want to ignore your question on the effectiveness of that spend and continue to see through the addition of many tools and data sets that we can increase the effectiveness of that advertising, increase the return rates of that advertising as you see in our bottom line, while increasing reach. So that's what we'll be forcing on -- we'll be very disciplined in that effort. Neither Andre or I or the rest of the team has any desire to spend money that isn't working for us."", 'Andre Schulten', ""Yes. And maybe to add, we just talked with our team actually about being very granular about the assessment of the ROI. So we don't have good investments cover for bad investments. So really go down to the country level, to the brand level to the channel level when we assess whether we are getting a payout on the investments. But the majority of the spend, as John said, is really focused on driving market growth. When you think about the opportunity on FE, for example, we've created 100% of the market growth in North America on FE, and it's still the biggest opportunity the team has in order to continue to accelerate both our own growth in a constructive way and the market given the low penetration FE has fabric enhancers. Oral-B, another example, power Oral-B was launched Oral-B iO 10, and we're also expanding distribution of Oral-B iO 3, 4 and 5. We've led 70% of global market growth with those launches. So communicating the benefit and driving penetration is a huge opportunity. So be assured, we look at ROI very carefully. And again, market growth continues to be the main area of focus when we invest incrementally."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI.', 'Robert Edward Ottenstein', 'Terrific. I was wondering if you could go into a little bit more detail on the state of the consumer in your 2 most important markets, the U.S. and China, how consumer demand develop through the quarter and into January? And when you talk about China, if you could also touch upon travel retail and maybe what SK-II was on a greater China basis, including Travel Retail as well?', 'Andre Schulten', ""I'll start, Robert, look, the U.S. continues to be a very solid, continues to impress I think a very smooth transition from pricing annualizing and overall consumption coming up in terms of volume, which is enabling us to post the volume improvement Jon was quoting over the past few quarters and still accelerating ahead of market with 4% volume growth and 50 basis points of market share growth. We continue to see trade up within our propositions. So as consumers come win, maybe at a lower tier and a lower value proposition, they continue to trade up in the U.S., which speaks to the health of the proposition, but also the health of the consumer and willingness to invest. The last data point I'll give you on the U.S. is we are able to grow as private label share or slightly up. We are up the same range. So some consumers will look for value in private label, but an equal, if not higher amount of consumers find better value in our propositions as we drive continued superiority via innovation. So I feel very strongly about U.S. We'll continue to invest to drive more market growth there, but the consumer is resilient and the business is doing well. On China, I'll begin, I'm sure Jon has an incremental perspective, but the China opportunity remains impact. If you look at the underlying market size, if you look at the potential development of the middle class, if you look at the ability to drive category penetration in our categories, all of those are huge opportunities for us. And all of those point to continued investment and commitment to the Chinese market. We have a very capable organization, and we continue to be very optimistic that we can create value honestly, when the market requires market growth to be driven by manufacturers, I think that positions us very well with our retail partners in China to have a competitive advantage and execute the model that we know how to execute in many parts of the world. In the short term, we mentioned it in the script, consumer sentiment is not fully recovered yet, and that is reflected in the results. Again, if you want to take a silver lining, we see the attractiveness of key opinion leaders and heavy discounting in key consumption periods decreasing. And that's actually good for us. And we believe that focus on brand equity, a focus on strong everyday value via priority will allow us to help grow the market back to mid-single digits and strengthen our position in the market. Last point on SK-II, no specifics. The numbers we're quoting. Obviously, on the quarter, minus 34% include the domestic travel retail channel. Nothing else to add there or other than we remain confident that as the sentiment improves, which we see already with continued investment in SK-II, we see that business recovering over the back half."", 'John T. Chevalier', ""Robert, as Andre suggested, I'll just provide a little bit of additional color on China, having spent a fair amount of my career involved in that market and having just spent almost a full week there. In digesting the Q2 numbers, the P&G numbers in China, you have to think about a couple of things. One is SK-II, which just for clarity for everybody, is really driven by an anti-Japanese brand sentiment, which Andre described in our opening remarks, that's related to the release of wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear facility. And we've had not identical but similar consumer sentiment dynamics in the past as it relates to this brand and as it relates to the relationship between those 2 countries. And it has always resolved itself with SK-II moving to higher heights -- so if you look at the decline in China on the quarter on our business, I don't know the exact number, but basically, think of it as 50% of that being the dynamic I just described and 50% of it being the market dynamics. The second thing that Andre referred to is important to understand as well. The heaviest purchase period historically in China was in November. I'm talking years past. And that was always a little bit disconcerting for us because a disproportionate amount of product moved during Double 11. It filled consumer pantries -- it often have filled some retailer pantries. It often are inventories and warehouses. It often moved at heavily discounted prices. The amount of movement during that period this year was much lower. And as Andre said, we view that as a good thing. -- and it's a temporary impact -- a quarterly impact the Q2 impact on the indices, but it moves us into a healthier position. If you think about the medium to longer term, Andre mentioned the addition of -- the expected addition of 200 million middle income consumers to China's population. That's very encouraging. Also, I mentioned I was in homes, I was in stores, I was with our retail partners. They are -- they remain encouraged about the future of China. I was telling -- I was talking to our organization at the end of the trip our organization in China. And I told them I had never seen as much alignment in the market between our intentions and our strategy, our retailers' intention and their strategy and the government's intention and their strategy. All focused on what's being referred to as quality market growth. As Andre suggested, that's a very good thing for us. We can play very effectively and help with that agenda, help society on a parallel path. And so you put all that together, and I agree it with Andre and I said it earlier, I think the growth potential here remains intact. There are some specific items that exacerbate the trend that you're seeing on the quarter, but I expect this will continue to be a source of both growth and value creation for P&G. Sorry for the long answer, but I think it's important."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank.', 'Stephen Robert R. Powers', ""A risk of provoking another long answer. I guess what struck me this morning is just the competence and front foot in this, if that's a word in both of your comments this morning. And I think, Jon, your strategic perspective destruct me as particularly assertive. Now I say that in the context that on the outside, I think based on some of the market challenges you called out in China, the Middle East, et cetera, this quarter. Concerns on to grow that P&G is likely to be thrown off course or maybe getting complacent. And I guess my question is, why is that wrong? And what to you are the keys to keeping the organization's eye on the ball focused grounded and executing on all those strategic pillars that you went through?"", 'Andre Schulten', ""Thanks, Steve. The -- I want to step back first. We do face a lot of challenges in the world that we all live in, and those have impacted our business. But stepping back probably 5 years, the level of challenge has always existed, whether it was COVID, whether it was the highest consumer inflation in 40 years, whether it was the 50% reduction, 5-0 and our profit over 2 years as a result of commodities, foreign exchange and transportation costs and this organization overcame all of that. They've overcome the challenges we faced in the last quarter, and that gives me a huge amount of confidence that we have the ability, the skills, the strategy and the agility to continue to meet challenges face first and work through them in ways that are constructive for consumers, for customers, for employees, for society and for share owners. We talk a lot internally about the complacency and the evils associated with it. So it's front and center in our thought process. I have a couple of kind of [trite signs] that I use in communicating with the organization and one of them is that complacency pills. You don't see a complacent organization when you're looking at the breadth of growth that they're delivering, when you're looking at the continued after a decade, continued work on productivity, yielding the kind of margin progress that we saw this quarter. You don't see it as they reinvest that into growing markets and to growing household penetration and shares. We're not immune to it, so you're right to raise it. But I feel, as you said, very -- I feel the organization, not just myself, are very much on their front foot as they move to take advantage of the opportunities that we see in front of us. I frankly never seen as many opportunities. Now there's a lot of work associated with capitalizing on those opportunities. And there will be lots of challenges and forces that will be working against us in that endeavor. But the accomplishments of the midterm passed the most recent past, the reflection of the work that the organization is doing all the way down the income statement and the innovation progress that I'm seeing not only in market or coming to market, but as we review the pipelines across each of the categories, also give me a good degree of confidence."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Filippo Falorni of Citi.', 'Filippo Falorni', 'Jon, I wanted to go back to China. You mentioned clearly that there was an impact from the cycling of the 11/11 shipments. And can you give us some sense like how down it was China and SK-II during that period and maybe some of the accelerate coming out of December that gives you some confidence in the improvement in the country in the second half?', 'John T. Chevalier', ""I apologize. I honestly don't operate at that level of data aggregation. So I don't have the answer with any degree of specificity. But I know the impact was there. I know it's a good thing for us long term, and I apologize, but I'm just going to leave it there."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities.', 'Christopher Michael Carey', ""The U.S. volume growth improvement is very constructive. It's quite a bit better than what we can see in the U.S. Nielsen data, for example, I know the data is far from perfect, but I wonder if you could just help characterize whether you have any nontrack channel boost or in general, talk about some of the specifics of what has really driven this volume improvement over the past 5 quarters? And I think maybe just connected to that, if you could. There's a lot of debate right now across consumer staples around just what does drive volume improvement, whether that's promotional activity or increased advertising or just the lapping of pricing. And I find it interesting today that this dynamic of sequential volume growth. And I wonder if you can just maybe talk about, in general, why this seems to be happening, what you're doing to drive this or whether this is just the natural evolution of markets post substantial pricing?"", 'Andre Schulten', ""Chris, let me start. On the noncovered channel side, we've seen noncovered outpaced cover channels for a period of time. This is not different. There's nothing specific happening there. We see a trend of some consumers going into larger pack sizes. Those are in club. Those are online. And many of those effects continue, but there's nothing differential between covered and noncovered channels, both are performing well. Noncovered a little bit ahead of covered. So that's why you don't see the results in the track data. What's driving the growth? I would argue it's all of the above that you've mentioned, right? I think we're seeing pricing lapping consumers seeing the pricing normalizing on the shelf. We don't see an increase in promotion depth of frequency, quite frankly. We are still operating at about 85% of pre-COVID levels from a volume sold on deal perspective. Competition is in a similar range. So there's no escalation of promotion. But what drives it is strong innovation, innovation that is focused on growing the market and strong communication of that innovation in a very targeted way leveraging our capability to be very detailed and very intentional on who we talk to at what point in time with what messaging. And the U.S. is probably our most sophisticated market in that regard, and it showed the ROIs and in the results back to Lauren's question earlier. A few examples, just the Gillette business innovation on the core with the Labs razor provides a growth driver. But adding new jobs to be done like female facial hair removal on male and female body hair removal, incremental jobs that were communicated appropriately of the benefit of the product drive incremental consumption. I mentioned Oral-B penetration is still low on the electric toothbrush. And as we're converting more and more users that drives incremental growth with more innovation, but also expansion of the lower-priced options of Oral-B iO 3, 4 and 5 and then the launch of Oral-B 10. Last example I'll give you, and then I'll let Jon add is Olay Super serum just to cover a few of the categories here is a new serum -- the most successful new serum in the category, 30% of those users are new to the category. So again, communication, strong innovation, premium propositions and bringing new cruises to the categories what's driving that accelerated volume growth."", 'John T. Chevalier', ""And I'll just pile on with -- I agree with everything that Andre said. So just a couple more examples to show you, again, the breadth of the innovation that's being commercialized currently. He talked about Olay, very exciting innovation in our hair care business as well. An example, Head & Shoulders BARE which is a more efficacious antidandruff offering with the BARE minimum number of ingredients, 9 to be exact in an eco-friendly package, 45% less plastic, and it's one of the drivers of growth, particularly in North America on the Head & Shoulders brand, which is up 8% fiscal year-to-date. Another example in a different category, Swiffer PowerMop, which is driving that business up 11% fiscal year-to-date and has built both volume and value share at about 1.5 points level. So that's -- and back to Steve's question on complacency, this is what we need to keep doing. And that's why we talk about the best path forward being doubling down on exactly these things. They do drive market -- they do drive volume. They do drive sales, and they do it profitably."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.', 'Andrea Faria Teixeira', ""So I wanted to go back to that 4% volume growth commentary in U.S. and representing the EU focus markets. And despite a tough comparison for the cold and flu season. It seems that you had market share gains in laundry and some other key categories. So can you comment on how you exit the quarter for the cold and flu season in the U.S. and in Europe? And separately, have you -- it seems like you secured more distribution in the balance of this fiscal year. So any comment on that. And a clarification on China. You said that you're confident that the growth will resume to the mid-single-digit level. I'm assuming that's not a comment for this fiscal year. But as you commented out, Jon, in terms of like the Head & shoulder, and I know hair care is a big category there and your [company easy comps] in hair. So I was wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more than SK-II in particular."", 'John T. Chevalier', ""Let me just take China real quick and then turn it over to Andre the cough/cold trend, et cetera. The mid-single-digit number that we referred to is an expectation of longer-term market growth. You're correct. It is not an expectation of ours for either the market or our business in this current fiscal year. On the broader beauty question, when you take SK-II and the market impacts in China, out of the equation, you see a business that's performing extraordinarily well. I mentioned Head & Shoulders, which is the largest shampoo brand in the world, up 8% fiscal year-to-date. If you look at North America Pantene fiscal year-to-date, up 15%, our Skin and Personal Care business up double digits. The same is true for the beauty business in an enterprise L.A. and then Europe. So it's a very strong business benefiting from the exact same strategies, obviously, applied differently that we're executing across the balance of the company. And that will, over time, as the market corrects itself, be demonstrated in China as well."", 'Andre Schulten', ""So on the other two questions on PHC, Andrea, look, the business is obviously a very, very strong past for your average growth rate of 13%. So the underlying strength of the business is very healthy. We see an impact of the cold/cough season. The season is still above average, but it's below a record season last year, and it's developing a little bit slower in the current profile, which means there could be some upside coming as we -- as time goes by. Last year, Vicks was 28% in the same quarter. So you can see the high base that we mentioned in the prepared remarks."", 'John T. Chevalier', ""Just one thing on that, sorry to interrupt Andre, that I think is relatively straightforward, but it's worth mentioning. As we were all coming out of COVID, going through our first cough -- our first non-COVID or light COVID cough/cold season. It's not surprising that having but spent time in our homes for the last 2 to 3 years at the level of immunity was not high. And therefore, the level of incidence was very high. So that's what we're annualizing against combined with a slower start to the normal season. As Andre says, we'll wait to see how that all materializes. We have seen some increase in incidents. You can probably hear a little bit of a frog in my voice this morning. I heard one on Andre's."", 'Andre Schulten', ""Right. We're contributing. Here we go. Just last point on PHC. If you look at the share development in every treatment area that we cover in PHC, we're up in share, in every treatment area, we're up in organic sales across regions. So again, it's purely a seasonal element. On distribution, Andrea, I won't give you an answer rather than obviously driving innovation, driving incremental sales for our retail partners driving category growth helps with their desire to have our brands present on their shelf."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Peter Grom of UBS.', 'Peter K. Grom', ""So I know you maintained your commodity outlook this morning, but just given the first half performance, the outlook does not bend as much of a tailwind from here, which you alluded to, Andre. But can you maybe just unpack what you're seeing across your key cost buckets, where are things getting better? Where are things getting worse? And maybe just based on current spot rates, like how should we think about the phasing? Would you expect deflation in both 3Q and 4Q? Or is there any potential for costs to become a headwind as we exit the year?"", 'Andre Schulten', ""Peter, the commodity basket is wide complex and changing very quickly. So the best guess we have is what we told you, 800 million of tailwind for the year, which the majority of which has been flown through the P&L in the front half. What I'll leave you with, I don't expect any headwind from commodity in the second half. It continues to be a tailwind. The second thought I'll leave you with is the impact on the P&L given the time it takes for commodity changes to flow through our contract structures and our own variance holding policy make the time lag significant. So even if we saw significant volatility on commodity spot prices, the impact on the fiscal will decrease over time simply because of those 2 dynamics, but continue to expect tailwinds just less than you saw in half one."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs.', 'Jason M. English', ""And belated Happy New Year to you all. A couple of questions. We've talked a few times about the North America volume strength. I had in my notes that you're lapping some undershipment that should have been a couple point benefit to this quarter. I don't think you've mentioned it so far. So am I wrong? Was there not an sizable transitory benefit this quarter? And then it's encouraging to hear the confidence that you're expressing around sort of it sounds like an imminent improvement in SK-II words like recovery and improvement throughout the back half. With the decline sort of half related to Japan boycotts and half related to market conditions, where are you seeing the improvement? Is that dissipating concerns around Japanese brands? Or are you actually seen improvement in market conditions?"", 'Andre Schulten', ""So the volume, we don't see a transitory effect on the volume side, Jason. First of all, -- so the base -- there's always some base volatility, as you know, in terms of inventories, in terms of our ability to ship, but there is no material impact that I would call out that would have to be taken into account if you look at the U.S. volume results, so nothing there. The SK-II improvement, again, I would -- I want to pace expectations, but the improvement is really in the consumer sentiment that we're seeing, where we had very high social media coverage in quarter 1 leading to negative sentiment and negative top-of-mind awareness of the brand. That is now dying down. And honestly, most consumers have gone back to a neutral position open to SK-II. And so what we're doing is really doubling down with innovation and doubling down with communication on the efficacy, the quality of the product, the quality of the brand and leveraging the most loyal and passionate consumer group to help us make the case for SK-II which we believe will help us improve run rates in the second half. The market dynamics, we continue to see bumpy even over the next quarters improving, but there will be volatility there."", 'John T. Chevalier', ""It's just an end of one, Jason. So it's kind of irrelevant. But I was in the home of a heavy SK-II user in Beijing. And I asked her about this dynamic and how it was affected in her purchasing. And she kind of laughed, and it wasn't the normal nervous laugh. It was -- and she said she followed that up with, if Japanese consumers aren't afraid of this, why should I be. And she said, I'm much more afraid of the pimple that I will get if I don't use this than I am about. So it's starting to normalize. Again, that's [end of one]. It was also interesting to me to see what was happening with her kind of personal inventory and just looking at the liquid fill levels in the bottles, which were low. So I think there's a dynamic as well where a number of consumers just kind of waited to see how this whole thing played out and reduce their personal stocks and the process. But again, that's probably need here there, but I thought it was worth sharing."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Callum Elliott of Bernstein.', 'Callum Elliott', 'My question guys is about your end price market restructuring, which I think in the release you described as substantial liquidation of the affected markets in places like Argentina and Nigeria. And I guess, look, recognizing that these are not huge markets for you today. From a profit perspective, this still feels like a fairly extreme decision and clearly, a challenging macro backdrop today in those markets. But in the case of Nigeria, probably one of the highest long-term potential economic market. So my question is Jon I know these enterprise markets for your baby, so to speak, for a number of years. Just hoping you can walk us through what I imagine must have been a difficult strategic decision.', 'John T. Chevalier', ""Yes, these decisions are not taken lightly. A couple of points. One is where we're moving to an import model which will be the case in Nigeria, we maintain an option on the future of those brands in those markets. We're just choosing to operate in a way that's that frankly is viable. You get into some tough situations in some of these markets with currency controls with pricing controls with the ability to dividend money out of these markets. And at some point, you run into a set of conditions that just make it impossible to operate. You can't get -- you can't source dollars as an example, in order to purchase the ingredients and raw materials, you need to manufacture your products. And so we've come into a decision when those situations present themselves to be pragmatic to be value creative and to flow resources to bigger opportunities that present more near-term opportunity, while in some cases, maintaining our optionality on the long term. Andre, I don't know if you want to add anything to that."", 'Andre Schulten', ""Yes, I just want to clarify because the strategic intent really is what Jon described, right? We are moving in Nigeria to an import market, we will still be present, but it's a better way to serve the consumer and a better way for us to create value. In Argentina, we are divesting our Fabric and Home Care business, and again, are looking to find a better go-to-market model. The language you're quoting Callum is substantial liquidation, that's an accounting term. And that accounting term is really defining the point at which we recognize the accumulated foreign exchange translation loss in those markets, which is part of that noncash restructuring that we talked about. So the accounting term doesn't represent the business execution. It is a technical term that once we get to that point of substantial liquidation, we will recognize the accumulated foreign exchange translation loss."", 'John T. Chevalier', 'By the way, as a prior CFO would have had no hope of explaining that to you as eloquently as the current CFO just did.', 'Andre Schulten', ""I won't comment."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Olivia Tong of Raymond James.', 'Olivia Tong Cheang', ""Great. Clearly, you've generated some impressive growth in the U.S. and Europe, so I want to bring it back to the developed markets, and you've held on very nicely the price. So I wanted to ask you about competitive response and any pushback from retailers or increase in promotion from competition, given the share gains you've made and whether you're seeing any response there?"", 'Jon R. Moeller', ""You want to talk competitive promotion, Andre, and then I'll talk to customers."", 'John T. Chevalier', ""Happy to. Olivia, so I started to mention this in the U.S. Our promotion level is still below pre-COVID about an 85 index competitive promotion level around 90 index. So very similar. We don't see a substantial increase in either depth or frequency in U.S. In Europe, we do see an increase in frequency, we do not see any increase in depths. Actually, both frequency and depth are still below pre-COVID levels, but frequency is increasing. So competitive environment still stable. And I think it's also driven by the fact that we are driving growth. We are driving market growth, and that contributes to the share growth, which means we can grow, but also it doesn't drive necessarily negative cycles in terms of pricing in the market."", 'Andre Schulten', ""The whole idea, just building on Andre's last point there is to create business, not take business. And that works out well for us. It works out well for the categories that we compete in, and it works out well for our retail partners. And that is really the focus of the existing interchange with our retail partners. It was #1, 2 and 3 supply as we've solidified our supply chains, the conversation moves very quickly to how do we work together to grow markets. That's a win-win-win proposition, a win for them, a win for us, a win for consumers and, of course, adding a fourth win for shareowners. So that's the state of play. And I experienced that in Europe, I experienced -- I was in Europe just before Christmas. As you know, I was just in China, that was the nature of the conversation there, and it's clearly the nature of the conversation here in the U.S."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel.', 'Mark Stiefel Astrachan', ""I wanted to go back to China for, you have a great time, I guess, on this call. The last quarter, you guys had talked about a portfolio structure examination. I guess I'm curious whether there's -- any update on that or what even does that mean? And maybe specifically, any underlying changes in consumer attitude towards beauty is a category including what is perceived to be relevant by brand or efficacy -- and also sort of related to that, it just seems a bit more of a sickle category, more trendy category than some of the others that you were in? And I guess I'm specifically talking in China as opposed to globally, so you can sort of parse out that, I guess, if you want. But any thoughts on maintaining a presence in a category that has more subjective sort of usage than some of your other categories on everyday usage?"", 'Andre Schulten', ""I'd offer a couple of thoughts there. One, China is our second largest market, sales and profits. Beauty represents a significantly disproportionate amount of the business. So if we weren't committed to the Beauty business in China, you'd have to ask yourself a different question. Second, when we did our significant portfolio restructuring, however many years ago, that was now into daily use categories where performance drives brand choice, we did the same with beauty. Exiting the most fickle to use your Symantecs portions of the business. We exited what I call fashion fragrances and flavors. The brands that we have remaining in the categories that we play in, there's real opportunity to drive long-term loyalty with superior performance. That's true in China, that's true outside of China. And there will always be a higher trial rate in that category than in many other categories. That's not a bad thing. It helps demonstrate the superiority of what we do offer and people come back to our brands. So if the question is commitment to beauty in China, the answer is yes."", 'Operator', 'Our final question will come from Edward Lewis of Redburn Atlantic.', 'Edward James Lewis', ""We've been accustomed to strong performance in the U.S. for a number of years, but some notable to see the stronger performance in Europe, again, with volume and price. I guess that comes at a time when the spent of scrutiny over here on pricing levels. So can you talk more about what's behind the strong results for Europe at present?"", 'Andre Schulten', ""Look, I think the execution of the strategy in Europe is really behind the strength of the results. The team has done a fantastic job in combining the price increases that needed to be taken to recover the commodity cost increases with very strong innovation that delights the consumer at the time when they see higher pricing materialize on the shelf. And that's really behind the benign volume impact as we took the pricing and behind the acceleration of volume growth now that pricing is established in the market. We've done that. A few examples. Jon mentioned aerial I'll mention aerial as well, but aerial parts in a more sustainable packaging launched with the price increase that we needed to take has been building organic sales by up to 20% or higher. So the results are really a combination of strong innovation, pricing and therefore, maintaining consumers coming into the franchise and trading up not different from the U.S. We convinced ourselves for years that what mattered most in Europe was price, specifically the lower the better. And that wasn't an uninformed decision. You had the highest development of heavy discounters, for example, in Europe, which would then indicate that price is an important part of the consumer value proposition. But as Andre said, in the last number of years, we've really pushed innovation as a driver of value, not forgetting about value but delivering it through performance. And that, combined with the executional capability of that market, which has just been phenomenal. And I want to thank them all as long as you've given me the opportunity to do that has led to just really terrific results and I believe sustainable results. Great. Thank you for your time this morning. I know it's a little bit of a difficult quarter to unpack. There's a lot going on. The net of that, although is very positive, strong, really strong earnings per share growth while increasing investments in the business, both present and future, maintaining topline momentum, building volume momentum and building share. As I expressed before, I have a higher degree of confidence in our ability to achieve a level of success going forward, and that's based entirely on both the strategy and the ability of our organization to deliver against that. Look forward to seeing many of you at CAGNY in a month or so, and we'll advance the conversation at that point. We're around Jon Chevalier sitting across the table from me right now. He's around all day. Andre is around. They'll get angry if you call me, so call them, but have a great day. Thanks."", 'Operator', ""That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.""]"

Bought $50 million worth of stock in the quarter. Of course, Ma is no longer executive chairman, but still an important shareholder over there. And then Chairman Joe Tsai has been buying too. And Bloomberg pointing out this is actually the first time his fund has purchased shares since at least the last quarter of 2017.', ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. And it seems to represent a change here, right? Because even Ma himself has been sort of critical of Alibaba falling behind some of its competitors, Temu Group. Temu, for example, owned by PDD.

But yikes, I mean, it's still down about 40% in the past 12 months."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yes, it is. Let's talk about another company we're watching today. That is Johnson & Johnson. It posted an earnings beat for the fourth quarter sales, surging in its pharmaceutical and medical devices business. The shares, though, are down here 1.6%. It looks like analysts and investors were zeroing in on the profit margins in its medical device unit. The company put that down too. They had some costs related to an acquisition. They had commodity, inflation. They called it an unfavorable product mix as well.

Now I will turn the call over to Andy Oxley, our President and CEO."", 'Anthony Oxley', ""Thanks, Katie. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm joined on the call today by Jim Allen, our Chief Financial Officer, and Mark Walker, our Chief Operating Officer. Before we discuss this quarter's results, I'd like to take a moment to introduce myself since this is my first quarterly public conference call. I joined Forestar at the beginning of the calendar year, transitioning from my prior tenure at D.R. Horton. While there, I served in numerous roles, the most recent being Senior Vice President of Business Development. In addition to being actively involved in D.R. Horton's relationships in strategic land banking and development, I oversaw opening new markets and M&A activity, including being involved in the D.R. Horton investment in Forestar. I'm excited to have joined the Forestar team and the opportunity to serve in my new role as CEO. I have the utmost respect and appreciation for what Dan Bartok, the company's previous CEO, and the Forestar team accomplished with Dan at the helm. We thank him for his many contributions to Forestar during his six years of service. Forestar's strong balance sheet, healthy pre-tax margins, and robust land portfolio position us well for future growth. With over 25 years of experience in land acquisition, development, and home building, I'm confident we will continue to expand Forestar's platform and operations to further strengthen our position as a leading lot developer. We remain focused on investing for future growth, turning our inventory, maximizing returns, and consolidating market share in the highly fragmented lot development industry. Now, on to our results. We are pleased with our first quarter results, highlighted by net income increasing 84% to $38.2 million, or $0.76 per diluted share. Our pre-tax income increased 84% to $51.2 million, and our pre-tax profit margin improved 380 basis points to 16.7%. Our consolidated revenues increased 41% to $305.9 million, while lots sold increased 39% to 3,150 lots. These results reflected significant improvement in demand for finished lots compared to the first fiscal quarter of 2023, when lot -- when builders were reducing starts in anticipation of lower demand for new homes after mortgage interest rates rose rapidly. Jim will now discuss our first quarter's financial results in more detail."", 'James Allen', 'Thank you, Andy. In the first quarter, net income increased 84% to $38.2 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, compared to $20.8 million, or $0.42 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Consolidated revenues for the quarter increased 41% to $305.9 million, compared to $216.7 million in the prior year quarter. Lots sold in our first fiscal quarter increased 39% to 3,150 lots, with an average sales price of $96,400. We expect continued quarterly fluctuations in our average sales price based on the geographic location and lot size mix of our deliveries. Our pretax income increased 84% to $51.2 million, compared to $27.9 million in the first quarter of last year, and our pretax profit margin this quarter was 16.7%, compared to 12.9% in the prior year quarter. Our gross profit margin was 23.8%, up 280 basis points sequentially, and up 190 basis points from a year ago. Gross margin was positively impacted by the closeout of a legacy community during the quarter. Excluding the legacy community lot sales, our first quarter gross profit margin would have been 22.8%. In the first quarter, SG&A expense was $28 million. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A expense improved 140 basis points to 9.2%, from 10.6% in the prior year quarter. We will continue to focus on controlling our SG&A costs while ensuring that our infrastructure supports our business. Mark.', 'Mark Walker', 'As for current market conditions, the supply of new and existing homes at affordable price points is still limited, and demographics supporting housing demand remain favorable, despite elevated mortgage interest rates and inflationary pressures. Builder incentives have helped bridge the affordability gap for many homebuyers, and low resale supply continues to be a driver of buyers choosing new construction. Supply of vacant developed lots, especially at affordable price points, continues to be constrained across our footprint, and Forestar is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the shortage of finished lots. Our ongoing focus is to develop lots for homes at affordable price points, demonstrated by our average sales price this quarter of roughly $96,000. Availability of contractors and necessary materials has improved over the past several months, but we have not seen overall reductions in the cost of developing land. We will continue value engineering our projects and work with our trade partners to develop lots in the most efficient way possible. Our development cycle times have continued to be infected by governmental delays. Homebuilders continue to compete to secure land and lot positions, and many are looking to replace current closed out communities to position for future growth. As a result, we are not seeing any softening in land prices. However, in most markets, we have seen an adjustment back to normal contract terms. Jim?', 'James Allen', ""D.R. Horton is our largest and most important customer. 16% of the homes D.R. Horton started in the past 12 months were on a Forestar developed lot. With a mutually stated goal of one out of every three homes D.R. Horton sells to be on a lot developed by Forestar, we have significant opportunity to grow our market share within D.R. Horton. We also continue to work on expanding our relationships with other homebuilders. Ten percent of our first quarter deliveries, or 316 lots, were sold to other homebuilders, which includes 124 lots that were sold to a lot banker who expects to sell those lots to D.R. Horton at a future date. Seven percent of our deliveries in the prior year quarter were sold to third party customers. Katie? Forestar's underwriting criteria for new development projects remains unchanged at a minimum 15 percent pre-tax return on average inventory and a return of our initial cash investment within 36 months. During the first quarter, we invested approximately $450 million in land and land development, split equally between land development and land acquisition. Given the strong demand for finished lots, this quarter's investment was almost double the prior year quarter. We still expect our investments in land acquisition and development to total $1.5 to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2024, subject to market conditions. Our lot position at December 31st was 82,400 lots, of which 55,400 lots are owned and 27,000 lots are controlled through purchase contracts. At quarter end, we have 7,300 finished lots on hand. We continue to target a three to four year owned inventory of land and lots and remain focused on managing our development in phases to deliver finished lots at a pace that matches market demand, consistent with our emphasis on capital efficiency. 30 percent of our owned lots are under contract to sell, representing approximately $1.6 billion of future revenue. These contracts have $141 million of hard-earned money deposits associated with them. Another 32 percent of our owned lots are subject to a right of first offer to D.R. Horton based on executed purchase and sale agreements. Jim? We have significant liquidity and are using modest leverage to keep our balance sheet strong. We ended the quarter with approximately $840 million of liquidity, including an unrestricted cash balance of $460 million and $380 million of available capacity on our undrawn revolving credit facility. Total debt at December 31st was $705 million, with no senior note maturities until fiscal 2026, and our net debt to capital ratio was 14.9 percent. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion of stockholder's equity, and our book value per share increased to $28.21, up 15 percent from a year ago. Four Star's capital structure is one of our biggest competitive advantages, and it sets us apart from other land developers. Project-level land acquisition and development loans are less available today and have continued to become more expensive, impacting most of our competitors. Other developers generally use project-level development loans, which are typically more restrictive, have floating rates, and create administrative complexity, especially in a volatile rate environment. Our capital structure provides us with operational flexibility, while our strong liquidity positions us to take advantage of attractive opportunities when they arise. Andy, I'll hand it back to you for closing remarks. Thanks, Jim. We are pleased with Four Star's start to fiscal 2024. Our team maintained double-digit revenues while continuing to deliver growth with strong profitability. Elevated mortgage interest rates continue to impact affordability, but the underlying fundamentals of a housing shortage remain in place. We believe the low supply of existing homes will continue to drive buyers to new construction, and our strong relationship with D.R. Horton provides a clear path for growth. Our guidance for fiscal 2024 remains unchanged. Based on current market conditions, we expect to deliver between 14,500 and 15,500 lots and generate $1.4 to $1.5 billion of revenue. We are closely monitoring each market as we strive to balance pace and price to maximize returns in each project. We are the market leader in a highly fragmented and undercapitalized industry and uniquely positioned to take advantage of builder demand for finished lots. There is a significant opportunity to expand our presence in markets that we operate in, and our goal remains the same, to double our market share to 5% over the intermediate term. We expect to aggregate significant market share over the next few years while maintaining a disciplined approach when investing capital to enhance the long-term value of Four Star. John, at this time we'll open the line for questions. Thank you. At this time we will be conducting a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star 1 on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star 2 if you'd like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. One moment please while we poll for questions. Our first question comes from Truman Patterson with Wolf Research. Please proceed. Hey, good afternoon everyone. Andy, congrats on the role. Look forward to working with you in the future. I realize you've only officially been in the role a short time here, but now that you're officially in the seat, are there any kind of big picture initiatives, shifts in how you're thinking about the business coming from the largest builder to now the largest land company? I'd love to hear just any thoughts there. It seems like the healthy growth initiatives that Four Star had laid out previously, doubling market share, seems like those are largely unchanged. So any commentary there would be helpful. Thank you very much. I appreciate the opportunity to be here. Our goal does not change, as you said. Our goal is to achieve a 5% market share as quickly and efficiently as we can. So we're looking to grow the business. Perfect. And then with your gross margins, I realize they can be lumpy kind of quarter to quarter. I believe you all said current quarter was about 22.8% excluding a closeout community, which is relatively elevated higher end of history. Could you all help us understand whether there were any other kind of items or one-time items during the quarter where this might not be repeatable at this level? Or is it a little bit more sustainable given your all's cost advantages versus the smaller peers where there's tighter lending conditions, higher cost of capital, et cetera? Hi, Truman. As you know, we don't provide guidance with respect to margins. And we underwrite returns, not margins. So it does create some variability in margins from quarter to quarter depending on which projects deliver lots within the quarter because we have a mix of, you know, projects with higher or lower margins. However, I mean, we can provide some historical context. And if you look at maybe the last nine quarters adjusted for impairments and, you know, kind of unusually high legacy lot or land sales, our margins have fluctuated between 18% to 23% for the last nine quarters. In the last five quarters, it's been 21% to 23%. If you look at last year's, our fiscal year, we reported 21.2%. But if you exclude the impairments that we recognized in the last fiscal year, that would have been 22.5% compared to the 22.8%, you know, for this quarter. So you can see that our margins have actually been fairly consistent for the last couple years, you know, kind of in that low 20s range. Yeah, and Truman, this is Katie. There wasn't anything else in the quarter that was significant enough to call out. Okay, that's very helpful. And if I could sneak another one in on kind of the other sides of returns at an enterprise level, if you will, but your lot delivery guidance over the next few quarters kind of implies flattish year over year, if I'm doing the math right. It seems like perhaps given some of the growth in the industry, is that, you know, a reality? Or, you know, on the flip side, did you all perhaps pull forward some sales into 1Q, and now you might have a little bit of a developed lot shortage, if you will, or a gap, if you will, just hoping to understand kind of the puts and takes of the guidance. Well, you know, first quarter was a good quarter, but, you know, it's still early in the year. Based on, you know, the current market conditions, our current lot positions, our development timelines, you know, we still believe that $14,500 to $15,500 is a realistic range. Yeah, Truman, that's Mark. We also expect, you know, new home starts to align with new home sales. So if home builder sales accelerate, we could be at the higher end of our range, but we're going to monitor the spring selling season, remain flexible to capitalize on any market upside. I was saying that there could be a bottleneck in achieving that upside that could be related to finished lot deliveries, particularly related to government approval delays. Yeah, we alluded to it in our scripted remarks, but we've continued to see delays from municipalities, land development, so that could definitely be the bottleneck. Gotcha. Understood. Thanks for your time, and good luck in the next couple quarters. Thank you. Thank you. The next question is from Carl Reichert with BTIG. Please proceed, Carl. Thanks, everybody. Andy, official welcome. Katie, good to have you back, too. Thank you. Can I go back to something Mark mentioned about normal contract terms and sort of a movement back that direction? Can you expand on that a little bit by what you mean by normal contract terms and what was really abnormal prior? Yeah, so we're seeing more takedown schedules than we were seeing before, less bulk closings, things of that nature. So although it was increasingly difficult today, those normal contract terms have kind of gone back to what was historically the case for I would tell you a decade. And so we're getting land sellers that are getting a little bit more realistic. I'll give you an example. So if you had a big project and you were going to go bulk a large project, they're now giving you time between your takedowns to take that land down over time versus having to bulk purchase that project. That's probably one of the big normalizations in contract terms. We've also seen more normalized due diligence timeframes. So instead of 30 days, you're getting 60 or 90 days. Okay. So more efficient. It takes longer but easier to manage and more efficient for you all in terms of capital deployment and receded capital. Is that the way to think about it as opposed to lumpier? Okay. Great. Thank you. And then if I can get to Truman's question a different way on the guide for the year. So do you have lots that you think right now you'd anticipate finishing in the next two quarters that would be available for sale that don't have a buyer or contract yet? And if so, what's that number? I don't have the specific number of lots that are going to be finished that aren't under contract right now. I can probably get that for you. I'd have to check. But we definitely do have stuff that's under development that's not been put under contract yet. In a four-star source project, we aim to have those under contract anywhere from three to six months before delivery. And so there's definitely still opportunity to put stuff under contract that's going to close in the back half of the year. Okay. All right. Great. Thank you, Katie. And then last question. You did another deal with a lot banker who's working with your largest customer. And I'm curious about whether or not that's a potential growth area for you, whether a lot banker will be working with Horton or not. We've certainly talked to plenty who are trying to deploy more capital and looking for opportunities. Can you talk about what that opportunity might be? And then I should sidecar onto that also because I always ask about single-family rental and how that business looks, if it looks interesting at all or is that still sort of a one-off? I'll start and I'll let somebody else chime in if they need to. But, I mean, as far as the opportunity with land bankers, it's not really our decision. You know, we're not marketing our lots to land bankers. But if one of our customers wants to use a land banker to step in as an intermediary, we're completely fine with that. It just, you know, enhances our capital efficiency and gets that inventory off of our balance sheet. So we're pretty indifferent if there's a land banker that's stepping in on behalf of a builder, as long as, you know, we have all of the checks and balances in place. And as it relates to the part of your question on build for rent, yes. We do think that that is a sustainable part of our business. If we can have portions of a larger community, which we could improve our pace through selling to a customer that has build for rent components or multifamily components, you know, that's something that we would absolutely entertain. Okay. I appreciate it all. Thanks very much. Thanks, Carl. The next question comes from Anthony Petinari with Citigroup. Please proceed. Hi, this is Asher Sonin on for Anthony. Thanks for taking my question. I think you've talked, you know, in the past about, you know, the capital structure offering competitive advantages, but I'm just wondering, you know, have you seen any concrete kind of like maybe opportunities in the land market come up, come about, or any sort of like concrete evidence? That's sort of coming to fruition or maybe that that'll take a little bit longer. Yeah, we're not seeing any really concrete evidence. What we do see, it does give us a little bit more of a competitive advantage having the liquidity at hand, competing against another developer. And at times too, you know, the other builders are using that developer in a much smaller fashion than they're using us. They know that we have the liquidity and they'd rather look to us to develop the lots versus the other, let's call it local or regional developer. There has been times too, where maybe that developer gets into a capital constraint on the following phase. And so some builders will look to us to see if we can step in and purchase that additional phase to keep, prevent them from gapping on their home sales. Great. And then just separately, obviously, you know, you're not, you're not guiding to gross margins for the year, but I'm just wondering, you know, I think, you know, previously we talked about increased force source lots driving kind of a gross margin headwind. Are you sort of seeing that drive? Sorry, tailwind rather. Are you seeing that tailwind kind of materialize in 2024? Is that maybe more of a 2025 story? Well, we could see it in 24. Definitely. You know, we're the four-star source. Lots does give us, does give us more optionality, I guess, for the project. I don't know that. I don't know that we'll see. I mean, we have seen significant increases in development costs as well. So, you know, I don't know that we're going to continue to see increased margins as a result of that, because we're always trying to, trying to match price and pace or balance price and pace to improve our returns. So it's, it's really not just about, you know, the sales price or margin. It's really more about our returns. Great. That's helpful. I'll turn it over. Once again, if you have a question or a comment, please indicate so by pressing star one. The next question comes from Mike Rehat with JP Morgan, please proceed. Hi guys, Doug Wardlaw from Mike. I was wondering if you could kind of speak to any potential regional trends you've seen over the recent months, especially with the kind of rate volatility that we've experienced, if there's been any particular regions where you've seen strength or weakness. I know that we've seen a particular weakness, Texas and Florida remain strong for us. They've been a stronghold for a long time. Great. And then in terms of you guys touched on, you know, difficulty with municipalities and getting approval there. Is there any kind of vision moving forward when you see that easing up a tad, or is that something that you expect to be a problem for the business moving forward? I guess for the foreseeable future in 2024. That's a great question. Historically, it's always been a challenge. It's been delayed even further. I would tell you in the past 12 to 24 months, a lot of it's turnover within those departments themselves. You get some folks with less experience that are now in that role versus more folks with seasoned experience. It's a daily battle out in the field with our folks that like anyway, I'll refrain from saying that, but it's, I don't know that it's going to ease up anytime in the foreseeable future, but again, I think it's market to market in terms of where we're seeing those governmental delays. Some areas we see it, some we don't. So it really fluctuates across the United States. And we we've been accounting for those delays in our underwriting. So we've been looking at it, you know, extended timelines and the underwriting to make sure that we're still going to be able to achieve our returns. Got it. Thank you guys. We have reached the end of the question and answer session. I will now turn the call over to Andy Oxley for closing remarks. Thank you, John. And thank you to everyone on the four star team for your focus and hard work. We will stay disciplined and opportunistic as we continue to consolidate market share. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again in April to share our second quarter results. This concludes today's conference and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.""]"

After this call, we will post updated investor and supplementary data presentations to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News and Events for your reference.Now I will turn the call over to Paul Romanowski, our President and CEO."", 'Paul J. Romanowski', 'Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.For the first quarter, the D.R. Horton team delivered solid results highlighted by earnings of $2.82 per diluted share. Our consolidated pretax income was $1.2 billion on a 6% increase in revenues to $7.7 billion with a pretax profit margin of 16.1%. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended December 31 was 29%, and our return on equity for the same period was 21.8%.Although inflation and mortgage interest rates remain elevated, our net sales orders increased 35% from the prior year quarter, as the supply of both new and existing homes at affordable price points is still limited and demographic supporting housing demand remain favorable. Early signs for the spring selling season have been encouraging. We will continue to focus on consolidating market share and are well positioned for the spring with 42,600 homes in inventory and our average construction cycle times returning to more normal levels.We expect our housing inventory turns to improve in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 and our ongoing focus on capital efficiency to produce strong homebuilding operating cash flows and consistent returns. Mike?', 'Michael J. Murray', 'Earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 increased 2% to $2.82 per diluted share compared to $2.76 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter was $947 million on consolidated revenues of $7.7 billion. Our first quarter home sales revenues were $7.3 billion on 19,340 homes closed compared to $6.7 billion on 17,340 homes closed in the prior year.Our average closing price for the quarter was $376,200, down 2% sequentially and down 3% from the prior year quarter. Bill?', 'Bill W. Wheat', 'Our net sales orders in the first quarter increased 35% to 18,069 homes and order value increased 38% from the prior year to $6.8 billion. Our cancellation rate for the quarter was 19%, down from 21% sequentially and down from 27% in the prior year quarter. Our average number of active selling communities was up 2% sequentially and up 14% year-over-year.The average price of net sales orders in the first quarter was $375,800, down 2% sequentially and up 2% from the prior year quarter. To adjust to changing market conditions during fiscal 2023 and into fiscal 2024, we have increased our use of incentives and reduced home prices and sizes of our home offerings where necessary to provide better affordability to homebuyers. Based on current market conditions, mortgage rates and continued affordability challenges, we expect our incentive levels to remain elevated in the near term.Our sales volumes can be significantly affected by changes in mortgage rates and other economic factors. However, we will continue to start homes and maintain sufficient inventory to meet sales demand and aggregate market share. Jessica?', 'Jessica Hansen', 'Our gross profit margin on home sales revenues in the first quarter was 22.9%, down 220 basis points sequentially from the September quarter. 100 basis points of the sequential margin decline related to the decrease in the value of hedging instruments we use to offer below-market interest rate financing to our homebuyers, while the remainder was primarily due to an increase in incentive levels on homes closed during the quarter.On a per square foot basis, home sales revenues were down 1.5% in the quarter and lot costs increased to 1.5%, while stick and brick costs decreased 1%. As Bill mentioned, we expect our incentive levels to remain elevated in the near term, but with mortgage rates generally declining from the recent highs, we expect our home sales gross margin in the second quarter to be similar to the first quarter.Our home sales gross margin for the full year of fiscal 2024 will be dependent on the strength of demand and other market conditions during the spring in addition to changes in mortgage interest rates. Bill?', 'Bill W. Wheat', 'In the first quarter, our homebuilding SG&A expenses increased by 14% from last year, and homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 8.3%, up 50 basis points from the same quarter in the prior year due primarily to expansion of our operations to support future growth and an increase in equity and stock market-based compensation expense. We will continue to control our SG&A while ensuring that our platform adequately supports our business. Paul?', 'Paul J. Romanowski', 'We started 19,900 homes in the December quarter and ended the quarter with 42,600 homes in inventory, down 1% from a year ago and up 1% sequentially. 28,800 of our homes at December 31 were unsold. 9,000 of our total unsold homes were completed, of which 730 had been completed for greater than 6 months. Our current level of homes in inventory puts us in a strong position for the upcoming spring selling season.For homes we closed in the first quarter, our construction cycle times continued to improve, and we are essentially back to our historical average of roughly 4 months from start to complete. We will continue to adjust our homes and inventory and start pace based on market conditions and expect our housing inventory turns to improve in fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023. Mike?', 'Michael J. Murray', 'Our homebuilding lot position at December 31 consisted of approximately 607,000 lots, of which 24% were owned and 76% were controlled through purchase contracts. 39% of our total owned lots are finished and 52% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our capital efficient and flexible lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position.Our first quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land and development totaled $2.4 billion, up 3% sequentially. Our investments this quarter consisted of $1.4 billion for finished lots, $740 million for land development and $270 million for land acquisition. Paul?', 'Paul J. Romanowski', 'In the first quarter, our rental operations generated $31 million of pretax income on $195 million of revenues from the sale of 379 single-family rental homes and 300 multifamily rental units. Our rental property inventory at December 31 was $3 billion which consisted of $1.4 billion of single-family rental properties and $1.6 billion of multifamily rental properties.We are not providing separate guidance for our rental segment this year due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of closings caused by interest rate volatility and capital market fluctuations. Based on our current pipeline of projects, we expect our rental closings and revenues in the second quarter to exceed the first quarter. Jessica?', 'Jessica Hansen', ""Forestar, our majority-owned residential lot development company reported revenues of $306 million for the first quarter on 3,150 lots sold with pretax income of $51 million. Forestar's owned and controlled lot position at December 31 was 82,400 lots. 61% of Forestar's owned lots are under contract with are subject to a right of first offer to D.R. Horton.$270 million of our finished lots purchased in the first quarter were from Forestar. Forestar had more than $840 million of liquidity at quarter end with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 14.9%. Forestar remains uniquely positioned to capitalize on the shortage of finished lots for the homebuilding industry and to aggregate significant market share over the next few years with its strong balance sheet, lot supply and relationship with D.R. Horton. Mike?"", 'Michael J. Murray', ""Financial Services earned $66 million of pretax income in the first quarter on $193 million of revenues, resulting in a pretax profit margin of 34.3%. During the first quarter, essentially all of our mortgage company's loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations, and our mortgage company held the financing for 78% of our buyers.FHA and VA loans accounted for 57% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 724 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 88%. First-time homebuyers represented 56% of the closings handled by our mortgage company this quarter, Bill?"", 'Bill W. Wheat', ""Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic to support and to sustain an operating platform that produces consistent returns, growth and cash flow. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with low leverage and significant liquidity, which provides us with flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions.During the first 3 months of the year, our consolidated cash used in operations was $153 million. At December 31, we had $6.4 billion of consolidated liquidity, consisting of $3.3 billion of cash and $3.1 billion of available capacity on our credit facilities. Debt at the end of the quarter totaled $5.3 billion with no senior note maturities in fiscal 2024. Our consolidated leverage at December 31 was 18.6% and consolidated leverage net of cash was 7.8%.At December 31, our stockholders' equity was $23.2 billion, and book value per share was $69.70, up 19% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months into December, our return on equity was 21.8% and our consolidated return on assets was 14.8%. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of approximately $100 million, and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level to be paid in February. We repurchased 3.3 million shares of common stock for $398 million during the quarter. Jessica?"", 'Jessica Hansen', 'Although volatility in mortgage rates and changes in economic conditions could significantly impact our business, for the second quarter, we currently expect to generate consolidated revenues of $8.1 billion to $8.3 billion and homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in the range of 20,000 to 20,500 homes.We expect our home sales gross margin in the second quarter to be approximately 22.6% to 23.1% and homebuilding SG&A as a percentage of revenues to be in the range of 7.5% to 7.7%. We anticipate a financial services pretax profit margin of around 30% to 35% in the second quarter, and we expect our quarterly income tax rate to be approximately 23.5% to 24%. We are well positioned to continue consolidating market share in all of our operations.Our full year fiscal 2024 revenue, pricing and margins in our homebuilding, rental, financial services and Forestar businesses will be determined by market conditions and the strength of the spring selling season in addition to our efforts to meet demand by balancing pace and price to maximize returns.For the full year of fiscal 2024, we now expect to generate consolidated revenues of approximately $36 billion to $37.3 billion, and expect homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in the range of 87,000 to 90,000 homes. We expect to generate approximately $3 billion of cash flow from our homebuilding operations. We also plan to repurchase approximately $1.5 billion of our common stock to continue reducing our outstanding share count in addition to annual dividend payments of around $400 million.Finally, we now expect an income tax rate for fiscal 2024 of approximately 24%. We remain focused on balancing our cash flow utilization priorities to grow our operations pay an increased dividend and consistently repurchase shares while maintaining strong liquidity and conservative leverage. Paul?', 'Paul J. Romanowski', 'In closing, our results and position reflect our experienced teams, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings. All of these are key components of our operating platform that sustain our ability to produce consistent returns, growth and cash flow, while continuing to aggregate market share.We will maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton family of employees, land developers, trade partners, vendors and real estate agents for your continued focus and hard work. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions.', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Your first question for today is coming from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI.', 'Stephen Kim', 'Appreciate it, and thanks for all your commentary. I guess, just to start off with, could you clarify, I think you mentioned at the beginning of the call about 100 basis points of the gross margin was affected by hedging related to -- I think you said rate buydowns? And in your guide for 2Q, can you also just clarify like what -- I thought I heard you said 20,000 to 20,500 closings and $8.1 billion to $8.3 billion in consolidated revenue. I just want to make sure I heard those right.', 'Jessica Hansen', ""Yes, Steve, that's correct. For the second quarter, $8.1 billion to $8.3 billion of consolidated revenues and closing to 20,000 to 20,500 homes. And in terms of home sales gross margin, you're also correct that 100 basis points of the impact was due to the rate buydowns that we've been offering and adjustments we had to make to that position during the quarter on a sequential basis. But what we've guided to for Q2 versus Q1 is relatively flat in terms of a 22.6% to 23.1% gross margin in Q2 versus the 22.9% that we posted this quarter."", 'Stephen Kim', 'Got you. And that 100 basis points, is that something that you have done in the past? Is that a number that compares? I guess, can you give us some sense of what that number has been over the last couple of quarters?', 'Bill W. Wheat', ""Steve, this quarter is the first time that, that amount has been significant at all. It has essentially adjusting the valuation of our hedging positions that we have in place to offer our programmatic rate buydowns across the country. And it's typically a very small move either up or down. But this quarter, given the significant volatility in rates during the quarter, of course, mortgage rates moved up to 8% in November and then dropped sharply in December, those hedging positions had to be adjusted to reflect that. So it was an unusual situation this quarter. Generally, we don't plan for any significant move one way or the other."", 'Jessica Hansen', 'And if you were to exclude that charge, we would have landed in the gross margin that we had guided to for the quarter. That was really the reason that we came in below.', 'Stephen Kim', ""Got you. Okay. That's really helpful. I'm sure there's going to be more questions about the guide, but I wanted to talk about your capital allocation, and in particular, I guess, I know that the mantra for D.R. Horton over the last several years now has been about consistency and predictability and reliability and that sort of thing, and you've done a great job there.But as I think about your overall cash position. It looks like you have sufficient cash. Currently, you've got another $3 billion coming. I think maybe a little less than $2 billion has spoken for with buybacks and dividends. I was curious about that extra $1 million. And I'm curious how land investment factors into that and rental? So those are the 2 other big pieces it would seem. So I guess, when I look at your land, your land supply has been coming down for -- had been coming down for a number of years, but now for about 3 years, your land and year supply has been flat. I was wondering, do you think you can bring down that land investment down further? Or is this kind of the level that you think that we're going to be seeing in the future? And then in rental, can you give us a sense for what you think the growth in the rental inventory may be over the course of the next year?"", 'Michael J. Murray', ""Steve, when we look at our land position, we feel that the forward 1 year's roughly supply of land that we own is important to maintain the production velocity in our neighborhoods, bringing that down significantly is going to be incremental because it's going to be with more developers providing finished lots for us versus self-development.And I think we're back up to 76% controlled which is up from where it's been in the past few quarters. So we're going to continue to incrementally look to control more land and acquire lots that are being finished by others, but we will still need to maintain a supply of land on our balance sheet, lots primarily on our balance sheet to feed the production."", 'Stephen Kim', 'And the rental inventory?', 'Michael J. Murray', ""And the rental inventory, we'll probably be investing some during fiscal '24 to grow that platform. It's getting closer to a good sustainable volume that will produce consistent revenues and profits quarter-to-quarter, but it's still in the growth mode."", 'Jessica Hansen', ""And in terms of the overall capital allocation, as you already alluded to, we did guide to the $1.5 billion of common stock. We've got the annual dividend payments of $400 million. We also have a sizable debt maturity that's very early in fiscal '25 of $500 million in October.So too early to say what we're going to do with that, and we're very focused on maintaining conservative leverage and we'll see as we get closer, but that is something we're going to be prepared to potentially pay out of cash if we don't feel like the market is right to go refi that."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is coming from Carl Reichardt with BTIG.', 'Carl Edwin Reichardt', ""I want to talk about SG&A for a second. Bill, can you talk about the basis points associated with the incentive comp this quarter? And then you talked about it being also ahead of some growth you're planning. Can you talk a little bit about community count expansion and whether or not this also might be related to some of the new markets you've entered more recently?"", 'Bill W. Wheat', ""Sure. Yes. The first factor this quarter, we could point to our 14% increase in our average selling community. So that's obviously a significant increase, and our SG&A is up 14% this quarter year-over-year as well. So that's a bigger move than we have had in a while that's positioning us to be able to provide the increased guidance, and you have seen our market count increase over the last several years. Obviously, we expect in time to achieve some leverage on that. And as we grow our revenues, we would expect our SG&A to come back down to historic levels. But I think we've got a couple of quarters here where we're going to see our SG&A little bit higher as a percentage of revenues, primarily driven by that. This quarter, we have one additional factor and really, it's just a timing factor in terms of the impact of equity and stock-based comp.We typically have an amount that we incurred typically in our second quarter or third quarter, but the timing of some grants this year were a little bit earlier into our first quarter. And so there's an amount of roughly $13 million that it was incurred in Q1 this quarter that typically would be a Q2 or Q3 event."", 'Carl Edwin Reichardt', ""Okay. That's small. So it's different this year. Okay. And then I have a bigger picture question for Paul. So obviously, the biggest news that we've seen in the business for a while is a large acquisition by an offshore player of a domestic homebuilder. And historically, long ago, Horton was a fairly significant acquirer public companies and other private companies and still here and there. We've seen you look at some deals.Paul, can you talk a little bit about from your perspective, what do you think -- whether or not acquisitions are something that Horton would consider historically, I know you've done it more recently, you've talked about doing most of your growth greenfield. I'd just like to know, given current conditions where you sit on this sort of big picture."", 'Paul J. Romanowski', ""Yes, Carl. We still today, look at -- continually look at acquisitions. And for us, we're more interested in the smaller tuck-in builders that may add to our market share in an existing market or give us some entry, but we do always have that opportunity to greenfield those. I don't see on the horizon, a significant large acquisition.Certainly, the acquisition that you're referring to make some sense. We speak to scale a lot in market share, and that makes some sense to us. But today, we're going to continue to look at those as they come available, but no significant shift in what you've seen us do over the last couple of years."", 'Operator', 'Your next question for today is coming from John Lovallo with UBS.', 'John Lovallo', 'The first one here is it seems like the first quarter gross margin at least relative to your expectations was impacted by that 100 basis points of hedging that seemingly was not contemplated in the initial guide. So I guess the question is, why would the 2Q gross margin be flattish sequentially if that hit is not expected to repeat and rates have come in a bit?', 'Bill W. Wheat', ""Well, it starts with, we sold homes with an increased level of incentives while rates were higher during Q1, and some of those closed in December, but there are still a number of them that will be closing in Q2. And so far on a core basis, we still are entering the quarter a little bit lower margin than what the average presents.And so that's -- but obviously, rates have dropped, and so those incentive costs are a bit lower in the later sales. And so on balance, we expect we should be able to hold margins around the current levels, excluding the hedging going forward."", 'John Lovallo', ""Okay. Got it. And then I think last quarter, lot costs were up 10% or 11% year-over-year, but I think there's some geographic mix that was in there and maybe it normalized to up sort of mid-single digits if you kind of accounted for that mix. I mean, how did lot cost trend in the quarter? And how are you thinking about that in 2Q?"", 'Jessica Hansen', ""Well, it's pretty similar to what we said last quarter. That was a year-over-year comp. And so we still were up low double digits on a year-over-year basis, and it did continue to have a little bit of geographic mix. But I would say, stripping out geography, our lot cost on a year-over-year basis probably are up high single digit. And until we cycle an entire year, it probably stays that way, and then it would moderate in terms of year-over-year because it's certainly less than that on a sequential basis."", 'Bill W. Wheat', 'Yes. 1.5% on a sequential basis.', 'Operator', 'Your next question is coming from Joe Ahlersmeyer with Deutsche Bank.', 'Joseph David Ahlersmeyer', ""If you are to humor me for maybe a couple more on the gross margin. Could you just talk about the actual P&L impact of that charge, whether it was something that hit deductions from revenue or if it was just a hit to COGS. And then similarly, on the -- what you're expecting going forward, I guess it makes sense, you're not expecting it given rates has kind of stabilized but is there a way to think about the sensitivity based on what you've still got out there notionally, like if we had another 50 to 100 basis point drop, would you have another 100 basis point impact from here?"", 'Bill W. Wheat', ""Joe, the charge -- the amount of the charge was $65 million approximately, and that's basically what hit during the quarter in terms of our position, outstanding we believe that our position is -- reflects the current market and the valuation adjustment in the December quarter takes care of all of it. There's always some sensitivity. We always have some hedging position outstanding. And so anytime there is a significant sudden change in rates that can leave some exposure there. Obviously, the opposite side of that is the benefits to the business.When rates drop, obviously, that improves affordability and improves our ability to sell at a price point in the core business. And so what this hedging position allows us to do is offer below market rates on a consistent basis on a broad basis across our business. And like we said, we try to manage that as best as we can, but in a period of significant sudden volatility, there can be some exposure to the position."", 'Michael J. Murray', ""There were 2 very significant moves in interest rates in the quarter. They went up significantly in the middle of the quarter, and they came down significantly to the end of the quarter. Kind of a very unique dynamic that we have not experienced. That's what led to the mark-to-market adjustment being more severe than it's been in prior quarters."", 'Jessica Hansen', 'And that $65 million mark-to-market is in cost of goods sold, whereas the just standard routine interest rate offering does net against revenue and flows through our ASP. But the $65 million specifically is in cost of goods.', 'Joseph David Ahlersmeyer', ""That's all very helpful. As a follow-up, thinking about the outlook for materials either inflation or deflation. Can you just speak to what's in your 2Q guide? And then maybe just generally, if we're looking at starts rising and your volumes obviously growing, how should we think about the competition for materials perhaps driving inflation again in those?"", 'Paul J. Romanowski', ""Yes. We're seeing some relative flatness in our cost side of the business and would expect to see similar all things stay consistent through the next quarter. Certainly, with the encouraging signs early in to January, it's possible that we see some increase in starts from all of our peers. That could put pressure on labor and on materials, which could cause some headwinds or some increase in the cost side."", 'Operator', 'Your next question for today is coming from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.', 'Michael Jason Rehaut', ""I wanted just to circle back for a moment on SG&A. And I think, Bill, you talked about the main drivers of the higher or negative leverage, I guess, you could say, being community count and the stock comp. You're going to see a similar type of negative leverage impact on the second quarter.Would you expect that to kind of flatten out everything else equal seems to imply? You said that maybe in the first couple of quarters, you're going to see this impact and that should kind of run through by the time you get to the back half? Or is this more of a '25 event? And as part of this question, I'm also curious if higher sales incentives outside broker commissions, has impacted this at all? Or if you could remind us if that's the portion that's in the COGS?"", 'Bill W. Wheat', ""Yes. The last part first. Yes, our broker commissions are in our gross margins are in our cost of goods sold. So that's not part of the equation. And I think your general commentary there is fair. We only provide specific SG&A guidance one quarter out. But generally, our expectation over the longer term is that we would get back to a similar SG&A level as last year and beyond. So I think it is a phenomenon here for a couple of quarters where we're guiding a little bit higher than last year."", 'Michael J. Murray', 'Little headwind on the community count market growth, but a little tailwind in Q2 on the equity comp position recognizing that in Q1 versus Q2.', 'Bill W. Wheat', ""And we're also -- also ASP is down year-over-year. And so it's always a little bit more of a headwind on a percentage basis for SG&A when ASPs are down."", 'Michael Jason Rehaut', ""Right. No, that's fair. That makes sense as well. I appreciate that. Secondly, not to beat a dead horse, but I do -- you kind of made a comment on the gross margins, Bill, and I don't know if you misspoke or it would kind of make sense to us if indeed you did not misspeak. But I think you said at one point, we would expect gross margins to get back to the 1Q levels excluding the hedging impact, that would kind of make sense to us to the extent that in the last couple of months, rates have come down and your current orders would include less expensive rate buydowns than, let's say, a couple of months ago.And I think you were kind of saying 2Q is currently being impacted by some of the carryover from 1Q. I just wanted to make sure I heard that right or how to think about where gross margins are today on orders taken in mid-January, let's say, versus a couple of months ago?"", 'Bill W. Wheat', ""Yes. We provided guidance one quarter out. So we've guided to 22.6% to 23.1%. So essentially straddling the GAAP margin that we reported in Q1. Coming into Q2, the closings that we will have early in the quarter are at the -- probably the low end of that range, maybe even a little below that. But then later in the quarter, margins are improving because of the cost of buydowns after rates have dropped is lower.And so -- but on average, that's -- we believe that, that will balance out to a margin in the 22.6% to 23.1% range. What will occur after that? We can't really comment. It's really going to be a matter of what of the spring selling season, what does demand look like through the spring and what happens with mortgage rates. And so -- but on average, that's where we believe things will fall for margins in Q2."", 'Michael Jason Rehaut', ""Right. So basically, what you're saying is beginning of the quarter at the low end, perhaps a little bit below the low end of that range, that would imply towards the end of the quarter at the higher end or perhaps a little bit above the high end of that range. Is that fair?"", 'Bill W. Wheat', ""I think on balance, it's going to balance out to 22.6% to 23.1%."", 'Paul J. Romanowski', ""And we still sell a large portion of our homes inter-quarter. So 35% to 40% is our kind of historical average. And so those are being sold now. And as we look through the quarter and into the spring selling season. So certainly, as the spring selling season emerges and continues, it's going to give us better visibility as we look towards the end of this quarter in to 3Q."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is coming from Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research.', 'Truman Andrew Patterson', ""Not to beat a dead horse here, but I just want to understand kind of your old philosophy and some near-term dynamics with rates coming below, a little bit below 7%. I realize there's this hedging noise, but have you all been able to kind of pull back on core incentives, if you will, the past several weeks? Or is this much more taking kind of a bit of a wait-and-see approach?I think you mentioned a good rebound early in the year. Are you taking a wait-and-see approach, so you're not disrupting kind of demand or the momentum ahead of the spring selling season?"", 'Paul J. Romanowski', ""Truman. I think that as we look at this today, it's still very early. And for us, consistency of activity has been important. So we haven't made any significant changes in our incentives if the market gives us to us, and we continue to see the early encouragement that we are, then we'll respond to the market in kind.If rates continue to stay up, then we'll need to lift our rate offerings like we've done in the past and will fluctuate as those rates move still has been our best incentive is the rate buydown and consistency of rate consistency of payment to our buyers as they shop in market."", 'Jessica Hansen', ""And all of that continues to be managed market by market, community by community based on what our local operators are seeing and believe it's the best to drive the strongest returns. I mean, even with a little bit of giveback in our gross margin, our improved cycle times and what we're going to turn this year in terms of inventory is way more important to our bottom line and the returns we're going to generate than giving up a little bit of gross margin and still being at roughly 23%."", 'Truman Andrew Patterson', ""Makes total sense. And with that, you all bumped your closings guidance a little bit to about 89,000 around there. That's well above the prior peak of, we'll call it, 83,000 back in 2022 when there were all of these supply chain issues and constraints. Could you just help us get a little more comfortable with that level of growth kind of based on today's labor pool, a lot availability. I'm really trying to understand constraints today and maybe what level of closings would really create bottlenecks in the construction process, not asking about demand or anything along those lines?"", 'Michael J. Murray', ""We've been very focused on creating a quarter-to-quarter consistent starts plan where we're feeding our neighborhoods with lots that are available in front of us and making sure we have those lots supplied and secured to us. At the same time, we've made a tremendous amount of progress reducing our cycle times and coming back to sort of our historical norms of around 4 months from starting a home to completion.And so that's giving us much greater flexibility going into this year. With the strong finished lot position we currently have, combined with the reduced cycle times, we're able to reduce our homes in inventory and still deliver a closing target that's going to be at or in excess of our 2x beginning of the year housing terms. So we really feel good about what's happened there. As to what the upside top side is where the bottlenecks would come in, hard to speculate on where that would be.We feel really good about our lot position, neighborhood by neighborhood and the trade partnerships that we have and the supplier relationships that we have, they've been very supportive of us."", 'Jessica Hansen', ""But great point, Truman, and that when we think about overall industry constraints, finished lots are going to continue to be an issue in terms of builders being able to put more houses on the ground today. It's not getting any easier to put a finish lot on the ground. And so we continue to have a focus on building out our lot position and our relationships with third-party developers to make sure we're positioned for growth. But when we think about the biggest constraints to the industry overall, it definitely starts with finished lots."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is coming from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.', 'Eric Bosshard', ""Curious if you can provide a little bit of perspective. You talked about favorable trends into the spring and 56% first time. Just as you look across the business, in terms of where you're seeing relative strength in regards to price points and product where things are above average and where things are below average?"", 'Michael J. Murray', ""I think it's pretty consistent across the board. We're feeling really good across all of our offerings. I mean as 55% to 56% of our deliveries have been to first-time homebuyers. That's generally where we've kind of geared our neighborhoods that we're positioning and the product that we're positioning with that. I think 70% of our deliveries were at $400,000 or less, which for us is maintaining a focus on affordability and a payment that works for people in their monthly budget.Hence, we've used the interest rate buydowns quite a bit. But feel really good. Coming out in January does not make a quarter or a spring selling season, but we're very encouraged by the early trends in January and are excited for what the spring is going to hold."", 'Eric Bosshard', ""From a product perspective or price point perspective with lower rates, do you think differently than you did 90 days ago in terms of focus on affordability? Or do you think about expanding a bit more what you're doing?"", 'Paul J. Romanowski', ""I think we have made adjustments as the market has shifted over the last 12 to 18 months and feel comfortable with our trajectory and the product offering that we have. Certainly, as you look across our communities, they're going to trend inside of the product offering that we have based on rate and monthly payment environment, whether that means that they're buying up in size or down in size.But we feel like we have a good offering across our markets, and we'll continue to stay as we need to respond to a monthly payment and interest rates and provide affordable opportunities across all of our platforms."", 'Operator', 'Your next question for today is coming from Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates.', 'Alan S. Ratner', ""I got some questions on kind of the spec versus build to order dynamic in the industry right now. You guys being a spec builder, I think, had a pretty strong advantage during the pandemic. Obviously, resale inventory was incredibly tight. The extended cycle time as well, I'm sure it was hard to manage from your side. Kind of gave you an advantage versus the BTO-guys in terms of the consumer experience. So I guess my question is now that cycle times seem to be improving across the industry, resale inventory is ticking a little bit higher. Are you thinking about that dynamic any differently? Are you maybe contemplating selling earlier in the construction process, again, whereas before you were maybe waiting for homes to get closer to completion? Are you seeing more competition from build-to-order builders that have kind of shrunk in their construction cycle times? Any commentary on that would be great."", 'Paul J. Romanowski', ""I think today, we are still seeing people looking for closing with certainty of close date and in that 30- to 60-day time frame based on their ability to lock in interest rate. And so I don't know that we've seen much significant shift from the build-to-order builders being able to deliver a presale into those time frames. We are very comfortable with our inventory position, both in the total homes and in a completed home scenario. It's continued to play into the shortness of resale inventory across our markets and I don't expect a significant change for us. We're going to continue to stay focused on inventory sales and consistent production community to community."", 'Michael J. Murray', ""Even with the decline in existing home sales, they're still 3x to 4x larger of a market transaction volume than new home sales. So we've always tried to position ourselves to compete against those homes rather than just other new home providers."", 'Paul J. Romanowski', 'The timing of that sale has been able to move up earlier in our stage of construction just because we have gotten back to our historical norms of months of delivery of (inaudible).', 'Alan S. Ratner', ""Got it. But in terms of your sales strategy, I mean, I look at your completed spec count, it's been ticking a little bit higher here more recently. Is that still kind of the strategy to hold these homes off until you're maybe a month or 2 from completion to allow the buyer to lock in that rate? Or are you maybe thinking about kind of pulling that forward a little bit?"", 'Michael J. Murray', ""We're allowing -- we're not restricting the sale of homes. Seasonally, you'll see the completed spec inventory, the completed home inventory tick up through the fall and be positioned that we have houses available for quick deliveries beginning in January for the spring selling season. So we're able to deliver the homes that people are coming in and needing in 30 or 60 days.At the same time, with the compressed cycle times, as Paul mentioned, we are very comfortable selling and locking a rate in for a buyer earlier in the production process than we were a year ago for sure."", 'Alan S. Ratner', ""Okay. Got you. One last quick one, if I could. Just going back to the charge on the hedge. I just want to better understand this. Like we have heard from other builders in the past situations where they would buy kind of forward commitment pools and when rates pull back sharply in a short period of time, those pools would kind of go unused because the market kind of fell below wherever that pool was. Is that kind of what's going on with you guys? Or are the mechanics of this much different? I'm just trying to wrap my arms around that better."", 'Bill W. Wheat', ""No, you've described it exactly. We typically will buy those forward commitment pools really for the next few weeks of deliveries essentially as plan. We're not going out very far, but it is a few weeks. And so that's when we say a very sudden sharp change in rates, that can present some exposure there, but it has not occurred in the past, but the circumstances this quarter were pretty unusual in terms of the significance and the suddenness of the rate moves."", 'Jessica Hansen', ""And it was really restructuring so it could be used, not that we weren't going to fulfill the pool. We just had to restructure it so it was usable."", 'Bill W. Wheat', ""And then at the end of the quarter, we always have to mark-to-market the value at the end of the quarter. So that's always a factor there as well."", 'Alan S. Ratner', ""So it sounds like this is an industry phenomenon, not necessarily an important phenomena, but obviously, we'll learn more about that in the next few weeks. But I appreciate that. Thank you."", 'Operator', 'Your next question for today is coming from Anthony Pettinari with Citi.', 'Anthony James Pettinari', ""There was an earlier question on the large builder acquisition we saw last week. I guess we also saw a large acquisition in SFR. And I'm just wondering if you could talk about how institutional demand for build-to-rent homes has been trending, maybe relative to earlier expectations. Do you expect that to grow as a portion of your homebuilding operations and just maybe the impact of that business in this kind of rate environment?"", 'Michael J. Murray', ""Certainly have seen that with the change in the capital markets, that demand environment became much choppier last year. But we still had institutional buyers that were anxious to get the product we were delivering to the market, and they continue to be so. We delivered projects in the first quarter. We expect to deliver more in the second quarter and then throughout the year with the pipeline that's there.I mean, for us, it's a strategy to help us derisk land positions and more rapidly monetize our land portfolio. And so we've still seen good demand for the product, good demand on the rentals and the lease-ups when we're taking the stabilization process on and continue to expect that to become a growing part of our business."", 'Anthony James Pettinari', ""Okay. That's helpful. And then just last quarter, I think 60% of your buyers took some form of a buydown and you were offering 6.25 on a conventional loan. Just wondering if you can update where that stands coming out of fiscal 1Q. And I guess you talked about this earlier a bit. But do you think about kind of a rate level where buydowns maybe stop becoming kind of the chief incentive mechanism or where incentives start to shift back to more kind of traditional ones?"", 'Jessica Hansen', ""We're probably up, call it, roughly 10% sequentially in terms of the take rate on that buydowns. So we were in the 70% and now we'd be in the 80% range of the buyers that utilize our mortgage company. So the 60% you said was on our overall business, so say 60% to roughly 70% of buyers took that this quarter."", 'Paul J. Romanowski', ""And the use of those rate buydowns is not just new to us over the last 12 months. We've been 24-plus months utilizing that incentive. So I believe on a go-forward basis, staying competitive to not only the new home market, but especially to the resale market for us, and the ability to have a lower monthly payment for same cost of home is advantageous. So we have no plan in the near term to stop utilizing it even if we see rates shift down."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is coming from Ken Zener with Seaport Research Partners.', 'Kenneth Robinson Zener', ""I wonder, with the industry, everybody likes to focus on the income statement, right? So the gross margins obviously been a focus today. However, your initial comments were about inventory turns, which together gets you returns on inventory. So because you took up volume for the year modestly and all we see is one quarter forward guidance. Is it fair to say that your guys' internal metrics are generating the same or higher ROI than you had started the year at? I know you kept the $3 billion cash flow the same. But I'm just trying to understand we see one part of the business, but not necessarily the output of the other."", 'Bill W. Wheat', ""Sure. Yes. I mean our returns are in line with our plans, and our divisions are out there executing on their plans, their start plans week-to-week, month-to-month and deliver the homes that we expected to this quarter, plus a few hundred more. And so as we enter the spring, we're continuing with that and very consistent with our expectations from an inventory turn standpoint and a return on our assets, our investments in inventory."", 'Kenneth Robinson Zener', ""Right. So you talked about improving cycle times, obviously, part of that stuff. Do you see -- when you started 20,000, the last 3 years starts to have been 14,000, 25,000 all over the place. Can you talk to that level? I mean, do you see some degree of maybe use the word seasonality or what's kind of affecting that? Is it orders? Or is it just a plan that you have to reach your closings, A? And then B, what do you expect your inventory units to be at the end of the year given your underlying assumptions right now?"", 'Paul J. Romanowski', 'Yes, Ken, as you look at our past year plus starts space, it has been inconsistent and a lot of that has been in response to the market in response to the elongation of cycle times and then further reduction of cycle times. As you look at our inventory today and our guide to basically turn a little more than 2x that inventory, we can expect to see consistent and sustainable starts expansion over the next few quarters.We want to maintain the level of inventory that we have and be in a position as we respond to the spring selling season to stay consistent with our starts, but we do need to grow our starts consistently quarter-to-quarter over the remainder of the year.', 'Bill W. Wheat', ""And as we consistently look to position ourselves to grow, we would certainly love one position ourselves to grow in fiscal '25 over fiscal '24. So we would expect our inventory at the end of the year to be a little higher than it was at the start of the year with the expectation of turning it a little more than 2x in fiscal '25."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is coming from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs.', 'Susan Marie Maklari', ""I wanted to talk a bit more about thinking of the competitive dynamics on the ground. As you think about some of the smaller new home markets that you have recently entered and the potential for more existing home turnover to perhaps come through as we move through the year. Any thoughts on what those competitive dynamics could mean for you in various markets and perhaps how you're positioned relative to that?"", 'Michael J. Murray', ""I think, Susan, that we're continually looking to provide affordable homes that hit a payment that's going to work in the monthly budget for our buyers. And that is what's oftentimes overlooked, especially by in the smaller markets, a lot of the builders that are currently existing have capital constraints on what they're able to build and start.And so they're looking generally to maximize revenue per lot or margin per lot and go with the lower volume. And so they're leaving that first-time homebuyer that family that needs a more affordable home, kind of not really their target. So that's the target customer we seek out and we see good results when we go into a new market, greenfield a new market and focus on the affordable price points."", 'Susan Marie Maklari', ""Okay. That's helpful. And then thinking about the cash generation and the balance sheet, what -- as things have normalized, what level of cash, I guess you're comfortable holding on the balance sheet today? And how do you think about the potential for perhaps increasing the buybacks? Or allocating capital as some of the other growth initiatives that you have out there as you continue to bolster the balance sheet?"", 'Bill W. Wheat', ""Susan, from the size and scale of our business today and the volume that we have in terms of just our constant production of inventory, the cash balance we have on the balance sheet today is in the range of where we'd like to be. So cash across our business segments and then availability under our credit facilities.We would like to maintain the current level. And as we scale up over time, we'd incrementally increase that level over time. With our plans this year and our guidance on share repurchase in fiscal '24, we are increasing our share repurchase by 25% this year from $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion, and that's just part of our plan to be consistent with distributions to shareholders as well, increased our dividend this year as well, expect spend $400 million on dividends this year.And so that is an increase over last year. And our plan would be to -- as we continue to scale the business, continue to be able to increase incrementally those repurchases and dividend levels."", 'Operator', 'Your next question for today is coming from Rafe Jadrosich at Bank of America.', 'Rafe Jason Jadrosich', ""It's Rafe. Just on the outlook that for an improvement in build cycles in 2024, can you talk about where your build cycles are now where they were last quarter? How much do you think that can improve? And then like what gets you there from a supply chain perspective?"", 'Jessica Hansen', ""We were just over 4 months this quarter, Rafe. And when we think about our historical norm, it really is right at that 4 months in terms of start to complete, and then there's an additional time from complete to close. That's down from 7 months a year ago. So a very substantial improvement in terms of year-over-year basis. Sequentially, it improved by about 10 days. So when we think about further improvements from here, they're not large moved, they're just continued improvements on average. So where hopefully, we can get below 4 months. But that's not something that we expect to drive from 4 to 2."", 'Rafe Jason Jadrosich', ""Got it. That's helpful. And then I just wanted to follow up on the comment that you're seeing encouraging signs as we head into the spring season. Can you just give a little bit more color on what you're seeing? Is that better home buyer traffic or conversion? And do you think that's just driven by sort of the headline rate number that's coming down? Just want to understand what you're seeing that's encouraging in the market."", 'Michael J. Murray', ""I think there's lots of reasons people are out looking for houses, but ultimately, they need a house, and we're seeing both good traffic and good convergence early in the spring.

How are you thinking about land development costs and lot costs moving higher and kind of offsetting that?', 'Paul J. Romanowski', ""For us, we are set in terms of our consistent delivery of loss into our starts plan. And so that plan is in place for us as we look 12 months out, we have not seen much reduction in development costs and wouldn't expect with the shortness of lots across the industry that we're going to see, and we're not anticipating much reduction in either the labor side or the supply side, product side of the components that go into developing lots. But we have a plan that we have stuck to and are consistent with. We feel good about our lot position in the near term and as we look next year or 2 out."", 'Unidentified Analyst', 'Okay. And then just kind of switching over to affordability.

So explain this situation to me, these buydowns that they're doing."", ""DANI ROMERO: Yeah, DR Horton, really the weaker results really does highlight the big divide among homebuilders right now, on whether or not to keep incentives where they're at, keep going with them, or pull back as mortgage rates are moving down lower. DR Horton made it very clear that they are sticking to their plan, and they are not pulling back on incentives, even if mortgage rates do come down."", ""And we have seen that mortgage rates have come down from their highs last year. They're no longer hovering around that 8% or even 7%. They're now hanging around the 6% range, which brings up the big Wall Street debate. If mortgage rates do come down, what does that mean for homebuilder incentives? Incentives have been such a big game changer for these homebuilders as the resale market has slumped last year."", ""And if they do pull back, what does that mean for demand, foot traffic, all those different things? Obviously, it would be a positive to their gross margins because that's been a bit of a squeeze, these quarters. But by contrast to one homebuilder, did come up front. KB Home, that homebuilder said that they are going to pull back on incentives this year. Will they actually execute it? We'll have to wait and see."", 'But the big bottom line-- the bottom line is that investors are not as optimistic that the Fed will cut interest rates in March.

I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our executive vice president and chief operating officer; and Bill Wheat, our executive vice president and chief financial officer. For the first quarter, the D.R. Horton team delivered solid results, highlighted by earnings of $2.82 per diluted share.', 'Our consolidated pre-tax income was $1.2 billion on a 6% increase in revenues to $7.7 billion, with a pre-tax profit margin of 16.1%. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended December 31st was 29%, and our return on equity for the same period was 21.8%. Although inflation and mortgage interest rates remained elevated, our net sales orders increased 35% from the prior-year quarter as the supply of both new and existing homes at affordable price points is still limited and demographics supporting housing demand remained favorable. Early signs for the spring selling season have been encouraging.', 'We will continue to focus on consolidating market share and are well-positioned for the spring with 42,600 homes in inventory and our average construction cycle times returning to more normal levels. We expect our housing inventory turns to improve in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 and our ongoing focus on capital efficiency to produce strong homebuilding operating cash flows and consistent returns. Mike.', 'Mike Murray -- Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer', 'Earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 increased 2% to $2.82 per diluted share, compared to $2.76 per share in the prior-year quarter. Net income for the quarter was $947 million on consolidated revenues of $7.7 billion. Our first quarter home sales revenues were $7.3 billion on 19,340 homes closed, compared to $6.7 billion on 17,340 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $376,200, down 2% sequentially and down 3% from the prior-year quarter.', 'Bill.', 'Bill Wheat -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Our net sales orders in the first quarter increased 35% to 18,069 homes, and order value increased 38% from the prior year to $6.8 billion. Our cancellation rate for the quarter was 19%, down from 21% sequentially and down from 27% in the prior-year quarter. Our average number of active selling communities was up 2% sequentially and up 14% year over year. The average price of net sales orders in the first quarter was $375,800, down 2% sequentially and up 2% from the prior-year quarter.', 'To adjust to changing market conditions during fiscal 2023 and into fiscal 2024, we have increased our use of incentives and reduced home prices and sizes of our home offerings, where necessary, to provide better affordability to homebuyers. Based on current market conditions, mortgage rates, and continued affordability challenges, we expect our incentive levels to remain elevated in the near term. Our sales volumes can be significantly affected by changes in mortgage rates and other economic factors. However, we will continue to start homes and maintain sufficient inventory to meet sales demand and aggregate market share.', 'Jessica.', 'Jessica Hansen -- Vice President, Investor Relations', 'Our gross profit margin on home sales revenues in the first quarter was 22.9%, down 220 basis points sequentially from the September quarter. One hundred basis points of the sequential margin decline related to the decrease in the value of hedging instruments we used to offer below-market interest rate financing to our homebuyers, while the remainder was primarily due to an increase in incentive levels on homes closed during the quarter. On a per-square-foot basis, home sales revenues were down 1.5% in the quarter and lot costs increased 1.5%, while stick-and-brick costs decreased 1%. As Bill mentioned, we expect our incentive levels to remain elevated in the near term, but with mortgage rates generally declining from their recent highs, we expect our home sales gross margin in the second quarter to be similar to the first quarter.', 'Our home sales gross margin for the full year of fiscal 2024 will be dependent on the strength of demand and other market conditions during the spring, in addition to changes in mortgage interest rates. Bill.', 'Bill Wheat -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'In the first quarter, our homebuilding SG&A expenses increased by 14% from last year and homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 8.3%, up 50 basis points from the same quarter in the prior year, due primarily to expansion of our operations to support future growth and an increase in equity and stock market-based compensation expense. We will continue to control our SG&A while ensuring that our platform adequately supports our business. Paul.', 'Paul Romanowski -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'We started 19,900 homes in the December quarter and ended the quarter with 42,600 homes in inventory, down 1% from a year ago and up 1% sequentially. Twenty-eight thousand eight hundred of our homes at December 31st were unsold. Nine thousand of our total unsold homes were completed, of which 730 had been completed for greater than six months. Our current level of homes in inventory puts us in a strong position for the upcoming spring selling season.', 'For homes we closed in the first quarter, our construction cycle times continued to improve, and we are essentially back to our historical average of roughly four months from start to complete. We will continue to adjust our homes and inventory and starts pace based on market conditions and expect our housing inventory turns to improve in fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023. Mike.', 'Mike Murray -- Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer', 'Our homebuilding lot position at December 31st consisted of approximately 607,000 lots, of which, 24% were owned and 76% were controlled through purchase contracts. Thirty-nine percent of our total owned lots are finished, and 52% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our capital-efficient and flexible lot portfolio is the key to our strong competitive position. Our first quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land, and development totaled $2.4 billion, up 3% sequentially.', 'Our investments this quarter consisted of $1.4 billion for finished lots, $740 million for land development, and $270 million for land acquisition. Paul.', 'Paul Romanowski -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'In the first quarter, our rental operations generated $31 million of pre-tax income on $195 million of revenues from the sale of 379 single-family rental homes and 300 multifamily rental units. Our rental property inventory at December 31st was $3 billion, which consisted of $1.4 billion of single-family rental properties and $1.6 billion of multifamily rental properties. We are not providing separate guidance for our rental segment this year due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of closings caused by interest rate volatility and capital market fluctuations. Based on our current pipeline of projects, we expect our rental closings and revenues in the second quarter to exceed the first quarter.', 'Jessica.', 'Jessica Hansen -- Vice President, Investor Relations', ""Forestar, our majority-owned residential lot development company, reported revenues of $306 million for the first quarter on 3,150 lots sold, with pre-tax income of $51 million. Forestar's owned and controlled lot position at December 31st was 82,400 lots. Sixty-one percent of Forestar's owned lots are under contract with or subject to a right of first offer to D.R. Horton."", 'Two hundred and seventy million dollars of our finished lots purchased in the first quarter were from Forestar. Forestar had more than $840 million of liquidity at quarter-end with a net debt to capital ratio of 14.9%. Forestar remains uniquely positioned to capitalize on the shortage of finished lots for the homebuilding industry and to aggregate significant market share over the next few years with its strong balance sheet, lot supply, and relationship with D.R. Horton.', 'Mike.', 'Mike Murray -- Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer', ""Financial services earned $66 million of pre-tax income in the first quarter on $193 million of revenues, resulting in a pre-tax profit margin of 34.3%. During the first quarter, essentially all of our mortgage company's loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations and our mortgage company handled the financing for 78% of our buyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 57% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 724 and an average loan to value ratio of 88%."", 'First-time homebuyers represented 56% of the closings handled by our mortgage company this quarter. Bill.', 'Bill Wheat -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible, and opportunistic to support and to sustain an operating platform that produces consistent returns, growth, and cash flow. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with low leverage and significant liquidity, which provides us with flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions. During the first three months of the year, our consolidated cash used in operations was $153 million. At December 31st, we had $6.4 billion of consolidated liquidity, consisting of $3.3 billion of cash and $3.1 billion of available capacity on our credit facilities.', 'Debt at the end of the quarter totaled $5.3 billion, with no senior note maturities in fiscal 2024. Our consolidated leverage at December 31st was 18.6%, and consolidated leverage net of cash was 7.8%. At December 31st, our stockholders equity was $23.2 billion and book value per share was $69.70, up 19% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months ended December, our return on equity was 21.8% and our consolidated return on assets was 14.8%.', 'During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of approximately $100 million and our board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level to be paid in February. We repurchased 3.3 million shares of common stock for $398 million during the quarter. Jessica.', 'Jessica Hansen -- Vice President, Investor Relations', 'Although volatility in mortgage rates and changes in economic conditions could significantly impact our business, for the second quarter, we currently expect to generate consolidated revenues of $8.1 billion to $8.3 billion and homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in the range of 20,000 to 20,500 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the second quarter to be approximately 22.6% to 23.1% and homebuilding SG&A as a percentage of revenues to be in the range of 7.5% to 7.7%. We anticipate a financial services pre-tax profit margin of around 30% to 35% in the second quarter, and we expect our quarterly income tax rate to be approximately 23.5% to 24%. We are well-positioned to continue consolidating market share in all of our operations.', 'Our full year fiscal 2024 revenue, pricing, and margins in our homebuilding, rental, financial services, and Forestar businesses will be determined by market conditions and the strength of the spring selling season, in addition to our efforts to meet demand by balancing pace and price to maximize returns. For the full year of fiscal 2024, we now expect to generate consolidated revenues of approximately $36 billion to $37.3 billion and expect homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in the range of 87,000 to 90,000 homes. We expect to generate approximately $3 billion of cash flow from our homebuilding operations. We also plan to repurchase approximately $1.5 billion of our common stock to continue reducing our outstanding share count, in addition to annual dividend payments of around $400 million.', 'Finally, we now expect an income tax rate for fiscal 2024 of approximately 24%. We remain focused on balancing our cash flow utilization priorities to grow our operations, pay an increased dividend, and consistently repurchase shares while maintaining strong liquidity and conservative leverage. Paul.', 'Paul Romanowski -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""In closing, our results and position reflect our experienced team's industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint, and diverse product offerings. All of these are key components of our operating platform that sustain our ability to produce consistent returns, growth, and cash flow while continuing to aggregate market share. We will maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Thank you to the entire D.R."", 'Horton family of employees, land developers, trade partners, vendors, and real estate agents for your continued focus and hard work. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions.', '', 'Operator', 'Certainly. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Your first question for today is coming from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI.', 'Stephen Kim -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', 'Yeah. Thanks very much, guys. Appreciate it and thanks for all your commentary. I guess just to start off with, could you clarify, I think you mentioned at the beginning of the call about 100 basis points of the gross margin was affected by hedging related to I think you said rate buydowns? And in your guide for 2Q, can you also just clarify like what -- I thought I heard you said 20,000 to 20,500 closings and 8.1 billion to 8.3 billion in consolidated revenues.', 'I just want to make sure I heard those right.', 'Jessica Hansen -- Vice President, Investor Relations', ""Yes, Steve. That's correct. For the second quarter, $8.1 billion to $8.3 billion of consolidated revenues and closings of 20,000 to 20,500 homes. And in terms of home sales gross margin, you're also correct that 100 basis points of the impact was due to the rate buydowns that we've been offering and adjustments we had to make to that position during the quarter on a sequential basis, but what we've guided to for Q2 versus Q1 is relatively flat in terms of a 22.6% to 23.1% gross margin in Q2, versus the 22.9% that we posted this quarter."", 'Stephen Kim -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', 'Gotcha. And that 100 basis points, is that something that, you know, you have done in the past? Is that a number that, you know, compares? I guess, can you give us some sense of what that number has been over the last couple of quarters?', 'Paul Romanowski -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Steve, this quarter is the first time that that amount has been significant at all. It has -- it's essentially adjusting the valuation of our hedging positions that we have in place to offer our programmatic rate buydowns, you know, across the country. And it's typically a very small move, either up or down. But this quarter, given the significant volatility in rates during the quarter, of course, mortgage rates moved up to 8% in November and then dropped sharply in December, those hedging positions had to be adjusted to reflect that."", ""So, it was an unusual situation this quarter. Generally, we don't plan for any significant move one way or the other."", 'Jessica Hansen -- Vice President, Investor Relations', 'And if you were to exclude that charge, we would have landed in the gross margin that we had guided to for the quarter. That was really the reason that we came in below.', 'Stephen Kim -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', ""Gotcha. OK. That's really helpful. I'm sure there's going to be more questions about the guide, but I wanted to talk about your capital allocation, and in particular, I guess, you know, I know that, you know, the mantra for D.R."", ""Horton over the last several years now has been about consistency and predictability and reliability and that sort of thing. And you've done a great job there. But as I think about your overall, you know, cash position, it looks like you have sufficient cash. Currently, you've got another 3 billion coming."", ""I think maybe, you know, a little less than 2 billion is spoken for with buybacks and dividends. I was curious about that extra million, and I'm curious how land investment factors into that and rental. So, those are the two other big pieces that would seem. So, I guess, when I look at your land, your land supply has been coming down from -- had been coming down for a number of years."", ""But now, for about three years, your land in year supply has been flat. I was wondering, do you think you can bring down that land investment down further, or is this kind of the level that you think that we're going to be, you know, seeing on -- in the future? And then in rental, can you give us a sense for what you think the growth in the rental inventory may be over the course of the next year?"", 'Mike Murray -- Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer', ""Steve, when we look at our land position, we feel that, you know, the forward one year is roughly supply of land that we own is important to maintain the production velocity in our neighborhoods. Bringing that down significantly is going to be incremental because it's going to be with more developers providing finished lots for us versus self-development. And I think we're back up to 76% controlled, which is up from where it's been the past few quarters. So, we're going to continue to incrementally look to control more land and acquire lots that are being finished by others, but we will still need to maintain a supply of land on our balance sheet lots, primarily on our balance sheet to feed the production."", 'Stephen Kim -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', 'And the rental inventory?', 'Mike Murray -- Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer', ""And the rental inventory, you know, we'll probably invest in some during fiscal '24 to grow that platform. It's getting closer to a good sustainable volume that'll produce a consistent revenues and profits quarter to quarter, but it's still in the growth mode."", 'Jessica Hansen -- Vice President, Investor Relations', ""And in terms of just overall capital allocation is, as you already alluded to, we did guide to the $1.5 billion of common stock. We've got the annual dividend payments of 400 million. We also have a sizable debt maturity that's very early in fiscal '25 of $500 million in October. So, you know, too early to say what we're going to do with that."", ""And we're very focused on maintaining conservative leverage, and we'll see as we get closer. But that is something we're going to be prepared to potentially pay out of cash if we don't feel like the market's right to go refi that."", 'Stephen Kim -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', 'Great. Thanks very much, guys.', 'Operator', 'Your next question is coming from Carl Reichardt with BTIG.', 'Carl Reichardt -- BTIG -- Analyst', ""Hey. Good morning, everybody. I want to talk about SG&A for a second. Bill, can you talk about the basis points associated with the incentive comp this quarter? And then you talked about it being also ahead of some growth you're planning."", ""Can you talk a little bit about community count expansion and whether or not this also might be related to some of the new markets you've entered more recently? Thanks."", 'Bill Wheat -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Sure. Yeah. The first factor this quarter, we could point to our 14% increase in our average selling community. So, that's -- it's obviously a significant increase."", ""Our -- and our SG&A is up 14% this quarter year over year as well. So, that's a bigger move than we have had in a while that's positioning us to be able to provide the increased guidance. And you have seen our market count increase over the last several years. Obviously, we expect in time to achieve some leverage on that."", ""And as we grow our revenues, we would expect our SG&A to come back down to historic levels. But I think we've got a couple of quarters here where we're going to see our SG&A a little bit higher as a percentage of revenues, primarily driven by that. This quarter, we have one additional factor. And really, it's just a timing factor in terms of the impact of equity and stock-based comp."", ""We typically have an amount that we incurred typically in our second quarter or third quarter, but the timing of some grants this year were a little bit earlier into our first quarter. And so, there's an amount of roughly $13 million that -- it was incurred in Q1 this quarter that typically would be a Q2 or Q3 event."", 'Carl Reichardt -- BTIG -- Analyst', ""OK. That's small. So, it's different this year. OK."", ""Thank you for that. And then I have a bigger-picture question for Paul. So, obviously, the biggest news that we've seen in the business for a while is this large acquisition by an offshore player of a domestic homebuilder. And historically, long ago, Horton was a fairly significant acquirer of public companies and other private companies, and still here and there."", ""I've -- we've seen you look at some deals. Paul, can you talk a little bit about your -- from your perspective what you think -- whether or not acquisitions are something that Horton would consider? Historically, I know you've done them. More recently, you've talked about doing most of your growth greenfield. I'd just like to know given current conditions where you sit on this sort of big picture."", 'Thanks so much.', 'Paul Romanowski -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes, Carl. You know, we still today look at -- continually look at acquisitions. And for us, you know, we're more interested in the smaller tuck-in builders that may add to our market share in an existing market or give us, you know, some entry, but we do always have an opportunity to greenfield those. You know, I don't see on the horizon a significant large acquisition."", ""Certainly, you know, the acquisition that you're referring to makes some sense. We speak to scale a lot in market share, and that makes some sense to us. But, you know, today, we're going to continue to look at those as they come available, but no significant shift in what you've seen us do over the last couple of years."", 'Carl Reichardt -- BTIG -- Analyst', 'OK. Appreciate it. Thanks, Paul.', 'Operator', 'Your next question for today is coming from John Lovallo with UBS.', 'John Lovallo -- UBS -- Analyst', 'Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my questions as well. The first one here is, you know, it seems like the first quarter gross margin, at least relative to your expectations, was impacted by that 100 basis points of hedging that seemingly was not contemplated in the initial guide. So, I guess the question is why would the 2Q gross margin be flattish sequentially if that hit is not expected to repeat and rates have come in a bit?', 'Bill Wheat -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Well, you know, it starts with we sold homes with an increased level of incentives while rates were higher during Q1, and some of those closed in December, but there are still a number of them that will be closing in Q2. And so far, on a core basis, we still are entering the quarter a little bit lower margin than what the average presents. And so, that's -- but obviously, rates have dropped, and so those incentive costs are a bit lower in the later sales. And so, on balance, we expect we should be able to hold margins around the current levels, you know, excluding the hedging going forward."", 'John Lovallo -- UBS -- Analyst', ""OK. Got it. And then I think, last quarter, lot costs were up, you know, 10% or 11% year over year, but I think there's some geographic mix that was in there, and maybe it normalized to up sort of mid-single digits if you kind of accounted for that mix. I mean, how did lot costs trend in the quarter and how are you thinking about that in 2Q?"", 'Jessica Hansen -- Vice President, Investor Relations', ""Really, it's pretty similar to what we said last quarter, that was a year-over-year comp. And so, we still were up low double digits on a year-over-year basis, and it did continue to have a little bit of geographic mix. But I would say, you know, stripping out geography, our lot costs on a year-over-year basis probably are up high single digit. And until we cycle an entire year, it probably stays that way, and then it would moderate in terms of year over year because it's certainly less than that on a sequential basis."", 'Bill Wheat -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Yeah, 1.5% on a sequential basis.', 'Jessica Hansen -- Vice President, Investor Relations', 'Yeah.', 'John Lovallo -- UBS -- Analyst', 'Got it.

If you'll just humor me for maybe a couple more on the gross margin, could you just talk about the actual P&L impact of that charge, whether it was something that hit deductions from revenue or if it was just a hit to COGS? And then similarly, on the -- what you're expecting going forward, I guess it makes sense you're not expecting it given rates just kind of stabilized. But is there a way to think about the sensitivity based on what you've still got out there notionally? Like if we had another 50-basis-point to 100-basis-point drop, would you have another 100-basis-point impact from here?"", 'Bill Wheat -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Joe, the charge -- the amount of the charge is $65 million approximately, and that's basically what hit during the quarter. In terms of our position outstanding, we believe that our position is -- reflects the current market, and the valuation adjustment in the December quarter takes care of all of it. There is always some sensitivity. We always have some hedging position outstanding."", 'And so, anytime there is a significant sudden change in rates, that can leave some exposure there. Obviously, the opposite side of that is the benefits to the business. When rates drop, obviously, that improves affordability and improves our ability to sell at a price point in the core business. And so, what this hedging position allows us to do is offer below-market rates on a consistent basis, on a broad basis across our business.', 'And like we said, we try to manage that as best as we can. But in a period of significant sudden volatility, there can be some exposure to the position.', 'Mike Murray -- Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer', ""There were two very significant moves in interest rates in the quarter. They went up significantly in the middle of the quarter and they came down significantly to the end of the quarter. Kind of a very unique dynamic that we have not experienced. That's what led to the mark-to-market adjustment being more severe than it's been in prior quarters."", 'Jessica Hansen -- Vice President, Investor Relations', 'And that 65 million mark-to-market is in cost of goods sold, whereas the just standard routine interest rate offering does net against revenue and flows through our ASP.

We're seeing some relative flatness in our cost side of the business and would expect to see similar, all things stay consistent through the next quarter.

You're going to see a similar type of negative leverage impact on the second quarter. Would you expect that to kind of flatten out? Everything else equal, it seems to imply -- you said that maybe in the first couple of quarters, you're going to see this impact and, you know that that should kind of run through by the time you get to the back half or is this more of a '25 event? And, you know, as part of this question, I'm also curious if, you know, higher sales incentives outside broker commissions has impacted this at all or if you could remind us if that's the portion that's in the COGS?"", 'Bill Wheat -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. The last part first, yeah, our broker commissions are in our gross margins or in our cost of goods sold. So, that's not part of the equation.

But generally, our expectation, you know, over the longer term is that we would get back to a similar, you know, SG&A level as last year and beyond.

Appreciate that."", ""Secondly, not to beat a dead horse, but I do -- you know, you kind of made a comment on the gross margins, Bill, and I don't know if you misspoke or it would kind of make sense to us if, indeed, you did not misspeak. But, you know, I think you said at one point, we would expect gross margins to get back to the 1Q levels, excluding the hedging impact. That would kind of make sense to us to the extent that, in the last couple of months, rates have come down and your current orders, you know, would include less expensive rate buydowns than, let's say, a couple of months ago. And I think you're kind of saying 2Q is currently being impacted by some of the carryover from 1Q."", ""I just wanted to make sure I heard that right or how to think about, you know, where gross margins are today on orders taken in, you know, mid-January, let's say, versus a couple of months ago?"", 'Bill Wheat -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. You know, we provided guidance one quarter out, so we've got it to 22.6% to 23.1%. So, essentially straddling the gap margin that we reported in Q1. Coming into Q2, the closings that we will have early in the quarter are at the -- probably the low end of that range, maybe even a little below that."", ""But then later in the quarter, you know, margins are improving because of the cost of buydowns after rates have dropped is lower. And so -- but on average, that's -- we believe that that will balance out to a margin in the 22.6% to 23.1% range. What will occur after that, we can't really comment. It's really going to be a matter of what's the strength of the spring selling season, what does demand look like through the spring, and what happens with mortgage rates."", ""And so -- but on average, that's where we believe things will fall for margins in Q2."", 'Mike Rehaut -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', ""Right.

That's well above, you know, the prior peak of, we'll call it, 83,000 back in 2022 and there were all of these supply chain issues and constraints. Could you just help us get a little more comfortable with that level of growth kind of based on today's labor pool, lot availability?

At the same time, we've made a tremendous amount of progress reducing our cycle times and coming back to sort of our historical norms of around four months from starting a home to completion. And so, that's giving us much greater flexibility going into this year. With the strong finished lot position we currently have, combined with the reduced cycle times, we're able to reduce our homes and inventory and still deliver, you know, a closings target that's going to be, you know, at or in excess of our two times beginning of the year housing turns."", ""So, we really feel good about what's happened there. As to what the upside, top side is for where the bottlenecks would come in, hard to speculate on where that would be.

They've been very supportive of us."", 'Jessica Hansen -- Vice President, Investor Relations', ""But great point, Truman, in that when we think about overall industry constraints, finished lots are going to continue to be an issue in terms of builders being able to put more houses on the ground today.

So, I guess my question is now that cycle times seem to be improving across the industry, resale inventory is ticking a little bit higher, are you thinking about that dynamic any differently? Are you, you know, maybe contemplating selling earlier in the construction process again, whereas before you were maybe waiting for homes to get closer to completion? Are you seeing more competition from build-to-order builders that have kind of shrunk in their construction cycle times? Any commentary on that would be great."", 'Paul Romanowski -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""I think, today, you know, we are still seeing people looking for closing with certainty of closed date and in that 30 to 60 day time frame based on their ability to lock an interest rate.

The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period.

In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth.

The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Sherwin-Williams as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.011. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

Investors following this investing style typically avoid betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. They believe instead that one could make far more money in lesser time by ""buying high and selling higher.""', ""Who doesn't like betting on fast-moving trending stocks? But determining the right entry point isn't easy. Often, these stocks lose momentum once their valuation moves ahead of their future growth potential. In such a situation, investors find themselves loaded up on expensive shares with limited to no upside or even a downside. So, going all-in on momentum could be risky at times."", ""It could be safer to invest in bargain stocks that have been witnessing price momentum recently. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, is pretty useful in identifying great momentum stocks, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced."", 'There are several stocks that currently pass through the screen and Universal Health Services (UHS) is one of them. Here are the key reasons why this stock is a great candidate.', ""Investors' growing interest in a stock is reflected in its recent price increase. A price change of 1.9% over the past four weeks positions the stock of this hospital and health facility operator well in this regard."", 'While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. UHS meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 26% over the past 12 weeks.', 'Moreover, the momentum for UHS is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.25. This indicates that the stock moves 25% higher than the market in either direction.', 'Given this price performance, it is no surprise that UHS has a Momentum Score of B, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.', ""In addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped UHS earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks.

Stocks recently featured in the blog include: American Water Works Company, Inc. AWK, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, A. O. Smith Corp. AOS and Arista Networks, Inc. ANET.', 'Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:', 'Wall Street showed volatility to start the New Year. However, stocks have since then rebounded and three major indexes officially entered the bull market last week, with the S&P 500 Index hitting an all-time high. The S&P 500 closed at 4,839.81 points on Friday to record its highest close since January 2022.', 'Wall Street had a solid 2023 after a disappointing 2022 as 40-year-high inflation took a toll on stocks and the Federal Reserve implemented an aggressive interest rate hike policy to normalize the situation. This saw the S&P 500 giving up 19% in 2022.', 'The high interest rate regime continued in 2023 but markets rebounded as inflation started showing signs of easing. The Fed left interest rates unchanged for the first time in July last year before keeping it steady in its last three FOMC meetings after hiking rates by 525 basis points.', 'Slowing inflation and a dovish stance from the Federal Reserve sent stocks on a year-end rally that saw the S&P 500 recording a 24% gain in 2023 as fears of a recession waned.', 'Economists now expect that the economy will make a softer landing as inflation has eased considerably. The Federal Reserve has also hinted at cutting interest rates this year. Although the optimism among investors about the first interest rate cut coming in March has somewhat wanted, rate cuts are happening for sure in 2024.', 'According to the CME FedWatch Tool, 47.2% feel that a 25-basis point rate cut is possible in March. This was, however, more than 90% at the beginning of this year. Several Fed officials have indicated at least three 25-basis point rate cuts in 2024.', 'Lower interest rates bode well for stock markets. A low risk-free interest rate will bring down the discount rate, leading to an increase in the net present value of investments in equities.', ""Also, the economy is on solid ground. The third-quarter GDP grew 4.9% and according to the Atlanta Fed, the nation's GDP is projected to grow 2.4% in the fourth quarter of 2023."", ""Given this scenario, it would be ideal to invest in four S&P 500 stocks such as American Water Works Company, Inc., NVIDIA Corp., A. O. Smith Corp. and Arista Networks, Inc. that have a strong potential in 2024. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns.

AWK also acquires small water service providers to expand its customer base.', 'American Water Works Company has an expected earnings growth rate of 7.3% for the current year.

American Water Works Co., with its widespread operations, provides services to domestic customers and military bases and offers an excellent opportunity to stay invested in the water utility space. Other utilities worth retaining in one's portfolio are California Water Service Group, SJW Group and Consolidated Water Co. Ltd."", 'The Zacks Utility - Water Supply industry includes companies providing drinking water and wastewater services to industrial, commercial and residential customers, and military bases. Water utility operators own nearly 2.2 million miles of pipelines that are getting old. Utilities continuously replace old pipelines and add new ones to expand operations. Utility operators own storage tanks, treatment plants and desalination plants to supply uninterrupted potable water to customers.', 'The highly fragmented industry creates operational challenges, but increasing efficient water use by individuals and other industries will ensure that previous water is not wasted. A large nation like the United States already has a widespread water infrastructure in place but proper maintenance and upgrade of aging infrastructure becomes crucial for the supply of potable water to millions of consumers.', 'Fragmented Water Industry Needs Consolidation: Since the U.S. water utility industry is highly fragmented, upgrading aging assets to provide quality services is the need of the hour. Per the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), at present, 50,000 community water systems and 16,000 wastewater treatment systems in the United States are providing water solutions to customers. Per the ASCE finding, due to the delay in pipeline repairs and maintenance, 6 billion gallons of treated water is lost every day in the United States.', 'The industry creates operational challenges in meeting the requirement for replacement and adding to the aging water and wastewater infrastructure. Large water utility companies continue to acquire small players to ensure the extension of high-quality services to customers and the investment required to upgrade old and acquired assets. Water conservation and initiatives taken by large water operators in educating their consumers on the efficient use of appliances and detecting leakage should help to prevent wastage.', 'Aging Infrastructure Needs Huge Investments: The water and wastewater infrastructure is aging and gradually nearing the end of its effective service life. Per the findings of the ASCE, water main breaks occur every two minutes in the United States due to the aging of the existing water infrastructure. It is evident that this industry needs more investment for maintenance and upgrade.', 'Per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), an estimated $744 billion investment is necessary to maintain and expand the drinking water and wastewater service to meet demand over the next 20 years. The massive investment requirement also creates an opportunity for growth among operators in this space.', 'The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $50 billion to EPA to strengthen the drinking water and wastewater systems of the United States. A major portion of the investment will be directed to upgrading water infrastructure serving disadvantaged communities. ASCE gives a C- rating to the U.S. drinking water infrastructure and D+ to the U.S. wastewater infrastructure.', 'Possibility of Interest Rate Decline is a Tailwind: Utilities, in order to maintain, upgrade and expand operations, approach capital markets for loans. The utilities have been enjoying near-zero interest rates for the past few years. However, multiple rate hikes by the Federal Reserve took the benchmark rate to the 5.25-5.50% range, which impacted the utility operators.', 'However, in its last three meetings in 2023, the Fed did not increase the benchmark rate and indicated the possibility of rate cuts in 2024. The likely drop in interest rates in 2024 would be a positive for utility operators that are planning large investments in infrastructure upgrades and the addition of renewable sources of energy to produce electricity.', 'The Zacks Utility Water Supply industry is a 13-stock group within the broader Zacks Utilities sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #53, which places it in the top 21% of more than 248 Zacks industries.', ""The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bullish prospects for the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1."", ""The industry's positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

Companies are expected to gain from the expansion into newer categories and adjacent categories, including capturing market share in the Ready-to-Drink (“RTD”) alcoholic beverage category through collaborations. Players like The Coca-Cola Company KO, PepsiCo Inc. PEP, Monster Beverage Corporation MNST, Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. KOF and Dutch Bros BROS are poised for growth on these actions.However, players in the industry have been witnessing continued pressure from cost inflation, including transportation and commodity costs, particularly steel and aluminum. Industry players’ actions, including price increases, reducing reliance on imported cans and moving production closer to markets, look promising to combat these headwinds. Elevated operating expenses related to increased spending on marketing and advertising to capture a share are likely to strain margins in the near term.', 'About the Industry', 'The Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry comprises companies that manufacture, source, develop, market and sell non-alcoholic beverages. Soft drinks mainly include sparkling drinks, natural juices, enhanced water, sports and energy drinks, dairy, and RTD tea and coffee beverages.

The companies have been optimizing their portfolios, and focusing on core brands and investments in innovation to meet the evolving needs of consumers. The players have been committed to product launches and innovation. Expansion into newer markets has been a critical focus for soft drink makers to boost market share. The companies are expected to reap the benefits of digital and technology-driven investments based on the shifting consumer preference for online shopping. Companies in the industry have been accelerating investments to build strong digital capabilities by piloting numerous digital-enabled fulfillment options. They have been expanding digital offerings and investing in loyalty programs to capture online demand. These investments are likely to position soft drink companies for long-term growth.Evolving Trends: One of the notable trends in the U.S. beverage soft drinks industry is the increasing demand for healthier options. Consumers are becoming more health-conscious, driving a shift toward beverages with natural ingredients, lower sugar content and functional benefits, while staying excited for varied flavors and better taste experiences. Plant-based beverages have gained significant traction as consumers seek alternatives to traditional soft drinks. Plant-based ingredients, such as botanical extracts and non-dairy milk alternatives, are becoming popular choices for those looking to reduce their environmental impacts and make healthier choices. Additionally, functional beverages that offer specific health benefits, such as enhanced hydration, energy boosters, and mood enhancers, are carving out a niche in the market. Companies in the industry are expected to benefit from the expansion into newer and adjacent categories, including capturing market share in the fast-growing RTD alcoholic beverage category through collaborations. RTD has emerged as the fastest-growing category since 2018. The industry players are also exploring CBD-infused drinks, which have been gaining popularity lately.Raw Material Cost Inflation and Supply Constraints: The beverage industry has been troubled by higher costs, including rising commodity input costs and transportation expenses. Raw material cost inflation, particularly steel and aluminum, has increased packaging costs. The ongoing supply constraints in the aluminum can industry have been other headwinds. The companies are also witnessing delays in procuring certain ingredients, domestically and internationally, leading to shortages of some goods. The industry players have been facing freight inefficiencies, and significant increases in domestic and international freight costs. Logistic issues, higher input costs and freight inefficiencies have led to higher sales and operating expenses, impacting the gross and operating margins.

What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. Importantly, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) does carry debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?"", 'Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.', ' See our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals ', 'The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals had US$1.98b in debt in September 2023; about the same as the year before. But it also has US$9.91b in cash to offset that, meaning it has US$7.93b net cash.', 'We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals had liabilities of US$3.60b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$3.66b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$9.91b in cash and US$5.58b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it actually has US$8.24b more liquid assets than total liabilities.', ""This short term liquidity is a sign that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals could probably pay off its debt with ease, as its balance sheet is far from stretched. Succinctly put, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!"", ""The modesty of its debt load may become crucial for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals if management cannot prevent a repeat of the 32% cut to EBIT over the last year. When a company sees its earnings tank, it can sometimes find its relationships with its lenders turn sour. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Regeneron Pharmaceuticals's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts."", ""Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. Over the most recent three years, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals recorded free cash flow worth 76% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to."", ""While we empathize with investors who find debt concerning, you should keep in mind that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has net cash of US$7.93b, as well as more liquid assets than liabilities. And it impressed us with free cash flow of US$4.4b, being 76% of its EBIT. So we are not troubled with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals's debt use. Over time, share prices tend to follow earnings per share, so if you're interested in Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, you may well want to click here to check an interactive graph of its earnings per share history."", ""At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

Moreover, Baylor can charge its wealthier patients a high price to obtain the test.', 'I believe that, later this year, Baylor will announce that the test has been a tremendous success. And order a large number of them from Exact Sciences, sparking a huge rally by EXAS stock. Moreover, I predict that that many other hospitals will ultimately follow Baylor’s lead, propelling Exact’s shares even higher and making it one of the best disease testing stocks to buy.', 'Source: shutterstock.com/JHVEPhoto', 'Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) owns GRAIL which has its own MCED test. However, due to regulatory issues, Illumina is being forced to either sell or divest GRAIL. ILMN stock has tumbled nearly 75% from its all-time highs, largely due to uncertainty over GRAIL’s fate, and the losses that GRAIL generated as a result of its high legal and R&D costs.', 'But if Illumina sells GRAIL, it expects to obtain $7 billion to $10 billion in the deal, while its current market capitalization is only $21.9 billion. Moreover, the transaction is expected to cause its operating margin to rise to 25% from its current 22.5% level. As a result, a sale of GRAIL is likely to tremendously boost ILMN stock.', 'Instead, Illumina may choose to retain a stake in GRAIL or conduct an IPO of the company. In that case, Illumina’s shareholders will eventually benefit from the large-scale utilization of GRAIL’s test by consumers and hospitals.', 'Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com', 'In 2021, Quest (NYSE:DGX) agreed to aid GRAIL in administering its liquid biopsy test. Consequently, I believe that DGX stock will get a big boost over the longer term from the widespread use of GRAIL’s tests by consumers. Eventually, Quest could make similar deals with other firms that have developed liquid biopsy tests.', 'The forward price-earnings ratio of DGX stock is an attractive 15, while analysts, on average, expect its earnings per share to climb to $9.03 in 2024 from $8.71 last year.', 'On the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in EXAS.

We diligently adopted best practices in the field such as offering year-round donation matching, raised annual match amounts to $25,000 per employee, and offered 40 hours of volunteer time off per year. These were an excellent foundation and edged our engagement up to 50%. Good, but not enough.', ""The breakthrough came when we shifted to learn from Cisco's own business transformation and re-design around the question: How do we make giving back a habit? We landed on these design principles:"", 'Center on inclusion and make it simple for nonparticipants to take their first give back action. For example, we provided new hires with $15 donation credits to direct to their preferred charity on their first day at Cisco.', 'Leverage digitization to engage at scale.

Compared to employees who did not take any community impact action, those who took at least one per year stayed longer at Cisco, had higher bonuses, had higher odds of promotion, and received more recognition from others.', 'The same held true for specific subgroups like teams, leaders, and new hires. For example, when a team collectively engaged in giving back, the whole team had higher rates of promotion and higher recognition.', 'Particularly compelling was that when leaders engaged in giving back, their team was more likely to give back as well.
