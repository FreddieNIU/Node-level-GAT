You can skip our detailed analysis and go directly to 5 Best Places to Retire Overseas for Affordable and Efficient Healthcare.Retirement Healthcare CostsAccording to the Federal Reserve, an average American has $65,000 in retirement savings, with the figure climbing up to $255,200 by the time they retire. In contrast, they need $967,000 for a comfortable retirement on average, a figure largely being obstructed today by decades-high inflation levels.The looming $7 trillion retirement crisis is now taking a turn for the worst, with falling stock markets shaving off more than $3 trillion from IRAs and 401(k)s. As a result, 75% of single retirees and half of all married elder couples have become reliant on social security for their income. The 8.7% Social Security Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) of 2023, originally adjusted to offset inflation, has been no help either.With an average $140 increase in social security incomes, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) reveals that consumer spending in the older generation has risen by 3 percentage points. Much of this unwise spending comes from a lack of awareness about retirement expenses.When surveyed, it has been revealed that an American expects healthcare costs to be $41,000 only. However, Fidelity Retiree Health Care Cost Estimate has revealed that a 65-year-old couple retiring in 2022 can expect to spend about $315,000, on average, in healthcare and medical expenses throughout their retirement period.The estimate has increased from 5% since 2021, nearly doubling the $160,000 estimate made in 2002. These healthcare costs continue to inflate at 2-2.5 times the rate of U.S. inflation. Provided these healthcare costs increase at 2% above inflation over the years, they could be spending over $1 million on these expenses during their lifetime. This amount is nearly the same as they can expect to collect through their social security checks.Story continuesThe Truth about MedicareMost Americans believe that healthcare costs in retirement will be covered by Medicare. Medicare, the nation's federal healthcare program for people over age 65, covers healthcare expenses for retirees but is not free. In fact, a study by EBRI reveals that the healthcare program only covers 65% of the costs of healthcare services for Medicare beneficiaries.In contrast, 12% of healthcare costs are out-of-pocket expenses, while private insurance covers around 14%. Further, retirees enrolled in Medicare are required to pay 25% of the total Medicare Part-B coverage costs, a cost eating away a significant portion of their social security checks.To make matters worse, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) have increased their Medicare Part B monthly premiums by 15% for 2022 due to increased spending on physician-administered drugs. As of 2023, the lowest possible monthly Medicare Part B premium will be $164.90 to as much as $230 in 2029.With co-pays, supplemental insurance, prescription drug coverage, and other expenses, Americans with fixed incomes may have already begun feeling the financial pressure. In addition, hearing aids and dental care aren’t covered by Medicare either. In many instances, there are separate premiums for Part-D drugs coverage and Medigap supplemental coverage.Furthermore, reserves for the Medicare Hospital Trust Fund are projected to be depleted by 2031, with benefits cutting by as much as 11% for retirees. Therefore, it can be safe to say that Medicare does not and cannot offer comprehensive healthcare insurance. For this reason, 90% of retirees have supplemental health plans for assistance.Low-income groups apply for Medicaid, while there are supplemental third-party insurance plans known as Medigap for others. With this backdrop, it is not surprising that 100 million people in the U.S. are burdened by medical debt. Even worse, over 6.5 million people in America have health problems that they do not seek treatment for and 11% skip prescribed medicines to save money.One way to prepare for healthcare costs during retirement is to have a Health Savings Account (HSA). Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), and Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) are two organizations offering HSAs to their customers. With an HSA at Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), customers can avail necessary guidance and advice on matching their financial strategies with their different health and wellness goals.Other corporations like Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), allow their customers to invest in Health Savings Brokerage Accounts within their Health Savings Accounts. This way, Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), allows customers to invest in mutual funds, stocks, bonds, and ETFs.While overall healthcare expenses are costly, a retiree's home base also impacts their healthcare costs. This is why retirees are increasingly exploring the best places overseas where they can enjoy affordable and efficient healthcare.17 Countries With Universal Health Care in 2017GagliardiImages/Shutterstock.comMethodologyIn order to identify the 20 best places to retire overseas for affordable and efficient health care, we have looked at 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, among other sources. Each time a place appeared in the sources, it was awarded a single point. The places are then ranked in an ascending order. Out of these, the top 20 places to retire overseas for affordable and efficient healthcare are listed below:20. SingaporeInsider Monkey Score: 2Singapore has one of the most efficient and affordable healthcare systems in the world. Retirees, medical tourists, and citizens get to avail excellent medical facilities and access to high-quality staff and services. Moreover, services are 25%-40% cheaper than in the U.S. Expat retirees must have private health insurance, which costs around $300 per month. Even if not covered, doctor trips cost a minimum of $25. Private insurance generally covers the cost of medication too.19. ColombiaInsider Monkey Score: 2The healthcare system in Colombia has witnessed tremendous growth over the years. According to the World Health Organization, its healthcare is more efficient than Canada, the U.S., and even Australia. Highly skilled doctors, excellent care, and well-equipped hospitals are key features of their healthcare system. The basic public insurance plan in Colombia is the Entidades Promotoras de Salud (EPS). Expat retirees over the age of 60 having a national I.D. card can apply for EPS in Colombia. Private health insurance and supplemental plans are also available.18. BrazilInsider Monkey Score: 2Famous for cosmetic and plastic surgeries, Brazil holds some of the most affordable healthcare plans in the world. High-quality procedures are available at cheap rates, and Americans getting treated in Brazil can save as much as 20% in the country. Moreover, the service quality is guaranteed, and over 40 hospitals are accredited by the Joint Commission International or JCI.17. CubaInsider Monkey Score: 2Cuba is home to world-class doctors, nurses, and state-of-the-art medical facilities. The Caribbean nation is most famous for its medical services pertaining to post-accident rehab, plastic surgery, eye illnesses, and drug abuse. It is almost on par with the USA's healthcare system, with the exception that medical tourists can save as much as 60%-80% on their bills. This makes their healthcare system both highly efficient and highly affordable.16. TaiwanInsider Monkey Score:2Thanks to recent medical advancements, Taiwan is becoming an ideal place for retirees seeking affordable and efficient health treatments. Expats can make use of the public health system through National Health Insurance. Public hospitals can be accessed by expats at heavily subsidized rates. Retirees may also choose to use private insurance plans for better patient care, wider treatment options, and shorter queues.15. ItalyInsider Monkey Score:2Known as the Servizio Sanitario Nazionale, Italy's national health service is similar to NHS. It is one of the most easily accessible health systems for expats in Europe. The public health system can be accessed by becoming a national and applying for an Italian health insurance card. However, many expats choose a private insurance as well for shorter wait times and wider options in terms of doctors and facilities.14. AustriaInsider Monkey Score:2Austria’s health system is two-tiered and has a higher doctor-patient ratio than most of Europe. All residents and expats must have public health insurance which covers basic health care, dental care, and some specialist consultations. Private health insurance exists to complement public insurance, and almost all of the services in that order are electronic. Moreover, pharmacies are easily available throughout the city.13. DubaiInsider Monkey Score:2Another place that is making rapid advancements in the medical sector is Dubai. Private healthcare facilities greatly outnumber public ones and are preferable because of their shorter wait times, fluent staff, and better facilities. Dubai is also the hub of innovative medical technology. Hospitals provide free or subsidized care to their residents. However, expats can also access it by applying for a UAE health card. Moreover, they must have a private insurance plan, and there are many affordable options available such as Cigna’s Close Care plan.12. MaltaInsider Monkey Score:2Malta's healthcare system is characterized by highly trained staff and state-of-the-art public and private facilities. The hospitals are modern, and the staff is highly fluent in English too. Medical insurance in the country needs to be paid, but the premiums are highly affordable. With its sound reputation, it is increasingly being considered a medical tourism destination. Moreover, nationals of Australia and the U.K. can avail free hospital care if they are visiting the islands for no more than a month.11. PanamaInsider Monkey Score: 3One of the primary reasons retirees choose Panama as their second home is because of its outstanding medical care. Major hospitals in the country are affiliated with international institutions such as the Cleveland Clinic, Johns Hopkins International, and more. Both public and private healthcare systems in Panama are excellent. Expats can access care at public hospitals. However, they mostly choose upscale private hospitals, which come with shorter wait time and affordability. Retiree residents in the country who don't have insurance can get a 20% discount on most medical services.10. PortugalInsider Monkey Score: 3Portugal is one of the countries where both public and private healthcare systems offer excellent healthcare. Home to the finest doctors with superior medical training, Portugal has 10 hospitals and 16 health facilities that together hold the Joint Commission International “gold stamp of approval.” Moreover, expats have access to both public and private health insurance. The latter is easily affordable with plans starting as low as $50. Doctors listen to their patients professionally, answer all their questions, and are willing to offer a solution. They are highly fluent in English as well.9. ThailandInsider Monkey Score:3Thailand is one of the best places to retire overseas for affordable and efficient healthcare. Run by the Ministry of Health, more than 1000 hospitals are present under the system that offer a high standard of care. Thai medical staff is highly efficient and trained, whereas treatment is done with modern and high-quality equipment.8. South KoreaInsider Monkey Score:3South Korea's healthcare system comprises an advanced healthcare system, well-trained staff, and cutting-edge technology. Treatments in the country cost 35%-40% less than in the U.S. Retirees living in the country for six months or longer must enroll in the National Health Insurance System (NHIS). A private insurance plan can also be availed to avail an extra level of comfort and luxury.7. JapanInsider Monkey Score:3The healthcare system in Japan is high-quality, as reflected by its high life expectancy rates. The quality of care is exceptional, with access to specialists and low rates of medical errors. Governments cover 70% of the cost while 30% is covered by patients. Everyone, including expats must pay for medical insurance. With 8 health insurance systems and over 3500 health insurers, citizens are free to choose medical facilities and physicians of their choice.6. MalaysiaInsider Monkey Score:4 Malaysia boasts a world-class healthcare system with excellent facilities. Compared to the U.S., people can save up to 80% of their medical bills in this country. Most hospitals have excellent patient rooms. The country offers both public and private healthcare systems. Both public and private sectors are affordable and efficient, consistently expanding investments in healthcare to deliver state-of-the-art health services.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Places to Retire Overseas for Affordable and Efficient Health Care.

(zz/STRF/STAR MAX/IPx)The retail sectors that will see the most closures, based on Lasser's work, includes clothing accessories and consumer electronics stores at an estimated 23,000 combined.Lasser pointed to several key drivers for the looming closures:A slowdown in consumer spendingA reduction of credit availabilityThe rising penetration of e-commerce shoppingHigher costs to operate retail storesA decade removed from the demises of once-dominant retail chains Sports Authority, Circuit City, and Linens N' Things — and more recently Sears and Kmart — the age of online shopping is continuing to pressure retailers with too many physical stores open.A Sears department store in West Covina, California on November 09, 2019. (Photo by Mark RALSTON / AFP) (MARK RALSTON via Getty Images)At the same time, the veteran analyst sees the store closure wave as an ""investable"" theme.As weaker retail chains such as Bed Bath &amp; Beyond vanish from the landscape, market share will further shift to strong national players.Lasser calculates that if 50,000 stores close over the next five years and that the average sales per store is $5.7 million, it would translate to $285 billion of retail sales ""up for grabs."" Assuming that 26% of these sales go online, it would suggest large national chains like Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), and Costco (COST) have the potential to haul in $210 billion in sales, Lasser believes.""Well capitalized, efficient, market share taking retailers will be fine,"" retail expert and J Rogers Kniffen WorldWide CEO Jan Kniffen told Yahoo Finance.

Sixth Street will provide the company with $240 million in debtor-in-possession financing, which will allow the company to continue operations during its wind-down process.""Our teams have worked with incredible purpose to support and strengthen our beloved banners, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and buybuy BABY,"" CEO Sue Gove said in a statement. ""We deeply appreciate our associates, customers, partners, and the communities we serve, and we remain steadfastly determined to serve them throughout this process. We will continue working diligently to maximize value for the benefit of all stakeholders.""Bed Bath &amp; Beyond had been exploring ""strategic alternatives"" for its business dating back to January. That plan spiraled, as Bed Bath &amp; Beyond’s first funding partner bailed after less than two months.In the most recent quarter, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond reported sales dropped 33% while adjusted losses totaled $225 million.Shares of the company have lost 98% over the last year; year-to-date, the stock was down 88% through Friday's close.After peaking at $12.3 billion in 2017, sales at the retailer have collapsed in recent years, totaling just $7.9 billion in 2021, its lowest annual tally since 2009. Through the first three quarters of 2022, the company was on pace for sales that would have matched levels reported in the mid-2000s.While private labels have become an increasing part of the growth story for Target (TGT), Macy’s (M), Walmart (WMT), and other large retailers, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond fell behind. The company's decline was only accelerated by the pandemic as shoppers switched to online retailers like Amazon (AMZN) and Wayfair (W).Story continuesFrom bath towels and hand soap to air fryers and board games, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond was once the go-to spot for suburban families and incoming college students to fill their homes.But in recent years, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond stores have been better known for discounts and empty shelves. After losing a cumulative $1.4 billion from 2018-2021, the company lost more than a billion dollars through the first three quarters of 2022.Last month, the company announced plans for a shareholder vote on a reverse stock split set for May 9 in an effort to shore up its liquidity and come into compliance with Nasdaq listing rules after its stock fell below $1 per share. The company noted in an SEC filing that boosting the stock price was its last hope at survival.""A failure to obtain shareholder approval for the Reverse Split Proposal will likely force us to file for bankruptcy,"" the company said in the SEC filing.Bed Bath &amp; Beyond had announced a funding deal with Hudson Bay Capital on February 7 to raise more than $1 billion over the next year. But provisions in that deal required Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's stock price to stay above certain levels.As the stock dropped from above $5 per share in February to less than $1 per share in late March, Hudson Bay's funding deal ended.The money from Hudson Bay, as well as Bed Bath &amp; Beyond’s new funding partner, B. Riley Securities, was meant to restock shelves, pay back vendors, and revive sales at stores that were still operating.“Having inventory and having the right inventory will help them,"" Goldman Sachs analyst Kate McShane told Yahoo Finance Live on April 6 after Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's latest round of funding.""I think the question is just, in this environment, where you do have a consumer that’s a little bit more thoughtful about their spending exactly what it will yield for someone like Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.""A customer walks into a Bed Bath &amp; Beyond store in Novi, Michigan, U.S., January 29, 2021.

Investor Ryan Cohen, who catalyzed the market's interest in GameStop back in late 2020, took a 9.8% stake in Bed Bath &amp; Beyond in March 2022, and company shares soared.The idea of retail investor interest even became part of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's revival strategy.The company wrote in an SEC filing on April 5 that a reverse-stock split could help make the stock ""more attractive"" to investors.In mid-August 2022, shares closed as high as $23.

NSP, Microchip Technology Inc. MCHP, Darden Restaurants Inc. DRI, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories RDY and W.W. Grainger Inc. GWW.5 Top-Ranked Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy NowVolatility has rattled stock markets in recent months. The Fed’s rate hike action, a series of bank failures in the United States, growing geopolitical tensions and recession fears have compelled investors to look for safe and defensive bets, thus raising the appeal for dividend investing.This is especially true as dividend stocks are major sources of consistent income for investors to create wealth when returns from the equity market are at risk, even though these do not offer dramatic price appreciation. In fact, stocks with a strong history of year-over-year dividend growth form a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those that have high yields.We have selected five dividend growth stocks — Insperity Inc., Microchip Technology Inc., Darden Restaurants Inc., Dr. Reddy's Laboratories and W.W. Grainger Inc. — that could be compelling picks amid market volatility.Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a dividend increase is likely in the future.Story continuesAlthough these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included.Here are five of the 22 stocks that fit the bill:Texas-based Insperity provides an array of human resources and business solutions designed to improve business performance. The company has an estimated earnings growth rate of 1.1% for this year and delivered an average earnings surprise of 22.2% for the past four quarters.Insperity has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of A.

The company has an estimated earnings growth rate of 2.7% for the fiscal year (ending March 2024) and delivered an average earnings surprise of 3.07% for the past four quarters.Microchip Technology has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of A.Florida-based Darden Restaurants is one of the largest casual dining restaurant operators worldwide. The company saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 8 cents over the past 30 days for the fiscal year (ending May 2023), with estimated earnings growth of 7.2%.Darden Restaurants has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of A. India-based Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories is an integrated global pharmaceutical company engaged in providing affordable and innovative medicines since 1984. The company has an estimated earnings growth of 5.2% for the fiscal year (ending March 2024) and delivered an earnings surprise of 48.61% over the last four quarters.At present, RDY has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of A.Illinois-based W.W.

20,3fc0d31c-38cf-3d13-97e0-0f5acc8ccb33,O,2023-04-24,Four Scenarios That Could Send Oil Prices To $200,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/four-scenarios-could-send-oil-230000561.html,1682290800,STORY,['CL=F'],"[It was the talk of the town last year. Traders bet on oil hitting $200 by March this year. Hedge fund managers warned it could even reach $250 before 2022 was over.None of that happened, and in hindsight, it’s easy to see why: global oil markets have time and again proved they are a lot more resilient than traders give them credit for. But is oil at $200 still a possibility? It always is, under certain scenarios.#1 Major Ukraine escalationIt was because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year that people started talking about $200. Pierre Andurand went even further, warning that oil could rise to $250 because “I think we’re losing the Russian supply on the European side for ever.”It turned out that the European side is not losing Russian supply but is simply getting it through third countries now, so that’s saved the global economy from a major oil price-induced headache. Oil always finds a way.Yet a major escalation in the conflict, possibly through more direct NATO involvement, could send prices flying high. It’s not certain they would reach $200 even in an escalation scenario because it’s highly unlikely the market could bear this price for any length of time, but it’s not impossible.#2 More OPEC+ cutsAs far as chances go, this scenario is less likely than the first one. To get prices to $200, OPEC+ would need to cut much deeper, but more importantly, the group would have to want it. It doesn’t. Because $200 is way too high a price, and it would sap demand.OPEC+ has suggested with its latest moves that its sweet price spot is around $80-90 per barrel, so it is trying to keep prices around that level.Production outages could push oil prices higher, as they invariably do, even when the outage is as small as 400,000 bpd, as we recently saw with the Kurdistan-Iraq export dispute.Yet outages do not move prices so radically as to take them from sub-$90 to $200, so this is an even less likely scenario. An attack on Saudi production facilities could do the trick if it’s very successful, but with the war in Yemen nearing its end after the Chinese-brokered thaw between Riyadh and Tehran, such an attack has become purely hypothetical.Story continues#3 Russia production cutsAll the $200-per-barrel forecasts from last year had to do with Russian oil. Most forecasters who saw oil rising to $200 cited European and U.S. bans on Russian oil imports as the basis for their forecasts, and at the time, it did seem like a sound basis.Of course, those forecasts never considered the option that Russia would simply switch buyers and Europe and the U.S. would switch sellers, which is exactly what happened.Another thing few considered was Russia cutting oil production in retaliation for Western sanctions. It already has announced certain cuts, but those, some commentators say, are a result of Russia’s inability to pump as much as before rather than deliberate action.Whatever the case with those cuts, the simple fact is that Russia can reduce its production deliberately. And if it does, prices will jump. How high is anyone’s guess, and it would depend on the rate of cuts. As for how likely that is—not very.#4 Underinvestment comes to biteThe scenarios outlined so far are more of a mental exercise than realistic scenarios. None of them are particularly likely, even though at least a couple seemed so likely they made traders buy $200 Brent options.Yet there is one more scenario that is a realistic one. It’s not as bombastic as a war, but that makes it all the more dangerous. It is the scenario where consistent underinvestment shrinks supply so much, that prices have nowhere to go but up.Saudi Arabia has been warning about it. U.S. shale producers have been warning about it. And the G7 just declared they would fight “unabated fossil fuels,” which essentially means discouraging more oil and gas production.Of course, that declaration is worth little more than the paper it was written on, and that is the world’s greatest hope that oil will not hit $200 anytime soon, if ever. If those governments get serious about what they call unabated fossil fuels, the world’s oil supply will be at risk.Analysts love to say that the cure for high oil prices is high prices, and they are correct. A very efficient way to control the price of a commodity is to let it rise so much it kills demand.But what happens if that commodity is as essential as oil? Not using oil takes people back through the ages to a simpler but a lot less abundant, wealthy time. Just ask a Kenyan farmer how he likes that.Luckily for all, even the consistent underinvestment in new oil and gas exploration may not be enough to take prices all the way to $200. Because the industry, with the help of technology, will always respond to demand by adjusting production. Underinvestment has made this harder but not impossible. And even the most ambitious G7 government is not ready to impose an outright ban on oil. That would be political and economic suicide.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Azerbaijan And Kazakhstan Agree To Optimize Energy Transit Route To EuropeHistorical Correlations Of Stocks And BondsUK To See Rapid Expansion In Battery Storage Through 2030Read this article on OilPrice.com]"

While U.S. manufacturing activity grew more than expected in April, analysts warned that this could likely feed into inflation.Concerns over more U.S. interest rate hikes also weighed heavily on oil markets, as the dollar recovered some lost ground and uncertainty persisted over when the Federal Reserve will pause its rate hike cycle.Crude markets saw their first weekly loss in five weeks, with prices once again close to falling below the $80 a barrel level.Brent oil futures fell 0.6% to $80.97 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 0.6% to 77.39 a barrel by 21:46 ET (01:46 GMT). Both contracts lost about 5% last week.A price boost from an unexpected production cut by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies (OPEC+) now appears to have largely worn off, with oil prices having reversed a bulk of their gains in recent weeks.While supply is set to tighten as the OPEC+ cuts take hold in May, markets fear that worsening demand will result in less tighter than expected conditions. A swathe of weaker-than-expected U.S. corporate earnings also furthered this notion, reflecting the impact of high interest rates on business activity.Focus this week is on U.S. and European GDP data for the first quarter of 2023, which is expected to show that growth slowed from the prior quarter.The first week of May will also see a string of central bank rate decisions, with the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and Bank of England all expected to hike rates further to combat inflation.This trend is expected to result in slowing economic growth this year, potentially denting crude demand despite a recovery in major importer China. Recent data showed that the country imported record amounts of crude in March, as it reopens after three years of COVID lockdowns.Story continuesRelated ArticlesOil nears 5-week low amid fears of rising rates, worsening growthGold pinned below $2,000 as rate hike fears persistEnergy &amp; precious metals - weekly review and outlook]"

That’s a surefire path to reaping strong returns. The stocks and cryptocurrencies below all look to be trading below where they should based on their intrinsic values and other factors. Granted, 2023 has started off with a lot of fear and unexpected shocks. However, there is reason to be optimistic. The Federal Reserve may or may not raise rates again in May with current trends favoring another down-to-the-wire decision as inflation cools. In either case, stocks should continue to inch upward as the majority of the hikes have passed. CRMSalesforce$198.72TYLTyler Technologies$372.71KKellogg$67.20ADA-USDCardano$0.39ASMLASML.$635.32XRP-USDXRP.$0.47VET-USDVeChain$0.02Salesforce (CRM)Salesforce (CRM) company logo seen displayed on smart phone. Salesforce Layoffs 2023Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comIt’s difficult to imagine that a leading company like Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) will see its stock held low for much longer. The customer relationship management firm is the largest player in the space and benefits from a leading market share. The company has had its share of troubles but the other leading industry names collectively control about as much market share as Salesforce. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSize matters as does the fact that Salesforce is coming off of a strong earnings period. Full year revenue increased by nearly 18% with Q4 growth of 14%. Salesforce gave guidance that it expects roughly 10% top-line growth overall in its fiscal year 2024. While that may not be a stellar number, there are a few things to note. The company’s cash flow increased by 19% meaning more money in than out. The company could be waiting for an opportunity to spend soon, potentially increasing growth. In any case, Salesforce is going to be receiving attention because of cooling inflation and fed rate hikes which will bring growth back into focus and investor capital inflows. Story continuesTyler Technologies (TYL)A large amount of SALE signs.Source: akamakis / Shutterstock.comOne of the clearest arguments favoring Tyler Technologies (NYSE:TYL) as an undervalued stock has to do with trajectory. Share prices of the public sector software provider are below where they were just prior to the onset of the pandemic. But Tyler Technologies is roughly twice as large as it was back then based on revenues. That has to matter. The company is expected to report approximately $1.95 billion in sales in 2023. That’s a significant increase over the $1.09 billion in sales from the company in 2019. However, the firm is expected to see a sales contraction during the current quarter which doesn’t exactly favor the stock. That probably explains why shares have fallen recently but realistically the company is still far bigger than it was in early 2020 when it traded for more. In short, it has nearly twice the revenues and trades for less than it did then. I don’t see why it should continue to go lower, quite the opposite. Kellogg (K)Kellogg's sign on their Canada's head office building in MississaugaSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comKellogg (NYSE:K) stock is undervalued based on the notion that its current strategy will work. That strategy, to isolate its snacking business, has a strong precedent in Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ). Kellogg will name its new snacking business Kellanova to focus on the growth in that business by separating it from its slower-growing parent. The strategy is similar to what Kraft (NYSE:KHC) did by spinning off newly created Mondelez a decade ago. Basically, Kellogg wants to do what Kraft did by focusing on snacking growth that would have otherwise been inseparable from the larger firm. The new firm even follows naming conventions that leverage the use of Latin words. What’s important is the fact that Kraft’s Mondelez strategy was successful and shares have more than doubled in the last decade. Kellanova could very well evolve into a similar story when Kellogg separates the snacking business as Kellanova later in 2023. Cardano (ADA-USD)A concept token for Cardano with a trading chart in the background.Source: ShutterstockCryptocurrencies such as Cardano (ADA-USD) are much more difficult to characterize as undervalued or overpriced than stocks. Crypto is still very much nascent and pricing mechanisms remain much more tenuous and underdeveloped. That said, Cardano appears to be one of the low-priced blockchain-based assets that may indeed be very, very cheap. Again, it’s very difficult to do much more than say that a given crypto once traded for much more and is building something that could become important and valuable. As that applies to Cardano, it was worth several dollars a few years ago. Crypto crashed. Now it’s worth $0.45 but has appreciated rapidly in price in 2023 after beginning the year at $0.25.  Cardano may indeed be building something valuable. Most crypto watchers are still busy in 2023 trying to make sense of the somewhat nebulous blockchain/crypto world. But Cardano could truly create a viable long-term project out of the chaos simply because the parent firm strictly adheres to a scientific approach in developing the platform. No trendy dog breeds and no wild origin stories, just computer science applied to an emerging technological field. ASML (ASML)Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboardSource: Ralf Liebhold / ShutterstockASML (NASDAQ:ASML) stock raises an important question for the markets. What price can you put on the shares of a company that produces something no other firm can in a vitally important industry? The answer for ASML is that the market currently values it at $665 but analysts believe it is much more valuable, at $755. As I mentioned, ASML is one of one. No other company on earth can make the EUV lithography systems it does. It is the only firm that has the technological know-how to fabricate the extreme ultraviolet systems used by leading global firms to fabricate leading-edge semiconductors. That has led some to dub ASML the world’s most important company since everything in our world relies on chips. No one else can afford to make the machines which require inputs from roughly 5000 different suppliers. Scarcity often creates overpriced assets but ASML is the rare chance to get the opposite. XRP (XRP-USD)Coin cryptocurrency ripple on the background of a stack of coinsSource: ShutterstockXRP (XRP-USD) is a story of an undervalued crypto that will continue to be retold throughout this year. Until the court case against the firm from the US SEC is settled there will be a clear opportunity at hand. The SEC’s case against XRP stem from its contention that XRP was offered as a security and thus subject to SEC oversight. As time has gone on it has become apparent that the courts are leaning heavily in favor of XRP and parent company, Ripple. Current indications are that a verdict favoring Ripple could come soon, perhaps next month if not later in 2023. That news certainly suggests XRP prices could rise quickly in the near term. That makes it very undervalued given the overwhelming expectation that it will emerge victorious. The case, like most prominent court cases, harbors greater ramifications for the legal landscape. If XRP prevails that will send a massive positive signal rippling across all of crypto that the regulatory bodies won’t be able to control crypto as they hoped. VeChain (VET-USD)A concept token for VeChain (VET).Source: ShutterstockVeChain (VET-USD) is another cryptocurrency that is arguably undervalued. Unlike XRP, its future potential has little to do with regulators. Instead, VeChain is full of potential exactly because it is one of many cryptos attempting to solve the problem of traceability. VeChain assigns unique identifiers to products which are then tracked during each step during said products’ journey throughout the supply chain. The company has successfully proven that its technology increases efficiency and traceability of products. Therefore, it’s evident that VeChain can provide real world utility that leverages blockchain ledger technology to improve business outcomes. The other inherent application for VeChain is in transparency with all kinds of NGOs and nonprofits seeing real utility in humanitarian efforts like human trafficking, smuggling, and so on. But at the same time, the success of the company and VeChain is a question of adoption. VET currently trades for $0.02 indicating that there’s a lot more to be done. As long as the company continues to develop real logistics-based solutions the potential for growth remains clear. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Stocks To Invest In 2023 For Beginners.""One-and-Done Much More Likely, But Not Fully Baked In Just Yet""On April 21 Roger Ferguson, former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he talked about inflation, the Fed, and recession risks. Ferguson thinks that we are now in a ""one-and-done"" situation, which means that he expects the Fed to raise interest rates for the last time at the FOMC meeting in May. However, as inflation is still higher than the 2% target, Ferguson thinks that there may be a June hike as well. Here is what he said:""I think a one-and-done is most likely, but the uniformity and the fact that inflation is still relatively high, it may leave the possibility for a June hike on the table. I would say, one-and-done much more likely but not fully baked in just yet.""The market is pricing in Fed cuts in the back half of 2023. Roger Ferguson spoke about a discrepancy between the market's expectations and the Fed's expectations regarding interest rates in the latter part of 2023 and said that ""the market is more optimistic about Fed cuts than the Fed themselves"". However, economic data will be the determining factor for this as we move into the back half of 2023, noted Ferguson. According to Roger Ferguson, the Fed may keep interest rates elevated for longer than the market is expecting.Roger Ferguson noted that sectors that are sensitive to interest rates, such as housing, are already experiencing challenges and pressures from rising rates. Ferguson thinks the Fed will keep interest rates higher for longer than the market is expecting because, though the labor market is showing signs of weakening, ""it is still not soft"", and there are certain parts of the economy that are still strong which will in turn keep inflation higher than 2%. According to Ferguson, ""the Fed wants to really make sure that the disinflationary process is well advanced before it even starts talking about cutting rates"".Story continuesFinally, Roger Ferguson talked about the risk of recession. Ferguson does not expect a severe recession, rather, he expects a shallow recession and he sees ""some credit tightening in various places"" as opposed to a credit crunch. Here are some comments from Roger Ferguson:""A recession is more likely than not. I still think it's more likely to be a softer recession, as opposed to a hard one. But, the credit tightening that's certainly going on and being talked about in the Fed's Beige Book, does suggest that conditions are a little more fraught, and maybe a slightly harder recession. I'm not yet in the camp that says that we have a real credit crunch, I think we see some credit tightening in various places. Count me still in a sort of soft and shallow recession camp right now, but with the risk to the downside given the changing credit dynamics in the country.""The next FOMC meeting is nearby and a 89.1% of the market is pricing in a 25 basis point rate hike by the Fed, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool. In times like these, investors can feel overwhelmed and confused about what stocks to pick. For risk averse investors, sticking with mature businesses that have stable revenue growth can be an approach to consider.

One of the first electric vehicle hubs of its kind in the world, the Riverside project is a foundational step toward Sysco’s goal to reduce its direct emissions by 27.5% and add 2,800 electric trucks to its U.S. fleet by 2030.“This year’s theme for Earth Day is ‘invest in our planet’ and Sysco is doing just that.

(NASDAQ:SNPS) Imply Investors Are Overpaying?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-valuation-synopsys-inc-nasdaq-124637148.html,1682253997,STORY,['SNPS'],"[Key InsightsSynopsys' estimated fair value is US$308 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityCurrent share price of US$377 suggests Synopsys is potentially 23% overvalued Analyst price target for SNPS is US$425, which is 38% above our fair value estimateToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Synopsys The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.43bUS$1.87bUS$2.15bUS$2.27bUS$2.78bUS$3.04bUS$3.25bUS$3.44bUS$3.60bUS$3.73bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x7Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 9.39%Est @ 7.19%Est @ 5.66%Est @ 4.58%Est @ 3.83% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.0% US$1.3kUS$1.6kUS$1.7kUS$1.7kUS$1.9kUS$1.9kUS$1.9kUS$1.9kUS$1.8kUS$1.7k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$17bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.7b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.0%– 2.1%) = US$64bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$64b÷ ( 1 + 8.0%)10= US$30bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$47b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$377, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Synopsys as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.003. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for SynopsysStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Software industry.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.ThreatRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a premium to intrinsic value?

(NYSE:GS) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 29th of June to $2.50. This makes the dividend yield about the same as the industry average at 2.9%. View our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group Goldman Sachs Group's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsUnless the payments are sustainable, the dividend yield doesn't mean too much. Before making this announcement, Goldman Sachs Group was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 43.4%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 30%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendGoldman Sachs Group Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $1.84 total annually to $10.00. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 18% a year over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Goldman Sachs Group has impressed us by growing EPS at 22% per year over the past five years. Earnings per share is growing at a solid clip, and the payout ratio is low which we think is an ideal combination in a dividend stock as the company can quite easily raise the dividend in the future.Goldman Sachs Group Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one.

To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Mattel, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAT).Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Mattel How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Mattel is:19% = US$394m ÷ US$2.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.19 in profit.Does Mattel Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Mattel has a lower ROE than the average (25%) in the Leisure industry classification.roeThat's not what we like to see. However, a low ROE is not always bad. If the company's debt levels are moderate to low, then there's still a chance that returns can be improved via the use of financial leverage. A high debt company having a low ROE is a different story altogether and a risky investment in our books. To know the 2 risks we have identified for Mattel visit our risks dashboard for free.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesMattel's Debt And Its 19% ROEIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Mattel, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.13. There's no doubt its ROE is decent, but the very high debt the company carries is not too exciting to see. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.ConclusionReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.Have feedback on this article?

40,610d747d-ae8f-328c-8974-cca704078148,AIG,2023-04-24,7 Low-PE Ratio Blue-Chip Stocks Offering Both Quality and Value,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-low-pe-ratio-blue-233255691.html,1681947175,STORY,"['AIG', 'NTR', 'BNTX', 'LH', 'MT', 'DD']","[While the concept of acquiring low-PE ratio blue-chip stocks (that is, industry-leading stalwarts that feature low price-earnings ratios relative to their sectors) appeals on paper, investors need to be cautious. You can’t just buy companies based on any one single metric. In addition, sometimes a very cheap PE can actually signal significant fundamental problems.Instead, investors will want to consider blue-chip stocks with value – and by that, I’m talking about substantive value. Rather than targeting cheap securities because they’re cheap, you should consider good enterprises that happened to fall under bad circumstances. Over time, the cream should rise to the top. On that note, below are seven low-PE ratio blue-chip stocks that genuinely represent great deals.MTArcelorMittal$29.47DDDuPont$71.21NTRNutrien$73.15LHLaboratory Corp. of America$231.29AIGAmerican International Group$53.17BNTXBioNTech$121.79GMGeneral MotorsInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsArcelorMittal (MT)a bull next to a stack of blue gambling chips to represent blue-chip stocksSource: ShutterstockA Luxembourgish multinational steel manufacturing corporation, ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT) might seem a risky idea low-PE ratio blue-chip stocks. After all, the steel industry tends to align with broader economic trends. However, if the economy struggles, MT might incur significant damage in the charts. Nevertheless, for those who want to live a bit dangerously, ArcelorMittal presents an intriguing framework.Financially, MT earns its place among blue-chip stocks with value because of its attractive quantitative ratios. First, the market prices MT at a trailing multiple of 3.03. As a discount to earnings, ArcelorMittal ranks better than 90% of its peers. Additionally, MT trades at 0.48-times tangible book value. In contrast, the sector median comes out to a loftier 1.03 times.However, these aren’t just “beauty” stats. Fundamentally, ArcelorMittal commands a return on equity (ROE) of 17.72%, ranking better than 74.19% and reflecting a high-quality enterprise. Also, the steel company benefits from solid strengths in the balance sheet, particularly a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.8 (above 66% of competitors).Story continuesFinally, analysts peg MT as a strong buy with a $35.84 average price target, implying over 19% upside potential.DuPont (DD)A close-up shot of a blue casino chip on red carpet.Source: ShutterstockA multinational chemical company, DuPont (NYSE:DD) delivers everyday industrial relevance to the table. Presently, the company commands a market capitalization of nearly $33 billion, partially qualifying it as one of the low-PE ratio blue-chip stocks. Since the beginning of this year, DD gained 4% of equity value. In the trailing one-year period, it’s up over 3%.Moving to the heart of the matter, DD definitely qualifies as one of the blue-chip stocks with low valuations thanks to its enticing multiples. Mainly, the market prices DD at a trailing multiple of 6.01. As a discount to earnings, DuPont ranks better than 90.45% of its peers. In addition, DD trades at 1.24-times book value. For context, the underlying sector median is 1.75 times.Even better, DuPont operates an extremely high-quality enterprise, evidenced by its ROE of 22.64%. This stat ranks higher than 84.38% of competitors listed in the chemicals industry. Lastly, analysts peg DD as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $86, implying 20% upside potential.Nutrien (NTR)blue chip definition highlightedSource: ShutterstockAnother infrastructurally relevant name among low-PE ratio blue-chip stocks, Nutrien (NYSE:NTR) is the largest producer of potash and the third largest producer of nitrogen fertilizer in the world. At the moment, Nutrien carries a market cap of 49.58 billion CAD (about $37 billion). Since the Jan. opener, NTR gained a bit over 3% of its equity value. However, in the trailing year, it’s down almost 35%.Despite the sharp loss, NTR attracts speculators as one of the blue-chip stocks with low valuations. Specifically, the market prices NTR at a trailing multiple of 5.25. As a discount to earnings, Nutrien ranks better than nearly 83% of companies listed in the agriculture industry. Also, NTR trades at 1.43-times book value. That’s noticeably below the sector median value of 1.85 times.Moreover, Nutrien runs a very high-quality enterprise as evidenced by its stratospheric ROE of 30.17%. Also, the company’s return on asset (ROA) pings at a lofty 14.31%. Closing out, analysts peg NTR as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $90.88, implying 23% upside potential.Laboratory Corp. of America (LH)a pile of blue chips on top of a newspaperSource: ShutterstockMore commonly known as LabCorp, Laboratory Corp. of America (NYSE:LH) is healthcare company headquartered in Burlington, North Carolina. Per its public profile, LabCorp operates one of the largest clinical laboratory networks in the world. Currently, the company features a market cap of over $20 billion. Sitting among the low-PE ratio blue-chip stocks, that status stems in part from LH’s loss of 15% in the trailing year.Still, despite the red ink, investors should look at the positive aspect. Right now, the market prices LH at a forward multiple of 13.32. As a discount to projected earnings, Labcorp ranks better than 63.3% of firms listed in the medical diagnostics and research sector. Notably, LH trades at 1.43-times sales, lower than about 70% of its peers. Thus, it’s easily one of the blue-chip stocks with value.Let’s not forget that Labcorp runs a quality enterprise, resulting in an ROE of 12.4%. Also, its ROA pings at 6.3%. Both stats rank better than at least 68% of the competition. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg LH as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target hits $286.30, implying over 24% upside potential.American International Group (AIG)Source: ShutterstockA multinational finance and insurance corporation, American International Group (NYSE:AIG) operates in more than 80 countries and jurisdictions. It runs three core businesses: general insurance, life and retirement and a standalone technology-enabled subsidiary, per its public profile. Currently, AIG features a market cap of $38.5 billion. However, circumstances haven’t been so auspicious recently, with AIG losing almost 18% in the trailing year.Nevertheless, AIG makes noise as one of the low-PE ratio blue-chip stocks. At present, the market prices AIG stock at a forward multiple of 8.36. As a discount to projected earnings, the insurance specialist ranks better than 68.12% of the competition. Also, AIG trades at 1.08-times tangible book value. In contrast, the sector median stat is 1.37 times. Thus, it holistically ranks among the blue-chip stocks with low valuations.As well, AIG features a strong ROA of 1.86% and a blistering ROE of nearly 21%, indicating a high-quality enterprise. Looking to the Street, analysts peg AIG as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target comes out to $66.92, implying almost 28% upside potential.BioNTech (BNTX)10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Grow UpSource: ShutterstockA biotechnology firm that rose to prominence for undergirding the race to find a Covid-19 vaccine, BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) subsequently became one of the low-PE ratio blue-chip stocks. Part of the status upgrade (or is that downgrade?) centers on the pandemic. With people no longer scared of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, BioNTech lost some of its edge. Conspicuously, shares stumbled nearly 23% in the trailing one-year period.Nevertheless, contrarians might want to consider picking up BNTX. First, it sits among the blue-chip stocks with value based on key financial ratios. First, BNTX trades at a trailing multiple of 3.14. As a discount to earnings, BioNTech ranks better than 94% of its peers. Also, BNTX trades at 1.43-times tangible book. Here, the stat falls well below the sector median of 2.62 times.Also, on a scientific level, the high-quality biotech (which sports an ROE of 56.83%) can leverage its Covid-19 acumen to develop other critical therapeutics and vaccines. So, it’s one of the blue-chip stocks with low valuations you shouldn’t ignore. Finally, analysts peg BNTX as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $172.30, implying nearly 40% upside potential.General Motors (GM)Source: ShutterstockA leading automotive brand, General Motors (NYSE:GM) commands extraordinary relevance. Further, its aggressive pivot to electric vehicles makes it a compelling long-term idea. Despite the traction that the new-look GM generates, shares remain one of the low-PE ratio blue-chip stocks. In the trailing one-year period, GM stumbled 16%. Still, it might not be seeing red for long.With electrification of mobility gaining ground, more people may find comfort in GM. For now, shares trade at a forward multiple of 5.62. As a discount to projected earnings, the automaker ranks better than 90.17% of the competition. Also, GM trades at 0.79-times tangible book value. In contrast, the sector median stat comes out to 1.61 times.Featuring a high-quality enterprise with an ROE of 15.58%, GM also enjoys a profitable business. In particular, its net margin is 6.34%, outpacing 72.2% of sector players. Lastly, analysts peg GM as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $51.67, implying over 46% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at Hologic (NASDAQ:HOLX) so let's look a bit deeper.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Hologic is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.15 = US$1.3b ÷ (US$9.3b - US$956m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Therefore, Hologic has an ROCE of 15%. On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 9.9% generated by the Medical Equipment industry. View our latest analysis for Hologic roceIn the above chart we have measured Hologic's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Hologic here  for free.What Can We Tell From Hologic's ROCE Trend?The trends we've noticed at Hologic are quite reassuring. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 15%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 24% more capital is being employed now too. The increasing returns on a growing amount of capital is common amongst multi-baggers and that's why we're impressed.What We Can Learn From Hologic's ROCEIn summary, it's great to see that Hologic can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. And a remarkable 114% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.Story continuesBefore jumping to any conclusions though, we need to know what value we're getting for the current share price.

Netflix and Taiwan Semiconductor, a key Apple supplier, issued guidance warnings too.There were more layoffs at Meta and Clorox, with reports of planned job cuts at Disney.Tesla reported a quarterly gross margin miss on recent price cuts.The bottom line is that there is an ongoing negative shift in economic data, likely as interest rate hikes take further hold in the economy.

Check if analysts think Amgen will grow revenue in the future.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Amgen's TSR for the last 5 years was 59%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Amgen has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 0.5% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. However, that falls short of the 10% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

This notion saw gold lose the $2,000 mark, while the dollar strengthened.Spot gold was flat at $1,983.94 an ounce, while gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,993.95 an ounce by 20:48 ET (00:48 GMT). Both instruments lost over 1% in the prior week.Gold’s two-week decline comes shortly after the yellow metal surged to near record highs, driven largely by increased safe haven demand as markets feared a potential banking crisis and a recession this year.Fears of a recession, especially as U.S. interest rates rise further, are expected to provide some support to the yellow metal, given its safe haven status.Fed Fund futures prices show that markets are pricing in a nearly 90% chance that the Fed will hike rates by 25 basis points (bps) when it meets next week. While the central bank is then expected to signal a pause in June, markets are pricing in a small but growing possibility of another 25 bps hike in June.Several Fed speakers recently signaled that interest rates will rise further, given that U.S. inflation is still trending well above the central bank’s target range.

The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for General Dynamics Step By Step Through The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.71bUS$4.11bUS$4.30bUS$4.58bUS$4.74bUS$4.87bUS$5.00bUS$5.12bUS$5.24bUS$5.35bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x9Analyst x7Analyst x3Analyst x2Est @ 2.77%Est @ 2.56%Est @ 2.41%Est @ 2.31%Est @ 2.24% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.2% US$3.5kUS$3.6kUS$3.5kUS$3.5kUS$3.3kUS$3.2kUS$3.1kUS$2.9kUS$2.8kUS$2.7k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$32bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.4b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.2%– 2.1%) = US$106bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$106b÷ ( 1 + 7.2%)10= US$53bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$85b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$225, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 27% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at General Dynamics as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.867. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for General DynamicsStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Aerospace &amp; Defense market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

(NYSE:NRG) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 15th of May to $0.3775. This makes the dividend yield 4.4%, which is above the industry average. Check out our latest analysis for NRG Energy NRG Energy's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. NRG Energy is quite easily earning enough to cover the dividend, however it is being let down by weak cash flows. In general, we consider cash flow to be more important than earnings, so we would be cautious about relying on the sustainability of this dividend.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 31.0% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 29% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendNRG Energy Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.36 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $1.51. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 15% a year over that time. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. We are encouraged to see that NRG Energy has grown earnings per share at 37% per year over the past five years. Earnings per share is growing at a solid clip, and the payout ratio is low which we think is an ideal combination in a dividend stock as the company can quite easily raise the dividend in the future.In SummaryIn summary, while it's always good to see the dividend being raised, we don't think NRG Energy's payments are rock solid. While NRG Energy is earning enough to cover the payments, the cash flows are lacking. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Thus, you can purchase Bank of New York Mellon's shares before the 27th of April in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 11th of May.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.37 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$1.48 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Bank of New York Mellon has a trailing yield of approximately 3.4% on its current stock price of $44.05. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to investigate whether Bank of New York Mellon can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. See our latest analysis for Bank of New York Mellon Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Fortunately Bank of New York Mellon's payout ratio is modest, at just 46% of profit.Companies that pay out less in dividends than they earn in profits generally have more sustainable dividends. The lower the payout ratio, the more wiggle room the business has before it could be forced to cut the dividend.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with falling earnings are riskier for dividend shareholders. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. So we're not too excited that Bank of New York Mellon's earnings are down 2.8% a year over the past five years.Story continuesMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Bank of New York Mellon has delivered 11% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years.To Sum It UpShould investors buy Bank of New York Mellon for the upcoming dividend? Earnings per share have shrunk noticeably in recent years, although we like that the company has a low payout ratio. This could suggest a cut to the dividend may not be a major risk in the near future. At best we would put it on a watch-list to see if business conditions improve, as it doesn't look like a clear opportunity right now.Wondering what the future holds for Bank of New York Mellon?

This notion saw gold lose the $2,000 mark, while the dollar strengthened.Spot gold was flat at $1,983.94 an ounce, while gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,993.95 an ounce by 20:48 ET (00:48 GMT). Both instruments lost over 1% in the prior week.Gold’s two-week decline comes shortly after the yellow metal surged to near record highs, driven largely by increased safe haven demand as markets feared a potential banking crisis and a recession this year.Fears of a recession, especially as U.S. interest rates rise further, are expected to provide some support to the yellow metal, given its safe haven status.Fed Fund futures prices show that markets are pricing in a nearly 90% chance that the Fed will hike rates by 25 basis points (bps) when it meets next week. While the central bank is then expected to signal a pause in June, markets are pricing in a small but growing possibility of another 25 bps hike in June.Several Fed speakers recently signaled that interest rates will rise further, given that U.S. inflation is still trending well above the central bank’s target range. Rate hike decisions from other major central banks are also due next, including the European Central Bank and the Reserve Bank of Australia.Any tightening in global monetary conditions heralds more pressure on gold.Other precious metals were mixed on Monday, with platinum futures down 0.8%, while silver futures rose 0.3%.Story continuesAmong industrial metals, copper futures fell slightly, extending steep losses from the past week as fears of slowing industrial activity weighed heavily.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like QUALCOMM (NASDAQ:QCOM). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. See our latest analysis for QUALCOMM How Fast Is QUALCOMM Growing?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. To the delight of shareholders, QUALCOMM has achieved impressive annual EPS growth of 44%, compound, over the last three years. That sort of growth rarely ever lasts long, but it is well worth paying attention to when it happens.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. QUALCOMM shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 31% to 34%, and revenue is growing. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for QUALCOMM's future profits.Story continuesAre QUALCOMM Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$131b company like QUALCOMM. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$159m. This comes in at 0.1% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.It's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to QUALCOMM, with market caps over US$8.0b, is around US$13m.The QUALCOMM CEO received total compensation of just US$4.8m in the year to September 2022. That's clearly well below average, so at a glance that arrangement seems generous to shareholders and points to a modest remuneration culture. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.Should You Add QUALCOMM To Your Watchlist?QUALCOMM's earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. An added bonus for those interested is that management hold a heap of stock and the CEO pay is quite reasonable, illustrating good cash management. The strong EPS improvement suggests the businesses is humming along. Big growth can make big winners, so the writing on the wall tells us that QUALCOMM is worth considering carefully. You still need to take note of risks, for example - QUALCOMM has   2 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

The gradual improvement of the leading tech index strongly suggests investors are again confident in the tech sector overall. Tech sector confidence is largely a function of prevailing interest rates. Lower rates favor tech companies which assume substantial risk and pursue growth-first strategies. Higher rates make borrowing more expensive and consequently rescue the overall appetite for such risk. The Fed is significantly slowing rate hikes, if not pausing them outright. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe best tech stocks to buy should get a further boost following a convincing performance this year. There are several obvious and not so obvious choices in that category worth buying.PIImpinj $8.15NVDANvidia $271.04QCOMQualcomm $118.64Impinj (PI)A man examines a digital screen with different icons for software.Source: ShutterstockImpinj (NASDAQ:PI) probably isn’t a name many investors immediately think of when considering the best tech stocks to buy. But the provider of RFID technology to companies that have significant commercial application. RFID stands for radio frequency identification and allows everyday objects to be identified and organized extremely quickly. Impinj’s RAIN RFID technology allows up to 1,000 objects per second to be identified and has clear logistics applicability. Technology that can connect objects to the digital world also has internet of things applications. IoT is a focus area for growth of companies and businesses everywhere. That makes Impinj highly relevant, which is reflected in its rapid growth. Impinj sales increased nearly 50% in Q4 and its net loss shrunk from $20 million to $118,000 YoY.   Coming quarter sales should grow to between $82 million and $85 million. Impinj is establishing a name in the burgeoning IoT space while growing quickly and approaching net gains. The combination of those factors makes it among the more intriguing tech stocks to buy.Story continuesNvidia (NVDA)Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock.Source: ShutterstockNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) isn’t very far away from the average target stock price of $278 assigned by analysts. Trading above $270, it’s nearly fully sold. When a stock is close to being fully sold, that’s a time to avoid it. More investors will question valuations, and any influx of investor capital will slow.But that will not happen with Nvidia even as its market capitalization rises to levels before Fed rate hikes began. Investor interest is instead likely to continue to rise. Let’s put some numbers to that idea. Nvidia carried a market cap of $823 billion when it became apparent that the Fed would raise rates. It’s now around $660 billion. Could it test those former highs again?I think so, and Nvidia’s AI position is the reason. Demand for Nvidia’s H100 gpu is extremely high, with units going for more than $45,000 on eBay. The chips are integral to AI software deployments, making Nvidia extremely relevant. It is certainly possible that Nvidia’s market cap blows past $823 billion, given that AI wasn’t part of the equation when it was that high. Qualcomm (QCOM)Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on the side of a building in San Jose, CA.Source: jejim / Shutterstock.comQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) looks like a strong bet among tech stocks currently for a very simple reason: Powerful institutional investors favor the company and its shares. Qualcomm sells integrated circuit products used in mobile applications primarily and also licenses its intellectual property. The company grew in 2022 by 19.2% as measured by revenues which totaled $42.96 billion. But 2023 isn’t expected to result in growth for Qualcomm. Wall Street expects the company to shrink by a few billion dollars on the top line. Wall Street expects Qualcomm to grow slightly between 2022 and 2024 with $43 billion in sales. Why then should investors consider QCOM stock? The reason is institutional power. Institutional investors own 75% of QCOM shares. The top 25 shareholders control 44% of shares overall. Those owners are the same people who head the analyst ratings agencies that assign target prices to Qualcomm. Those analysts have pegged Qualcomm’s target price at $152, well above its current price of $120. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

For more on this, go to the 5 Strongest Militaries in Europe. The EU's military spending stood at a paltry 1.3% in 2014. The increased spending in the following years was motivated by two factors: The Russian takeover of Crimea and the then US President Trump’s demands from EU countries to contribute more to NATO. The EU’s military spending consistently increased over the following years, and aggregated at 32% in real terms in 2021. In the wake of the full-scale Russian military assault on Ukraine that began in 2022, the military spending in Europe is only expected to pick up pace. Many European countries are also aggressively arming Ukraine in order to aid its military resistance against Russia. Germany is highly important in this respect. The country is heavily industrialized, and its defense industry is crucial to re-arming Europe. A military fund worth more than $100 billion that was announced in February of last year in reaction to the Ukrainian invasion was approved by the German lower house parliament in June of 2022. The fund is intended to supplement Germany's normal defense budget over the following few years in order to aid in the military's reconstruction.Germany would become the third-largest military spender behind the US and China since the fund should allow it to reach NATO's 2% defense spending target, given its GDP size.European and even some US defense companies are already poised to reap great benefits from the ongoing arms procurement. According to reports, the German Rheinmetall AG plans to increase tank output from 40,000 to 240,000 units annually. Germany, France, Spain, and Italy also signed contracts for the Eurodrone initiative in 2022, in an effort to lessen Europe's reliance on Israeli drones. OCCAR granted these contracts to the French company; Airbus SE. In this regard, General Electric Company (NYSE:GE)-owned Avivo Aero was selected by Airbus SE to design and produce the drone's engine. Story continuesOther US defense companies, such as Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), are also expanding European defense capabilities, in addition to General Electric Company (NYSE:GE). 20 Strongest Militaries in EuropeBPTU/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyWe have defined militarily strong European countries as ones that have advanced strategic military assets, and logistical and financial capability. The last metric is important since financial capacity directly determines defense capability.For this purpose, we have first identified the top 20 European countries on the Global Firepower Index of 2023 and ranked them amongst themselves. Then, we used the 2021 GDPs of these countries to rank them separately amongst themselves as well. Then we've averaged out the rankings on the two indexes for our list. We used countries’ ranking amongst themselves on Global Firepower Index to tiebreak countries with the same averaged-out rankings. The information for countries' military assets also comes from the Global Firepower Index of 2023. For militarily strategic countries, we’ve also brought into discussion their cyberwarfare capabilities, for which, we consulted with the Belfer Center’s National Cyber Power Index of 2022. We also discussed some countries’ number of military bases around the world and space capabilities for military purposes. In that order, we’ve sourced data from The Power Atlas by the European Council on Foreign Relations. Here are the 20 strongest militaries in Europe: 20. BelgiumGlobal Firepower Index Ranking: 25 GDP Ranking: 12 Average Ranking: 18.5Belgium is one of the biggest economies in Europe, having a GDP of $0.6 trillion as of 2021, which allows the country to invest significantly in its military capability. Its military globally ranks 66th on the Global Firepower Index of 2023. The country’s navy operates two frigates, two patrol vessels and five vessels for mine warfare vessels. Its air force is significantly stronger, operating 106 aircraft, including 44 fighters.19. FinlandGlobal Firepower Index Ranking: 19 GDP Ranking: 15 Average Ranking: 17Finland has one of the most advanced air forces in Europe, owing to its aircraft inventory consisting of F/A-18s and F35s, with the latter developed by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT). The country’s navy operates 18 mine warfare vessels and two patrol vessels. In terms of army assets, Finland boasts 239 tanks. 18. Czech RepublicGlobal Firepower Index Ranking: 17 GDP Ranking: 16 Average Ranking: 16.5The Czech Republic has one of the most powerful militaries in Europe, which is, to a large extent, armed by the country’s domestic defense industry, which comprises companies like Česká Zbrojovka (CZ), Aero Vodochody and Tatra. 17. RomaniaGlobal Firepower Index Ranking: 16 GDP Ranking: 17 Average Ranking: 16.5Romania spent 2% of it on its defense in 2021. Being a member of NATO, Romania is also further modernizing its military. As of 2023, its military operates 45 naval assets, including 18 vessels, 413 tanks and 146 aircraft, including 30 fighters.16. DenmarkGlobal Firepower Index Ranking: 18 GDP Ranking: 14 Average Ranking: 16Denmark is a Scandinavian country. The country has 115 aircraft in its inventory, with four F-35s and 33 F-16s. Denmark is home to domestic defense companies like Danish Aerotech A/S, and also hosts US defense companies like Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) and General Electric Company (NYSE:GE). The country's military has had numerous contracts with General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) for Armored Personnel Carriers (APCs).The Danish military operates 74 naval assets, including 24 vessels, 44 tanks and 115 aircraft, which comprise 33 fighter jets. 15. PortugalGlobal Firepower Index Ranking: 14 GDP Ranking: 18 Average Ranking: 16In 2021, defense expenditures were 2.2% of Portugal’s GDP of $254 billion.

(NYSE:WEC) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 1st of June to $0.78. The payment will take the dividend yield to 3.2%, which is in line with the average for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for WEC Energy Group WEC Energy Group's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWe like a dividend to be consistent over the long term, so checking whether it is sustainable is important. Based on the last payment, WEC Energy Group's earnings were much higher than the dividend, but it wasn't converting those earnings into cash flow. Since a dividend means the company is paying out cash to investors, this could prove to be a problem in the future.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 17.8% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 61% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendWEC Energy Group Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.20 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $3.12. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 10% per annum over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.The Dividend's Growth Prospects Are LimitedSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Earnings have grown at around 3.2% a year for the past five years, which isn't massive but still better than seeing them shrink. WEC Energy Group is struggling to find viable investments, so it is returning more to shareholders. This isn't bad in itself, but unless earnings growth pick up we wouldn't expect dividends to grow either.Story continuesIn SummaryOverall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think WEC Energy Group will make a great income stock. While WEC Energy Group is earning enough to cover the payments, the cash flows are lacking. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. To that end, WEC Energy Group has 2 warning signs (and 1 which is significant) we think you should know about. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

For example, StockRover is a screening service that scores stocks on three key metrics. One, growth scores are based on five year historical growth, compared to forward EBITDA estimates. Two, quality scores depend on profitability and a healthy balance sheet. Three, value scores are based on the usual price-to-earnings multiple and earnings per share predictability. Quant scores offer investors a numerical characterization of a stock.Conversely, investors should still consider companies with modest growth scores as a buy. They offer a well-balanced investment with strong value or quality. In addition, investors need to dig further to discover a company’s business growth prospects. Markets likely discovered firms that have a high growth score and lower value score. They are willing to pay a premium for the growth ahead. Conversely, companies that are not showing growth require a catalyst to unlock their profit expansion.BIPBrookfield Infrastructure$35.38CAGConagra$37.35CCICrown Castle$133.55GILDGilead Sciences$84.11JPMJPMorgan$141.22WPCWP Carey$72.40WSOWatsco$316.58InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsGrowth Stocks to Buy: Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (BIP)Stacks of coins with trading graph, quantitative finance investment conceptSource: Tendo / ShutterstockBrookfield Infrastructure Partners (NYSE:BIP) is a highly attractive growth stock to buy after bidding $13.3 billion to buy Triton International (NYSE:TRTN), the world’s largest intermodal container leasing company.Triton’s CEO, Brian Sondey, said that BIP has significant resources and long-term time horizon to fuel Triton’s business growth. In addition, BIP’s CEO, Sam Pollock, liked Triton’s business, supported by contracts, stable cash flow, strong margins, and a history of creating value.I should also note that Brookfield increased its dividend by 6.3% to $0.3825 a share quarterly. In fiscal 2022, the company reported funds from operations of $2.1 billion, up by 20% from the previous year. It owes its strong financial and operating growth to global volume growth for critical infrastructure networks.Story continuesConagra Brands (CAG)A businessman's hand arranging wooden cube blocks to represent growth stocks.Source: 3rdtimeluckystudio / ShutterstockConagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) reported diluted earnings per share increasing by 57.8% to 70 cents. In 2023, it expects organic net sales growth of up to 7.5% Y/Y. EPS will grow by between 14% to 17%.Conagra is among the growth stocks to buy for its product catalyst. Frozen and snack foods are the basis of its strong performance. The business recovery will accelerate as management invests in brand-building support and ongoing product innovation.Conagra enjoys resilience from inflation. It may increase prices to match inflation without hurting demand. The company reported consistent demand elasticity over the last eight quarters. Once inflation rates slow, Conagra will slow its pace of price hikes. This should strengthen demand and expand its profit margin.Crown Castle (CCI)A businessman holding a coin with a tree that grows and a tree that grows on a pile of money representing growth stocksSource: MEE KO DONG / ShutterstockCrown Castle (NYSE:CCI) is a REIT in the shared communications infrastructure sector, with a strong quality score. The tower business grew at 6.5% in 2022. This will grow from 5% to 6% in 2023. Crown Castle’s big wireless carriers need to compete on network quality. They will commit to heavy investments to strengthen the network. This could push CCI’s growth to at least 6.5% in the years ahead.CCI stock suits income investors since the company has a goal of growing the dividend from 7% to 8% annually. However, from 2024 to 2025, dividend growth will slow to adjust for higher interest rates. In addition, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint merging will increase churn and lower revenue. After that disruption, Crown Castle’s growth will resume.In the second half of this year, the company will update investors with a stronger outlook. It may rely on predictable, long-term agreements with its major customers.Gilead Sciences (GILD)A hand reaches up on a red ladder pointing to the sky.Source: ShutterstockGilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) has a strong commitment to improving the health of people and communities worldwide. By developing drugs to treat more challenging diseases, Gilead is poised to accelerate its growth.In 2022, sales of Biktarvy, which treats HIV-1, grew by 20% to $10.4 billion. In 2023, the business will grow by between 4% to 6%. The U.S. approved Sunlenca (Lenacapavir), an antiretroviral medication used to treat HIV/AIDS. This is for patients who have multi-drug-resistant HIV infection. In the quarters ahead, Gilead will partner with the HIV community to increase Sunlenca awareness. This will accelerate the drug’s sales growth.Gilead has a strong product pipeline. It will meet key milestones in 2023, which should drive GILD stock prices higher. For example, it will post data readouts for products in the oncology and neurology units. Investors enjoy a diversified pipeline, supported by 59 clinical programs.JPMorgan Chase (JPM)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comJPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) has strong value to offset its near-term slow growth. After forecasting sharply higher net interest income for the year, JPM stock will rise along with its growth grade.In the fiscal first quarter of 2023, JPMorgan posted revenue growing by 24.8% Y/Y to $38.3 billion. It booked $20.7 billion in net interest income. The more deposits it attracts, the higher the NII. For the full year, FY2023 NII of $81 billion is sharply above the approximately $74 billion previous target.Credit card spending, automotive loans, and private banking advisory growth will increase the bank’s profits this year. CEO Jamie Dimon expects bank headwinds related to the Federal Reserve interest rate tightening. It does not expect a credit crunch that would devastate the banking system. However, the firm is ready for recessionary conditions.JPMorgan may grow its market share by leveraging the strength of its capital and liquidity. It will issue loans without undermining its strong underwriting standards.WP Carey (WPC)An image of three yellow arrows on a red background.Source: smshoot/ShutterStock.comWP Carey (NYSE:WPC) is a REIT. It will fuel its growth by focusing on its core geographies. It has investing experience in Europe that began in 1998.Other REITs are suffering from cap rate pressures related to weak economic conditions. W.P. Carey is taking advantage of the weak market conditions through acquisitions, sale-leasebacks, or dictating favorable pricing terms. It has a competitive advantage in sale-leasebacks, helped by its experienced advisors. In addition, companies are focused more on execution than on price.CEO Jason Fox said that WPC has some pricing power to maximize returns. It developed relationships and has a history of executing successfully its business plan. WPC has a cap rate target in the 5% to 7% range. Its target range is 6.5% to 7.0% for acquisitions. Expect the company to announce deals that boost the bottom line. Among the REITs, WPC is one of the best growth stocks to buy.Watsco (WSO)trainSource: ShutterstockWatsco (NYSE:WSO) is a distributor of air conditioning, heating, and refrigeration equipment. The highly profitable firm offers investors top dividends. UBS included the company as one of the firms that are relative winners in a recessionary environment.Watsco is working collaboratively with its OEM partners to develop its growth initiatives. In addition, it is investing in technology to widen its advantage. Technologies that increase the company’s engagement with customers will lower attrition. As a result, Watsco will sustain long-term market share gains.Watsco may count on heat pump growth to increase revenue. In the last quarter, the duct-free split market grew by a double-digit percentage. Its partnership with OnCall Air will give Watsco a presence in the online sales channel. This competitive edge will expand its profits.Ductless split systems are another growth opportunity. Homes that need ductwork may count on Watsco.

The same can be downloaded here. In the first quarter, the fund underperformed and was down 2.33% compared to the Midcap 400 Index’s 3.81% and the S&amp;P 500 Index’s 7.49% returns.

The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) has a market capitalization of $14.629 billion.White Brook Capital made the following comment about The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:""The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS): Despite favorable midterm fertilizer dynamics, Mosaic (MOS) performed worse than expected during the quarter. Significantly, the Company began to rally in the last days of the quarter after it preannounced production at the low end of the guidance for the first quarter when market fears were for an even worse outcome.  Given March weather, particularly in the northern United States, where a significant snow pack continued to cover farmland (as of the first days of April), I expect their 1stquarter earnings call will speak to significant second-quarter demand, particularly as the weather was more favorable for fertilizer usage in early April. Prices during the second week of April for fertilizers broadly also have begun to lessen their decline despite a continued rapid decline in other feedstock commodities.The stock has been driven by concern about destroyed 2023 demand that I believe, given the state of the world’s depleted fields, issues that demand can no longer be destroyed, only delayed, and even that may not be necessary given the rapid improvement of the US’s northern grain basket and the solid fundamentals in Brazil.  The Company continues to trade for a very cheap valuation even though it generates strong free cash flow, returns that cash flow to shareholders, and is under levered.

It was the most-watched media libel case in decades.Fox had about $4 billion of cash on hand as of December 2022, and MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman expects the company to pay the settlement during the current quarter.How much the lawsuit will actually end up costing Fox is unclear because there are ways it can defray some of the expense, primarily through insurance and the use of tax deductions.Fox can deduct the Dominion settlement from its income taxes as an expense necessary for the cost of doing business. Fox Chief Communications Officer Brian Nick has confirmed the deductibility of the settlement.Big companies often deduct large settlements to help offset some of the cost, but since settlement amounts are usually confidential, it's difficult to pin down exactly how much they benefit. Payments that are seen as restitution or compensation can be deducted, while payments made to the government or at the direction of a government are usually not deductible.Robert Willens, a tax professor at the Columbia University School of Business, estimates that after the tax write-off, Fox will incur about three-fourths of the settlement amount, about $590 million.“The key is that if the payments are being made to private parties and not at the behest of the government then you can pretty much conclude without any fear of contradiction that the payment will be deductible,"" he said.A study by the Government Accountability Office in 2005 found that of 34 settlements totaling over $1 billion, 20 companies reported deducting some portion or all of their settlement payments. Big banks such as Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase reportedly also deducted portions of their settlements of charges tied the financial crisis of 2008.Story continuesAlso, if Fox is insured, insurance is likely to cover some of the settlement. Chad Milton, a partner at Media Risk Consultants, said a large media company such as Fox could have anywhere between $100 million to $500 million in coverage, including media liability insurance and other types of insurance.“It’s not hard to stack up $100 million but as you go higher than that, it gets harder and harder,” Milton said.Usually, there’s a certain amount a media company has to pay, which could be in the millions, before insurance kicks in. However, the deductible incudes attorney fees, which in a high-profile case like Fox-Dominion could be tens of millions of dollars or higher, so the deductible could be swallowed up just by attorney fees.One wrinkle: even if an insurance company pays a substantial part of the settlement, there could be an annual aggregate limit of liability, which could mean that insurers wouldn’t cover another big-money settlement.And media companies and insurers don’t always agree on who should cover what, since there are caveats written into contracts that allow insurers to avoid paying under certain circumstances. In 2017, Disney settled a defamation suit that was filed in 2012 after ABC aired a segment that questioned the safety of a meat producer’s products that critics dubbed “pink slime.” But one of its insurers, AIG, ended up suing Disney so it wouldn’t have to pay part of the settlement, although AIG eventually lost.Fox has also said it doesn’t expect the settlement to affect its operations.“We don’t expect significant operational effects or changes to our business given our cash flow, strong balance sheet and the health of our business,” the company said in a statement after the settlement was announced.MoffettNathanson's Fishman said everything indicates the company will be able to run its business as usual.“It isn’t clear there has been much, if any, impact of these lawsuits on Fox News’ viewership and business,” he said.Fishman said he doesn’t expect the settlement to hamper Fox’s ability to return money to shareholders, including a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program announced in February.Fox has a similar lawsuit looming with another voting machine company, Smartmatic, but no date has been set and the case might not go to court for a couple of years.__An earlier version of this story said Disney settled a defamation suit in 2012 after ABC aired a segment that questioned the safety of a meat producer’s products. The settlement of the suit was announced in 2017.]"

As well, a select few large-capitalization companies may be too undervalued and beaten down for their own good. Therefore, speculators may enjoy significant upside.To generate this list, I turned to the investment resource Gurufocus, specifically its screener function. Here, I filtered out the best blue-chip stocks to buy for quality and predictability. As well, I’ve incorporated analyst ratings provided by TipRanks so you know what the experts think. So, without any more delay, let’s take a deeper look at the “greatest” blue-chip stocks list.RACEFerrari$275.22AAPLApple$167.72SHWSherwin-Williams$234.83REGNRegeneron$803.62NFLXNetflix$329.59UNHUnitedHealth$489.56PYPLPayPal$74.32InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFerrari (RACE)a bull next to a stack of blue gambling chips to represent blue-chip stocksSource: ShutterstockWhile exotic car manufacturer Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) might seem an odd idea for the best blue-chip stocks to buy, in my view, it makes perfect sense. First, it’s a world-recognized brand with a market cap north of $51 billion. Second, it’s performed very well this year, gaining over 29% of equity value. In contrast, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index moved up just under 9% during the same period.Fundamentally, what makes RACE so special within this rarefied blue-chip stocks list focuses on economic insulation. Brewing headwinds against the consumer economy means that people are cutting back on their purchases, impacting once-resilient sectors like electric vehicles. However, Ferrari remains a powerful brand that constantly generates positive traction because it caters to a completely different wealth class.In other words, there’s rich and then there’s Ferrari rich. And Ferrari rich doesn’t worry about little things like interest rate hikes. They’re truly above it all. Not surprisingly, Wall Street analysts peg RACE as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target comes out to $287.58, implying a bit over 3% upside potential.Story continuesApple (AAPL)A close-up shot of a blue casino chip on red carpet.Source: ShutterstockWith consumer technology giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), I shouldn’t encounter any pushback signaling it as one of the top blue-chip stocks to buy. Thanks to its market cap of $2.65 trillion, Apple basically represents its own powerhouse country. Plus, it continues to perform well, gaining 34% of equity value since the beginning of this year. Furthermore, it’s erased its trailing one-year loss, now staring at a slightly positive return.Fundamentally, Apple’s brand power impresses like nothing else. With mass layoffs and other pressures working against the consumer economy, you’d expect a discretionary player like Apple to suffer. However, the products are too compelling and perhaps too addictive to ignore.Financially, the company features strengths across the board. From a solid balance sheet to double-digit revenue growth to excellent profit margins, you can’t go wrong with AAPL on your blue-chip stocks list. Presently, analysts peg AAPL as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target comes out to $174.28, implying 4% upside potential.Sherwin-Williams (SHW)blue chip definition highlightedSource: ShutterstockA paint and coating manufacturing firm, Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW) doesn’t exactly rank as one of the most exciting large-scale enterprises. However, a case can be made that it stands among the best blue-chip stocks to buy right now. Featuring everyday relevance, SHW can easily be an investment to build for the long run. Plus, its red ink this year may offer a discounted entry point.Financially, it doesn’t offer truly remarkable attributes. However, the company gets the job done. For example, it posts a competent three-year revenue growth rate of 9.8%. Again, not remarkable but it betas out 57.05% of companies listed in the chemicals sector.More importantly, Sherwin-Williams benefits from a consistently profitable enterprise. Its trailing-year operating margin pings at 13.55% while its net margin comes out to 9.12%. Both stats rank in the underlying sector’s upper half. Finally, analysts peg SHW as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $253.71, implying nearly 9% upside potential.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN)Source: ShutterstockOne of the companies that generated tremendous relevance during the worst of the Covid-19 crisis, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) no longer commands the spotlight like it once did when it contributed to restoring former President Donald Trump back to full health. Still, REGN deserves consideration on your blue-chip stocks list.While it no longer generates front-page news, it continues to research and develop new therapeutics. Even better, investors like what they’re seeing. Since the Jan. opener, REGN gained over 12% of its market value. Financially too, Regeneron attracts investors thanks to its rock-solid balance sheet, strong three-year sales trend, and an excellent profit margin of 35.64%.Notably, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 19.23. As a discount to projected earnings, Regeneron ranks better than 71.43% of the competition. Therefore, it’s not only one of the top blue-chip stocks to buy, but it’s also one of the most undervalued. Lastly, analysts peg REGN as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target comes out to $885, implying over 9% upside potential.Netflix (NFLX)Source: ShutterstockOne of the trickier blue-chip stocks to buy, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) carries significant clout as an entertainment stalwart. Obviously, during the worst of the pandemic, Netflix shot up the charts because it offered entertainment to quarantined consumers. However, as fears of the SARS-CoV-2 virus along with governmental restrictions faded away, the phenomenon of revenge travel took over. That left little room for Netflix to sustain its stratospheric growth.At the same time, NFLX stock has been mounting a credible comeback effort. In the trailing one-year period, it gained nearly 43% of its equity value. It still has some ways to go to reach its post-pandemic record highs. Nevertheless, with the consumer economy again struggling, the content streamer could get interesting as a cheap entertainment source.Financially, Netflix benefits from a solid balance sheet and strong operational stats. Notably, it’s a consistently profitable enterprise, featuring a trailing-year net margin of 14.21%. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg NFLX as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $362.37, implying over 12% upside potential.UnitedHealth Group (UNH)10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Grow UpSource: ShutterstockAnother tricky name to put on your blue-chip stocks list, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) on the surface seems like a reasonable enterprise to choose. Sure, it might be a bit choppy. Since the Jan. opener, UNH lost over 6% of its equity value. In the past 365 days, it fell 11%. Nevertheless, as a managed healthcare and insurance giant, UnitedHealth appears resilient.However, one thing to keep in mind is that as layoffs accelerate, UnitedHealth may suffer a reduction in its total addressable market. With the alpha dogs in the business world announcing steep headcount reductions, you want to be careful with UNH.Still, at the end of the day, we’re talking about one of the best blue-chip stocks to buy. Financially, UnitedHealth posts solid strengths in the balance sheet. Operationally, it features a three-year book growth rate of 11.1%, outpacing 73.33% of its peers. Also, it features robust profitability with a net margin of 6.21%, above 79% of the competition.Looking to the Street, analysts peg UNH as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target stands at $602.38, implying nearly 24% upside potential.PayPal (PYPL)Source: ShutterstockEasily the riskiest idea on this list of top blue-chip stocks to buy, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a powerhouse in the digital payments ecosystem. Fundamentally, it aligns with the burgeoning gig economy. Thanks to its intuitive business management ecosystem, it’s easy for gig workers (i.e. independent contractors) to get up and running. Also, the PayPal system keeps records of everything, making it convenient for tax-reporting purposes.However, it’s a tough sell for risk-averse investors. Since the beginning of this year, PYPL gained only 1%. In the trailing one-year period, it fell nearly 21%. Further, trading hands at a little over $75, we’re way off from the time that PYPL commanded a $300 price tag.But then, speculators wonder – could PYPL make another run to $300? If so, the underlying enterprise would easily rank as one of the best blue-chip stocks to buy. Financially, it has the right stuff, featuring decent stability in the balance sheet, solid revenue growth, and consistent profitability. Also, PayPal’s a quality enterprise, as evidenced by its return on equity of 11.78%.For the final word, analysts peg PYPL as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $116.52, implying nearly 55% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

101,7532e202-fc0d-39ca-8f26-cfc7aad023e0,PYPL,2023-04-24,3 Must-Buy Fintech Growth Stocks After the Fed “Bailouts”,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-must-buy-fintech-growth-151821250.html,1682003901,STORY,"['SOFI', 'PYPL', 'MA']","[The banking sector has been through a lot lately. The Fed had to step in and bail out some of the biggest names in the industry as they faced a liquidity crunch and a wave of defaults. The ripples in the banking sector have been calming down, with many banks starting to bounce back. However, there are still investors that are wary of a possible recession on the horizon, leaving them hesitant to look into financial technology (fintech) growth stocks. Understandably so, as some banks could still collapse, and even if the Fed does come to the rescue, depositors will be the ones getting their money back, not investors.That said, the turmoil in the banking sector has caused many fintech names to trade at depressed prices despite solid balance sheets and high growth potential as they tap into new markets and segments that the incumbents underserve.Moreover, I believe that investing in fintech growth stocks is not as risky as some investors think. The Fed has shown that it is committed to preventing a banking crisis and has ample tools and resources to do so. Even if some fintech names are connected to these banks, they will also be the ones to be rescued.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith that in mind, let’s look at three fintech growth stocks:SoFi Technologies (SOFI)Silhouette of person holding mobile phone with SoFi (SOFI) logo shown in backgroundSource: shutterstock.com/rafapressSoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) is (essentially) an online bank and one of the fastest-growing names in the financial sector. It is unique because SoFi operates entirely online, focusing more on personal loans. This makes the company’s borrower base much more diversified compared to banks that fund startups or risky institutions. Thus, despite SoFi being a “bank,” the risk here is low. Even with the recent Supreme Court ruling, the long-term potential outweighs the risk.As for the balance sheet, it is among the most robust in the industry. It has accelerating revenue growth of 82.9% in Q4, reaching $1.7 billion trailing twelve months. That’s expected to reach $2 billion at the midpoint this year and $2.9 billion in 2024.Story continuesFurthermore, the demand for personal loans continues to grow. With traditional banks growing conservative, it is hard for individuals to get any loans, especially online. That’s a tailwind SoFi can capitalize on in the long run since physical branches are growing less and less popular. Mastercard (MA)Close up of a pile of mastercard credit load debit bank cards.Source: David Cardinez / Shutterstock.comMastercard (NYSE:MA) is finally catching the attention of investors as it delivers some of the strongest growth in the fintech industry. Unlike most industries, Mastercard benefits from the rate hikes, and the Fed is likely to stay put at the 5% range for at least a few months. That’ll likely result in even stronger results in the following quarters this year.The company’s margins are especially compelling, with net margins at 44.7%, turning Mastercard into a cash machine. Operating income slowed slightly but still grew at double digits to 21.6%, reaching $12.3 billion for FY 2022. Revenue growth has also outpaced that of Visa (NYSE:V) and could lead to a more premium valuation if sustained.It’s a more conservative pick, but I believe the upside potential here is enough to make it a must-buy for a growth portfolio. PayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquarters. PYPL stockSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) continues to languish below pre-pandemic prices, but it might be time for Wall Street to reverse its sentiment on the stock. PayPal’s financials have turned a corner, and it is back to delivering double-digit growth on the bottom line and a healthy 6.7% growth in its top line.It is a household name that I don’t expect to stay at these levels for too long. Growth will eventually return to PayPal in the long term. At the same time, one of its biggest competitors, Block (NYSE:SQ), has faced setbacks due to the Hindenburg Research report. Thus, I believe the conditions are ripe for PayPal to resume its growth trajectory in 2023 and beyond.Furthermore, PayPal is generating strong cash flow, spending most of it on share repurchases. It guided $5 billion in FCF this year, with 75% to be spent buying back shares.The consensus price target here is above $100, but I believe $150 or higher is possible.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

I know that sounds like an excuse for lazy stock picking, but above all else, environment is what drives them. Currently, the environment is not very good for these names, which makes it tough to look for growth stocks to buy.Eventually though, that environment will change and become more favorable towards growth stocks. When that will happen, I’m not really sure. We’ll likely need the Federal Reserve to ease off its hawkish rhetoric (and ideally, lower interest rates). But we’ll also need speculation to come back into the market.Business quality is important in this group and it’s what separates the high-quality firms from the low-quality flash-in-the-pan names. However, the simple truth is, good growth stocks struggle in bad environments — defined as bear markets with lower liquidity and less speculation — and they surge alongside low-quality stocks in favorable environments.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe stock prices move quickly, but the environment changes slowly, which is why it’s so hard to trade these stocks at times. In any regard, let’s look at three growth stocks to buy that should double over time.The Trade Desk (TTD)The logo for The Trade Desk is displayed on a smart phone.Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comThe Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) remains one of my favorite long-term growth stocks to buy. It has continued to deliver, even during the pandemic, and I don’t anticipate that changing.Before the pandemic started, this firm was already profitable. While it did have a hiccup in the months after Covid-19 first hit (like everyone), it rebounded rapidly and remains profitable today. At a time where other mega-cap digital ad firms — like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) and Meta (NASDAQ:META) — were struggling for growth, The Trade Desk was churning out impressive numbers.Now that the industry is back on the upswing, I expect more solid results out of TTD.Story continuesRun by co-founder and CEO Jeff Green, The Trade Desk remains a powerhouse in the growth department. Analysts expect about 20% to 23% annual revenue growth through 2026. That’s robust growth for a company operating in a slower-growth environment with worries of a recession.While that does create risk to these estimates, I think it also shows the potential that The Trade Desk has — If it doubles from here, it will hit all-time highs.Snowflake (SNOW)The Snowflake logo on a company office in Silicon Valley, California. (SNOW IPO)Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comI remember reading about Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) in the lead-up to its initial public offering (IPO) in September 2020. The stock market was running red hot in those months, while growth stocks, SPACs, EV stocks and other speculative investments were scorching higher.Snowflake came bursting onto the scene and when you read about it, you got excited. But in the days leading up to the IPO, it became almost impossible to buy. Demand for the stock continued to swell, as big buyers were stepping in ahead of its public debut — including Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM).As the valuation continued to climb, so did its anticipated opening price. By the time it opened, it was well above where it initially began pricing and the stock wasn’t done rallying yet, eventually topping out near $430.Now down two-thirds from that level at around $145, it might be time to start picking at Snowflake. Analysts expect revenue to continue soaring. Consensus expectations call for 38% sales growth this year, then 39.5% growth and 36.7% growth the following two years.PayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquarters. PYPL stockSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comPeople are going to think I’m crazy for getting behind PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). The stock was decimated in the bear market and was obliterated from its highs. I think that was because of its consideration as a growth stock and its connection to the crypto space. All of that ultimately blew up in PayPal’s face.Despite the rally in tech though, PYPL is not performing well. It had a nice little jump over a few sessions, but just a few weeks ago, it was officially flat on the year.From current levels, it would take a 307% rally for PayPal stock to take out its all-time high. Let’s lower our expectations though and shoot for a more reasonable target: 100%.Analysts expect lumpy revenue growth, but growth nonetheless with estimates calling for 6.7% sales growth this year and 9.1% in 2024. As for earnings, estimates call for almost 18.2% growth this year and 14.9% growth over the next five years.PYPL is trading at a paltry 15.5 times this year’s earnings and I think we’ve hit some sort of trough. If that pans out, it should slowly but surely grind higher.On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell held a long position in PYPL.

In recent years, however, dividend stocks have witnessed a renewed interest as investors have become more focused on income generation and risk management. Dividend stocks can provide some stability and downside protection in times of market volatility. Companies in the S&amp;P 500 distributed a record $565 billion in dividend payments in 2022, a year that was one of the most challenging periods for the stock market.Analysts gave a positive stance about dividend growth this year as well. However, recent events surrounding Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapse have cast doubts on the performance of dividend stocks in 2023. Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, previously estimated dividends to grow by 6% to 7.5% this year. The analyst now anticipates a modest dividend growth of about 5%, which would still result in record payouts but is less than what he projected earlier this year. The bank turmoil has affected future spending for both consumers and companies, which may hinder dividend growth as well. Last month’s performance of the market also shows the impact of the bank’s failure on dividend payments. From March 8 through April 18, the S&amp;P 500 gained 4% on the banks of tech companies that pay less in dividends, as reported by Barron’s. Nevertheless, dividend stocks that have raised their payouts over time are still delivering stable returns. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks the performance of companies with dividend growth tracks of 25 years or more, is up 2.05% year-to-date and gained 8.69% in the last six months.Investors are still loading up on dividend stocks this year due to high inflation and fluctuating market conditions. Dividend-focused exchange-traded funds are especially gaining fame among investors because of their long-term growth potential, diversification, and professional management. According to a report by Wall Street Journal, there are currently 180 US dividend ETFs, with total assets worth over $384 billion. As of April 14, investors have poured over $2.8 billion into ETFs that purchase dividend-paying stocks. The report also highlighted that dividends are a good inflation hedge as S&amp;P 500 dividend growth has outpaced inflation from 2000 through March 2023.Story continuesSome of the best dividend stocks that have grabbed investors' attention include McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL), and Roper Technologies, Inc.

But even the best stock picker will only win with some selections. So we wouldn't blame long term International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 14% over a half decade. Furthermore, it's down 11% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders. This could be related to the recent financial results - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading our company report.Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns. Check out our latest analysis for International Business Machines In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During the five years over which the share price declined, International Business Machines' earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 18% each year. The share price decline of 3% per year isn't as bad as the EPS decline. So investors might expect EPS to bounce back -- or they may have previously foreseen the EPS decline. With a P/E ratio of 55.53, it's fair to say the market sees a brighter future for the business.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on International Business Machines' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of International Business Machines, it has a TSR of 14% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 3.6% in the twelve months, International Business Machines shareholders did even worse, losing 4.5% (even including dividends). However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 3%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand International Business Machines better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should learn about the   5 warning signs  we've spotted with International Business Machines (including 1 which shouldn't be ignored) .International Business Machines is not the only stock insiders are buying.

The global automotive industry is set to face several challenges in 2023 as well, due to various global factors, including the energy crisis, sluggish global demand, and ongoing disruptions in supply chains. However, the electric vehicle market is projected to be the only positive aspect, with the sales of conventional fossil-fuel cars and commercial vehicles expected to decline. Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska wrote in an investor note in December 2022: “There is active demand destruction in the industry, given inflation, interest rates, and energy costs − but so far, this has mostly impacted the backlog.”According to Charlie Chesbrough, Cox Automotive's senior economist and senior director of industry insights, the company is predicting that U.S. new vehicle sales will reach 14.1 million in 2023, which he characterized as ""cautiously optimistic."" However, Wall Street analysts estimate that U.S. auto sales for this year will be around 13.7 million. S&amp;P Global Mobility predicts that new vehicle sales worldwide will rise by 5.6% from the previous year to nearly 83.6 million units in 2023. S&amp;P also expects sales in the United States to increase by 7%, reaching about 14.8 million units in 2023.Similarly, Fitch Ratings predicts a 5% increase in global vehicle production and sales in 2023 due to the easing of supply chain disruptions. However, the global sales and production will still be constrained by weak economic conditions, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. Lower commodity prices and reduced logistics costs are expected to support the profitability of auto makers and suppliers. Nevertheless, the normalization of vehicle mix and higher incentives will bring down net pricing and reduce auto manufacturer margins from the high levels of 2022. Fitch maintained a Neutral outlook for the global auto sector. Story continuesThe automotive industry faced a major challenge when a significant number of employees left their jobs and did not return, leaving factories and original equipment manufacturers short-staffed just when the industry needed to resume production. This was compounded by the need for a shift in skill sets to support the transition from internal combustion engine models to electric vehicles. Larry Keyler, Partner and Global Automotive Leader at RSM US, said on January 18, 2023: “As a result of the labor shortage, I think we will continue to see a significant increase in the development of robotics and automation on the supply base as well as other technologies at the OEM level.”Don't Miss: Most Promising Car Stocks According to AnalystsDespite numerous challenges faced by the automotive industry, one of the most prominent trends is the focus on the development of electric vehicles, including improving battery performance and expanding charging infrastructure. As a result, vehicle manufacturers are increasing their research and development efforts on EV technology despite the current challenges in the industry. To benefit from the growth and transformation in the auto sector, some of the best car stocks to buy include Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) and Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN). Our Methodology We scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and picked the top 10 companies that provide services in the auto sector with the highest number of hedge fund investors. These are the best car stocks to buy according to hedge funds.10 Best Car Stocks To Buy Nowlaurel-and-michael-evans-c-KDq7nxVdQ-unsplashBest Car Stocks To Buy Now10. Fisker Inc. (NYSE:FSR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 13Fisker Inc. (NYSE:FSR) manufactures, advertises, rents out, and sells electric cars. The company is divided into three segments – The White Space, The Value Segment, and The Conservative Premium segments. According to the company's statement in Q4 2022, Fisker Inc. (NYSE:FSR) has manufactured a total of 56 vehicles, out of which 15 were created for Magna's group, since production commenced. Fisker Inc. (NYSE:FSR) has already requested and secured the necessary parts for the initial 300 automobiles, as well as some long-lead components for the second quarter.On March 27, Citi initiated a ""90-day upside Catalyst Watch"" for Fisker Inc. (NYSE:FSR)’s stock. Despite providing ""very promising"" guidance for 2023 compared to other electric vehicle companies, Fisker Inc. (NYSE:FSR)’s stock has not performed well, possibly due to broader economic concerns. Citi believes that if Fisker Inc.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks To Buy and Hold. Growth stocks were all the rage in the mid-20th century because they offered more potential for capital appreciation. In recent years, however, dividend stocks have witnessed a renewed interest as investors have become more focused on income generation and risk management. Dividend stocks can provide some stability and downside protection in times of market volatility. Companies in the S&amp;P 500 distributed a record $565 billion in dividend payments in 2022, a year that was one of the most challenging periods for the stock market.Analysts gave a positive stance about dividend growth this year as well. However, recent events surrounding Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapse have cast doubts on the performance of dividend stocks in 2023. Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, previously estimated dividends to grow by 6% to 7.5% this year. The analyst now anticipates a modest dividend growth of about 5%, which would still result in record payouts but is less than what he projected earlier this year. The bank turmoil has affected future spending for both consumers and companies, which may hinder dividend growth as well. Last month’s performance of the market also shows the impact of the bank’s failure on dividend payments. From March 8 through April 18, the S&amp;P 500 gained 4% on the banks of tech companies that pay less in dividends, as reported by Barron’s. Nevertheless, dividend stocks that have raised their payouts over time are still delivering stable returns. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks the performance of companies with dividend growth tracks of 25 years or more, is up 2.05% year-to-date and gained 8.69% in the last six months.Investors are still loading up on dividend stocks this year due to high inflation and fluctuating market conditions. Dividend-focused exchange-traded funds are especially gaining fame among investors because of their long-term growth potential, diversification, and professional management. According to a report by Wall Street Journal, there are currently 180 US dividend ETFs, with total assets worth over $384 billion. As of April 14, investors have poured over $2.8 billion into ETFs that purchase dividend-paying stocks. The report also highlighted that dividends are a good inflation hedge as S&amp;P 500 dividend growth has outpaced inflation from 2000 through March 2023.Story continuesSome of the best dividend stocks that have grabbed investors' attention include McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL), and Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP).

(zz/STRF/STAR MAX/IPx)The retail sectors that will see the most closures, based on Lasser's work, includes clothing accessories and consumer electronics stores at an estimated 23,000 combined.Lasser pointed to several key drivers for the looming closures:A slowdown in consumer spendingA reduction of credit availabilityThe rising penetration of e-commerce shoppingHigher costs to operate retail storesA decade removed from the demises of once-dominant retail chains Sports Authority, Circuit City, and Linens N' Things — and more recently Sears and Kmart — the age of online shopping is continuing to pressure retailers with too many physical stores open.A Sears department store in West Covina, California on November 09, 2019.

Sixth Street will provide the company with $240 million in debtor-in-possession financing, which will allow the company to continue operations during its wind-down process.""Our teams have worked with incredible purpose to support and strengthen our beloved banners, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and buybuy BABY,"" CEO Sue Gove said in a statement. ""We deeply appreciate our associates, customers, partners, and the communities we serve, and we remain steadfastly determined to serve them throughout this process. We will continue working diligently to maximize value for the benefit of all stakeholders.""Bed Bath &amp; Beyond had been exploring ""strategic alternatives"" for its business dating back to January. That plan spiraled, as Bed Bath &amp; Beyond’s first funding partner bailed after less than two months.In the most recent quarter, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond reported sales dropped 33% while adjusted losses totaled $225 million.Shares of the company have lost 98% over the last year; year-to-date, the stock was down 88% through Friday's close.After peaking at $12.3 billion in 2017, sales at the retailer have collapsed in recent years, totaling just $7.9 billion in 2021, its lowest annual tally since 2009. Through the first three quarters of 2022, the company was on pace for sales that would have matched levels reported in the mid-2000s.While private labels have become an increasing part of the growth story for Target (TGT), Macy’s (M), Walmart (WMT), and other large retailers, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond fell behind. The company's decline was only accelerated by the pandemic as shoppers switched to online retailers like Amazon (AMZN) and Wayfair (W).Story continuesFrom bath towels and hand soap to air fryers and board games, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond was once the go-to spot for suburban families and incoming college students to fill their homes.But in recent years, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond stores have been better known for discounts and empty shelves. After losing a cumulative $1.4 billion from 2018-2021, the company lost more than a billion dollars through the first three quarters of 2022.Last month, the company announced plans for a shareholder vote on a reverse stock split set for May 9 in an effort to shore up its liquidity and come into compliance with Nasdaq listing rules after its stock fell below $1 per share. The company noted in an SEC filing that boosting the stock price was its last hope at survival.""A failure to obtain shareholder approval for the Reverse Split Proposal will likely force us to file for bankruptcy,"" the company said in the SEC filing.Bed Bath &amp; Beyond had announced a funding deal with Hudson Bay Capital on February 7 to raise more than $1 billion over the next year. But provisions in that deal required Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's stock price to stay above certain levels.As the stock dropped from above $5 per share in February to less than $1 per share in late March, Hudson Bay's funding deal ended.The money from Hudson Bay, as well as Bed Bath &amp; Beyond’s new funding partner, B. Riley Securities, was meant to restock shelves, pay back vendors, and revive sales at stores that were still operating.“Having inventory and having the right inventory will help them,"" Goldman Sachs analyst Kate McShane told Yahoo Finance Live on April 6 after Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's latest round of funding.""I think the question is just, in this environment, where you do have a consumer that’s a little bit more thoughtful about their spending exactly what it will yield for someone like Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.""A customer walks into a Bed Bath &amp; Beyond store in Novi, Michigan, U.S., January 29, 2021.

Investor Ryan Cohen, who catalyzed the market's interest in GameStop back in late 2020, took a 9.8% stake in Bed Bath &amp; Beyond in March 2022, and company shares soared.The idea of retail investor interest even became part of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's revival strategy.The company wrote in an SEC filing on April 5 that a reverse-stock split could help make the stock ""more attractive"" to investors.In mid-August 2022, shares closed as high as $23.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Stocks To Invest In 2023 For Beginners.""One-and-Done Much More Likely, But Not Fully Baked In Just Yet""On April 21 Roger Ferguson, former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he talked about inflation, the Fed, and recession risks. Ferguson thinks that we are now in a ""one-and-done"" situation, which means that he expects the Fed to raise interest rates for the last time at the FOMC meeting in May. However, as inflation is still higher than the 2% target, Ferguson thinks that there may be a June hike as well. Here is what he said:""I think a one-and-done is most likely, but the uniformity and the fact that inflation is still relatively high, it may leave the possibility for a June hike on the table. I would say, one-and-done much more likely but not fully baked in just yet.""The market is pricing in Fed cuts in the back half of 2023. Roger Ferguson spoke about a discrepancy between the market's expectations and the Fed's expectations regarding interest rates in the latter part of 2023 and said that ""the market is more optimistic about Fed cuts than the Fed themselves"". However, economic data will be the determining factor for this as we move into the back half of 2023, noted Ferguson. According to Roger Ferguson, the Fed may keep interest rates elevated for longer than the market is expecting.Roger Ferguson noted that sectors that are sensitive to interest rates, such as housing, are already experiencing challenges and pressures from rising rates. Ferguson thinks the Fed will keep interest rates higher for longer than the market is expecting because, though the labor market is showing signs of weakening, ""it is still not soft"", and there are certain parts of the economy that are still strong which will in turn keep inflation higher than 2%. According to Ferguson, ""the Fed wants to really make sure that the disinflationary process is well advanced before it even starts talking about cutting rates"".Story continuesFinally, Roger Ferguson talked about the risk of recession. Ferguson does not expect a severe recession, rather, he expects a shallow recession and he sees ""some credit tightening in various places"" as opposed to a credit crunch. Here are some comments from Roger Ferguson:""A recession is more likely than not. I still think it's more likely to be a softer recession, as opposed to a hard one. But, the credit tightening that's certainly going on and being talked about in the Fed's Beige Book, does suggest that conditions are a little more fraught, and maybe a slightly harder recession. I'm not yet in the camp that says that we have a real credit crunch, I think we see some credit tightening in various places. Count me still in a sort of soft and shallow recession camp right now, but with the risk to the downside given the changing credit dynamics in the country.""The next FOMC meeting is nearby and a 89.1% of the market is pricing in a 25 basis point rate hike by the Fed, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool. In times like these, investors can feel overwhelmed and confused about what stocks to pick.

122,601d77a9-ca19-37bb-a091-cfcaf3faf233,RF,2023-04-24,Regions Financial Corporation Just Missed Earnings - But Analysts Have Updated Their Models,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/regions-financial-corporation-just-missed-101937404.html,1682331577,STORY,['RF'],"[Last week, you might have seen that Regions Financial Corporation (NYSE:RF) released its quarterly result to the market. The early response was not positive, with shares down 3.1% to US$18.36 in the past week. It looks like the results were a bit of a negative overall. While revenues of US$2.0b were in line with analyst predictions, statutory earnings were less than expected, missing estimates by 5.3% to hit US$0.62 per share. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year. Check out our latest analysis for Regions Financial earnings-and-revenue-growthAfter the latest results, the 15 analysts covering Regions Financial are now predicting revenues of US$7.71b in 2023. If met, this would reflect a notable 8.3% improvement in sales compared to the last 12 months. Statutory per share are forecast to be US$2.40, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$7.78b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$2.45 in 2023. The analysts seem to have become a little more negative on the business after the latest results, given the minor downgrade to their earnings per share numbers for next year.The consensus price target held steady at US$22.20, with the analysts seemingly voting that their lower forecast earnings are not expected to lead to a lower stock price in the foreseeable future. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Regions Financial at US$25.05 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$19.00. Still, with such a tight range of estimates, it suggeststhe analysts have a pretty good idea of what they think the company is worth.Story continuesTaking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. It's clear from the latest estimates that Regions Financial's rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with the forecast 11% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2023 noticeably faster than its historical growth of 6.3% p.a. over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 3.8% per year. Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that Regions Financial is expected to grow much faster than its industry.The Bottom LineThe biggest concern is that the analysts reduced their earnings per share estimates, suggesting business headwinds could lay ahead for Regions Financial. Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting sales are tracking in line with expectations - and our data suggests that revenues are expected to grow faster than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$22.20, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.

The bottom line improved from 55 cents in the prior-year quarter.Shares of RF gained a mere 0.5% in the pre-market trading on the lower-than-expected results. A full-day trading session will depict a clearer picture.Results have been aided by a rise in net interest income (NII) and average loan balances. However, increasing expenses and provision for credit losses affected the bottom line.Net income available to common shareholders was $588 million, up year over year from $524 million.Revenues Improve, Expenses RiseTotal quarterly revenues were $1.95 billion, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.96 billion. Nonetheless, the top line rose 22% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Quarterly NII was $1.41 billion, up 39.6% year over year. Also, the net interest margin rose 137 basis points to 4.22%.Non-interest income dipped 8.6% year over year to $534 million. The downside mainly resulted from lower service charges on deposit accounts, capital markets income, mortgage income and other income.Non-interest expenses rose 10.1% year over year to $1.02 billion. The rise was due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits costs, equipment and software expenses, FDIC insurance assessment costs, and branch consolidation, property and equipment charges.The efficiency ratio was 52.3% in the first quarter.As of Mar 31, 2023, average loans increased 1.6% on a sequential basis to $92.27 billion. Moreover, total deposits were $129.04 billion, down 3% from the prior quarter.Credit Quality DeterioratesNon-performing assets (excluding 90+ past due), as a percentage of loans, foreclosed properties and non-performing loans held for sale were up to 0.58% from the prior-year quarter’s 0.39%.Non-performing loans, excluding loans held for sale as a percentage of net loans, were 0.56%, up from 0.39% in the prior year. Annualized net charge-offs, as a percentage of average loans, were 0.35% compared with 0.21% in the prior-year quarter. A provision for credit losses of $135 million was recorded in the quarter against $36 million of benefit in the prior-year quarter.Story continuesCapital Ratios MixedAs of Mar 31, 2023, the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio and the Tier 1 capital ratio were estimated at 9.8% and 11.2%, respectively, compared with 9.4% and 10.8% recorded in the year-earlier quarter.Our ViewpointRegions Financial put up a decent performance in the first quarter on higher loan balances and rising interest rates. RF’s attractive core business and revenue-diversification strategies will likely yield stellar earnings in the upcoming period.Though a fall in fee income is concerning, we are optimistic about the bank’s branch-consolidation plan. Nevertheless, expense pressure is expected to prevail.Regions Financial Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Regions Financial Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseRegions Financial Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Regions Financial Corporation QuoteCurrently, Regions Financial carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Performance of Other BanksU.S. Bancorp’s USB first-quarter 2023 earnings per share (excluding merger and integration-related charges) of $1.16 handily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.13 per share. It grew 17.2% from the prior-year quarter.USB’s results benefited from an increase in NII, supported by higher interest rates.

Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, the Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) share price is up 86% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 47% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 13% in the last year , including dividends .Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. See our latest analysis for Visa While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Visa managed to grow its earnings per share at 19% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 13% over the same period. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Visa has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Visa the TSR over the last 5 years was 92%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Visa shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 13% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. However, that falls short of the 14% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

In recent years, however, dividend stocks have witnessed a renewed interest as investors have become more focused on income generation and risk management. Dividend stocks can provide some stability and downside protection in times of market volatility. Companies in the S&amp;P 500 distributed a record $565 billion in dividend payments in 2022, a year that was one of the most challenging periods for the stock market.Analysts gave a positive stance about dividend growth this year as well. However, recent events surrounding Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapse have cast doubts on the performance of dividend stocks in 2023. Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, previously estimated dividends to grow by 6% to 7.5% this year. The analyst now anticipates a modest dividend growth of about 5%, which would still result in record payouts but is less than what he projected earlier this year. The bank turmoil has affected future spending for both consumers and companies, which may hinder dividend growth as well. Last month’s performance of the market also shows the impact of the bank’s failure on dividend payments. From March 8 through April 18, the S&amp;P 500 gained 4% on the banks of tech companies that pay less in dividends, as reported by Barron’s. Nevertheless, dividend stocks that have raised their payouts over time are still delivering stable returns. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks the performance of companies with dividend growth tracks of 25 years or more, is up 2.05% year-to-date and gained 8.69% in the last six months.Investors are still loading up on dividend stocks this year due to high inflation and fluctuating market conditions. Dividend-focused exchange-traded funds are especially gaining fame among investors because of their long-term growth potential, diversification, and professional management. According to a report by Wall Street Journal, there are currently 180 US dividend ETFs, with total assets worth over $384 billion. As of April 14, investors have poured over $2.8 billion into ETFs that purchase dividend-paying stocks. The report also highlighted that dividends are a good inflation hedge as S&amp;P 500 dividend growth has outpaced inflation from 2000 through March 2023.Story continuesSome of the best dividend stocks that have grabbed investors' attention include McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL), and Roper Technologies, Inc.

Since diversified information technology company IBM’s 2019 acquisition of Red Hat, the company has aggressively pursued a hybrid cloud strategy. Though IBM and its new management team have made solid progress on this pivot, we believe the company still meaningfully lags the cloud hyperscalers and other cloud-native companies.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Although, when we looked at Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Verizon Communications:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.10 = US$33b ÷ (US$380b - US$50b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Thus, Verizon Communications has an ROCE of 10%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Telecom industry average of 6.5% it's much better. Check out our latest analysis for Verizon Communications roceIn the above chart we have measured Verizon Communications' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Does the ROCE Trend For Verizon Communications Tell Us?In terms of Verizon Communications' historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 13% over the last five years. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Verizon Communications' ROCEIn summary, Verizon Communications is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. Unsurprisingly then, the total return to shareholders over the last five years has been flat.

138,5c4204b2-f27b-3477-8ec9-057d13251206,FOX,2023-04-24,Fox's settlement with Dominion unlikely to cost it $787.5M,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/foxs-settlement-dominion-unlikely-cost-120054140.html,1682251254,STORY,['FOXA'],"[Fox Corp.'s $787.5 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems over defamation charges is eye-popping, but the ultimate cost to the media company is likely to be much lower.On Tuesday, Fox settled with Dominion over charges that Fox News baselessly accused the company of rigging its voting machines against former President Donald Trump in 2020. It was the most-watched media libel case in decades.Fox had about $4 billion of cash on hand as of December 2022, and MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman expects the company to pay the settlement during the current quarter.How much the lawsuit will actually end up costing Fox is unclear because there are ways it can defray some of the expense, primarily through insurance and the use of tax deductions.Fox can deduct the Dominion settlement from its income taxes as an expense necessary for the cost of doing business. Fox Chief Communications Officer Brian Nick has confirmed the deductibility of the settlement.Big companies often deduct large settlements to help offset some of the cost, but since settlement amounts are usually confidential, it's difficult to pin down exactly how much they benefit. Payments that are seen as restitution or compensation can be deducted, while payments made to the government or at the direction of a government are usually not deductible.Robert Willens, a tax professor at the Columbia University School of Business, estimates that after the tax write-off, Fox will incur about three-fourths of the settlement amount, about $590 million.“The key is that if the payments are being made to private parties and not at the behest of the government then you can pretty much conclude without any fear of contradiction that the payment will be deductible,"" he said.A study by the Government Accountability Office in 2005 found that of 34 settlements totaling over $1 billion, 20 companies reported deducting some portion or all of their settlement payments. Big banks such as Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase reportedly also deducted portions of their settlements of charges tied the financial crisis of 2008.Story continuesAlso, if Fox is insured, insurance is likely to cover some of the settlement. Chad Milton, a partner at Media Risk Consultants, said a large media company such as Fox could have anywhere between $100 million to $500 million in coverage, including media liability insurance and other types of insurance.“It’s not hard to stack up $100 million but as you go higher than that, it gets harder and harder,” Milton said.Usually, there’s a certain amount a media company has to pay, which could be in the millions, before insurance kicks in. However, the deductible incudes attorney fees, which in a high-profile case like Fox-Dominion could be tens of millions of dollars or higher, so the deductible could be swallowed up just by attorney fees.One wrinkle: even if an insurance company pays a substantial part of the settlement, there could be an annual aggregate limit of liability, which could mean that insurers wouldn’t cover another big-money settlement.And media companies and insurers don’t always agree on who should cover what, since there are caveats written into contracts that allow insurers to avoid paying under certain circumstances. In 2017, Disney settled a defamation suit that was filed in 2012 after ABC aired a segment that questioned the safety of a meat producer’s products that critics dubbed “pink slime.” But one of its insurers, AIG, ended up suing Disney so it wouldn’t have to pay part of the settlement, although AIG eventually lost.Fox has also said it doesn’t expect the settlement to affect its operations.“We don’t expect significant operational effects or changes to our business given our cash flow, strong balance sheet and the health of our business,” the company said in a statement after the settlement was announced.MoffettNathanson's Fishman said everything indicates the company will be able to run its business as usual.“It isn’t clear there has been much, if any, impact of these lawsuits on Fox News’ viewership and business,” he said.Fishman said he doesn’t expect the settlement to hamper Fox’s ability to return money to shareholders, including a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program announced in February.Fox has a similar lawsuit looming with another voting machine company, Smartmatic, but no date has been set and the case might not go to court for a couple of years.__An earlier version of this story said Disney settled a defamation suit in 2012 after ABC aired a segment that questioned the safety of a meat producer’s products. The settlement of the suit was announced in 2017.]"
139,d7cbe820-3e4b-3931-8e5d-6c528065a05b,CMI,2023-04-24,Cummins Inc.'s (NYSE:CMI) Stock Been Rising: Are Strong Financials Guiding The Market?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cummins-inc-nyse-cmi-stock-130034039.html,1682168434,STORY,['CMI'],"[Most readers would already know that Cummins' (NYSE:CMI) stock increased by 1.5% over the past month. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on Cummins'  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for Cummins How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Cummins is:21% = US$2.2b ÷ US$10b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.21 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of Cummins' Earnings Growth And 21% ROETo begin with, Cummins seems to have a respectable ROE. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 13%. This certainly adds some context to Cummins' decent 7.3% net income growth seen over the past five years.As a next step, we compared Cummins' net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 8.1% in the same period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is CMI fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Cummins Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?With a three-year median payout ratio of 40% (implying that the company retains 60% of its profits), it seems that Cummins is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees respectable amount growth in its earnings and pays a dividend that's well covered.Besides, Cummins has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 33%. Still, forecasts suggest that Cummins' future ROE will rise to 27% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Cummins' performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. The latest industry analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to maintain its current growth rate.

When you buy individual stocks, you can make higher profits, but you also face the risk of under-performance. That downside risk was realized by The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) shareholders over the last year, as the share price declined 17%. That contrasts poorly with the market decline of 3.6%. At least the damage isn't so bad if you look at the last three years, since the stock is down 6.1% in that time.Now let's have a look at the company's fundamentals, and see if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. Check out our latest analysis for Walt Disney There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Even though the Walt Disney share price is down over the year, its EPS actually improved. It's quite possible that growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.It's surprising to see the share price fall so much, despite the improved EPS. But we might find some different metrics explain the share price movements better.Walt Disney's revenue is actually up 16% over the last year. Since we can't easily explain the share price movement based on these metrics, it might be worth considering how market sentiment has changed towards the stock.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-and-revenue-growthWalt Disney is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecastsA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 3.6% in the twelve months, Walt Disney shareholders did even worse, losing 17%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 0.4% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. Before forming an opinion on Walt Disney you might want to consider these 3 valuation metrics.Story continuesFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

(NYSE:OKE) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 15th of May to $0.955. This takes the dividend yield to 5.8%, which shareholders will be pleased with. Check out our latest analysis for ONEOK ONEOK's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsIf the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. Before making this announcement, the company's dividend was much higher than its earnings. It will be difficult to sustain this level of payout so we wouldn't be confident about this continuing.EPS is set to grow by 35.2% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, our estimates say the payout ratio could reach 78% - on the higher side, but we wouldn't necessarily say this is unsustainable.historic-dividendONEOK Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $1.32, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $3.82. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 11% over that duration. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.ONEOK's Dividend Might Lack GrowthThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. ONEOK has impressed us by growing EPS at 24% per year over the past five years. While EPS is growing rapidly, ONEOK paid out a very high 98% of its income as dividends. If earnings continue to grow, this dividend may be sustainable, but we think a payout this high definitely bears watching.ONEOK's Dividend Doesn't Look SustainableOverall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think ONEOK will make a great income stock. In the past the payments have been stable, but we think the company is paying out too much for this to continue for the long term. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach.

(NASDAQ: AKAM), the cloud company that powers and protects life online, today announced the availability of Brand Protector, a new solution that detect and disrupt phishing sites, fake stores, and brand impersonations. Brand Protector enables organizations to retain and grow customer loyalty while minimizing loss, drops in productivity and bad customer feedback.Akamai Technologies, Inc. logo (PRNewsfoto/Akamai Technologies, Inc.)According to Google, over 50,000 new phishing websites are created every week. Akamai Brand Protector inspects trillions of digital activities a day across both internal and external sources to discover abuse of an organization's brand — often before an attack campaign launches. This shields businesses from revenue loss and increased risk by combating fake goods sales, phishing sites and unauthorized use of brand elements outside of its environment and across the internet.Brand Protector addresses the problem of fraudulent impersonations with a four-step approach:Intelligence: As the world's largest distributed edge and cloud platform, our proprietary view across the worldwide web traffic analyzes over 600 TB of data a day. The depth of intelligence in Brand Protector is enhanced with third-party data feeds for holistic visibility into attacker actions everywhere.Detection: Today's brand attacks automate the deployment of malicious, short-lived websites. Akamai Brand Protector traces live traffic to detect brand abuse often before a phishing campaign begins - instead of relying on refreshed lists or delayed feeds. The outcome reduces attack impact, protecting customers and brand trust.Visibility: Customer-centric design gives security teams vital security insight in a single dashboard view. After receiving intelligence, data signals are run through a series of heuristic and AI detectors. Akamai's simplified user interface provides an instant understanding of real-time threats to customers via impersonations. Findings are ranked by threat score and users click into an alert to view analyzed threat data including confidence score, severity rating, number of affected users and a timeline of attack events.Mitigation: Integrated takedown services help close the loop to combat brand fraud. Brand Protector enables security teams to issue a takedown request of the abusive site right in the detection screen. Takedown requests for Brand Protector automatically attach the detection's evidence and supporting details for ease of use.Story continues""Attackers are increasingly abusing trusted brand names to lure end-users through phishing and fake sites for the promise of financial gain,"" said Rupesh Chokshi, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Application Security at Akamai. ""Detecting the rapid deployment of these attack campaigns and mitigating them can be a challenge for global brands.

However, not all APJ businesses plan to or are able to invest heavily in the space. Willingness to spend varies greatly, with 27% planning to spend below 20% of their IT budget on cloud and 33% planning to spend above 40% of their budget.Results are based on a survey of 386 respondents across Australia and New Zealand (ANZ), Japan, China, India, Singapore, and South Korea. The survey was conducted to glean insights into partners' perspectives on IT budget priorities, and their customers' 2023 cloud strategy.""In our conversations with partners, we see that organisations are walking the fine line between investing in cloud as well as being frugal in light of the macroeconomic headwinds. We believe the solution lies in working with a developer-friendly cloud and compute ecosystem that can offer them both flexibility and cost-effectiveness, while avoiding bill shock,"" explained Tatsuya Suzuki, Regional VP, APJ Carrier and Channel, Akamai. ""Even as the industry landscape continues to evolve and increase in complexity, Akamai seeks to accelerate the ambitions of our partners as they help their customers harness the potential of the cloud. We will offer expanded product roadmaps in the new year, across the areas of cloud, security, and delivery to achieve the overarching goal of making life better for billions of people, billions of times a day,"" concluded Suzuki.Story continuesUnderstanding cloud priorities across the APJ regionUpon analysis of country-specific data, Akamai's findings revealed significant differences in the willingness to spend on cloud despite an overarching agreement on the importance of cloud technology.Specifically, Vietnam (31%), Indonesia (27%), and India (23%) had the highest percentages in terms of respondents who said the proportion of IT budget spent on cloud would be 60% and up.Conversely, Thailand (50%), Japan (49%) and Taiwan (40%) had the highest percentages for respondents who indicated that the proportion of IT budget spent on cloud would be below 20%.""While most organisations acknowledge the importance of cloud, many are apprehensive about investing their IT budgets in this technology, given concerns of costs and how this will affect other overarching IT priorities. These sentiments are clear from the latest insights we have gathered from our partners, and this is why Akamai is investing heavily in scaling our cloud computing capabilities,"" explained Suzuki.""We believe that organisations need more options for their cloud needs, particularly those that are easy to use and developer friendly with transparent, attractive pricing, and we are able to provision for these needs with Akamai Connected Cloud,"" he continued.In February, Akamai announced Akamai Connected Cloud, a massively distributed edge and cloud platform for computing, security, and content delivery. As part of the announcement, Akamai plans to launch four new enterprise-scale core cloud computing sites across APJ in Chennai, Osaka, Jakarta, and Auckland by the end of 2023. Additionally, Akamai has identified more than 50 cities globally in which it plans to begin rolling out distributed sites this year, bringing basic cloud computing capabilities into difficult-to-reach locations currently underserved by traditional cloud providers.Security remains a key priority for ANZ partners in 2023While cloud remains top of mind, so too is security which continues to be an overarching priority for ANZ partners, with the rise of data breaches in the past months.The Australian Cyber Security Centre's (ACSC) third Annual Cyber Threat Report threat report, revealed that the agency had received over 76,000 cybercrime reports last financial year – a 13 per cent increase from the year before.""In the coming months, we are likely to see an increase in the number and sophistication of cyber-attacks and larger scale data breaches, causing more disruption. There is also a risk of complacency from breach fatigue. Many organisations will focus on improving the security of their supply chain as part of ensuring positive business outcomes,"" explained Mark Trumble, APAC Head of Portfolio - Cyber Security, Fujitsu Australia, and New Zealand.""To account for these challenges, partners are increasingly looking to provide a range of products and services for customers that embed different layers of security and in-depth defense.""Akamai is supporting our customers and partners with our security solutions, including Edge DNS, a global, highly scalable domain name system (DNS) service offering security, resilience from Distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) events, and high DNS responsiveness. As a result, we are able to observe trillions of DNS requests daily and have clear visibility on the latest developments in the threat landscape,"" explained Dean Houari, Director of Security Technology and Strategy, APJ, Akamai.""We remain committed to protecting our customers and partners and staying ahead of attackers by blocking requests leading to domains serving malware and phishing sites that could steal data,"" concluded Houari.Logo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/384815/Akamai_v1_Logo.jpgCisionView original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/apac/news-releases/overwhelming-number-96-percent-of-channel-partners-in-anz-agree-that-cloud-is-key-to-2023-strategy-akamai-partner-survey-301801538.htmlSOURCE Akamai Technologies, Inc.]"
152,7461e52a-8700-3a4b-8308-91f0d79160c1,JNPR,2023-04-24,Will Solid Revenue Growth Aid Juniper's (JNPR) Q1 Earnings?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/solid-revenue-growth-aid-junipers-095309554.html,1682329989,STORY,['JNPR'],"[Juniper Networks, Inc. JNPR is scheduled to report first-quarter 2023 results on Apr 25, after market close. The company delivered an earnings surprise of 1.55%, on average, in the trailing four quarters. In the last reported quarter, the bottom line matched adjusted earnings estimates. Juniper is strengthening its portfolio through steady R&amp;D investments, while expanding its global footprint. It is witnessing a healthy momentum for its AI-driven network solutions and is expected to record higher revenues year over year.Factors at PlayIn the first quarter, Juniper — in collaboration with NEC Corporation — inked an agreement with Powerco for an undisclosed amount to augment the latter’s Wi-Fi network capabilities across its operating states in New Zealand. Juniper routing solutions helped Powerco to replace its legacy Wi-Fi network with a state-of-the-art LAN infrastructure. The Mist-AI-driven platform offers automated real-time data insights into the network and offers a proactive approach to identify and resolve any error. These developments are likely to have had a positive impact on the company’s first-quarter earnings.In the to-be-reported quarter, Juniper was selected by Virgin Media O2 to upgrade its network infrastructure in the U.K. This partnership is aimed to support the increasing demand for high-speed connectivity and digital services. Virgin Media intended to leverage Juniper’s silicon, software and automation innovation to construct a reliable and sustainable network foundation and enhance service providers’ ability to better tackle the technical and commercial issues they faced in everyday operations. With this partnership, Juniper continued its expansion in the U.K. telecommunications market and it is likely to have generated incremental revenues in the quarter.During the quarter, Greenergy Data Centers — a leading data center enterprise in the Baltics — leveraged Juniper’s technology and expertise to create highly efficient, low-carbon data centers. Juniper’s Mist AI is utilized for network monitoring and analytics to improve decision-making, reduce error and enhance productivity. Juniper Access Points and Juniper EX Switches will deliver faster, more reliable and secure connectivity to Greenergy’s data centers. This likely to improve Juniper’s first-quarter performance.In the first quarter, Juniper extended its collaboration with IBM. The partnership will witness the integration of Juniper’s Radio Access Network (RAN) optimization and Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) technology with IBM’s Cloud Pak for Network Automation. This integration intends to support communication service providers (CSP) with a unified platform for managing and automating their network infrastructure. The joint solution will allow CSPs to find better monetization opportunities, reduce operational costs and simplify network management.Juniper also partnered with Vodafone to deliver a successful trial of its network automation technology. In the trial, Juniper’s RIC (RAN Intelligent Controller) technology validated Admission Control and Traffic Steering applications. The successful use cases show that Juniper RIC can optimize the user experience automatically based on real-time data insights in a multi-vendor environment. These use cases can be deployed across RANS and third-party vendors can develop innovative applications on the Juniper RIC platform to unlock the full potential and benefits of Open RAN. The trials will help drive more sustainable and energy-efficient operations, which are essential for mobile operators. Such initiatives are likely to get reflected in the upcoming results.  In the March quarter, Juniper unveiled Three-Step Campus Fabric Workflow and the new Juniper Networks EX4400-24X which help enterprises to better manage their network operational challenges and accelerate time to service while mitigating troubleshooting costs.Juniper inked an agreement with Meesho for an undisclosed amount to augment the latter’s network capabilities across its partner call centers in various locations in India. The improvement in network connectivity is expected to enhance user experience with AI-based insights and automated troubleshooting for improved uptime. This is likely to aid top-line growth.For the March quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $1,345 million, indicating growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure of $1,168 million. The consensus estimate for adjusted earnings per share stands at 43 cents, suggesting growth from 31 cents reported in the prior-year quarter.Story continuesEarnings WhispersOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Juniper this time around.

Senior executives formerly under Shell will now report to Comcast president Michael Cavanagh until a successor is announced, according to an NBCUniversal email viewed by the BBC.Shell became the CEO of NBCUniversal in 2020, where he made a strong push to expand its streaming service, Peacock.

In 2017, Matt Lauer, the face of the morning news show “Today,” was fired after a female colleague accused him of sexual assault.

Still, the platform also reported nearly $1 billion in losses, a number NBCUniversal expects to peak at $3 billion in 2023.Cavanagh, Comcast’s president, and Shell have been optimistic about a near-future turnaround for Peacock.

Credit Suisse suffers significant first quarter outflows, underlining the challenges surrounding its shotgun marriage with rival UBS, while NBCUniversal's CEO resigns and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond files for bankruptcy.1. Futures drop as earnings season kicks into full gearHigh-profile corporate names, including some of the world's biggest technology groups, will unveil their latest results this week as concerns persist over a possible slowdown in the U.S. economy.Companies faced a tumultuous quarter highlighted by stubbornly elevated (but easing) inflation, widespread tech sector layoffs, and the banking crisis.Google-parent Alphabet Inc. Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Facebook-owned Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) are all slated to report, along with chip-making giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Consumer goods firm Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ), oil major ExxonMobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM), payments processor Mastercard Inc. (NYSE:MA), drinks maker Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and drugmaker Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) are also among the hundreds of businesses due to release their earnings in the coming days.Last week, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) chief Jamie Dimon flagged looming economic ""storm clouds"" on the horizon, adding that the banking industry's recent issues have only exacerbated these fears. However, these worries were somewhat tempered by separate data on Friday which showed that business activity in the U.S. touched an 11-month high in April.On Monday, U.S. stocks were seen opening lower. By 04:41 ET (08:41 GMT), the Dow futures contract was down 109 points or 0.32%, S&amp;P 500 futures traded 16 points or 0.40% lower, and Nasdaq 100 futures dropped by 57 points or 0.44%.2. Credit Suisse's 'alarming' resultsCredit Suisse (SIX:CSGN) saw CHF 61.2 billion in asset outflows in the first quarter in what is likely to be the final earnings report from the Swiss lender after its merger with rival UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG).Story continuesThe bank called the outflows ""significant,"" adding that they have moderated but not yet reversed.It said that withdrawals of cash deposits and non-renewal of maturing time deposits were most acute in the days preceding and following the announcement of the tie-up last month. Swiss officials brokered the deal to bolster confidence in the country's banking system in the wake of turmoil across the global financial services sector sparked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.Customer deposits also declined by CHF 67B in the opening three months of its 2023 fiscal year.The results, which analysts at KBW called ""alarming,"" set the stage for quarterly figures from UBS due out tomorrow, with investors keen to find out more about how it plans to fold Credit Suisse into its operations.""UBS undoubtedly faces a major (and urgent) task in deeply restructuring its former competitor,"" analysts at Vontobel said in a note on Monday.3. NBCUniversal CEO to step downNBCUniversal chief Jeff Shell will leave following an investigation reportedly led by an outside counsel into a complaint over inappropriate behavior, the media giant's parent Comcast Corp. (NASDAQ:CMCSA) announced in a note to staff.In a statement, Shell said he had had an ""inappropriate relationship"" with a female employee. The woman is believed to be a long-time journalist for the company, according to multiple media reports.""Today is my last day as CEO of NBCUniversal,"" Shell said on Sunday. The executive, who is married, added that he deeply regretted the relationship.Shell's departure comes as a precarious time for NBCUniversal. He had been leading a charge to refocus on the firm's operations as it faced increased competition from streaming rivals.Senior leaders who had been working under Shell will now report to Comcast president Mike Cavanagh, the note said.4. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond files for bankruptcyU.S. home goods retailer Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc. (NASDAQ:BBBY) has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in a New Jersey court after it failed to secure funds needed to continue as a going concern.The embattled business had attempted to stay afloat through a complex sale of preferred stock and warrants that aimed to raise $1B. However, that deal was scrapped last month, leading the company to announce a last-ditch effort to garner $300 million from investors.But neither this fundraising drive nor a series of store closures have proven to be enough. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is now expected to use the bankruptcy proceedings to give it time to conduct a liquidation of some or most of its assets. Individual shareholders will likely be wiped out in the process.Should a bidder for the business come forward, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond said it would pursue a sale and move away from liquidation.The retail chain, which was once a hugely popular staple of suburban American life, had previously tried to overhaul its operations to combat flagging demand for its privately branded products. This push ultimately proved unfruitful with Bed Bath &amp; Beyond posting a loss of about $393M and a 33% fall in sales in the quarter ended on November 26.5.

(NASDAQ:HAS) For Its Upcoming Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-might-not-sense-buy-123339023.html,1682253219,STORY,['HAS'],"[Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Therefore, if you purchase Hasbro's shares on or after the 28th of April, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 15th of May.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.70 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$2.80 per share. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Hasbro has a trailing yield of 5.4% on the current share price of $51.69. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. As a result, readers should always check whether Hasbro has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. See our latest analysis for Hasbro Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Hasbro paid out 191% of profit in the past year, which we think is typically not sustainable unless there are mitigating characteristics such as unusually strong cash flow or a large cash balance. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Hasbro paid out more free cash flow than it generated - 194%, to be precise - last year, which we think is concerningly high. We're curious about why the company paid out more cash than it generated last year, since this can be one of the early signs that a dividend may be unsustainable.Story continuesAs Hasbro's dividend was not well covered by either earnings or cash flow, we would be concerned that this dividend could be at risk over the long term.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with shrinking earnings are tricky from a dividend perspective. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. Hasbro's earnings per share have fallen at approximately 14% a year over the previous five years. Such a sharp decline casts doubt on the future sustainability of the dividend.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Hasbro has lifted its dividend by approximately 6.9% a year on average. That's intriguing, but the combination of growing dividends despite declining earnings can typically only be achieved by paying out a larger percentage of profits. Hasbro is already paying out a high percentage of its income, so without earnings growth, we're doubtful of whether this dividend will grow much in the future.The Bottom LineShould investors buy Hasbro for the upcoming dividend? Not only are earnings per share declining, but Hasbro is paying out an uncomfortably high percentage of both its earnings and cashflow to shareholders as dividends. This is a clearly suboptimal combination that usually suggests the dividend is at risk of being cut. If not now, then perhaps in the future. It's not that we think Hasbro is a bad company, but these characteristics don't generally lead to outstanding dividend performance.Although, if you're still interested in Hasbro and want to know more, you'll find it very useful to know what risks this stock faces. For instance, we've identified 4 warning signs for Hasbro (2 don't sit too well with us) you should be aware of.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks To Buy and Hold. Growth stocks were all the rage in the mid-20th century because they offered more potential for capital appreciation. In recent years, however, dividend stocks have witnessed a renewed interest as investors have become more focused on income generation and risk management. Dividend stocks can provide some stability and downside protection in times of market volatility. Companies in the S&amp;P 500 distributed a record $565 billion in dividend payments in 2022, a year that was one of the most challenging periods for the stock market.Analysts gave a positive stance about dividend growth this year as well. However, recent events surrounding Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapse have cast doubts on the performance of dividend stocks in 2023. Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, previously estimated dividends to grow by 6% to 7.5% this year. The analyst now anticipates a modest dividend growth of about 5%, which would still result in record payouts but is less than what he projected earlier this year. The bank turmoil has affected future spending for both consumers and companies, which may hinder dividend growth as well. Last month’s performance of the market also shows the impact of the bank’s failure on dividend payments. From March 8 through April 18, the S&amp;P 500 gained 4% on the banks of tech companies that pay less in dividends, as reported by Barron’s. Nevertheless, dividend stocks that have raised their payouts over time are still delivering stable returns. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks the performance of companies with dividend growth tracks of 25 years or more, is up 2.05% year-to-date and gained 8.69% in the last six months.Investors are still loading up on dividend stocks this year due to high inflation and fluctuating market conditions. Dividend-focused exchange-traded funds are especially gaining fame among investors because of their long-term growth potential, diversification, and professional management. According to a report by Wall Street Journal, there are currently 180 US dividend ETFs, with total assets worth over $384 billion. As of April 14, investors have poured over $2.8 billion into ETFs that purchase dividend-paying stocks. The report also highlighted that dividends are a good inflation hedge as S&amp;P 500 dividend growth has outpaced inflation from 2000 through March 2023.Story continuesSome of the best dividend stocks that have grabbed investors' attention include McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL), and Roper Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:ROP). In this article, we will discuss 15 best dividend stocks to buy and hold.15 Best Dividend Stocks To Buy and HoldPhoto by buian_photos on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we scanned through various credible sources, including Business Insider, Forbes, Morningstar, and Barron's, and identified their consensus picks from their recent articles.

Since diversified information technology company IBM’s 2019 acquisition of Red Hat, the company has aggressively pursued a hybrid cloud strategy. Though IBM and its new management team have made solid progress on this pivot, we believe the company still meaningfully lags the cloud hyperscalers and other cloud-native companies.

This means the annual payment is 5.0% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry. See our latest analysis for Seagate Technology Holdings Seagate Technology Holdings Doesn't Earn Enough To Cover Its PaymentsWhile it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable. Seagate Technology Holdings is unprofitable despite paying a dividend, and it is paying out 102% of its free cash flow. This is quite a strong warning sign that the dividend may not be sustainable.EPS is forecast to rise very quickly over the next 12 months. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we could see the payout ratio reach 96%, which is on the unsustainable side.historic-dividendSeagate Technology Holdings Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.28 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.80. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 8.1% per annum over that time. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.Seagate Technology Holdings May Find It Hard To Grow The DividendInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Unfortunately things aren't as good as they seem. However, Seagate Technology Holdings' EPS was effectively flat over the past five years, which could stop the company from paying more every year.The Dividend Could Prove To Be UnreliableIn summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about Seagate Technology Holdings' payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. In the past the payments have been stable, but we think the company is paying out too much for this to continue for the long term. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 3 warning signs for Seagate Technology Holdings that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks To Buy and Hold. Growth stocks were all the rage in the mid-20th century because they offered more potential for capital appreciation. In recent years, however, dividend stocks have witnessed a renewed interest as investors have become more focused on income generation and risk management. Dividend stocks can provide some stability and downside protection in times of market volatility. Companies in the S&amp;P 500 distributed a record $565 billion in dividend payments in 2022, a year that was one of the most challenging periods for the stock market.Analysts gave a positive stance about dividend growth this year as well. However, recent events surrounding Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapse have cast doubts on the performance of dividend stocks in 2023. Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, previously estimated dividends to grow by 6% to 7.5% this year. The analyst now anticipates a modest dividend growth of about 5%, which would still result in record payouts but is less than what he projected earlier this year. The bank turmoil has affected future spending for both consumers and companies, which may hinder dividend growth as well. Last month’s performance of the market also shows the impact of the bank’s failure on dividend payments. From March 8 through April 18, the S&amp;P 500 gained 4% on the banks of tech companies that pay less in dividends, as reported by Barron’s. Nevertheless, dividend stocks that have raised their payouts over time are still delivering stable returns. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks the performance of companies with dividend growth tracks of 25 years or more, is up 2.05% year-to-date and gained 8.69% in the last six months.Investors are still loading up on dividend stocks this year due to high inflation and fluctuating market conditions. Dividend-focused exchange-traded funds are especially gaining fame among investors because of their long-term growth potential, diversification, and professional management. According to a report by Wall Street Journal, there are currently 180 US dividend ETFs, with total assets worth over $384 billion. As of April 14, investors have poured over $2.8 billion into ETFs that purchase dividend-paying stocks. The report also highlighted that dividends are a good inflation hedge as S&amp;P 500 dividend growth has outpaced inflation from 2000 through March 2023.Story continuesSome of the best dividend stocks that have grabbed investors' attention include McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL), and Roper Technologies, Inc.

Management has also laid out aggressive long-term targets for revenue growth and free cash flow, both of which we believe the company will struggle to achieve as it faces intense competition in its hybrid cloud business and structural headwinds in the company’s legacy businesses.”10.

That’s a surefire path to reaping strong returns. The stocks and cryptocurrencies below all look to be trading below where they should based on their intrinsic values and other factors. Granted, 2023 has started off with a lot of fear and unexpected shocks. However, there is reason to be optimistic. The Federal Reserve may or may not raise rates again in May with current trends favoring another down-to-the-wire decision as inflation cools. In either case, stocks should continue to inch upward as the majority of the hikes have passed. CRMSalesforce$198.72TYLTyler Technologies$372.71KKellogg$67.20ADA-USDCardano$0.39ASMLASML.$635.32XRP-USDXRP.$0.47VET-USDVeChain$0.02Salesforce (CRM)Salesforce (CRM) company logo seen displayed on smart phone. Salesforce Layoffs 2023Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comIt’s difficult to imagine that a leading company like Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) will see its stock held low for much longer. The customer relationship management firm is the largest player in the space and benefits from a leading market share. The company has had its share of troubles but the other leading industry names collectively control about as much market share as Salesforce. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSize matters as does the fact that Salesforce is coming off of a strong earnings period. Full year revenue increased by nearly 18% with Q4 growth of 14%. Salesforce gave guidance that it expects roughly 10% top-line growth overall in its fiscal year 2024. While that may not be a stellar number, there are a few things to note. The company’s cash flow increased by 19% meaning more money in than out. The company could be waiting for an opportunity to spend soon, potentially increasing growth. In any case, Salesforce is going to be receiving attention because of cooling inflation and fed rate hikes which will bring growth back into focus and investor capital inflows. Story continuesTyler Technologies (TYL)A large amount of SALE signs.Source: akamakis / Shutterstock.comOne of the clearest arguments favoring Tyler Technologies (NYSE:TYL) as an undervalued stock has to do with trajectory. Share prices of the public sector software provider are below where they were just prior to the onset of the pandemic. But Tyler Technologies is roughly twice as large as it was back then based on revenues. That has to matter. The company is expected to report approximately $1.95 billion in sales in 2023. That’s a significant increase over the $1.09 billion in sales from the company in 2019. However, the firm is expected to see a sales contraction during the current quarter which doesn’t exactly favor the stock. That probably explains why shares have fallen recently but realistically the company is still far bigger than it was in early 2020 when it traded for more. In short, it has nearly twice the revenues and trades for less than it did then. I don’t see why it should continue to go lower, quite the opposite. Kellogg (K)Kellogg's sign on their Canada's head office building in MississaugaSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comKellogg (NYSE:K) stock is undervalued based on the notion that its current strategy will work. That strategy, to isolate its snacking business, has a strong precedent in Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ). Kellogg will name its new snacking business Kellanova to focus on the growth in that business by separating it from its slower-growing parent. The strategy is similar to what Kraft (NYSE:KHC) did by spinning off newly created Mondelez a decade ago. Basically, Kellogg wants to do what Kraft did by focusing on snacking growth that would have otherwise been inseparable from the larger firm. The new firm even follows naming conventions that leverage the use of Latin words. What’s important is the fact that Kraft’s Mondelez strategy was successful and shares have more than doubled in the last decade. Kellanova could very well evolve into a similar story when Kellogg separates the snacking business as Kellanova later in 2023. Cardano (ADA-USD)A concept token for Cardano with a trading chart in the background.Source: ShutterstockCryptocurrencies such as Cardano (ADA-USD) are much more difficult to characterize as undervalued or overpriced than stocks. Crypto is still very much nascent and pricing mechanisms remain much more tenuous and underdeveloped. That said, Cardano appears to be one of the low-priced blockchain-based assets that may indeed be very, very cheap. Again, it’s very difficult to do much more than say that a given crypto once traded for much more and is building something that could become important and valuable. As that applies to Cardano, it was worth several dollars a few years ago. Crypto crashed. Now it’s worth $0.45 but has appreciated rapidly in price in 2023 after beginning the year at $0.25.  Cardano may indeed be building something valuable. Most crypto watchers are still busy in 2023 trying to make sense of the somewhat nebulous blockchain/crypto world. But Cardano could truly create a viable long-term project out of the chaos simply because the parent firm strictly adheres to a scientific approach in developing the platform. No trendy dog breeds and no wild origin stories, just computer science applied to an emerging technological field. ASML (ASML)Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboardSource: Ralf Liebhold / ShutterstockASML (NASDAQ:ASML) stock raises an important question for the markets. What price can you put on the shares of a company that produces something no other firm can in a vitally important industry? The answer for ASML is that the market currently values it at $665 but analysts believe it is much more valuable, at $755. As I mentioned, ASML is one of one. No other company on earth can make the EUV lithography systems it does. It is the only firm that has the technological know-how to fabricate the extreme ultraviolet systems used by leading global firms to fabricate leading-edge semiconductors. That has led some to dub ASML the world’s most important company since everything in our world relies on chips. No one else can afford to make the machines which require inputs from roughly 5000 different suppliers. Scarcity often creates overpriced assets but ASML is the rare chance to get the opposite. XRP (XRP-USD)Coin cryptocurrency ripple on the background of a stack of coinsSource: ShutterstockXRP (XRP-USD) is a story of an undervalued crypto that will continue to be retold throughout this year. Until the court case against the firm from the US SEC is settled there will be a clear opportunity at hand. The SEC’s case against XRP stem from its contention that XRP was offered as a security and thus subject to SEC oversight. As time has gone on it has become apparent that the courts are leaning heavily in favor of XRP and parent company, Ripple. Current indications are that a verdict favoring Ripple could come soon, perhaps next month if not later in 2023. That news certainly suggests XRP prices could rise quickly in the near term. That makes it very undervalued given the overwhelming expectation that it will emerge victorious. The case, like most prominent court cases, harbors greater ramifications for the legal landscape. If XRP prevails that will send a massive positive signal rippling across all of crypto that the regulatory bodies won’t be able to control crypto as they hoped. VeChain (VET-USD)A concept token for VeChain (VET).Source: ShutterstockVeChain (VET-USD) is another cryptocurrency that is arguably undervalued. Unlike XRP, its future potential has little to do with regulators. Instead, VeChain is full of potential exactly because it is one of many cryptos attempting to solve the problem of traceability. VeChain assigns unique identifiers to products which are then tracked during each step during said products’ journey throughout the supply chain. The company has successfully proven that its technology increases efficiency and traceability of products. Therefore, it’s evident that VeChain can provide real world utility that leverages blockchain ledger technology to improve business outcomes. The other inherent application for VeChain is in transparency with all kinds of NGOs and nonprofits seeing real utility in humanitarian efforts like human trafficking, smuggling, and so on. But at the same time, the success of the company and VeChain is a question of adoption. VET currently trades for $0.02 indicating that there’s a lot more to be done. As long as the company continues to develop real logistics-based solutions the potential for growth remains clear. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. In this article, we decided to focus on Occidental Petroleum's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Occidental Petroleum is:44% = US$13b ÷ US$30b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.44 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Occidental Petroleum's Earnings Growth And 44% ROETo begin with, Occidental Petroleum has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 30% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Probably as a result of this, Occidental Petroleum was able to see a decent net income growth of 11% over the last five years.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Occidental Petroleum's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 16% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is OXY worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether OXY is currently mispriced by the market.Is Occidental Petroleum Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Occidental Petroleum has a low LTM (or last twelve month) payout ratio of 3.9%, meaning that the company retains the remaining 96% of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business.Additionally, Occidental Petroleum has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to rise to 16% over the next three years. Therefore, the expected rise in the payout ratio explains why the company's ROE is expected to decline to 18% over the same period.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with Occidental Petroleum's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a respectable growth in its earnings. That being so, according to the latest industry analyst forecasts, the company's earnings are expected to shrink in the future.

However, finding diamonds in the rough can be very rewarding for long-term investors. Thus, the search for stock gems is on, with many investors looking through this period of weakness to better days.Stock gems can take varying forms. For those in or nearing retirement, perhaps these stocks provide steady, and preferably rising, dividends. Growth investors, on the other hand, are looking for stock gems that can outpace their peers. And when assessing any stock, you want to find a valuation profile that you’re comfortable with.The three stocks below offer all of these things — growth, income and value — and should outperform over the next decade or two. I own two of them but haven’t pulled the trigger on the other.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith that said, let’s dive into why these stock gems are worth accumulating at this point in the market cycle.QSRRestaurant Brands$69.04OXYOccidental Petroleum$62.03KOCoca-Cola$63.96Restaurant Brands (QSR)Source: ShutterstockRestaurant Brands (NYSE:QSR) is one stock I’d certainly call undervalued at its current price despite gaining 15% over the past year. The parent company of a number of world-class fast food chains, including Tim Hortons and Burger King, Restaurant Brands has delivered impressive growth in recent quarters.Despite inflation and other macroeconomic headwinds, Restaurant Brands saw revenue increase 13.4% in 2022 to $6.5 billion. Even more impressive, earnings per diluted share were up nearly 21% to $3.25. Meanwhile, the company saw strong performance across its four segments, three of which delivered double-digit percentage sales growth last year. This sort of growth is sustainable given the rather under-penetrated markets in Asia the company is focusing on. Additionally, the appointment of Joshua Kobza as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) in March 2022 is a positive development. Story continuesOn the dividend front, there’s a lot to like. With a yield of 3.2%, QSR provides stability and a solid base of returns for long-term investors. Notably, Restaurant Brands has been consistent in raising its distribution, suggesting that as long as earnings are growing, this is a company that should provide even more income over time. I like that.On the valuation front, QSR stock is fairly priced at around 21 times earnings. This is lower than the stock’s five-year average, though it’s still a premium to the market multiple. I think investors are rightly paying up for the defensiveness this business offers. And valuation expansion is likely if we head into dire economic times.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is a major oil and gas player with operations in the United States, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. In addition to higher energy prices, OXY stock has benefitted from being a favorite of legendary investor Warren Buffett, who has been a big accumulator of the stock in recent quarters. Buffett’s views on growth, income and value are second to none.The company’s dividend has been reduced in the past to preserve the company’s liquidity profile. That said, after Occidental’s most recent earnings release, it raised its dividend by 38.5%. With a forward payout ratio of 12.8%, even if energy prices decline considerably, this is an income stock with plenty of room to maintain its distribution.Much of this is due to the company’s strong fundamentals. For the fourth quarter of 2022, Occidental generated adjusted earnings of $1.61 per share on $8.3 billion in revenue. This fell short of analyst estimates, but revenue was up more than 150% year over year. While revenue and earnings are expected to decline this year, the company’s solid fundamentals make up for its slowing growth profile.Concerns around growth are evident in the company’s valuation multiples, which are at rock-bottom levels. Trading at around 5 times trailing earnings, this stock is about as cheap as they come. Thus, it’s no surprise Buffett continues to load up on shares at these levels.Coca-Cola (KO)coca-cola bottles and cans. coke is a blue-chip stocksSource: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.comAs the most popular drink company worldwide, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is a stock gem that requires no introduction. With a market capitalization of $277 billion and operations in more than 200 nations, Coca-Cola is the largest alcohol-free drink producer worldwide. Despite having a sizable global footprint, the organization believes there is still potential for growth given that it holds a 36.5% market share in North America and far less in emerging markets. Having been in operation for almost 150 years, Coca-Cola is a reputable and profitable company. Management is committed to returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Last year, the business generated cash flow from operations of $9.5 billion and earnings of $2.19 per share. In 2022, Coca-Cola used only 20% of its free cash flow to fulfill its dividend commitment, leaving significant room for a considerable payout increase next year, even without considering the cash flow generated from selling assets. Due to its diversified product range and more efficient operations, Coca-Cola could continue raising its dividend for many years, as it has done for the past 60 years. Thus, the stock’s current dividend yield of 2.9%, alongside its solid growth profile and reasonable valuation, make KO stock a buy in my books.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald has positions in QSR and KO.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230424005250/en/HighlightsQuarterly PerformanceRevenues: Net revenues grew 5% to $11.0 billion, and organic revenues (non-GAAP) grew 12%. Revenue performance included 11% growth in price/mix and 1% growth in concentrate sales. Concentrate sales were 2 points behind unit case volume, largely due to the timing of concentrate shipments and the impact of one less day in the quarter.Operating margin: Operating margin was 30.7% versus 32.5% in the prior year, while comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) was 31.8% versus 31.4% in the prior year. Operating margin decline was primarily driven by items impacting comparability and currency headwinds. Comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) expansion was primarily driven by strong topline growth and the impact of refranchising bottling operations, partially offset by an increase in marketing investments and higher operating costs versus the prior year as well as currency headwinds.Story continuesEarnings per share: EPS grew 12% to $0.72, and comparable EPS (non-GAAP) grew 5% to $0.68. Comparable EPS (non-GAAP) performance included the impact of a 7-point currency headwind.Market share: The company gained value share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) beverages.Cash flow: Cash flow from operations was $160 million, a decline of approximately $460 million versus the prior year, largely due to the timing of working capital initiatives and payments related to acquisitions and divestitures. Free cash flow (non-GAAP) declined approximately $520 million versus the prior year, resulting in negative free cash flow of approximately $120 million.Company UpdatesGrowing loved brands through consumer-centric innovation and occasion-based marketing: smartwater®, a billion-dollar brand that is available in 28 markets, grew volume 8% in the first quarter. The company continues to innovate with the brand, recently launching smartwater alkaline with antioxidant to offer premium hydration for consumers with active lifestyles. The innovation features a higher pH level, the antioxidant selenium and a unique electrolyte blend for a crisp, pure taste. The launch was supported by the ""Elevate How You Hydrate"" marketing campaign, which was promoted through digital platforms such as Spotify, Meta and TikTok, as well as through partnerships with comedian Pete Davidson, Peloton instructor Alex Toussaint and others. The campaign used geolocation apps to drive incremental occasions with on-the-go consumers and segmented experiential sampling in gyms and fitness centers in select U.S. cities.Driving value through continued excellence in integrated execution in India: The company, in close alignment with its bottling partners, continues to raise the bar in India in integrated execution to deliver value for its customers and consumers. The company grew its business in the first quarter in India by adding retailers, investing in cold-drink equipment and offering the right products at the right price points to recruit consumers. During the first quarter, the company and its bottling partners increased availability by more than 300,000 stores and approximately 40,000 coolers ahead of the summer season and drove approximately 3 billion transactions at affordable price points through single-serve packages and at-home entry packs. The company also increased household penetration via targeted promotions on large packages for the at-home channel. This integrated execution yielded strong results, as the company grew revenue ahead of transactions and grew transactions ahead of volume, while also growing value share in the sparkling soft drinks and juice categories.Collaborating with cutting-edge technology platforms to experiment, learn and drive results: The company is adopting emerging technologies to drive new approaches, more experimentation and improved speed to market. Coca-Cola is the first company to collaborate with OpenAI and Bain &amp; Company to harness the power of ChatGPT and DALL-E to enhance marketing capabilities and business operations and to build capabilities through cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI). Within one month of announcing this collaboration, the company launched the ""Create Real Magic"" platform, which allowed consumers to become digital marketeers by leveraging AI to generate original artwork with iconic creative assets from the Coca-Cola archives. The company is also exploring ways to leverage AI to improve customer service and ordering as well as point-of-sale material creation in collaboration with its bottling partners.Laying out a roadmap to 2030 Water Security Strategy and driving collective action: Water is a priority for the company because it is essential for beverages and the communities the company serves. Sustainable access to water is critical for the company’s success and the resilience of its agricultural supply chain. During the UN 2023 Water Conference in March, the company announced three goals to accelerate action by investing more in its Leadership Locations, which are basins designated based on needs for the company, its supply chain and impacted communities. In addition, the company is working with other partners and stakeholders to improve watershed health and communities’ access to clean water and sanitation as part of the Business Leaders’ Open Call to Accelerate Action on Water – a partnership to achieve collective positive water impact in at least 100 vulnerable water basins by 2030.Operating Review – Three Months Ended March 31, 2023Revenues and VolumePercent ChangeConcentrate Sales1Price/MixCurrency ImpactAcquisitions, Divestitures and Structural Changes, NetReported Net RevenuesOrganic Revenues2Unit Case Volume3Consolidated111(6)(1)5123Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa222(13)01023(3)Latin America118(5)014195North America(2)1100990Asia Pacific(2)5(8)2(3)310Global Ventures48(3)(8)0(3)57Bottling Investments38(9)(7)(5)11(1)Operating Income and EPSPercent ChangeReported Operating IncomeItems Impacting ComparabilityCurrency ImpactComparable Currency Neutral Operating Income2Consolidated(1)(7)(9)15Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa131(17)28Latin America122(8)18North America(2)(23)021Asia Pacific(15)1(9)(7)Global Ventures1(5)(1)8Bottling Investments(28)1(7)(23)Percent ChangeReported EPSItems Impacting ComparabilityCurrency ImpactComparable Currency Neutral EPS2Consolidated127(7)13Note: Certain rows may not add due to rounding.1 For Bottling Investments, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume computed based on total sales (rather than average daily sales) in each of the corresponding periods after considering the impact of structural changes, if any.2 Organic revenues, comparable currency neutral operating income and comparable currency neutral EPS are non-GAAP financial measures.

The company is not able to reconcile full-year 2023 projected organic revenues (non-GAAP) to full-year 2023 projected reported net revenues, full-year 2023 projected comparable net revenues (non-GAAP) to full-year 2023 projected reported net revenues, full-year 2023 projected comparable cost of goods sold (non-GAAP) to full-year 2023 projected reported cost of goods sold, full-year 2023 projected underlying effective tax rate (non-GAAP) to full-year 2023 projected reported effective tax rate, full-year 2023 projected comparable currency neutral EPS (non-GAAP) to full-year 2023 projected reported EPS, or full-year 2023 projected comparable EPS (non-GAAP) to full-year 2023 projected reported EPS without unreasonable efforts because it is not possible to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the exact timing and exact impact of acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes throughout 2023; the exact impact of changes in commodity costs throughout 2023; the exact timing and exact amount of items impacting comparability throughout 2023; and the exact impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates throughout 2023. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on the company’s full-year 2023 reported financial results.Full Year 2023The company expects to deliver organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth of 7% to 8%. – No ChangeFor comparable net revenues (non-GAAP), the company expects a 2% to 3% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to an approximate 1% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes. – No ChangeThe company expects commodity price inflation to be a mid single-digit percentage headwind on comparable cost of goods sold (non-GAAP) based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions. – No ChangeThe company’s underlying effective tax rate (non-GAAP) is estimated to be 19.5%. This does not include the impact of ongoing tax litigation with the IRS, if the company were not to prevail. – No ChangeGiven the above considerations, the company expects to deliver comparable currency neutral EPS (non-GAAP) growth of 7% to 9% and comparable EPS (non-GAAP) growth of 4% to 5%, versus $2.48 in 2022. – No ChangeComparable EPS (non-GAAP) percentage growth is expected to include a 3% to 4% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to a slight headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes. – No ChangeThe company expects to generate free cash flow (non-GAAP) of approximately $9.5 billion through cash flow from operations of approximately $11.4 billion, less capital expenditures of approximately $1.9 billion. This does not include any potential payments related to ongoing tax litigation with the IRS. – No ChangeSecond Quarter 2023 Considerations – NewComparable net revenues (non-GAAP) are expected to include a 3% to 4% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to an approximate 1% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.Comparable EPS (non-GAAP) percentage growth is expected to include a 2% to 3% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions.NotesAll references to growth rate percentages, share and stores added compare the results of the period to those of the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise noted.All references to volume and volume percentage changes indicate unit case volume, unless otherwise noted. All volume percentage changes are computed based on average daily sales, unless otherwise noted. ""Unit case"" means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings), with the exception of unit case equivalents for Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products which are primarily measured in number of transactions. ""Unit case volume"" means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of company beverages directly or indirectly sold by the company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers.""Concentrate sales"" represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, beverage bases, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, ""concentrate sales"" represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by the company to customers or consumers. In the reconciliation of reported net revenues, ""concentrate sales"" represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in concentrate sales volume for the geographic operating segments and the Global Ventures operating segment after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. For the Bottling Investments operating segment, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume computed based on total sales (rather than average daily sales) in each of the corresponding periods after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. The Bottling Investments operating segment reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only.""Price/mix"" represents the change in net operating revenues caused by factors such as price changes, the mix of products and packages sold, and the mix of channels and geographic territories where the sales occurred.First quarter 2023 financial results were impacted by one less day as compared to first quarter 2022, and fourth quarter 2023 financial results will be impacted by one additional day as compared to fourth quarter 2022. Unit case volume results for the quarters are not impacted by the variances in days due to the average daily sales computation referenced above.Conference CallThe company is hosting a conference call with investors and analysts to discuss first quarter 2023 operating results today, April 24, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. ET. The company invites participants to listen to a live webcast of the conference call on the company’s website, http://www.coca-colacompany.com, in the ""Investors"" section.

For example, a report published by the JAMA Network indicates that experts project the global economic cost of cancers from 2020 to 2050 will be $25.2 trillion (in constant 2017 dollar terms). Therefore, finding a cure would translate to a massive economic boon.On a related note, society eagerly anticipates these breakthroughs. Therefore, biotech stocks to buy tend to march to their own beat. Sure, broader market pressures will cause any sector to tumble. However, recession or not, people will always search for innovative treatments to vexing conditions and diseases. Thus, while the sector can be volatile, from another perspective, it’s a wise place to put funds to work. Below then are seven biotech stocks to buy.BGNEBeiGene$258.50INCYIncyte$73.81BMRNBiomarin$99.06ARGXargenx$382.12UTHRUnited Therapeutics$226.68TECHBio-Techne$84.98LEGNLegend Biotech$62.50InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBiotech Stocks to Buy: BeiGene (BGNE)Biotechnology stocks, biomedical stocksSource: aslysun / Shutterstock.comBilled as a biotechnology specialist seeking to develop therapies that are more accessible to people around the world, BeiGene (NASDAQ:BGNE) presents a feel-good narrative. Operationally, the company focuses on developing drugs for cancer treatment. Presently featuring a market capitalization of $29 billion, BGNE ranks as one of the larger biotech stocks to buy. In the trailing one-year period, shares gained nearly 51% of equity value.Financially, the company admittedly presents a mixed bag. On the positive front, BeiGene sports an Altman Z-Score of 6.73. This indicates high fiscal stability and low risk of imminent bankruptcy. As well, it enjoys a three-year revenue growth rate of 24.4%, ranking higher than 72.61% of companies listed in the biotech space.On the other hand, its profit margins sit in negative territory, reflecting significant risk. Plus, the company appears overvalued relative to its pricing of 6.35-times book value.Story continuesNevertheless, Wall Street analysts peg BGNE as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target comes out to $308.04, implying over 15% upside potential.Biotech Stocks to Buy: Incyte (INCY)Photo of test tubes and droplet with purple and reddish-orange sunset visual effect, representing biotechSource: shutterstock.com/Romix ImageA multinational pharmaceutical company, Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY) develops and manufacturers prescription biopharmaceutical medications in multiple therapeutic areas including oncology, inflammation and autoimmunity. Carrying a market cap of $16.45 billion, INCY also rates as one of the larger players among biotech stocks to buy. However, that didn’t spare it volatility, with INCY shedding over 7% since the Jan. opener.Still, contrarians will want to take a closer look at Incyte. On the balance sheet, the company features a strong cash-to-debt ratio of 78.13 times, above 74.79% of other biotech stocks to buy. Operationally, Incyte commands a three-year revenue growth rate of 15.2%, above nearly 63% of sector players.Notably, the market prices INCY at a forward multiple of 18.87. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than 73.21% of the competition. Lastly, covering analysts peg INCY as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $87.46, implying almost 19% upside potential.Biotech Stocks to Buy: BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN)Medical technology network team meeting concept. Doctor hand working smart phone modern digital tablet laptop computer graphics chart interface, sun flare effect photo, PTESource: everything possible / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in San Rafael, California, BioMarin Pharmaceutical (NASDAQ:BMRN) has offices and facilities in the United States, South America, Asia and Europe. According to its public profile, BioMarin’s core business and research is in enzyme replacement therapies. BioMarin was the first company to provide therapeutics for mucopolysaccharidosis type I, by manufacturing laronidase. Thanks to its relevance, BMRN gained over 22% of equity value in the trailing year.Still, it’s possible that BioMarin can keep delivering for investors. On the balance sheet, the company’s Altman Z-Score pings at 6.9, reflecting very low risk of bankruptcy. Operationally, BioMarin enjoys a three-year book growth rate of 12.5%, outflanking 60.51% of other biotech stocks to buy. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period stands at 99.5%.About the one major drawback centers on BMRN being overvalued against earnings (both trailing and projected). However, it sports solid profit margins, making it attractive. Moreover, analysts peg BMRN as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target hits $118.19, implying 20% upside potential.argenx (ARGX)Biochemical/biotech research scientist team working with microscopeSource: Mongkolchon Akesin / Shutterstock.comLocated in the Netherlands, argenx (NASDAQ:ARGX) claims to reach patients through immunology innovation. Specifically, Argenx created an antibody innovation ecosystem where pioneering scientists and antibody engineers work side-by-side to accelerate the discovery of novel targets, disease pathways and differentiated therapeutic antibodies. So far this year, ARGX gained only half a percent. However, in the trailing year, it’s up 17%.Financially, the company’s main strengths centers on its balance sheet. Featuring a cash-to-debt ratio of 176.45 times, Argenx should be able to ride out some lean cycles. Notably, its Altman Z-Score pings at a stratospherically high 38.27, indicating extremely low risk of imminent bankruptcy.Operationally, the company currently features a three-year revenue growth rate of 57.4%, beating out 85% of biotech stocks to buy. However, Gurufocus warns ARGX could be a possible value trap. Nevertheless, Argenx may be able to buy time thanks again to its cash position. So, speculators should watch this name.Plus, analysts peg ARGX as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target stands at $456.72, implying almost 22% upside potential.United Therapeutics (UTHR)Pipette adding fluid to one of several test tubes; biotech NVTA StockSource: motorolka / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Silver Spring, Maryland, United Therapeutics (NASDAQ:UTHR) develops novel, life-extending technologies for patients in the areas of lung disease and organ manufacturing. United just ranks on the cusp of large cap status with a market value of almost $11 billion. Unfortunately, since the January opener, UTRH incurred volatility, slipping nearly 17%. Of course, the upshot is that in the past 365 days, it’s up nearly 24%.As with other biotech stocks to buy, United presents a mixed bag. On the balance sheet, the company sports an Altman Z-Score of 7.76, delivering great fiscal stability. Operationally, the biotech features an okay three-year revenue growth rate of 6.5%. However, on the bottom line, its net margin of 37.56% beats out 94.26% of sector players.Further, the market prices UTHR at a forward multiple of 11.29. As a discount to projected earnings, United ranks better than 87.5% of rival biotech stocks to buy. Turning to the Street, analysts peg UTHR as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target comes out to $282.88, implying 24% upside potential.Bio-Techne (TECH)A scientist holding up her biotech experiment in a small Petri dish.Source: ShutterstockBased in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Bio-Techne (NASDAQ:TECH) develops, manufactures and sells life science reagents, instruments and services for the research, diagnostic and bioprocessing markets. Presently, the company carries a market cap of over $13 billion. Since the Jan. opener, TECH gained a modest 2%. However, in the trailing year, it’s down over 18%.Generally, Bio-Techne offers some intriguing, perhaps enticing fiscal stats. First, on the balance sheet, the company commands an Altman Z-Score of 16.86, reflecting extremely low bankruptcy risk. Operationally, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 13.6%, outpacing 61.09% of competing biotech stocks to buy. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period comes out to an impressive 22.8%.As well, Bio-Techne posts consistent profitability. Currently, its trailing-year net margin hits 23.38%, above 88.62% of its peers. Finally, analysts peg TECH as a consensus strong buy. Overall, their average price target lands at $106.13, implying nearly 26% upside potential.Legend Biotech (LEGN)Image of two scientists in lab coats studying results in a labSource: ShutterstockCalling Somerset, New Jersey home, Legend Biotech (NASDAQ:LEGN) is a global, commercial-stage biotechnology company developing and manufacturing novel therapies. Currently, it’s one of the smaller of the large biotech stocks to buy, posting a market cap of $8.6 billion. Since the beginning of this year, LEGN gained over 7% of equity value. In the past 365 days, it’s up nearly 37%, an impressive figure.However, Legend largely banks on speculative interest. One main positive here is that the company’s Altman Z-Score pings at 11.08, indicating low bankruptcy risk. Also, Legend prints a modestly positive three-year revenue growth rate of 8.8%, beating out 55.76% of its peers.On the other hand, the company’s EBITDA growth rate during the aforementioned period sits at 28.1% below breakeven. Also, its operating and net margins on a trailing-year basis sit well into negative territory.Nevertheless, for speculators, LEGN may be one of the biotech stocks to buy. And that’s because analysts peg it as a unanimous strong buy (among nine experts). Also, their average price target stands at $72.33, implying over 38% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

In 2021, ten nonprofits were each awarded $40,000 in grants for their efforts promoting climate solutions throughout Southern California. Five of these organizations have been selected in 2022 to receive an additional $40,000 each in a one-time second phase granting process.""We are always looking for new ways to support projects and programs that promote wellbeing in the communities we serve,"" says Jawaad Malik, chief sustainability and strategy officer at SoCalGas. ""These outreach efforts highlight how our company's ASPIRE 2045 vision, together with our community partners, can lead to real, actionable solutions that help improve air quality and reduce our carbon footprint.""One of the recipients of the second-phase grant is LA Compost's project, Bringing Community Level Composting Access to Los Angeles. The program develops community-based composting systems for food scrap collection, as well as compost education, creation, and uses.""Our community level-systems strive to keep the valuable resource of compost local, especially within Los Angeles neighborhoods most vulnerable to climate change,"" says Michael Martinez, Founder and Executive Director of LA Compost. ""In 2022, our decentralized network in Los Angeles was able to divert nearly four million pounds of food and carbon-based organics from landfills, reduce an estimated 3,750 metric tons of CO2 from entering the atmosphere, and repurpose an estimated 14.3 million gallons of water from food waste through compost production.""Story continuesThe San Diego State University Research Foundation (SDSURF) is also making strides in sustainable agriculture through its Farms of the Future project. Led by Dr. Saeed Manshadi, the project has also been awarded a second-phase grant, with a primary focus on reducing the carbon intensity of agriculture in the Imperial Valley.Dr. Manshadi shared his enthusiasm for the project, stating, ""We are thrilled with the progress we've made so far in advancing sustainable agriculture in the Imperial Valley. Our goal is to encourage at least 30% of farm owners to explore electrification within the first year, and we're delighted to have already exceeded that target. By presenting this road map, we hope to reduce carbon emissions by 30% and help improve air quality in agricultural activities related to transportation, irrigation, and water supply in the food production supply chain.""Other second-phase grant recipients include The Ecology Center's Compost and Expansion and Education Initiative, a project that aims to inspire healthy change in the food system and strengthen the growing number of satellite and school farms they serve; the Cal Poly Pomona Philanthropic Foundation's Low-cost Energy Storage Using Repurposed Desalination Salt project, which aims to use desalination salt as a low cost solution to store excess intermittent renewable energy; and The Amigos De Los Rios' Emerald Necklace – Rio Hondo, San Gabriel River, &amp; School Greening project that plants trees and native shrubs in critical areas along urban river corridors as well as schools.""Climate change is a global issue, but it is important that we develop local solutions that can be replicated throughout the state, supporting our under resourced communities most impacted by pollution and climate change,"" said Assemblymember Eduardo Garcia (D-Coachella). ""SoCalGas' Climate Champions Grant will advance many of the great local projects and research taking place in southern and central California. Funding research projects like these have the potential to reach beyond just one neighborhood or city and could help lay the foundation for the climate solutions of tomorrow.""Over the last two years, the SoCal Climate Champions Grant has awarded $600,000 in grants to support nonprofit organizations.

For more on this, go to the 5 Strongest Militaries in Europe. The EU's military spending stood at a paltry 1.3% in 2014. The increased spending in the following years was motivated by two factors: The Russian takeover of Crimea and the then US President Trump’s demands from EU countries to contribute more to NATO. The EU’s military spending consistently increased over the following years, and aggregated at 32% in real terms in 2021. In the wake of the full-scale Russian military assault on Ukraine that began in 2022, the military spending in Europe is only expected to pick up pace. Many European countries are also aggressively arming Ukraine in order to aid its military resistance against Russia. Germany is highly important in this respect. The country is heavily industrialized, and its defense industry is crucial to re-arming Europe. A military fund worth more than $100 billion that was announced in February of last year in reaction to the Ukrainian invasion was approved by the German lower house parliament in June of 2022. The fund is intended to supplement Germany's normal defense budget over the following few years in order to aid in the military's reconstruction.Germany would become the third-largest military spender behind the US and China since the fund should allow it to reach NATO's 2% defense spending target, given its GDP size.European and even some US defense companies are already poised to reap great benefits from the ongoing arms procurement. According to reports, the German Rheinmetall AG plans to increase tank output from 40,000 to 240,000 units annually. Germany, France, Spain, and Italy also signed contracts for the Eurodrone initiative in 2022, in an effort to lessen Europe's reliance on Israeli drones. OCCAR granted these contracts to the French company; Airbus SE. In this regard, General Electric Company (NYSE:GE)-owned Avivo Aero was selected by Airbus SE to design and produce the drone's engine. Story continuesOther US defense companies, such as Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), are also expanding European defense capabilities, in addition to General Electric Company (NYSE:GE). 20 Strongest Militaries in EuropeBPTU/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyWe have defined militarily strong European countries as ones that have advanced strategic military assets, and logistical and financial capability. The last metric is important since financial capacity directly determines defense capability.For this purpose, we have first identified the top 20 European countries on the Global Firepower Index of 2023 and ranked them amongst themselves. Then, we used the 2021 GDPs of these countries to rank them separately amongst themselves as well. Then we've averaged out the rankings on the two indexes for our list. We used countries’ ranking amongst themselves on Global Firepower Index to tiebreak countries with the same averaged-out rankings. The information for countries' military assets also comes from the Global Firepower Index of 2023. For militarily strategic countries, we’ve also brought into discussion their cyberwarfare capabilities, for which, we consulted with the Belfer Center’s National Cyber Power Index of 2022. We also discussed some countries’ number of military bases around the world and space capabilities for military purposes. In that order, we’ve sourced data from The Power Atlas by the European Council on Foreign Relations. Here are the 20 strongest militaries in Europe: 20. BelgiumGlobal Firepower Index Ranking: 25 GDP Ranking: 12 Average Ranking: 18.5Belgium is one of the biggest economies in Europe, having a GDP of $0.6 trillion as of 2021, which allows the country to invest significantly in its military capability. Its military globally ranks 66th on the Global Firepower Index of 2023. The country’s navy operates two frigates, two patrol vessels and five vessels for mine warfare vessels. Its air force is significantly stronger, operating 106 aircraft, including 44 fighters.19. FinlandGlobal Firepower Index Ranking: 19 GDP Ranking: 15 Average Ranking: 17Finland has one of the most advanced air forces in Europe, owing to its aircraft inventory consisting of F/A-18s and F35s, with the latter developed by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT). The country’s navy operates 18 mine warfare vessels and two patrol vessels. In terms of army assets, Finland boasts 239 tanks. 18. Czech RepublicGlobal Firepower Index Ranking: 17 GDP Ranking: 16 Average Ranking: 16.5The Czech Republic has one of the most powerful militaries in Europe, which is, to a large extent, armed by the country’s domestic defense industry, which comprises companies like Česká Zbrojovka (CZ), Aero Vodochody and Tatra. 17. RomaniaGlobal Firepower Index Ranking: 16 GDP Ranking: 17 Average Ranking: 16.5Romania spent 2% of it on its defense in 2021. Being a member of NATO, Romania is also further modernizing its military. As of 2023, its military operates 45 naval assets, including 18 vessels, 413 tanks and 146 aircraft, including 30 fighters.16. DenmarkGlobal Firepower Index Ranking: 18 GDP Ranking: 14 Average Ranking: 16Denmark is a Scandinavian country. The country has 115 aircraft in its inventory, with four F-35s and 33 F-16s. Denmark is home to domestic defense companies like Danish Aerotech A/S, and also hosts US defense companies like Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) and General Electric Company (NYSE:GE). The country's military has had numerous contracts with General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) for Armored Personnel Carriers (APCs).The Danish military operates 74 naval assets, including 24 vessels, 44 tanks and 115 aircraft, which comprise 33 fighter jets. 15. PortugalGlobal Firepower Index Ranking: 14 GDP Ranking: 18 Average Ranking: 16In 2021, defense expenditures were 2.2% of Portugal’s GDP of $254 billion. The premier fighter in the country’s air force is the F-16 fighting falcon, 28 of which are battle-ready.

203,ff4873c2-93e5-3b31-baae-4b3e74db3320,GE,2023-04-24,"General Electric (NYSE:GE) delivers shareholders solid 37% CAGR over 3 years, surging 4.3% in the last week alone",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-electric-nyse-ge-delivers-140348533.html,1682258628,STORY,['GE'],"[One simple way to benefit from the stock market is to buy an index fund. But if you buy good businesses at attractive prices, your portfolio returns could exceed the average market return. For example, the General Electric Company ( NYSE:GE ) share price is up 99% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 43% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 44% in the last year , including dividends .Since it's been a strong week for General Electric shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals.  View our latest analysis for General Electric  While General Electric made a small profit, in the last year, we think that the market is probably more focussed on the top line growth at the moment. Generally speaking, we'd consider a stock like this alongside loss-making companies, simply because the quantum of the profit is so low. It would be hard to believe in a more profitable future without growing revenues.In the last 3 years General Electric saw its revenue shrink by 6.6% per year. Despite the lack of revenue growth, the stock has returned 26%, compound, over three years. If the company is cutting costs profitability could be on the horizon, but the revenue decline is a prima facie concern.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. This free report showing analyst forecasts should help you form a view on General ElectricWhat About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for General Electric the TSR over the last 3 years was 158%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that General Electric has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 44% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 4% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Stocks To Invest In 2023 For Beginners.""One-and-Done Much More Likely, But Not Fully Baked In Just Yet""On April 21 Roger Ferguson, former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he talked about inflation, the Fed, and recession risks. Ferguson thinks that we are now in a ""one-and-done"" situation, which means that he expects the Fed to raise interest rates for the last time at the FOMC meeting in May. However, as inflation is still higher than the 2% target, Ferguson thinks that there may be a June hike as well. Here is what he said:""I think a one-and-done is most likely, but the uniformity and the fact that inflation is still relatively high, it may leave the possibility for a June hike on the table. I would say, one-and-done much more likely but not fully baked in just yet.""The market is pricing in Fed cuts in the back half of 2023. Roger Ferguson spoke about a discrepancy between the market's expectations and the Fed's expectations regarding interest rates in the latter part of 2023 and said that ""the market is more optimistic about Fed cuts than the Fed themselves"". However, economic data will be the determining factor for this as we move into the back half of 2023, noted Ferguson. According to Roger Ferguson, the Fed may keep interest rates elevated for longer than the market is expecting.Roger Ferguson noted that sectors that are sensitive to interest rates, such as housing, are already experiencing challenges and pressures from rising rates. Ferguson thinks the Fed will keep interest rates higher for longer than the market is expecting because, though the labor market is showing signs of weakening, ""it is still not soft"", and there are certain parts of the economy that are still strong which will in turn keep inflation higher than 2%. According to Ferguson, ""the Fed wants to really make sure that the disinflationary process is well advanced before it even starts talking about cutting rates"".Story continuesFinally, Roger Ferguson talked about the risk of recession. Ferguson does not expect a severe recession, rather, he expects a shallow recession and he sees ""some credit tightening in various places"" as opposed to a credit crunch. Here are some comments from Roger Ferguson:""A recession is more likely than not. I still think it's more likely to be a softer recession, as opposed to a hard one. But, the credit tightening that's certainly going on and being talked about in the Fed's Beige Book, does suggest that conditions are a little more fraught, and maybe a slightly harder recession. I'm not yet in the camp that says that we have a real credit crunch, I think we see some credit tightening in various places. Count me still in a sort of soft and shallow recession camp right now, but with the risk to the downside given the changing credit dynamics in the country.""The next FOMC meeting is nearby and a 89.1% of the market is pricing in a 25 basis point rate hike by the Fed, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool. In times like these, investors can feel overwhelmed and confused about what stocks to pick. For risk averse investors, sticking with mature businesses that have stable revenue growth can be an approach to consider. Additionally, finding companies with stable revenue growth that are popular among institutional investors can help retail investors avoid major losses, since hedge fund sentiment is a good indicator of investor confidence in an organization. We have compiled a list of the best beginner stocks to buy in 2023 which include PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP), UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Let's now discuss these stocks, among others, in detail below.10 Best Stocks To Invest In 2023 For BeginnersPhoto by Ruben Sukatendel on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo determine the best beginner stocks to buy now according to hedge funds, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of roughly 900 elite hedge funds and went through the most popular stocks among hedge funds.

205,fb77e632-42ec-3eed-8c66-70fac6a5f2a2,UNH,2023-04-24,The Greatest 7 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy for Your Portfolio,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/greatest-7-blue-chip-stocks-170709839.html,1682010429,STORY,"['NFLX', 'UNH', 'REGN', 'AAPL', 'PYPL', 'RACE', 'SHW']","[While the debate will certainly rage over which ideas legitimately rank as the greatest blue-chip stocks to buy of all time, for right now, certain enterprises stand out for a combination of their relevance and resilience. As well, a select few large-capitalization companies may be too undervalued and beaten down for their own good. Therefore, speculators may enjoy significant upside.To generate this list, I turned to the investment resource Gurufocus, specifically its screener function. Here, I filtered out the best blue-chip stocks to buy for quality and predictability. As well, I’ve incorporated analyst ratings provided by TipRanks so you know what the experts think. So, without any more delay, let’s take a deeper look at the “greatest” blue-chip stocks list.RACEFerrari$275.22AAPLApple$167.72SHWSherwin-Williams$234.83REGNRegeneron$803.62NFLXNetflix$329.59UNHUnitedHealth$489.56PYPLPayPal$74.32InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFerrari (RACE)a bull next to a stack of blue gambling chips to represent blue-chip stocksSource: ShutterstockWhile exotic car manufacturer Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) might seem an odd idea for the best blue-chip stocks to buy, in my view, it makes perfect sense. First, it’s a world-recognized brand with a market cap north of $51 billion. Second, it’s performed very well this year, gaining over 29% of equity value. In contrast, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index moved up just under 9% during the same period.Fundamentally, what makes RACE so special within this rarefied blue-chip stocks list focuses on economic insulation. Brewing headwinds against the consumer economy means that people are cutting back on their purchases, impacting once-resilient sectors like electric vehicles. However, Ferrari remains a powerful brand that constantly generates positive traction because it caters to a completely different wealth class.In other words, there’s rich and then there’s Ferrari rich. And Ferrari rich doesn’t worry about little things like interest rate hikes. They’re truly above it all. Not surprisingly, Wall Street analysts peg RACE as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target comes out to $287.58, implying a bit over 3% upside potential.Story continuesApple (AAPL)A close-up shot of a blue casino chip on red carpet.Source: ShutterstockWith consumer technology giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), I shouldn’t encounter any pushback signaling it as one of the top blue-chip stocks to buy. Thanks to its market cap of $2.65 trillion, Apple basically represents its own powerhouse country. Plus, it continues to perform well, gaining 34% of equity value since the beginning of this year. Furthermore, it’s erased its trailing one-year loss, now staring at a slightly positive return.Fundamentally, Apple’s brand power impresses like nothing else. With mass layoffs and other pressures working against the consumer economy, you’d expect a discretionary player like Apple to suffer. However, the products are too compelling and perhaps too addictive to ignore.Financially, the company features strengths across the board. From a solid balance sheet to double-digit revenue growth to excellent profit margins, you can’t go wrong with AAPL on your blue-chip stocks list. Presently, analysts peg AAPL as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target comes out to $174.28, implying 4% upside potential.Sherwin-Williams (SHW)blue chip definition highlightedSource: ShutterstockA paint and coating manufacturing firm, Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW) doesn’t exactly rank as one of the most exciting large-scale enterprises. However, a case can be made that it stands among the best blue-chip stocks to buy right now. Featuring everyday relevance, SHW can easily be an investment to build for the long run. Plus, its red ink this year may offer a discounted entry point.Financially, it doesn’t offer truly remarkable attributes. However, the company gets the job done. For example, it posts a competent three-year revenue growth rate of 9.8%. Again, not remarkable but it betas out 57.05% of companies listed in the chemicals sector.More importantly, Sherwin-Williams benefits from a consistently profitable enterprise. Its trailing-year operating margin pings at 13.55% while its net margin comes out to 9.12%. Both stats rank in the underlying sector’s upper half. Finally, analysts peg SHW as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $253.71, implying nearly 9% upside potential.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN)Source: ShutterstockOne of the companies that generated tremendous relevance during the worst of the Covid-19 crisis, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) no longer commands the spotlight like it once did when it contributed to restoring former President Donald Trump back to full health. Still, REGN deserves consideration on your blue-chip stocks list.While it no longer generates front-page news, it continues to research and develop new therapeutics. Even better, investors like what they’re seeing. Since the Jan. opener, REGN gained over 12% of its market value. Financially too, Regeneron attracts investors thanks to its rock-solid balance sheet, strong three-year sales trend, and an excellent profit margin of 35.64%.Notably, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 19.23. As a discount to projected earnings, Regeneron ranks better than 71.43% of the competition. Therefore, it’s not only one of the top blue-chip stocks to buy, but it’s also one of the most undervalued. Lastly, analysts peg REGN as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target comes out to $885, implying over 9% upside potential.Netflix (NFLX)Source: ShutterstockOne of the trickier blue-chip stocks to buy, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) carries significant clout as an entertainment stalwart. Obviously, during the worst of the pandemic, Netflix shot up the charts because it offered entertainment to quarantined consumers. However, as fears of the SARS-CoV-2 virus along with governmental restrictions faded away, the phenomenon of revenge travel took over. That left little room for Netflix to sustain its stratospheric growth.At the same time, NFLX stock has been mounting a credible comeback effort. In the trailing one-year period, it gained nearly 43% of its equity value. It still has some ways to go to reach its post-pandemic record highs. Nevertheless, with the consumer economy again struggling, the content streamer could get interesting as a cheap entertainment source.Financially, Netflix benefits from a solid balance sheet and strong operational stats. Notably, it’s a consistently profitable enterprise, featuring a trailing-year net margin of 14.21%. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg NFLX as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $362.37, implying over 12% upside potential.UnitedHealth Group (UNH)10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Grow UpSource: ShutterstockAnother tricky name to put on your blue-chip stocks list, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) on the surface seems like a reasonable enterprise to choose. Sure, it might be a bit choppy. Since the Jan. opener, UNH lost over 6% of its equity value. In the past 365 days, it fell 11%. Nevertheless, as a managed healthcare and insurance giant, UnitedHealth appears resilient.However, one thing to keep in mind is that as layoffs accelerate, UnitedHealth may suffer a reduction in its total addressable market. With the alpha dogs in the business world announcing steep headcount reductions, you want to be careful with UNH.Still, at the end of the day, we’re talking about one of the best blue-chip stocks to buy. Financially, UnitedHealth posts solid strengths in the balance sheet. Operationally, it features a three-year book growth rate of 11.1%, outpacing 73.33% of its peers. Also, it features robust profitability with a net margin of 6.21%, above 79% of the competition.Looking to the Street, analysts peg UNH as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target stands at $602.38, implying nearly 24% upside potential.PayPal (PYPL)Source: ShutterstockEasily the riskiest idea on this list of top blue-chip stocks to buy, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a powerhouse in the digital payments ecosystem. Fundamentally, it aligns with the burgeoning gig economy. Thanks to its intuitive business management ecosystem, it’s easy for gig workers (i.e. independent contractors) to get up and running. Also, the PayPal system keeps records of everything, making it convenient for tax-reporting purposes.However, it’s a tough sell for risk-averse investors. Since the beginning of this year, PYPL gained only 1%. In the trailing one-year period, it fell nearly 21%. Further, trading hands at a little over $75, we’re way off from the time that PYPL commanded a $300 price tag.But then, speculators wonder – could PYPL make another run to $300? If so, the underlying enterprise would easily rank as one of the best blue-chip stocks to buy. Financially, it has the right stuff, featuring decent stability in the balance sheet, solid revenue growth, and consistent profitability. Also, PayPal’s a quality enterprise, as evidenced by its return on equity of 11.78%.For the final word, analysts peg PYPL as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $116.52, implying nearly 55% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in LKQ (NASDAQ:LKQ). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. View our latest analysis for LKQ LKQ's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingIf you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. It certainly is nice to see that LKQ has managed to grow EPS by 35% per year over three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. While LKQ may have maintained EBIT margins over the last year, revenue has fallen. Suffice it to say that is not a great sign of growth.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for LKQ?Story continuesAre LKQ Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$15b company like LKQ. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Holding US$85m worth of stock in the company is no laughing matter and insiders will be committed in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders. This would indicate that the goals of shareholders and management are one and the same.It means a lot to see insiders invested in the business, but shareholders may be wondering if remuneration policies are in their best interest. Our quick analysis into CEO remuneration would seem to indicate they are. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to LKQ, with market caps over US$8.0b, is around US$13m.The LKQ CEO received US$11m in compensation for the year ending December 2022. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given it's below the median for similar sized companies. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.Is LKQ Worth Keeping An Eye On?You can't deny that LKQ has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. If that's not enough, consider also that the CEO pay is quite reasonable, and insiders are well-invested alongside other shareholders. This may only be a fast rundown, but the key takeaway is that LKQ is worth keeping an eye on. You should always think about risks though. Case in point, we've spotted   3 warning signs for LKQ  you should be aware of.Although LKQ certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend Stocks To Buy and Hold. Growth stocks were all the rage in the mid-20th century because they offered more potential for capital appreciation. In recent years, however, dividend stocks have witnessed a renewed interest as investors have become more focused on income generation and risk management. Dividend stocks can provide some stability and downside protection in times of market volatility. Companies in the S&amp;P 500 distributed a record $565 billion in dividend payments in 2022, a year that was one of the most challenging periods for the stock market.Analysts gave a positive stance about dividend growth this year as well. However, recent events surrounding Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapse have cast doubts on the performance of dividend stocks in 2023. Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, previously estimated dividends to grow by 6% to 7.5% this year. The analyst now anticipates a modest dividend growth of about 5%, which would still result in record payouts but is less than what he projected earlier this year. The bank turmoil has affected future spending for both consumers and companies, which may hinder dividend growth as well. Last month’s performance of the market also shows the impact of the bank’s failure on dividend payments. From March 8 through April 18, the S&amp;P 500 gained 4% on the banks of tech companies that pay less in dividends, as reported by Barron’s. Nevertheless, dividend stocks that have raised their payouts over time are still delivering stable returns. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks the performance of companies with dividend growth tracks of 25 years or more, is up 2.05% year-to-date and gained 8.69% in the last six months.Investors are still loading up on dividend stocks this year due to high inflation and fluctuating market conditions. Dividend-focused exchange-traded funds are especially gaining fame among investors because of their long-term growth potential, diversification, and professional management. According to a report by Wall Street Journal, there are currently 180 US dividend ETFs, with total assets worth over $384 billion. As of April 14, investors have poured over $2.8 billion into ETFs that purchase dividend-paying stocks. The report also highlighted that dividends are a good inflation hedge as S&amp;P 500 dividend growth has outpaced inflation from 2000 through March 2023.Story continuesSome of the best dividend stocks that have grabbed investors' attention include McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE:HRL), and Roper Technologies, Inc.

Since diversified information technology company IBM’s 2019 acquisition of Red Hat, the company has aggressively pursued a hybrid cloud strategy. Though IBM and its new management team have made solid progress on this pivot, we believe the company still meaningfully lags the cloud hyperscalers and other cloud-native companies.

Horton (NYSE:DHI) Has Announced That It Will Be Increasing Its Dividend To $0.25,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/d-r-horton-nyse-dhi-120819945.html,1682251699,STORY,['DHI'],"[D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 10th of May to $0.25. This takes the annual payment to 0.9% of the current stock price, which unfortunately is below what the industry is paying. See our latest analysis for D.R. Horton D.R. Horton's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWhile yield is important, another factor to consider about a company's dividend is whether the current payout levels are feasible. However, prior to this announcement, D.R. Horton's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.EPS is set to fall by 10.4% over the next 12 months. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, we estimate the payout ratio could be 8.3%, which is comfortable for the company to continue in the future.historic-dividendD.R. Horton Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $0.15, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $1.00. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 21% a year over that time. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. We are encouraged to see that D.R. Horton has grown earnings per share at 38% per year over the past five years. Rapid earnings growth and a low payout ratio suggest this company has been effectively reinvesting in its business. Should that continue, this company could have a bright future.We Really Like D.R. Horton's DividendOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The distributions are easily covered by earnings, and there is plenty of cash being generated as well. We should point out that the earnings are expected to fall over the next 12 months, which won't be a problem if this doesn't become a trend, but could cause some turbulence in the next year. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For example, we've identified 2 warning signs for D.R. Horton (1 is concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Stocks To Invest In 2023 For Beginners.""One-and-Done Much More Likely, But Not Fully Baked In Just Yet""On April 21 Roger Ferguson, former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he talked about inflation, the Fed, and recession risks. Ferguson thinks that we are now in a ""one-and-done"" situation, which means that he expects the Fed to raise interest rates for the last time at the FOMC meeting in May. However, as inflation is still higher than the 2% target, Ferguson thinks that there may be a June hike as well. Here is what he said:""I think a one-and-done is most likely, but the uniformity and the fact that inflation is still relatively high, it may leave the possibility for a June hike on the table. I would say, one-and-done much more likely but not fully baked in just yet.""The market is pricing in Fed cuts in the back half of 2023. Roger Ferguson spoke about a discrepancy between the market's expectations and the Fed's expectations regarding interest rates in the latter part of 2023 and said that ""the market is more optimistic about Fed cuts than the Fed themselves"". However, economic data will be the determining factor for this as we move into the back half of 2023, noted Ferguson. According to Roger Ferguson, the Fed may keep interest rates elevated for longer than the market is expecting.Roger Ferguson noted that sectors that are sensitive to interest rates, such as housing, are already experiencing challenges and pressures from rising rates. Ferguson thinks the Fed will keep interest rates higher for longer than the market is expecting because, though the labor market is showing signs of weakening, ""it is still not soft"", and there are certain parts of the economy that are still strong which will in turn keep inflation higher than 2%. According to Ferguson, ""the Fed wants to really make sure that the disinflationary process is well advanced before it even starts talking about cutting rates"".Story continuesFinally, Roger Ferguson talked about the risk of recession. Ferguson does not expect a severe recession, rather, he expects a shallow recession and he sees ""some credit tightening in various places"" as opposed to a credit crunch. Here are some comments from Roger Ferguson:""A recession is more likely than not. I still think it's more likely to be a softer recession, as opposed to a hard one. But, the credit tightening that's certainly going on and being talked about in the Fed's Beige Book, does suggest that conditions are a little more fraught, and maybe a slightly harder recession. I'm not yet in the camp that says that we have a real credit crunch, I think we see some credit tightening in various places. Count me still in a sort of soft and shallow recession camp right now, but with the risk to the downside given the changing credit dynamics in the country.""The next FOMC meeting is nearby and a 89.1% of the market is pricing in a 25 basis point rate hike by the Fed, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool. In times like these, investors can feel overwhelmed and confused about what stocks to pick. For risk averse investors, sticking with mature businesses that have stable revenue growth can be an approach to consider. Additionally, finding companies with stable revenue growth that are popular among institutional investors can help retail investors avoid major losses, since hedge fund sentiment is a good indicator of investor confidence in an organization. We have compiled a list of the best beginner stocks to buy in 2023 which include PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP), UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).

217,fb77e632-42ec-3eed-8c66-70fac6a5f2a2,SHW,2023-04-24,The Greatest 7 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy for Your Portfolio,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/greatest-7-blue-chip-stocks-170709839.html,1682010429,STORY,"['NFLX', 'UNH', 'REGN', 'AAPL', 'PYPL', 'RACE', 'SHW']","[While the debate will certainly rage over which ideas legitimately rank as the greatest blue-chip stocks to buy of all time, for right now, certain enterprises stand out for a combination of their relevance and resilience. As well, a select few large-capitalization companies may be too undervalued and beaten down for their own good. Therefore, speculators may enjoy significant upside.To generate this list, I turned to the investment resource Gurufocus, specifically its screener function. Here, I filtered out the best blue-chip stocks to buy for quality and predictability. As well, I’ve incorporated analyst ratings provided by TipRanks so you know what the experts think. So, without any more delay, let’s take a deeper look at the “greatest” blue-chip stocks list.RACEFerrari$275.22AAPLApple$167.72SHWSherwin-Williams$234.83REGNRegeneron$803.62NFLXNetflix$329.59UNHUnitedHealth$489.56PYPLPayPal$74.32InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFerrari (RACE)a bull next to a stack of blue gambling chips to represent blue-chip stocksSource: ShutterstockWhile exotic car manufacturer Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) might seem an odd idea for the best blue-chip stocks to buy, in my view, it makes perfect sense. First, it’s a world-recognized brand with a market cap north of $51 billion. Second, it’s performed very well this year, gaining over 29% of equity value. In contrast, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index moved up just under 9% during the same period.Fundamentally, what makes RACE so special within this rarefied blue-chip stocks list focuses on economic insulation. Brewing headwinds against the consumer economy means that people are cutting back on their purchases, impacting once-resilient sectors like electric vehicles. However, Ferrari remains a powerful brand that constantly generates positive traction because it caters to a completely different wealth class.In other words, there’s rich and then there’s Ferrari rich. And Ferrari rich doesn’t worry about little things like interest rate hikes. They’re truly above it all. Not surprisingly, Wall Street analysts peg RACE as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target comes out to $287.58, implying a bit over 3% upside potential.Story continuesApple (AAPL)A close-up shot of a blue casino chip on red carpet.Source: ShutterstockWith consumer technology giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), I shouldn’t encounter any pushback signaling it as one of the top blue-chip stocks to buy. Thanks to its market cap of $2.65 trillion, Apple basically represents its own powerhouse country. Plus, it continues to perform well, gaining 34% of equity value since the beginning of this year. Furthermore, it’s erased its trailing one-year loss, now staring at a slightly positive return.Fundamentally, Apple’s brand power impresses like nothing else. With mass layoffs and other pressures working against the consumer economy, you’d expect a discretionary player like Apple to suffer. However, the products are too compelling and perhaps too addictive to ignore.Financially, the company features strengths across the board. From a solid balance sheet to double-digit revenue growth to excellent profit margins, you can’t go wrong with AAPL on your blue-chip stocks list. Presently, analysts peg AAPL as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target comes out to $174.28, implying 4% upside potential.Sherwin-Williams (SHW)blue chip definition highlightedSource: ShutterstockA paint and coating manufacturing firm, Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW) doesn’t exactly rank as one of the most exciting large-scale enterprises. However, a case can be made that it stands among the best blue-chip stocks to buy right now. Featuring everyday relevance, SHW can easily be an investment to build for the long run. Plus, its red ink this year may offer a discounted entry point.Financially, it doesn’t offer truly remarkable attributes. However, the company gets the job done. For example, it posts a competent three-year revenue growth rate of 9.8%. Again, not remarkable but it betas out 57.05% of companies listed in the chemicals sector.More importantly, Sherwin-Williams benefits from a consistently profitable enterprise. Its trailing-year operating margin pings at 13.55% while its net margin comes out to 9.12%. Both stats rank in the underlying sector’s upper half. Finally, analysts peg SHW as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $253.71, implying nearly 9% upside potential.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN)Source: ShutterstockOne of the companies that generated tremendous relevance during the worst of the Covid-19 crisis, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) no longer commands the spotlight like it once did when it contributed to restoring former President Donald Trump back to full health. Still, REGN deserves consideration on your blue-chip stocks list.While it no longer generates front-page news, it continues to research and develop new therapeutics. Even better, investors like what they’re seeing. Since the Jan. opener, REGN gained over 12% of its market value. Financially too, Regeneron attracts investors thanks to its rock-solid balance sheet, strong three-year sales trend, and an excellent profit margin of 35.64%.Notably, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 19.23. As a discount to projected earnings, Regeneron ranks better than 71.43% of the competition. Therefore, it’s not only one of the top blue-chip stocks to buy, but it’s also one of the most undervalued. Lastly, analysts peg REGN as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target comes out to $885, implying over 9% upside potential.Netflix (NFLX)Source: ShutterstockOne of the trickier blue-chip stocks to buy, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) carries significant clout as an entertainment stalwart. Obviously, during the worst of the pandemic, Netflix shot up the charts because it offered entertainment to quarantined consumers. However, as fears of the SARS-CoV-2 virus along with governmental restrictions faded away, the phenomenon of revenge travel took over. That left little room for Netflix to sustain its stratospheric growth.At the same time, NFLX stock has been mounting a credible comeback effort. In the trailing one-year period, it gained nearly 43% of its equity value. It still has some ways to go to reach its post-pandemic record highs. Nevertheless, with the consumer economy again struggling, the content streamer could get interesting as a cheap entertainment source.Financially, Netflix benefits from a solid balance sheet and strong operational stats. Notably, it’s a consistently profitable enterprise, featuring a trailing-year net margin of 14.21%. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg NFLX as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $362.37, implying over 12% upside potential.UnitedHealth Group (UNH)10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Grow UpSource: ShutterstockAnother tricky name to put on your blue-chip stocks list, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) on the surface seems like a reasonable enterprise to choose. Sure, it might be a bit choppy. Since the Jan. opener, UNH lost over 6% of its equity value. In the past 365 days, it fell 11%. Nevertheless, as a managed healthcare and insurance giant, UnitedHealth appears resilient.However, one thing to keep in mind is that as layoffs accelerate, UnitedHealth may suffer a reduction in its total addressable market. With the alpha dogs in the business world announcing steep headcount reductions, you want to be careful with UNH.Still, at the end of the day, we’re talking about one of the best blue-chip stocks to buy. Financially, UnitedHealth posts solid strengths in the balance sheet. Operationally, it features a three-year book growth rate of 11.1%, outpacing 73.33% of its peers. Also, it features robust profitability with a net margin of 6.21%, above 79% of the competition.Looking to the Street, analysts peg UNH as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target stands at $602.38, implying nearly 24% upside potential.PayPal (PYPL)Source: ShutterstockEasily the riskiest idea on this list of top blue-chip stocks to buy, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a powerhouse in the digital payments ecosystem. Fundamentally, it aligns with the burgeoning gig economy. Thanks to its intuitive business management ecosystem, it’s easy for gig workers (i.e. independent contractors) to get up and running. Also, the PayPal system keeps records of everything, making it convenient for tax-reporting purposes.However, it’s a tough sell for risk-averse investors. Since the beginning of this year, PYPL gained only 1%. In the trailing one-year period, it fell nearly 21%. Further, trading hands at a little over $75, we’re way off from the time that PYPL commanded a $300 price tag.But then, speculators wonder – could PYPL make another run to $300? If so, the underlying enterprise would easily rank as one of the best blue-chip stocks to buy. Financially, it has the right stuff, featuring decent stability in the balance sheet, solid revenue growth, and consistent profitability. Also, PayPal’s a quality enterprise, as evidenced by its return on equity of 11.78%.For the final word, analysts peg PYPL as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $116.52, implying nearly 55% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Stocks To Invest In 2023 For Beginners.""One-and-Done Much More Likely, But Not Fully Baked In Just Yet""On April 21 Roger Ferguson, former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he talked about inflation, the Fed, and recession risks. Ferguson thinks that we are now in a ""one-and-done"" situation, which means that he expects the Fed to raise interest rates for the last time at the FOMC meeting in May. However, as inflation is still higher than the 2% target, Ferguson thinks that there may be a June hike as well. Here is what he said:""I think a one-and-done is most likely, but the uniformity and the fact that inflation is still relatively high, it may leave the possibility for a June hike on the table. I would say, one-and-done much more likely but not fully baked in just yet.""The market is pricing in Fed cuts in the back half of 2023. Roger Ferguson spoke about a discrepancy between the market's expectations and the Fed's expectations regarding interest rates in the latter part of 2023 and said that ""the market is more optimistic about Fed cuts than the Fed themselves"". However, economic data will be the determining factor for this as we move into the back half of 2023, noted Ferguson. According to Roger Ferguson, the Fed may keep interest rates elevated for longer than the market is expecting.Roger Ferguson noted that sectors that are sensitive to interest rates, such as housing, are already experiencing challenges and pressures from rising rates. Ferguson thinks the Fed will keep interest rates higher for longer than the market is expecting because, though the labor market is showing signs of weakening, ""it is still not soft"", and there are certain parts of the economy that are still strong which will in turn keep inflation higher than 2%. According to Ferguson, ""the Fed wants to really make sure that the disinflationary process is well advanced before it even starts talking about cutting rates"".Story continuesFinally, Roger Ferguson talked about the risk of recession. Ferguson does not expect a severe recession, rather, he expects a shallow recession and he sees ""some credit tightening in various places"" as opposed to a credit crunch. Here are some comments from Roger Ferguson:""A recession is more likely than not. I still think it's more likely to be a softer recession, as opposed to a hard one. But, the credit tightening that's certainly going on and being talked about in the Fed's Beige Book, does suggest that conditions are a little more fraught, and maybe a slightly harder recession. I'm not yet in the camp that says that we have a real credit crunch, I think we see some credit tightening in various places. Count me still in a sort of soft and shallow recession camp right now, but with the risk to the downside given the changing credit dynamics in the country.""The next FOMC meeting is nearby and a 89.1% of the market is pricing in a 25 basis point rate hike by the Fed, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool. In times like these, investors can feel overwhelmed and confused about what stocks to pick. For risk averse investors, sticking with mature businesses that have stable revenue growth can be an approach to consider. Additionally, finding companies with stable revenue growth that are popular among institutional investors can help retail investors avoid major losses, since hedge fund sentiment is a good indicator of investor confidence in an organization.

(NASDAQ:PEP) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for PepsiCo Crunching The NumbersWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$9.32bUS$10.4bUS$10.8bUS$11.0bUS$11.5bUS$11.9bUS$12.2bUS$12.5bUS$12.8bUS$13.1bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x6Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 2.89%Est @ 2.65%Est @ 2.47%Est @ 2.35%Est @ 2.27% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.8% US$8.7kUS$9.1kUS$8.9kUS$8.5kUS$8.3kUS$8.0kUS$7.7kUS$7.4kUS$7.1kUS$6.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$80bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$13b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.1%) = US$281bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$281b÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)10= US$145bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$225b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$185, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at PepsiCo as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for PepsiCoStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Beverage market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatDividends are not covered by cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Today, however, there are many more ETF options available.One option is low-volatility funds. They are designed to lag the market slightly when things are going well, while offering more downside protection when things are going wrong.Low-volatility funds became popular after the 2008/2009 financial crisis. In recent years, they were out of style until 2022, when they experienced their first annual inflows ($6.5 billion) since 2019. A significant correction in the S&amp;P 500 last year helped their popularity.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe largest low-volatility fund in the U.S. is the iShares MSCI USA Min Vol Factor ETF (BATS:USMV). It tracks the performance of the MSCI USA Minimum Volatility (USD) Index, which is a collection of mid- and large-capitalization U.S. stocks that have lower volatility than the entire U.S. mid- and large-cap equity market. The ETF currently has 164 holdings.  Based on the fund’s holdings, here are three defensive stocks to buy now.BRK.BBerkshire Hathaway$323.82PEPPepsiCo$185.33HSYHershey Foods$260.42Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)A Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) sign sits out front of an office in Lafayette, Indiana.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) is one of the best non-fund funds you can own. Sure, it’s not a mutual fund per se. However, its equity portfolio alone has a value of more than $347 billion. Shareholders gain ownership in many private companies that Warren Buffett and his team have bought over the years. And you get all of that for zero fees. In 2020, Berkshire started investing in Japan’s largest trading houses. One of the trading houses, Itochu (OTCMKTS:ITOCY), is the holding company’s 12th-largest holding, representing 0.9% of its equity portfolio. That investment translates into a 6.2% ownership stake. As a result, his return on Itochu has nearly doubled in just two years.Story continuesBerkshire might not always beat the S&amp;P 500. However, it delivers positive returns in most years. For example, the 2022 shareholder letter shows that since 2000, Berkshire’s stock has lost ground in only four of 23 years, two less than the index. If you like sleeping well at night, Berkshire is one of the defensive stocks to buy that won’t let you down. PepsiCo (PEP)Cans of PepsiCo's Pepsi soda are in a bucket of ice.Source: suriyachan / Shutterstock.comAs most investors know, Warren Buffett is a fan of Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), not PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP). Berkshire has made a lot of money from Coca-Cola. However, over the past 15 years, PepsiCo’s annualized total return through April 18 was 8.16%, 115 basis points higher than Coca-Cola’s. Further, PepsiCo’s five-year average total yield is 3.75% — defined as the dividend yield plus buyback yield — 50 basis points higher than Buffett’s favorite cola maker. The two companies differ in one significant way.PepsiCo has a huge food business with Frito Lay and Quaker Foods — in 2021, its food-related businesses accounted for 58% of its annual revenue — while Coca-Cola has a negligible amount. In recent years, Coke has added an alcoholic drink segment, and PepsiCo has followed suit. So the competition continues to heat up. Where it ends, nobody knows.Frito Lay North America generated 27% of PepsiCo’s $86.4 million in 2022 net revenue and 44% of its operating income. So it’s a significant driver of PepsiCo’s share price.  In 2023, PepsiC0’s stock is up 2.92% year-to-date, 184 basis points higher than Coca-Cola’s. The latter might have higher margins, but the former seems to be more popular with investors. Well, at least if stock returns are your barometer. Hershey Foods (HSY)Hershey's milk chocolate pieces on a white plate on top of a wooden tableSource: shutterstock.com/VG FotoI’m a Hershey Foods (NYSE:HSY) fan for two reasons. First, CEO Michelle Buck is one of the best leaders in corporate America and an inspiration to businesswomen everywhere. However, in 2017 when she became the first woman CEO of Hershey, she wasn’t an overnight success. Buck spent 15 months at Frito-Lay after completing her MBA in 1987. She then moved to Kraft, where she rose the ladder over 17 years to become Vice President of Marketing for Kraft Foods. Then, in April 2005, Buck jumped to Hershey to become its Senior Vice President and Global Chief Marketing Officer. Twelve years later, she was CEO.That’s patience. Second, how can you not root for a company controlled by a trust that supports the Milton Hershey School, “a school for the full-time care and education of disadvantaged children?” It has approximately 2,000 students ranging from pre-Kindergarten through 12th grade.  The Milton Hershey School Trust controls 79.5% of the company’s voting shares.As for the company itself, Hershey announced on April 17th that it was acquiring two popcorn manufacturing plants from Weaver Popcorn Manufacturing, a leader in popcorn production and co-packing. Weaver co-manufactures Hershey’s Skinny Pop brand. The acquisition ensures the company can continue growing Skinny Pop in the years ahead. In 2022, Hershey generated $1.81 billion [cash flow] in free cash flow from $10.42 billion [income statement] in revenue, good for a 17.4% margin. Hershey should be fine in a downturn unless Americans stop eating sweets and snacks.  On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. As with many other companies Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) makes use of debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.When Is Debt A Problem?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals What Is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals's Net Debt?As you can see below, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals had US$1.98b of debt, at December 2022, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. However, it does have US$7.74b in cash offsetting this, leading to net cash of US$5.76b.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' LiabilitiesThe latest balance sheet data shows that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals had liabilities of US$3.14b due within a year, and liabilities of US$3.41b falling due after that. Offsetting this, it had US$7.74b in cash and US$5.33b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it can boast US$6.52b more liquid assets than total liabilities.This surplus suggests that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has a conservative balance sheet, and could probably eliminate its debt without much difficulty. Succinctly put, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!Story continuesIn fact Regeneron Pharmaceuticals's saving grace is its low debt levels, because its EBIT has tanked 44% in the last twelve months. When it comes to paying off debt, falling earnings are no more useful than sugary sodas are for your health. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Regeneron Pharmaceuticals can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. While Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance. During the last three years, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 68% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.Summing UpWhile we empathize with investors who find debt concerning, you should keep in mind that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has net cash of US$5.76b, as well as more liquid assets than liabilities. And it impressed us with free cash flow of US$3.4b, being 68% of its EBIT. So we are not troubled with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals's debt use. Of course, we wouldn't say no to the extra confidence that we'd gain if we knew that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals insiders have been buying shares: if you're on the same wavelength,  you can find out if insiders are buying by clicking this link.At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

224,fb77e632-42ec-3eed-8c66-70fac6a5f2a2,REGN,2023-04-24,The Greatest 7 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy for Your Portfolio,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/greatest-7-blue-chip-stocks-170709839.html,1682010429,STORY,"['NFLX', 'UNH', 'REGN', 'AAPL', 'PYPL', 'RACE', 'SHW']","[While the debate will certainly rage over which ideas legitimately rank as the greatest blue-chip stocks to buy of all time, for right now, certain enterprises stand out for a combination of their relevance and resilience. As well, a select few large-capitalization companies may be too undervalued and beaten down for their own good. Therefore, speculators may enjoy significant upside.To generate this list, I turned to the investment resource Gurufocus, specifically its screener function. Here, I filtered out the best blue-chip stocks to buy for quality and predictability. As well, I’ve incorporated analyst ratings provided by TipRanks so you know what the experts think. So, without any more delay, let’s take a deeper look at the “greatest” blue-chip stocks list.RACEFerrari$275.22AAPLApple$167.72SHWSherwin-Williams$234.83REGNRegeneron$803.62NFLXNetflix$329.59UNHUnitedHealth$489.56PYPLPayPal$74.32InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFerrari (RACE)a bull next to a stack of blue gambling chips to represent blue-chip stocksSource: ShutterstockWhile exotic car manufacturer Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) might seem an odd idea for the best blue-chip stocks to buy, in my view, it makes perfect sense. First, it’s a world-recognized brand with a market cap north of $51 billion. Second, it’s performed very well this year, gaining over 29% of equity value. In contrast, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index moved up just under 9% during the same period.Fundamentally, what makes RACE so special within this rarefied blue-chip stocks list focuses on economic insulation. Brewing headwinds against the consumer economy means that people are cutting back on their purchases, impacting once-resilient sectors like electric vehicles. However, Ferrari remains a powerful brand that constantly generates positive traction because it caters to a completely different wealth class.In other words, there’s rich and then there’s Ferrari rich. And Ferrari rich doesn’t worry about little things like interest rate hikes. They’re truly above it all. Not surprisingly, Wall Street analysts peg RACE as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target comes out to $287.58, implying a bit over 3% upside potential.Story continuesApple (AAPL)A close-up shot of a blue casino chip on red carpet.Source: ShutterstockWith consumer technology giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), I shouldn’t encounter any pushback signaling it as one of the top blue-chip stocks to buy. Thanks to its market cap of $2.65 trillion, Apple basically represents its own powerhouse country. Plus, it continues to perform well, gaining 34% of equity value since the beginning of this year. Furthermore, it’s erased its trailing one-year loss, now staring at a slightly positive return.Fundamentally, Apple’s brand power impresses like nothing else. With mass layoffs and other pressures working against the consumer economy, you’d expect a discretionary player like Apple to suffer. However, the products are too compelling and perhaps too addictive to ignore.Financially, the company features strengths across the board. From a solid balance sheet to double-digit revenue growth to excellent profit margins, you can’t go wrong with AAPL on your blue-chip stocks list. Presently, analysts peg AAPL as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target comes out to $174.28, implying 4% upside potential.Sherwin-Williams (SHW)blue chip definition highlightedSource: ShutterstockA paint and coating manufacturing firm, Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW) doesn’t exactly rank as one of the most exciting large-scale enterprises. However, a case can be made that it stands among the best blue-chip stocks to buy right now. Featuring everyday relevance, SHW can easily be an investment to build for the long run. Plus, its red ink this year may offer a discounted entry point.Financially, it doesn’t offer truly remarkable attributes. However, the company gets the job done. For example, it posts a competent three-year revenue growth rate of 9.8%. Again, not remarkable but it betas out 57.05% of companies listed in the chemicals sector.More importantly, Sherwin-Williams benefits from a consistently profitable enterprise. Its trailing-year operating margin pings at 13.55% while its net margin comes out to 9.12%. Both stats rank in the underlying sector’s upper half. Finally, analysts peg SHW as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $253.71, implying nearly 9% upside potential.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN)Source: ShutterstockOne of the companies that generated tremendous relevance during the worst of the Covid-19 crisis, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) no longer commands the spotlight like it once did when it contributed to restoring former President Donald Trump back to full health. Still, REGN deserves consideration on your blue-chip stocks list.While it no longer generates front-page news, it continues to research and develop new therapeutics. Even better, investors like what they’re seeing. Since the Jan. opener, REGN gained over 12% of its market value. Financially too, Regeneron attracts investors thanks to its rock-solid balance sheet, strong three-year sales trend, and an excellent profit margin of 35.64%.Notably, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 19.23. As a discount to projected earnings, Regeneron ranks better than 71.43% of the competition. Therefore, it’s not only one of the top blue-chip stocks to buy, but it’s also one of the most undervalued. Lastly, analysts peg REGN as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target comes out to $885, implying over 9% upside potential.Netflix (NFLX)Source: ShutterstockOne of the trickier blue-chip stocks to buy, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) carries significant clout as an entertainment stalwart. Obviously, during the worst of the pandemic, Netflix shot up the charts because it offered entertainment to quarantined consumers. However, as fears of the SARS-CoV-2 virus along with governmental restrictions faded away, the phenomenon of revenge travel took over. That left little room for Netflix to sustain its stratospheric growth.At the same time, NFLX stock has been mounting a credible comeback effort. In the trailing one-year period, it gained nearly 43% of its equity value. It still has some ways to go to reach its post-pandemic record highs. Nevertheless, with the consumer economy again struggling, the content streamer could get interesting as a cheap entertainment source.Financially, Netflix benefits from a solid balance sheet and strong operational stats. Notably, it’s a consistently profitable enterprise, featuring a trailing-year net margin of 14.21%. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg NFLX as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $362.37, implying over 12% upside potential.UnitedHealth Group (UNH)10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Grow UpSource: ShutterstockAnother tricky name to put on your blue-chip stocks list, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) on the surface seems like a reasonable enterprise to choose. Sure, it might be a bit choppy. Since the Jan. opener, UNH lost over 6% of its equity value. In the past 365 days, it fell 11%. Nevertheless, as a managed healthcare and insurance giant, UnitedHealth appears resilient.However, one thing to keep in mind is that as layoffs accelerate, UnitedHealth may suffer a reduction in its total addressable market. With the alpha dogs in the business world announcing steep headcount reductions, you want to be careful with UNH.Still, at the end of the day, we’re talking about one of the best blue-chip stocks to buy. Financially, UnitedHealth posts solid strengths in the balance sheet. Operationally, it features a three-year book growth rate of 11.1%, outpacing 73.33% of its peers. Also, it features robust profitability with a net margin of 6.21%, above 79% of the competition.Looking to the Street, analysts peg UNH as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target stands at $602.38, implying nearly 24% upside potential.PayPal (PYPL)Source: ShutterstockEasily the riskiest idea on this list of top blue-chip stocks to buy, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a powerhouse in the digital payments ecosystem. Fundamentally, it aligns with the burgeoning gig economy. Thanks to its intuitive business management ecosystem, it’s easy for gig workers (i.e. independent contractors) to get up and running. Also, the PayPal system keeps records of everything, making it convenient for tax-reporting purposes.However, it’s a tough sell for risk-averse investors. Since the beginning of this year, PYPL gained only 1%. In the trailing one-year period, it fell nearly 21%. Further, trading hands at a little over $75, we’re way off from the time that PYPL commanded a $300 price tag.But then, speculators wonder – could PYPL make another run to $300? If so, the underlying enterprise would easily rank as one of the best blue-chip stocks to buy. Financially, it has the right stuff, featuring decent stability in the balance sheet, solid revenue growth, and consistent profitability. Also, PayPal’s a quality enterprise, as evidenced by its return on equity of 11.78%.For the final word, analysts peg PYPL as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $116.52, implying nearly 55% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.
