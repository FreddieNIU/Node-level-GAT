As a mid-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine Acuity Brands’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity.', ' View our latest analysis for Acuity Brands ', 'According to our valuation model, Acuity Brands seems to be fairly priced at around 18% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Acuity Brands today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $307.21, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Acuity Brands’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.', ""Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Acuity Brands' earnings growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years, indicating a solid future ahead. This should lead to robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value."", 'Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in AYI’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company.

Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on AYI, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value.

However, some may expect the struggles of the real estate sector to abate as the year progresses, especially as many financial professionals begin to analyze the state of US real estate markets. Several spaces within the real estate sector are under-invested in, leaving the arena free and open for investors looking to make a real estate play.', 'On February 29, Carly Trip, the Head of Investments at Nuveen Real Estate, joined CNBC\'s ""Closing Bell Overtime"" to discuss the state of the US real estate markets. Here\'s what she had to say:', '""On the residential market, it\'s kind of like no new news, however what\'s interesting is that the consumer is really starting to explain their tolerance for mortgage rates. In December we saw really strong numbers, mortgage rates had come in about 50 basis points, bouncing around six and a half. As they have suddenly come up since then and hover above 7%, consumers do not like that. And so we\'re seeing the results of that in pending home sales. So we expect that that is not gonna improve, inventory will remain low until rates come around 6%, in which case your cost to own versus cost to rent margin really starts to shrink.""', ""Despite the above observations, Tripp noted that other areas in the real estate markets are doing better. Here's what she said:"", '""Retail\'s doing amazingly well. So retail has been the underdog of the last decade. And what we\'re seeing in our centres is increased activity, a lot of demand, increased sales. The consumer is obviously very resilient and strong. That is accomodating to retail spending, 80% of retail sales do involve a physical store which is a positive for our centres. And not only that, there\'s no new supply added to retail. Over the last five years, about a 130 million square feet of retail has been converted to other uses, so it\'s really been under-invested in. So the outlook for retail is very, very strong.""', 'Similarly, for the industrial real estate side, Tripp had positive insights to share. Here are some of the comments she made:', '""Industrial\'s been incredible. It has performed exactly as real estate should perform. Income has outpaced inflation, right, real estate is expected to be an inflation hedge, that\'s why it\'s such a great diversifier to a portfolio. And so we continue to see incredibly strong demand for industrial. Supply has slowed, that was the concern pre-pandemic. However, due to lack of construction spending, lack of financing just generally speaking, bottlenecks in the construction system, we expect that demand is just gonna continue to flow. E-commerce spending is not going anywhere.', 'Considering these highlights, while the residential side of real estate seems to be still struggling in 2024, that does not mean all real estate should be avoided this year.

AI might be more efficient at it — and the technology might raise some new ethical and legal challenges, as well as risk alienating employees — but the fact is workplace conversations have never really been private anyway.', '“Monitoring employee communications isn’t new, but the growing sophistication of the analysis that’s possible with ongoing advances in AI is,” said David Johnson, a principal analyst at Forrester Research.', '“What’s also evolving is the industry’s understanding of how monitoring in this way impacts employee behavior and morale under various circumstances, along with the policies and boundaries for acceptable use within the workplace.”', 'A recent study by a company called Qualtrics, which uses AI to help filter employee engagement surveys, found that managers are bullish on AI software but that employees are nervous, with 46% calling its use in the workplace “scary.”', '“Trust is lost in buckets and gained back in drops, so missteps in applying the technology early will have a long tail of implications for employee trust over time,” said Johnson, even as he called a future of AI-powered employee monitoring “inevitable.”', 'One company that’s getting AI into common work-related software, including Slack, Zoom, Microsoft Teams and Meta’s Workplace platform, is seven-year-old startup Aware.', 'Aware is working with Starbucks, Chevron, Walmart and others; the startup says its product is meant to pick up on everything from bullying and harassment to cyberattacks and insider trading.', 'Data stays anonymous until the technology finds instances that it’s been asked to highlight, Aware says.

Meta, for example, uses content moderation teams and related technologies to manage abuse and behaviors on its platforms. (Meta has recently been heavily criticized over allegations of inadequate moderation, in fact, particularly around child sex abuse.)', 'At the same time, employee behavior has been monitored on work systems since the dawn of email. Even when employees are not on a secure work network, companies are able to monitor activity through browsers. (Aware, however, only works on corporate communications services, not browsers.)', '“\u200b\u200bTrying to understand employee patterns is not a new concept,” Hayden said, pointing to companies tracking things like log on times and meeting attendance.', 'But what’s changing with this process is applying more advanced AI tools directly into employee workflows. AI software could allow companies to quickly analyze thousands of data points and key words to give insight into trends and what workers are discussing in real time.', 'Hayden said companies may want to track employee conversations not because they care about what your weekend plans or latest Netflix binge people are watching.', '“This will help gain more granular, real-time insights on employees,” Hayden said.', 'He added that this can help companies better shape internal messaging, policies and strategies, based on what the software is learning about its workforce.', 'Although the rise of AI in the workplace could introduce legal and ethical challenges, along with issues around accuracy and relevancy, Johnson at Forrester Research said he views the biggest complication ahead as gaining employee trust in both the short and long term.', 'Simply put, people don’t want to feel like they’re being watched.', 'He said organizations need to be careful about how they embrace the technology; if a company uses it to determine how productive their employees are, or if workers are unhappy, followed by disciplinary action or termination, it could be years before their employees will trust them again.', '“It’s critically important to be cautious and deliberate” in using this technology, he said.', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Microchip Technology, it has a TSR of 117% for the last 5 years.

India, in particular, is poised for robust growth at 6.3%. However, China is facing some challenges with sluggish consumer demand and a shaky property market, which could have ripple effects globally. Efforts to boost confidence in China's economy could impact other Asian countries as well. Inflation is also a hot topic, with expectations of a decrease to 5.2% in 2024. Central banks will be busy adjusting their monetary policies to navigate these choppy waters."", ""The US Federal Reserve might tweak interest rates, while the European Central Bank (ECB), Bank of England, and Bank of Canada are also expected to make moves in response to changing economic conditions.

In this article, we decided to focus on Microsoft's  ROE."", 'ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Microsoft ', 'ROE can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Microsoft is:', '35% = US$83b ÷ US$238b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.35."", 'We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company\'s future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don\'t necessarily bear these characteristics.', ""First thing first, we like that Microsoft has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 13% which is quite remarkable. This probably laid the groundwork for Microsoft's moderate 16% net income growth seen over the past five years."", ""As a next step, we compared Microsoft's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 16% in the same period."", 'The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth.

But among the Magnificent Seven, Nvidia may be playing the most important role. The company's graphics processing units (GPU) are fueling applications across the generative AI spectrum -- from machine learning and quantum computing to data centers."", 'During its fiscal 2024 fourth-quarter earnings call on Feb. 21, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang declared that ""accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point."" With Nvidia stock up over 230% in the last year, some investors may be wondering what Huang meant, and if it\'s too late to buy shares.', ""Let's dig into Nvidia's earnings report and assess the secular trends fueling demand for generative AI GPUs. While Nvidia stock is certainly enjoying the moment, investors may still come away inspired to buy shares now."", ""Oftentimes when a company is experiencing unprecedented demand, it will see soaring revenue -- and that's it. In other words, companies sometimes have to reinvest heavily into manufacturing in order to meet that higher demand. This can put a strain on operating margins and profits, even during times of accelerated sales growth."", 'But Nvidia is a rare breed, make no mistake about it.', ""The chart above illustrates Nvidia's revenue, gross profit, net income, and free cash flow on a quarterly basis over the last 10 years. Just look at how steep the slope of each line has become. Not only is the company generating robust top-line growth, but its profits and cash flows are growing in lockstep."", 'Taking this a step further, Nvidia is not resting on its laurels. While demand for its industry-leading A100 and H100 GPUs remains strong, the company is investing its profits relentlessly into product innovation. The company is on track to begin shipments of next-generation chips, including the H200 in the second quarter. Moreover, reports suggest that Nvidia plans to release its most powerful chip to date, the B100, later in 2024.', ""The above trends underscore the fact that Nvidia's chips are in high demand. And with newer, improved models expected to reach customers soon, Nvidia's ride could just be getting started."", ""As use cases for AI continue to evolve, so do estimates about the total market size for the technology. A top Nvidia manager recently forecast that the market for AI-powered chips and software would grow to be worth $600 billion. The jury is still out on whether that prediction will prove accurate. However, what analysts are calling for in terms of growth can shed some light on Nvidia's potential."", ""While Nvidia's trailing-12-month revenue of $61 billion is impressive, perhaps even more encouraging are its long-term growth prospects as estimated by Wall Street analysts. Given Nvidia's status as a market leader in AI GPUs, many clearly believe that the current demand trends can be sustained over the next few years."", ""To me, the biggest risk associated with Nvidia is not its valuation. Rather, I think the competitive landscape is going to become increasingly intense. Nvidia's top rival at the moment is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). However, both Amazon and Microsoft are already developing their own inference and training chips for generative AI models. While Nvidia may have a head start, investors should not turn their backs on its big tech cohorts. While I suspect it'll take a few years for other chips to acquire meaningful market share, Nvidia investors should be considering what other growth drivers the company has beyond AI GPUs."", ""One area that investors may be overlooking at the moment is Nvidia's opportunity in software. While the company is still primarily a hardware developer, Nvidia's software and services business reached a $1 billion revenue run rate during the fourth quarter."", ""This is a big deal for a couple of reasons. First, software tends to come with high margins. Should Nvidia begin to eventually lose share in the chip market, it's likely that its margins will take a hit. However, this could be more than offset if Nvidia continues to see success in software. Additionally, since software services are typically more predictable in terms of demand, I wouldn't be surprised to see investors apply even more of a premium to Nvidia stock in the future."", ""At a price-to-sales ratio of 32, Nvidia stock is trading much higher than its historical levels. However, the company's soaring revenue and profits, coupled with its steadfast reinvestment into new products and its budding software business, could warrant the premium. Given its differentiated business model, full-spectrum platform, and the secular tailwinds fueling AI, I think now is as good a time as ever to scoop up shares of Nvidia and hold them for the long run."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

This group of companies includes the following tech leaders: Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Nvidia, and Tesla. These corporations have generally produced excellent stock market returns. However, several of them don\'t even pay dividends. Of those that do, one stands out as the best income stock of the group. That company is Microsoft. Let\'s find out why.', ""It's hard for a company to be a great dividend stock when it doesn't pay any. So, we can start by putting aside those members of the Magnificent Seven that haven't initiated payouts. That gets rid of Alphabet, Amazon, and Tesla. Next, we can put Meta Platforms out of the running, too. Though the Facebook parent company pays a dividend, it just started doing so this year. Only time will tell whether Meta Platforms will become an outstanding dividend stock. But for now, it hasn't proven itself in this arena yet."", ""That leaves us with three companies in the running. One of them, Nvidia, is the inferior dividend stock of the trio. Nvidia hasn't increased its payouts in more than five years. The company's forward yield of 0.02% could hardly be lower. Nvidia has plenty of qualities that make it an attractive stock, but its dividend program isn't impressive, at least not compared to our two finalists."", ""Microsoft and Apple have raised their payouts significantly over the past 10 years. However, Microsoft's track record is better than Apple's in this category."", ""That's the first point in Microsoft's favor, especially since its dividend per share is more than three times Apple's. Next, let's compare the companies' yields. Microsoft also wins in this head-to-head, although neither is particularly impressive. Apple's forward yield of 0.53% is lower than Microsoft's 0.74%. Let's now turn to these companies' cash payout ratios. Microsoft's 30.75% is higher than Apple's 14.11%."", 'Conventional wisdom might suggest that Apple is the winner in this battle. A lower cash payout ratio is usually considered better as it shows that a company has plenty of room to increase its dividends. However, it can also show that a corporation is failing to do so despite having the means. Neither Microsoft nor Apple is anywhere close to a cash payout ratio that would be problematic.', ""In this context, the higher of the two might indicate a greater willingness to reward shareholders with dividend increases. That's especially true since Microsoft generates less free cash flow than Apple. Yet, the former spends a greater share of its smaller free cash flow on dividends. No wonder, then, that some investors feel it's about time for Apple to raise its dividend. So, this third category also goes to Microsoft. It has the superior dividend profile."", ""But that means nothing if it will be unable to sustain its dividend program in the future. Is Microsoft's underlying business strong enough to keep payouts moving in the right direction? The answer is a resounding yes! Microsoft remains the undisputed leader in the market for computer operating systems. It is also one of the biggest players in gaming."", 'The tech giant has multiple growth areas to exploit, from cloud computing to generative artificial intelligence, thanks to its investment in ChatGPT creator OpenAI. Microsoft also boasts a solid competitive advantage from multiple sources. Its brand name stands as one of the most valuable worldwide, and it benefits from switching costs thanks to its productivity tools and cloud computing services.', 'Also worth noting: Microsoft is one of the few companies with a higher credit rating than the U.S. government.

Snowflake runs its platform on top of AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, so it's ironically paying hefty cloud hosting costs to its largest competitors."", ""Back in 2022, Snowflake's then-CEO Frank Slootman set a target for generating $10 billion in product revenue in fiscal 2029. To reach that goal, the company needs to grow its product revenue at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 30% from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2029. Unfortunately, it expects its ongoing slowdown to deepen with just 26%-27% year-over-year growth in product revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Slootman also abruptly resigned in late February and handed the reins over to his successor Sridhar Ramaswamy, but the company hasn't abandoned its ambitious growth targets yet."", ""Snowflake's gross, operating, and free cash flow margins are expanding on a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis, but it's still deeply unprofitable on a GAAP basis. Analysts expect its non-GAAP EPS to rise 16% in fiscal 2025 -- but its stock looks expensive at 165 times that estimate."", 'Alphabet faces a lot of near-term challenges, and it might turn into a slower growth company like IBM if it fails to keep pace with Microsoft and Amazon in the cloud and AI race. That said, it still looks like a safer investment than Snowflake, which is priced like a hypergrowth stock but quickly losing its momentum.

Since hitting a peak in November 2021, the stock has cratered 62% as it tries to regain its footing. Perhaps the initial excitement surrounding this growth stock has calmed down a bit."", ""But that price performance hasn't prevented some of Dutch Bros' most bullish supporters from hoping it can become the next Starbucks. Is this even a possible outcome? Let's take a closer look."", 'Dutch Bros just reported its 2023 financial results, and unsurprisingly, its growth took the spotlight. Revenue jumped 31% from 2022. And the business opened 160 net new stores during the 12-month period, bringing the total to 831. The company, which has a strong presence in the western and southern parts of the U.S., is gaining customers thanks to its customizable beverage offerings and accessible store formats.', ""Management sees huge potential in the years ahead. They're optimistic that Dutch Bros can have 4,000 locations open one day. That would translate to a nearly five-fold expansion from the current footprint. Surely, revenue will be astronomically higher at this level of scale."", 'While it makes sense that a business like this, which is in full-on expansion mode, is investing aggressively in growth opportunities, investors have something to be encouraged about. Dutch Bros reported adjusted net income of $50 million in 2023, a huge improvement from the $25 million posted the year before.', 'Wall Street analysts expect the bottom line to improve. Consensus estimates call for adjusted earnings per share to increase at a compound annual rate of 21% over the next three years.', ""Shares trade at a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 1.9 right now. That's down significantly from a couple years ago. And it represents a discount to Starbucks' P/S ratio of 2.9. Should Dutch Bros successfully executive its plan, the valuation is likely to get a boost."", 'With 38,587 stores scattered around the globe, Starbucks reported fiscal 2023 (ended Oct. 1) revenue of $36 billion. Just in the U.S., the business has 16,466 locations that raked in $6.6 billion in sales last fiscal quarter. This is the dominant leader in the retail coffee industry.', ""Consequently, I'm not so sure Dutch Bros can ever become Starbucks one day. That would require revenue and the store count to rise 26 and 20 times over, respectively. That's a monumental task."", ""Protecting Starbucks' competitive position is its incredibly powerful brand, which is the key source of its economic moat. According to Interbrand, this intangible asset alone is worth $15 billion, making it one of the most valuable in the world. It allows Starbucks to charge premium prices for its products, while at the same time driving customer loyalty and repeat purchases. "", 'Despite its massive scale, Starbucks isn\'t sitting around idle, as it has its own expansion plans. Executives hope to have 20,000 stores open in the U.S. over the long term. That includes the introduction of more of what management calls ""purpose-defined stores,"" including drive-through and delivery-only outfits.', 'And that means that on its quest for growth, Dutch Bros will undoubtedly be forced to compete more directly for favorable real estate with Starbucks. That seems like a difficult task, given that Starbucks has the financial resources, marketing capabilities, and superb digital foundation to excel.', ""Because of its rapid growth, Dutch Bros is receiving a lot of attention. But investors should seriously temper expectations if they think the small coffeehouse chain can one day get to Starbucks' level."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Dutch Bros right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Dutch Bros, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Dutch Bros wasn’t one of them.

But as of this writing, the restaurant stock is 26% below its peak price.', 'Before you rush to add this dominant enterprise to your portfolio, take the time to know these three facts about the company.', 'Starbucks generated $34.7 billion in revenue in the past 12 months, a sum that demonstrates its scale. Even more impressive, the business currently has 38,587 locations in 80 countries.', ""Based on these figures, you could be forgiven if you assumed that the company doesn't have much growth potential. But this would be a wrong assumption. Consensus analyst estimates call for revenue to increase at a compound annual rate of 9.1% over the next three fiscal years. And this will partly be driven by the opening of new locations."", 'Management hopes to have 20,000 stores open in the U.S. one day, up from 16,466 right now. And in China, where the biggest opportunity lies, executives plan to have 9,000 stores up and running by the end of fiscal 2025, a 29% expansion in less than two years from the 6,975 that are in the country today.', 'A key part of the growth plan is to further densify existing markets. This means a bigger focus on introducing drive-thru or delivery-only setups.', ""For a business to have long-term success in the way Starbucks has, it's crucial to have an economic moat -- a term popularized by Warren Buffett. It means that a company has an advantage that makes it more difficult for rivals to compete."", ""Starbucks' most valuable asset is its brand. It can be argued that the coffee and food the business sells are largely just commoditized products. But the company is able to charge premium prices since its brand differentiates it from rivals. This helps explain how the company's gross margin has averaged a superb 28.3% in the past decade."", 'Besides the invaluable brand, Starbucks also benefits from scale advantages. Compared to smaller competitors, it has the buying power and negotiating leverage to obtain better pricing on these commodities. Plus, any technology investments the company makes can benefit a much larger store and customer base.', ""Any retail business must find ways to meet its customers where they are. This means focusing on bolstering digital capabilities, allowing consumers to order in ways that are best for them. Launched in late 2009, Starbucks' highly successful rewards program does exactly this. It currently has 34.3 million 90-day active members domestically."", 'In a world that is becoming increasingly digitized, the data Starbucks can collect from these customers creates another advantage for its business. It provides insights that can be used to direct marketing and product development.', 'Management is able to drive customer loyalty and repeat purchases, the holy grail for any consumer-facing enterprise. In the U.S., rewards members account for 59% of all sales at company-owned locations.', '""Our growing Starbucks Rewards members are visiting our stores more frequently and increasing their spend each time that they come,"" CEO Laxman Narasimhan said on the 2024 first-quarter earnings call.', ""At the end of the day, it's all about increasing the accessibility and convenience to order Starbucks' products.

If they’re buying, you may want to look into it. Politicians seem to have an uncanny, remarkable track record of success.', 'For example, on Nov. 22,\xa0Rep. Nancy Pelosi bought 50 Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) 20 Dec 2024 $120 call options even as the underlying stock traded at a high of $503.31. Today, NVDA stock trades around $784.\xa0Had you followed her into NVDA, you stood to make a good deal of money.', 'Granted, not all of her trades worked out so well, but the exception proves the rule.\xa0 So if you find that a top official is buying something, you may want to do your due diligence and consider following them in. The only downfall to this strategy is that elected officials don’t have to disclose their transactions for\xa030 to 45 days under the STOCK Act. These three companies are some of the most popular stocks owned by Congress.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com', 'One of the top stocks owned by Congress is\xa0Simon Property Group\xa0(NYSE:SPG), a real estate investment trust (REIT) that yields 5.2%.', 'On Feb. 2,\xa0Rep. Victoria Spartz bought 91,000 shares for around $138 — just as it was bottoming out around the time earnings were coming out. The trade was then disclosed on Feb. 16, as SPG traded at $146. A week later it was up to $151. So, even if you and I bought on the disclosure, we would still have walked away with a few dollars.', 'At the time, it was a good bet on\xa0potential interest rate cuts and the company’s announcement of a\xa0$2 billion stock buyback. However, with no interest rate cuts to be seen, and the buyback news priced in, I’d wait for SPG stock to put in a healthy pullback before even considering buying Simon Property Group here.', 'With earnings, the REIT is seeing improvements. In its fourth quarter, Simon saw funds from operations (FFO) of $3.69, which beat by 36 cents. Revenue of $1.53 billion was up about 9% year over year, and beat estimates by $160 million. Guidance was a bit underwhelming, though. For the full-year 2024, it now expects its FFO to come in between $11.85 and $12.10 per share, which is lower than expectations for a range of $12.20 to $12.51 per share.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'We learned that\xa0Rep. Judy Chu\xa0bought just over $350,000 worth of\xa0Apollo Medical (NASDAQ:AMEH), as noted by CapitolTrades.com. The stock was purchased on Jan. 10 at $37.66. When the transaction was disclosed on Jan. 22, it traded at $37.65. Today, it closed at $42.79. If you bought on the disclosure, you could have made a nice little profit.', 'At its current price though, I’d wait for it to pull back. Right now, it’s overbought on various technical analysis indicators like relative strength, moving averages, and momentum.\xa0However, over the long term, it could be attractive. According to Bank of America – which upgraded it to a buy rating – there’s “an inflection point in the growth story, with a high confidence path to sustaining 30-40%+ revenue and 20%+ EBITDA growth through at least 2026,”\xa0as quoted by Seeking Alpha.', 'The firm also points to a few key headwinds for AMEH, including organic contract wins, tuck-in mergers and acquisitions and a reduction in its corporate tax rate. Of special note is the end of Medicaid redeterminations, which is Apollo Medical’s largest customer segment.', 'Source: Thapana_Studio / Shutterstock.com', 'Another top trade was the Vanguard Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:VUG). We can see that on Nov. 3,\xa0Rep. Hal Rogers bought shares just under $270. That was then disclosed on Dec. 20. Then, on Jan. 19,\xa0Rep. Blake Moore bought shares at $319.98. He then disclosed that five days later on Jan. 24. Since then, the VUG ETF ran to $338.84.', 'While it’s also a bit overbought at the moment, it could eventually see higher highs.\xa0Vanguard Growth has an expense ratio of just 0.04%. Like all of Vanguard’s family of funds, they tend to be the lowest in the business.\xa0The Vanguard Growth ETF tracks the nation’s largest growth stocks, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to name a few of its 208 holdings.', 'These, of course, were some of the leading Magnificent Seven stocks last year and powered the market indexes to new highs.

That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).', 'Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors.

This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at PPG Industries' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters."", ""Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences.

Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.', 'While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.', 'I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.', 'Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of PPG Industries, Inc.. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$71m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. ', ""The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 17% stake in PPG Industries. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run."", ""I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company.

When he was CFO of JPMorgan during the ""London Whale"" trading debacle, he had to testify before Senate lawmakers in 2013. At Wells Fargo, Braunstein will report directly to the CEO as vice chairman.', '""Doug is a world-class banker,"" Scharf said in a press release, noting that his ""expertise and business relationships reflect our continued commitment to strengthen"" Wells Fargo\'s Wall Street unit.', 'The CEO of the nation’s fourth-largest bank is not out of the woods with regulators, however. Even though Scharf has ticked off six consent orders that regulators had in place when he became boss, Scharf still has eight to go — including two added during his tenure.', 'The big one is a cap on the size of Wells Fargo imposed by the Federal Reserve. It can’t go past the $1.95 trillion in assets it had at the end of 2017 unless regulators say so. The Fed imposed the broad restriction in 2018, citing ""widespread consumer abuses"" at Wells Fargo.', 'Lifting that cap would allow Wells Fargo to boost activity in its capital-intensive markets business, CFO Mike Santomassimo said last Monday at a UBS conference in Florida.', '""I would just caution that when it does happen, it’s not this kind of light switch moment,"" Santomassimo said, but ""we do believe that there\'ll be some opportunity there.""

We can\'t lose sight of that.""', 'Several analysts who follow the bank said Wells Fargo is taking steps in the right direction, and they do expect the Fed to eventually take the bank out of the penalty box.', '""They’ve done a tremendous amount under these highly idiosyncratic restrictions,"" said Scott Siefers, an analyst for Piper Sandler who has covered the bank over nearly two decades. ""To reach the company\'s full potential, they will certainly need more freedom over some period of time,"" he added.', 'The timing for when the Fed removes Wells Fargo\'s balance sheet limit remains ""hard to predict,"" according to Jefferies bank analyst Ken Usdin.', ""Even after this asset cap is removed, a second third-party review is required to assess the bank's improvements."", 'The irony of Wells Fargo’s regulatory predicament is that there was a time not that long ago when it faced fewer constraints than its peers.', 'It was able to dodge many of the problems that hobbled other big banks during the 2008 financial crisis and became a coast-to-coast giant with its purchase that year of Wachovia, a big Charlotte lender weakened by a national mortgage meltdown.', 'The bank emerged from the crisis with a reputation for being conservative, not taking a lot of risks, and relying on a plain-vanilla, old-fashioned strategy of boosting revenue by cross-selling various products to existing customers.', 'But that strength turned into a weakness after it became clear in the second half of last decade that the bank had opened millions of bank and credit card accounts without customers’ knowledge as employees raced to meet their sales goals.', 'CEO John Stumpf, who had been with the bank for three decades, resigned and was later barred by regulators from the banking industry.', 'His successor Tim Sloan left in 2019.

Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 52% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.', ""The company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2014, the dividend has gone from $1.60 total annually to $5.00. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 12% over that duration. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time."", ""Investors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. However, Packaging Corporation of America's EPS was effectively flat over the past five years, which could stop the company from paying more every year.

This isn't necessarily bad, but we wouldn't expect rapid dividend growth in the future."", ""In summary, it is good to see that the dividend is staying consistent, and we don't think there is any reason to suspect this might change over the medium term.

Based on this payment, the dividend yield on the company's stock will be 3.6%, which is an attractive boost to shareholder returns."", ' See our latest analysis for Northern Trust ', ""A big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained."", ""Having distributed dividends for at least 10 years, Northern Trust has a long history of paying out a part of its earnings to shareholders. Taking data from its last earnings report, calculating for the company's payout ratio shows 59%, which means that Northern Trust would be able to pay its last dividend without pressure on the balance sheet."", 'Looking forward, EPS is forecast to rise by 47.9% over the next 3 years. The future payout ratio could be 45% over that time period, according to analyst estimates, which is a good look for the future of the dividend.', 'The company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.24 in 2014 to the most recent total annual payment of $3.00. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 9.2% a year over that time. The dividend has been growing very nicely for a number of years, and has given its shareholders some nice income in their portfolios.', ""The company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Let's not jump to conclusions as things might not be as good as they appear on the surface. Northern Trust has seen earnings per share falling at 5.1% per year over the last five years. If earnings continue declining, the company may have to make the difficult choice of reducing the dividend or even stopping it completely - the opposite of dividend growth. It's not all bad news though, as the earnings are predicted to rise over the next 12 months - we would just be a bit cautious until this can turn into a longer term trend."", 'In summary, we are pleased with the dividend remaining consistent, and we think there is a good chance of this continuing in the future. The earnings coverage is acceptable for now, but with earnings on the decline we would definitely keep an eye on the payout ratio. The dividend looks okay, but there have been some issues in the past, so we would be a little bit cautious.', 'Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. Given that earnings are not growing, the dividend does not look nearly so attractive. Very few businesses see earnings consistently shrink year after year in perpetuity though, and so it might be worth seeing what the 12 analysts we track are forecasting for the future.

For one thing, I needed a few stocks to replace my long-term market-losing position in Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS), which I finally exited after the most recent rally. It's a late decision that cost me, as Netflix has been the obvious outperformer over the last year-plus since I put Disney on the chopping block."", ""In fact, much of the traditional media industry is a mess right now, with the exception of Netflix. Here's what finally pushed me over the edge to pull the trigger on Netflix -- even after the stock doubled in the last year."", ""As I've explained for years, despite being a Netflix subscriber, I could never bring myself to own a slice of the business itself because of a lack of profitability. Sure, Netflix has been showing GAAP net income for quite some time. But on a free cash flow basis (which includes the money paid for the company to create content, versus GAAP net income which amortizes this key expense over time), Netflix was decidedly unprofitable."", 'But that changed in grand fashion in 2023. As Netflix has grown up, it has turned highly profitable by all measures over the last year. Free cash flow is now being cranked out at an even higher rate than GAAP net income.', ""Of course, the market has taken note of Netflix's more profitable advance as well -- thus the big stock run-up, especially since the start of 2023. Shares now trade for a premium 50 times trailing 12-month earnings, or nearly 40 times trailing 12-month free cash flow. Surely it's too late to buy now, right?"", ""Netflix's subscriber base continues to rise higher. This media business has fewer international border confines than the traditional U.S. TV business, and Netflix's steady investment over the years in a diverse set of content has positioned it well. Total subscribers grew 13% year over year in Q4 2023 to surpass 260 million."", 'The world is still a very large place, though, and Netflix still estimates its share of global screen time at just a single-digit percentage. Subscription pricing keeps rising too, and an ads business is now being built, putting Netflix on track to eventually become something resembling what traditional cable is today (except for the consumer ability to more carefully select what they want to watch at any given moment). Nevertheless, steady subscriber growth remains a key reason Netflix can sustain a low-teens revenue growth rate in the years to come.', 'Along the way, management has stated that it intends to continue gradually increasing those profit margins. On a free cash flow basis, 2024 is expected to yield a similar result to the $6 billion the company generated in 2023, owing to Netflix ramping up from a content production pause in the U.S. due to actor and writer strikes last year. Despite this near-term flattish outlook, however, Netflix remains a highly profitable business with ample cash to fund its expansion plans.', ""And shareholders are now being rewarded too. Netflix returned $6 billion of that cash last year via stock repurchases. That's another reason for optimism going forward, despite the rich valuation on the stock."", 'In all, the story has changed dramatically at Netflix, and what has emerged from the bear market of the last couple of years is healthy growth and a profitable media business. I plan on buying more Netflix stock as the year progresses.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Netflix right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Netflix, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Netflix wasn’t one of them.

Afghanistan has collapsed to the Taliban. Azerbaijan and Armenia exchange regular fire in the Caucasus after the former seized parts of the Nagorno-Karabakh region from Armenian control in 2020. Russia’s war on Ukraine has gone beyond two years (737 days), with no immediate end in sight. And if that was not it, the Middle East is facing what analysts describe as the worst crisis in the region since 1973 after Israel launched a full-scale invasion of Gaza in response to Hamas’ attacks on Israel in October last year.', 'Defense spending reached a record-high of $2.2 trillion in 2022, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, with Europe witnessing its steepest rise in military expenditure in three decades.

General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD)’s combat systems unit also generated a 25% YoY higher revenue during the third quarter of 2023.

Owning these stocks offers the opportunity for solid long-term total returns because of the steady, increasing payouts.', 'However, even among the aristocrats, there are some that are more regal than others. This has nothing to do with the amount of years of dividend growth under a particular company’s belt. There are plenty of not only mere “aristocrats,” but “dividend kings” (stocks with over 50 years of consecutive dividend growth) as well as questionable dividend growth prospects.', 'A prime example is 3M (NYSE:MMM). As I have discussed previously, following the settlement of billions worth of litigation, plus other headwinds like persistent weak growth, a dividend cut may be in its future. With this, the key to steady, growing payouts in the long haul may entail finding the aristocrats with the best chances of maintaining their royal status.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'That’s the situation here, with these seven dividend stocks.', 'Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock', 'Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP), best known for being the world’s leading payroll processing company, is a top choice among blue-chips with dividend quality and growth potential. Not only is the business services firm in the “dividend aristocrats” category.', 'Over the past five years, dividends for ADP stock have increased by an average of 12.96% annually. While the stock’s 2.19% forward yield may look tiny in a high-interest environment, this payout is likely to grow considerably over time. At least, earnings forecasts for Automatic Data Processing.', 'These call for the company’s earnings to increase by more than 30% this fiscal year (ending June 2024), and by another 9.52% during the next fiscal year. Besides pointing to higher payouts, steady earnings growth also points to further price appreciation. In turn, leading to strong potential for above-average total returns from buying/holding this stock.', 'Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com', 'With a 63-year track record of dividend growth, Cincinnati Financial (NASDAQ:CINF) is up there with 3M, as one of the “kings” among dividend stocks. However, unlike the possibly-threatened dividend of the aforementioned industrial conglomerate, payout growth from this property & casualty insurer is likely sustainable.', 'Forecasts for CINF stock call for the insurer to report earnings growth in the high single-digit/low-teens range over the next two years. This is in line with Cincinnati Financial’s average annual dividend growth over the past five years (7.19%). Trading for 17.9 times forward earnings, a fair valuation for a property & casualty insurer, CINF may not be in the running to experience much earnings multiple expansion.', 'That said, shares could still appreciate in value, in tandem with increased earnings. This, coupled with the dividend (currently giving CINF a 2.87% forward yield), could result in satisfactory long-term total returns.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) is of course not the only consumer staples stock in the “dividend aristocrats” category. Yet while peers such as Clorox (NYSE:CLX) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) are also popular among long-term dividend investors, shares in this maker of products like its namesake toothpaste, Irish Spring soap, and household cleaner Ajax may be the better buy among the bunch.', 'Clorox has the highest forward yield among the three (3.14%, versus 2.23% for CL stock and 2.34% for PG). That said, issues like a post-Covid sales slump and the continued impact of last year’s cyber attack call into question Clorox’s dividend growth sustainability.', 'PG is similar to CL in terms of yield, its payout ratio, as well as in expected earnings growth. However, Colgate-Palmolive (at 24.6 times forward earnings) is slightly cheaper than Procter & Gamble (which trades for 25.1 times forward earnings).', 'Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com', 'Long-term dividend stocks are usually defensive stocks, but in the case of General Dynamics (NYSE:GD), it’s a defensive stock in the defense industry. General Dynamics has a 29 year dividend growth track record. The current geopolitical environment strongly suggests this streak will continue.', 'Irrespective of how the global economy fares in 2024, one thing is certain. There’s little end in sight to conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. New conflicts could emerge in Africa and Asia. Expect continued strong results for General Dynamics in the years ahead, as the U.S. keeps spending heavily on defense in light of this strife.', 'GD stock has a forward dividend yield of only 1.93%, but payouts have increased by an average of 7.26% per year over the past five years.

Largely, because of the industrial conglomerate’s dividend growth history. Besides being an “aristocrat,” ITW has increased its payout at a high single-digit clip (8.77% annually on average) over the past five years.', 'This dividend (2.15% at current prices) provides a steady baseline of returns for ITW stock investors. Some in the sell-side community has soured on Illinois Tool Works as of late. Over the past month, analysts at BofA and Wells Fargo have both downgraded ITW to “underweight.”', 'Challenges like weak demand and falling margins may persist for now. Even so, as macro factors like inflation and interest rates normalize, ITW could soon get back on track, in terms of earnings growth. Earnings and dividend growth will help drive a move to higher prices for shares.', 'Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com', 'With the management of Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) strongly committed to return-of-capital efforts, it’s no surprise that this is one of the top dividend stocks. A “dividend king,” with 60 years of consecutive dividend growth, the most recent payout increased happened last May.', 'The company increased its dividend by 5%. Currently paying investors $1.10 per share annually in dividends, LOW stock has a forward yield of 1.89%. There’s a good reason I kicked off discussion about Lowe’s by mentioning “return of capital.” Besides steady, ever-growing dividends, Lowe’s has since late 2022 been buying back stock, as part of a $15 billion share repurchase program.', 'In terms of company-specific catalysts, factors like a rebound in housing demand may positively affect Lowe’s fiscal performance in the future.

In the near-term, there’s a catalyst that could have a major impact on Realty Income’s valuation: the expected lowering of interest rates.', 'Uncertainty above the Federal Reserve’s so-called “pivot” has weighed on O shares since the start of the year, as I noted earlier this month.

The clean energy infrastructure company lost more than half its value as surging interest rates impacted its ability to fund its business and growth. That shellacking has pushed its dividend yield into the double digits. ', ""I recently decided to take advantage of the sell-off by buying a few more shares of the renewable energy producer. While there's a near-term risk that it might need to reduce its big-time dividend, I think it has tremendous total return potential in the coming years."", ""NextEra Energy's cost of capital surged last year because of rising interest rates and its sagging stock price. That had a significant impact on the company. It couldn't get new funding at an attractive rate to refinance maturing debt, buy back the convertible equity portfolio financing (CEPF) it used to make acquisitions, or make new acquisitions."", 'That led the company to make two notable adjustments. The first change was to unveil plans to become a pure play on renewable energy by selling its natural gas pipeline assets in stages to help complete the buyouts of CEPFs maturing over the next few years.', 'NextEra Energy Partners closed the sale of its STX Midstream assets to Kinder Morgan late last year, netting $1.8 billion. It used that money to repay associated debt and pay down its credit facility so it could fund the buyouts of $1.1 billion of CEPFs due in June 2024 and June 2025. The company plans to sell its Meade Pipeline assets next year to help fund CEPFs maturing in 2026. ', 'The company also revised its growth expectations last year to limit its capital requirements. It cut its dividend growth rate from 12%-15% annually through 2026 to 5%-8% with a target of 6%. NextEra Energy Partners also shifted its growth driver from acquisitions to repowering existing wind farms. These projects require less capital and generate higher returns, which will help grow its cash flow over the next few years to support a rising dividend. ', ""NextEra Energy Partners' strategy would see it continue growing its high-yielding dividend for the next few years while shoring up its financial foundation. However, there is one major caveat. The company's plan puts its dividend payout ratio in the mid-90s through 2026. That's awfully high and leaves no room for error. If the company runs into any additional trouble, it might need to cut its dividend to retain more cash to help fund its strategy. "", ""NextEra Energy Partners' strategy shift should help return its cost of capital to an attractive level. That would put it in a better position to capitalize on the massive growth potential of the renewable energy industry. According to estimates, the U.S. will need to invest $4 trillion to decarbonize the economy by 2050 by building 7,000 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity. That should power accelerating growth in the sector. Renewable energy development is on track to increase from 175 GW in the 2023-2026 timeframe to 250 GW between 2027-2030. "", ""The company could play an important role in helping finance new renewable energy projects. It serves as a funding vehicle for its parent, utility NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE), which is a leading renewable energy project developer. NextEra had traditionally sold cash-flowing operating assets to its affiliate, giving it the cash to invest in new developments. Meanwhile, those deals have historically helped power NextEra Energy Partners' rapidly rising dividend."", 'Once NextEra Energy Partners can get its finances back on solid ground, it will be in a better position to accelerate its growth rate by making acquisitions from its parent again. It has the potential to create a lot of value for investors in the future by capitalizing on the massive growth ahead for renewable energy.', ""NextEra Energy Partners has been under a lot of pressure over the past year because of the impact of surging interest rates on its strategy. However, it has a plan to address that issue while continuing to increase its high-yielding dividend. While there's still a near-term risk it might eventually have to reduce that payout to retain more cash, it has significant long-term growth potential.

The future results of NEP and its business and financial condition are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause NEP\'s actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties could require NEP to limit or eliminate certain operations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: NEP\'s ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders is affected by the performance of its renewable energy projects which could be impacted by wind and solar conditions and in certain circumstances by market prices; operation and maintenance of renewable energy projects and pipelines involve significant risks that could result in unplanned power outages, reduced output or capacity, property damage, personal injury or loss of life; NEP\'s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects can be materially adversely affected by weather conditions and related impacts, including, but not limited to, the impact of severe weather; NEP depends on certain of the renewable energy projects and the investment in pipeline asests in its portfolio for a substantial portion of its anticipated cash flows; the repowering of renewable energy projects or requires up-front capital expenditures and could expose NEP to project development risks; geopolitical factors, terrorist acts, cyberattacks or other similar events could impact NEP\'s projects, pipeline investment or surrounding areas and adversely affect its business; the ability of NEP to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be materially adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, as well as the financial condition of insurers. NEP\'s insurance coverage does not provide protection against all significant losses; NEP relies on interconnection and transmission and other pipeline facilities of third parties to deliver energy from its renewable energy projects and to transport natural gas to and from its pipeline investment. If these facilities become unavailable, NEP\'s projects and pipeline investment may not be able to operate or deliver energy or may become partially or fully unavailable to transport natural gas; NEP\'s business is subject to liabilities and operating restrictions arising from environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, compliance with which may require significant capital expenditures, increase NEP\'s cost of operations and affect or limit its business plans; NEP\'s renewable energy projects and pipeline investment may be adversely affected by new or revised laws or regulations, interpretations of these laws and regulations or a failure to comply with current applicable energy and pipeline regulations; NEP does not own all of the land on which the projects in its portfolio are located and its use and enjoyment of the property may be adversely affected to the extent that there are any lienholders or land rights holders that have rights that are superior to NEP\'s rights or the United States of America (U.S.) Bureau of Land Management suspends its federal rights-of-way grants; NEP is subject to risks associated with litigation or administrative proceedings; NEP is subject to risks associated with its ownership interests in projects that it identifies for repowering, which could result in its inability to complete construction at those projects on time or at all, and make those projects too expensive to complete or cause the return on an investment to be less than expected; NEP relies on a limited number of customers and is exposed to the risk that they may be unwilling or unable to fulfill their contractual obligations to NEP or that they otherwise terminate their agreements with NEP; NEP or its pipeline investment may not be able to extend, renew or replace expiring or terminated power purchase agreements (PPAs), natural gas transportation agreements or other customer contracts at favorable rates or on a long-term basis; if the energy production by or availability of NEP\'s renewable energy projects is less than expected, they may not be able to satisfy minimum production or availability obligations under their PPAs; NEP\'s ability to acquire assets involves risks; reductions in demand for natural gas in the U.S. and low market prices of natural gas could materially adversely affect NEP\'s pipeline investment\'s operations and cash flows; government laws, regulations and policies providing incentives and subsidies for clean energy could be changed, reduced or eliminated at any time and such changes may negatively impact NEP and its ability to make acquisitions; NEP\'s ability to acquire projects depends on the availability of projects developed by NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE) and third parties, which face risks related to project siting, financing, construction, permitting, the environment, governmental approvals and the negotiation of project development agreements; acquisitions of existing clean energy projects involve numerous risks; NEP may acquire assets that use other renewable energy technologies and may acquire other types of assets. Any such acquisition may present unforeseen challenges and result in a competitive disadvantage relative to NEP\'s more-established competitors; certain agreements which NEP or its subsidiaries are parties to have provisions which may preclude NEP from engaging in specified change of control and similar transactions; NEP faces substantial competition primarily from regulated utility holding companies, developers, independent power producers, pension funds and private equity funds for opportunities in North America; the natural gas pipeline industry is highly competitive, and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect NEP\'s pipeline investment; NEP may not be able to access sources of capital on commercially reasonable terms; restrictions in NEP and its subsidiaries\' financing agreements could adversely affect NEP\'s business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders; NEP may be unable to maintain its current credit ratings; NEP\'s cash distributions to its unitholders may be reduced as a result of restrictions on NEP\'s subsidiaries\' cash distributions to NEP under the terms of their indebtedness or other financing agreements or otherwise to address alternative business purposes; NEP\'s and its subsidiaries\' substantial amount of indebtedness may adversely affect NEP\'s ability to operate its business, and its failure to comply with the terms of its subsidiaries\' indebtedness or refinance, extend or repay the indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on NEP\'s financial condition; NEP is exposed to risks inherent in its use of interest rate swaps; widespread public health crises and epidemics or pandemics may have material adverse impacts on NEP\'s business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and ability to grow its business and make cash distributions to its unitholders; NEE has influence over NEP; under the cash sweep and credit support agreement, NEP receives credit support from NEE and its affiliates. NEP\'s subsidiaries may default under contracts or become subject to cash sweeps if credit support is terminated, if NEE or its affiliates fail to honor their obligations under credit support arrangements, or if NEE or another credit support provider ceases to satisfy creditworthiness requirements, and NEP will be required in certain circumstances to reimburse NEE for draws that are made on credit support; NextEra Energy Resources, LLC (NEER) and certain of its affiliates are permitted to borrow funds received by NextEra Energy Operating Partners, LP (NEP OpCo) or its subsidiaries and is obligated to return these funds only as needed to cover project costs and distributions or as demanded by NEP OpCo. NEP\'s financial condition and ability to make distributions to its unitholders, as well as its ability to grow distributions in the future, is highly dependent on NEER\'s performance of its obligations to return all or a portion of these funds; NEER\'s right of first refusal may adversely affect NEP\'s ability to consummate future sales or to obtain favorable sale terms; NextEra Energy Partners GP, Inc.

Agency-backed MBS are very low-risk fixed-income investments. They're also fairly low-return investments."", 'Residential mortgage REITs like AGNC juice those returns by using leverage. But that also increases risk. For example, amid rising interest rates, borrowing costs rise, which squeezes profit margins.

The company noted that one of the crucial factors supporting its dividend is its ability to earn a high enough return on equity to cover its expenses and payout. Right now, its dividend is in alignment with its returns. However, if market conditions or other factors deteriorate, the REIT might need to cut its payout again. ', 'NextEra Energy Partners owns a growing portfolio of clean-energy infrastructure, like wind farms and solar projects, as well as natural gas pipelines. Those assets generate very stable income, nearly all of which it pays to investors in dividends.', 'The company finances its business with debt and a funding vehicle called convertible equity portfolio financing (CEPF). Rising interest rates have made it challenging to refinance maturing debt and complete the required repurchases of CEPF as they come due. These issues forced the company to make some changes, including selling off its gas pipeline assets to repay maturing CEPF and slowing its dividend growth forecast. ', 'NextEra Energy now expects to increase its dividend by 5% to 8% annually through 2026 with a target of 6% (down from 12% to 15% per year).

It looks fairly cheap, historically speaking. It is the type of company that a lot of investors will want to have in their portfolios, but it is not going to be the perfect fit for everyone. Here's why NextEra Energy is a buy -- and why some might want to pass it by."", ""NextEra Energy was able to grow its adjusted earnings per share at a compound annual rate of 9.8% between 2012 and 2022. In 2023, adjusted earnings per share rose 9.3%. So it's generated more than a decade of nearly 10% growth in adjusted earnings. That's a very impressive figure, particularly for a utility. Utilities are generally considered slow and steady companies that provide investors with reliable income streams. But NextEra isn't your typical utility."", ""Roughly 70% of NextEra's business is made up of regulated utility assets, largely Florida Power & Light. The remainder is the company's renewable power segment. The regulated assets give NextEra a strong foundation. It basically gets a monopoly in the regions it serves in exchange for having to get its rates and investment plans approved by the government. That said, Florida has seen net migration for years, which has resulted in a steady increase in customers. The renewable power business is the company's growth platform, with around 34 gigawatts of production capacity and plans to potentially more than double that figure by 2026."", ""This combination is expected to boost adjusted earnings between 6% and 8% a year through at least 2026. It's also worth highlighting that NextEra has an investment-grade balance sheet, so it has a solid financial foundation to back up its robust business. As another sign of the company's fortitude, the dividend has been increased annually for nearly three decades. It is the type of boring and reliable stock that a lot of investors will like."", ""The problem is that investors have largely recognized the company's strong performance and solid outlook. NextEra Energy's dividend yield is 3.6%, which is just average for a utility stock, using Vanguard Utilities Index ETF (NYSEMKT: VPU) as an industry proxy. Thus, investors seeking to maximize the income they generate from their portfolios will probably not be excited by NextEra Energy."", ""However, that 3.6% yield is near the highest levels of the past decade. Viewed in that light, it appears that the stock is on sale right now. This is likely driven by the rise in interest rates, which will increase the company's expenses. Higher costs will be a headwind to growth."", ""That's not great, but management is still projecting a dividend boost of 10% in 2024. That is roughly the same rate it has achieved over the past decade. And the respectable adjusted earnings projections noted above should support continued dividend increases, though perhaps not quite in the double-digit range. Even if dividend growth slowed to the pace of adjusted earnings expansion, NextEra Energy would still be a standout dividend growth stock in the utility sector."", 'That is the big story here. Yes, you can buy utilities with higher yields. But finding a utility with as strong a dividend growth profile will be much harder to achieve. Growth-and-income investors and dividend growth investors will probably find NextEra Energy extremely attractive today.', ""There's no such thing as a perfect stock, so it is hardly surprising that there are some investors who won't see NextEra Energy's appeal. That said, given its strong business, solid balance sheet, and promising growth prospects, a lot of investors will likely find this utility quite compelling. It would fit particularly well in a growth-and-income portfolio, because it could add diversification to a portfolio that would most likely be light on utility exposure."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy right now?', 'Before you buy stock in NextEra Energy, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and NextEra Energy wasn’t one of them.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.', ""So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Masco (NYSE:MAS). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing."", ' View our latest analysis for Masco ', ""If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. We can see that in the last three years Masco grew its EPS by 11% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up."", 'Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. While Masco may have maintained EBIT margins over the last year, revenue has fallen. This does not bode too well for short term growth prospects and so understanding the reasons for these results is of great importance.', ""The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. For finer detail, click on the image."", ""The trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Masco's future EPS 100% free."", ""Since Masco has a market capitalisation of US$17b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Holding US$71m worth of stock in the company is no laughing matter and insiders will be committed in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders. This should keep them focused on creating long term value for shareholders."", ""While it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. Our quick analysis into CEO remuneration would seem to indicate they are. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Masco, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$12m."", ""Masco's CEO took home a total compensation package worth US$6.3m in the year leading up to December 2022. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given it's below the median for similar sized companies. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense."", ""One positive for Masco is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. Earnings growth might be the main attraction for Masco, but the fun does not stop there. Boasting both modest CEO pay and considerable insider ownership, you'd argue this one is worthy of the watchlist, at least. Still, you should learn about the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Masco."", 'Although Masco certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares. If you like to see companies with insider buying, then check out this handpicked selection of companies that not only boast of strong growth but have also seen recent insider buying..', 'Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.', 'Have feedback on this article?

When he was CFO of JPMorgan during the ""London Whale"" trading debacle, he had to testify before Senate lawmakers in 2013. At Wells Fargo, Braunstein will report directly to the CEO as vice chairman.', '""Doug is a world-class banker,"" Scharf said in a press release, noting that his ""expertise and business relationships reflect our continued commitment to strengthen"" Wells Fargo\'s Wall Street unit.', 'The CEO of the nation’s fourth-largest bank is not out of the woods with regulators, however. Even though Scharf has ticked off six consent orders that regulators had in place when he became boss, Scharf still has eight to go — including two added during his tenure.', 'The big one is a cap on the size of Wells Fargo imposed by the Federal Reserve. It can’t go past the $1.95 trillion in assets it had at the end of 2017 unless regulators say so. The Fed imposed the broad restriction in 2018, citing ""widespread consumer abuses"" at Wells Fargo.', 'Lifting that cap would allow Wells Fargo to boost activity in its capital-intensive markets business, CFO Mike Santomassimo said last Monday at a UBS conference in Florida.', '""I would just caution that when it does happen, it’s not this kind of light switch moment,"" Santomassimo said, but ""we do believe that there\'ll be some opportunity there."" At the moment, ""our focus is really to solve the risk and regulatory work first. ... We can\'t lose sight of that.""', 'Several analysts who follow the bank said Wells Fargo is taking steps in the right direction, and they do expect the Fed to eventually take the bank out of the penalty box.', '""They’ve done a tremendous amount under these highly idiosyncratic restrictions,"" said Scott Siefers, an analyst for Piper Sandler who has covered the bank over nearly two decades. ""To reach the company\'s full potential, they will certainly need more freedom over some period of time,"" he added.', 'The timing for when the Fed removes Wells Fargo\'s balance sheet limit remains ""hard to predict,"" according to Jefferies bank analyst Ken Usdin.', ""Even after this asset cap is removed, a second third-party review is required to assess the bank's improvements."", 'The irony of Wells Fargo’s regulatory predicament is that there was a time not that long ago when it faced fewer constraints than its peers.', 'It was able to dodge many of the problems that hobbled other big banks during the 2008 financial crisis and became a coast-to-coast giant with its purchase that year of Wachovia, a big Charlotte lender weakened by a national mortgage meltdown.', 'The bank emerged from the crisis with a reputation for being conservative, not taking a lot of risks, and relying on a plain-vanilla, old-fashioned strategy of boosting revenue by cross-selling various products to existing customers.', 'But that strength turned into a weakness after it became clear in the second half of last decade that the bank had opened millions of bank and credit card accounts without customers’ knowledge as employees raced to meet their sales goals.', 'CEO John Stumpf, who had been with the bank for three decades, resigned and was later barred by regulators from the banking industry.', 'His successor Tim Sloan left in 2019. He is now suing the bank in a California state court for $34 million, claiming the bank canceled stock grants and that Sloan was used as a ""scapegoat"" for the sales practices scandal.', 'The bank has said that it stands by its decisions and that ""compensation decisions are based on performance.""', 'The search for a replacement landed Scharf, who had been in charge of JPMorgan’s consumer bank while working for Dimon and then became the CEO of credit card giant Visa (V) and custody bank Bank of New York Mellon (BK).', 'His own overhaul has not been without surprises, including a $3.7 billion pact in December 2022 with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to resolve allegations that it illegally overcharged customers on their auto loans and mortgages. The actions at issue took place as recently as 2022.', 'Scharf has also significantly reduced the bank’s workforce. Since peaking during the pandemic in 2020 with 276,000 employees, Wells has eliminated roughly 18% of its headcount — or 50,000 employees. The bank’s CFO said this past week that Wells Fargo may also trim more real estate as a cost-cutting move.', 'There was also a new reminder this past week that the sales-practice scandal is still not totally behind the bank.', ""The company was sued in a San Francisco federal court by customers claiming the lender was not doing enough to assist those who were harmed by being signed up for products they didn't want."", 'The bank sent out letters asking for people to contact Wells Fargo if they had been enrolled in such products, but the lawsuit claims the letter burdens the customer to take action.', 'Wells Fargo tries ""to avoid, reduce, and delay its ultimate liability and sweep under the rug its long-standing, intentional misconduct,"" lawyers representing the bank\'s customers stated.', 'The bank said it is still reviewing the legal claims.

The market\'s insatiable appetite for high-growth AI stocks and a ""fear of missing out"" amplified those gains.', 'As the bull market continues, it might seem difficult to find cheap stocks that still have a lot of upside potential. However, I believe these three oft-overlooked stocks -- Magnite (NASDAQ: MGNI), DigitalOcean (NYSE: DOCN), and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) -- are still screaming bargains right now.', ""Magnite is an ad tech company created by the merger of The Rubicon Project and Telaria in 2020. It subsequently acquired several other companies to become the world's largest independent sell-side platform (SSP) for digital ads."", 'SSPs help publishers manage and sell their own ad inventories, and they shouldn\'t be confused with demand-side platforms (DSPs) that sell the actual advertising space. Digital advertising giants like Alphabet\'s Google bundle together SSPs, DSPs, and other advertising tools, but independent SSPs and DSPs encourage companies to buy and sell ads across the ""open internet,"" which isn\'t locked into the ""walled gardens"" of tech giants like Google.', 'Magnite suffered a slowdown over the past year as its connected-TV business, which previously drove most of its growth, cooled off in a challenging macro environment. In 2023, its revenue rose only 7% as its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) dipped 4%.

Its recent acquisition of the cloud startup Paperspace last year also added GPU-powered AI processing services to its servers.', 'Like many of its peers, DigitalOcean struggled as many companies reined in their software spending to cope with the macro headwinds.

Its higher-value customers who pay at least $50 a month also accounted for 86% of its full-year revenue. Its adjusted EBITDA margin expanded six percentage points to 40% in 2023.', ""The company is bracing for tougher macro headwinds and a near-term slowdown in 2024, but analysts still expect its revenue and adjusted EBITDA to both grow at a CAGR of 13% from 2023 to 2026.

Over just nine days in February, as Bloomberg reported on Feb. 20, Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos unloaded a total of 50 million shares of Amazon stock, netting $8.5 billion in proceeds -- nearly $1 billion per day of selling. Now inquiring minds want to know: What is Bezos planning to do with all the cash?', ""One possible answer: He's going to buy himself another space company."", ""For the better part of a year now, rumors have swirled around the fate of United Launch Alliance, the rocket-launching joint venture formed by Boeing (NYSE: BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) in 2005 -- and until SpaceX entered the national security launch market in 2016, America's primary means of delivering government satellites to orbit."", 'Ars Technica first broke the story back in March of 2023, and rumors soon sprang up about who might be bidding for ULA. Would Boeing -- or Lockheed -- try to buy out its partner? Might a second-tier space company like Northop Grumman (NYSE: NOC) try to expand its business by buying ULA? Or perhaps another defense giant, such as Textron (NYSE: TXT), would see buying ULA as a way to break into the space business itself?', ""From the very start, however, one company always seemed the most likely to want to own ULA. Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin was a rising star in space circles, and had a successful suborbital rocket and a budding space tourism business. It also built rocket engines for ULA, but had no actual, orbital rocket of its own with which to deliver payloads to orbit."", ""What Blue Origin did have was a multi-multi-(multi)-billion-dollar founder in Jeff Bezos, and therefore easy access to the billions of dollars it would cost to take out ULA. And now, as the bidding for ULA finally nears its (presumed) end, wouldn't you know it?"", 'Jeff Bezos is accessing those dollars himself, in a series of transactions yielding $8.5 billion. Cash.', 'Citing unnamed sources, Ars Technica predicted last month that a sale of ULA was imminent, and might happen ""within a month or two."" That timeline, coming so quickly on the heels of reports of Bezos selling Amazon stock, certainly does seem to suggest that Bezos (and Blue Origin) are laying the groundwork for a purchase of ULA.', 'It remains to be seen, however, whether the government would permit such a sale.', ""On the one hand, buying ULA would give Blue Origin immediate access to ULA's growing fleet of Vulcan Centaur orbital rockets -- for which Blue Origin itself already provides the engines -- as well as a host of contracts to launch the same for ULA customers. (Blue Origin therefore wouldn't have to wait to see if its planned New Glenn rocket can make a successful flight to enter the space race immediately.) At the same time, winning Bezos as a backer would give ULA an immediate cash infusion as it works to upgrade its technology to better compete with Elon Musk and SpaceX."", 'On the other hand, though, with Blue Origin so close to testing New Glenn, the U.S. Air Force is on the cusp of having three companies to choose from when picking its rocket rides -- and three companies bidding against each other to help keep prices down. Allowing ULA to merge into Blue Origin would derail that plan, at the very moment it might begin paying off for the government.', ""I don't know about you, but if I were a government regulator right now, I'd be thinking that's a very good argument -- albeit a self-interested one -- for forbidding a merger between Blue Origin and ULA to proceed. If Boeing and Lockheed really feel compelled to sell their joint venture, I'd be inclined to agree to a sale to Textron, certainly, to Northop, probably, or to almost any other would-be buyer, possibly."", ""The one option I wouldn't want to see under any circumstances, though, is a purchase of ULA by Blue Origin."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

To skip our detailed analysis of the real estate sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Real Estate and Realty Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.', 'The real estate sector has been battling with elevated mortgage rates this year, resulting in the US housing market suffering from a lack of demand among the population. However, some may expect the struggles of the real estate sector to abate as the year progresses, especially as many financial professionals begin to analyze the state of US real estate markets. Several spaces within the real estate sector are under-invested in, leaving the arena free and open for investors looking to make a real estate play.', 'On February 29, Carly Trip, the Head of Investments at Nuveen Real Estate, joined CNBC\'s ""Closing Bell Overtime"" to discuss the state of the US real estate markets. Here\'s what she had to say:', '""On the residential market, it\'s kind of like no new news, however what\'s interesting is that the consumer is really starting to explain their tolerance for mortgage rates. In December we saw really strong numbers, mortgage rates had come in about 50 basis points, bouncing around six and a half. As they have suddenly come up since then and hover above 7%, consumers do not like that. And so we\'re seeing the results of that in pending home sales. So we expect that that is not gonna improve, inventory will remain low until rates come around 6%, in which case your cost to own versus cost to rent margin really starts to shrink.""', ""Despite the above observations, Tripp noted that other areas in the real estate markets are doing better. Here's what she said:"", '""Retail\'s doing amazingly well. So retail has been the underdog of the last decade. And what we\'re seeing in our centres is increased activity, a lot of demand, increased sales. The consumer is obviously very resilient and strong. That is accomodating to retail spending, 80% of retail sales do involve a physical store which is a positive for our centres. And not only that, there\'s no new supply added to retail. Over the last five years, about a 130 million square feet of retail has been converted to other uses, so it\'s really been under-invested in. So the outlook for retail is very, very strong.""', 'Similarly, for the industrial real estate side, Tripp had positive insights to share. Here are some of the comments she made:', '""Industrial\'s been incredible. It has performed exactly as real estate should perform. Income has outpaced inflation, right, real estate is expected to be an inflation hedge, that\'s why it\'s such a great diversifier to a portfolio. And so we continue to see incredibly strong demand for industrial. Supply has slowed, that was the concern pre-pandemic. However, due to lack of construction spending, lack of financing just generally speaking, bottlenecks in the construction system, we expect that demand is just gonna continue to flow. E-commerce spending is not going anywhere.', 'Considering these highlights, while the residential side of real estate seems to be still struggling in 2024, that does not mean all real estate should be avoided this year. Several other areas within the sector remain ripe for investment.

But is it the best way to invest, or is a less well-known aerospace supplier like Carpenter Technology\xa0(NYSE: CRS) a better option? I think the answer is the latter. Here's why."", ""Boeing's medium-term plans, as laid out in its investor day presentation in November 2022, involved raising its delivery rate in the 737 aircraft to between 400 and 450 in 2023 and then to a rate of 50 a month (600 a year) in 2025 and 2026. These metrics are critical to the company's aim of hitting $10 billion in free cash flow in that period -- a figure investors use to value the company."", 'Unfortunately, Boeing is falling behind that schedule with only 389 deliveries of 737 airplanes in 2023, as it suffered manufacturing quality issues, not least from fuselages supplied by Spirit AeroSystems. Moreover, there are question marks around its delivery rate in 2024 in the aftermath of the blowout of a fuselage panel on an Alaska Air flight in early January.', ""Boeing's management recently told investors it was moving toward a delivery rate of 38 a month in the second half. However, the company said regulators will dictate the pace. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is currently auditing Boeing 737-9 MAX production lines."", ""A figure of 38 a month is fine and worthy, but it implies an annualized rate of 456 a year (which Boeing was supposed to be close to in 2023). It's also some way off from the 50-a-month target for 2025 and 2026."", 'As such, it was no surprise that CFO Brian West said during the company\'s earnings call with analysts in late January that ""it may take longer in that window than originally anticipated"" to hit its free-cash-flow (FCF) target.', ""The uncertainty around Boeing's commercial production rate is one issue, and there's also the issue that its defense arm, Boeing Defense, Space & Security (BDS) lost money in 2023 as it continues to suffer supply chain issues and work through fixed-price contracts won in less inflationary periods."", ""The pressure on Boeing's production rate led at least one analyst, Morgan Stanley's Kristine Liwag, to downgrade a supplier of advanced composite materials, Hexcel, to a sell rating recently."", 'If you are looking for a different way to invest in the sector, you could consider Carpenter Technology, a manufacturer of premium specialty alloys that generates around half of its revenue from aerospace and defense, supplying the market with engine parts (rings, discs, bearings, etc.), fasteners (for airframes and engines), and structural and avionics (landing gear parts and auxiliary power unit parts).', 'The critical difference between the investment propositions at Boeing and Carpenter is that original equipment manufacturer (OEM) Boeing is obligated to increase production and is supporting key supplier Spirit AeroSystems to enable it to keep up with planned 737 production rates.', 'Carpenter\'s parts are also sold in the maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO) market. As Carpenter CEO Tony Thene noted on the company\'s earnings call in late January: ""If you would see any type of movement on the OEM side, that MRO demand would go up even further. And certainly, Carpenter Technology"" is ""delivering that demand, whether it be OEM or MRO.""', ""Carpenter's fiscal year finishes at the end of June, and Wall Street analysts have the stock trading at 16.5 times 2024 earnings and dropping to just 13.5 times earnings at the end of June 2025.

To skip our detailed analysis of the real estate sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Real Estate and Realty Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.', 'The real estate sector has been battling with elevated mortgage rates this year, resulting in the US housing market suffering from a lack of demand among the population. However, some may expect the struggles of the real estate sector to abate as the year progresses, especially as many financial professionals begin to analyze the state of US real estate markets. Several spaces within the real estate sector are under-invested in, leaving the arena free and open for investors looking to make a real estate play.', 'On February 29, Carly Trip, the Head of Investments at Nuveen Real Estate, joined CNBC\'s ""Closing Bell Overtime"" to discuss the state of the US real estate markets. Here\'s what she had to say:', '""On the residential market, it\'s kind of like no new news, however what\'s interesting is that the consumer is really starting to explain their tolerance for mortgage rates. In December we saw really strong numbers, mortgage rates had come in about 50 basis points, bouncing around six and a half. As they have suddenly come up since then and hover above 7%, consumers do not like that. And so we\'re seeing the results of that in pending home sales. So we expect that that is not gonna improve, inventory will remain low until rates come around 6%, in which case your cost to own versus cost to rent margin really starts to shrink.""', ""Despite the above observations, Tripp noted that other areas in the real estate markets are doing better. Here's what she said:"", '""Retail\'s doing amazingly well. So retail has been the underdog of the last decade. And what we\'re seeing in our centres is increased activity, a lot of demand, increased sales. The consumer is obviously very resilient and strong. That is accomodating to retail spending, 80% of retail sales do involve a physical store which is a positive for our centres. And not only that, there\'s no new supply added to retail. Over the last five years, about a 130 million square feet of retail has been converted to other uses, so it\'s really been under-invested in. So the outlook for retail is very, very strong.""', 'Similarly, for the industrial real estate side, Tripp had positive insights to share. Here are some of the comments she made:', '""Industrial\'s been incredible. It has performed exactly as real estate should perform. Income has outpaced inflation, right, real estate is expected to be an inflation hedge, that\'s why it\'s such a great diversifier to a portfolio. And so we continue to see incredibly strong demand for industrial. Supply has slowed, that was the concern pre-pandemic. However, due to lack of construction spending, lack of financing just generally speaking, bottlenecks in the construction system, we expect that demand is just gonna continue to flow. E-commerce spending is not going anywhere.', 'Considering these highlights, while the residential side of real estate seems to be still struggling in 2024, that does not mean all real estate should be avoided this year.

When the tech sector gets hot, it grows very quickly producing rapid returns. 2023 was a prime example of that broad truth. Investors will continue to buy tech stocks primarily for that exposure.', 'Yet, text stocks also provide the stability of dividend income in some cases. Most tech firms direct cash toward growth prospects primarily. More established firms also choose to direct the sum of their cash back to investors in the form of dividends and share buybacks.', 'Those are the firms we will be discussing below. These firms tend to pay lower yields but there are also cases in which yields exceed 3% or more. Let’s take a look at these tech firms and their dividends.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com', 'Investors who do their homework on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock will discover that it actually pays a dividend. In fact, the company instituted its dividend program all the way back in 2013. Nvidia has never reduced its dividend payment during that time.', 'While its yield is very low at 0.02%, it is clearly very reliable overall. To be clear, Nvidia is not highly focused on its dividend program as an enticement to investors: the dividend has only grown by 2% on average over the past five years.', 'In any case, investors are interested in Nvidia for its growth prospects. The small dividend is something of a novelty but provides a slight amount of income nonetheless. Investors will buy NVDA shares at the moment primarily because it continues to shine. Its fourth quarter earnings beat was yet another strong signal from the world’s leading chip maker. Buy Nvidia because it has the potential to move as high as $1,300 but also consider that dividend which will continue to grow over time.', 'Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com', 'Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) Is one of the better known tech dividend stocks. The internet networking firm pays a dividend yielding more than 3% and which has not been reduced for more than a dozen years.', 'That dividend looks to add an additional $1.60 to each share of CSCO stock in 2024. Consider that in light of the fact that analysts believe share prices could rise above $76 this year. That would put the total return at $78. Cisco Systems shares currently trade for approximately $49. There is legitimate potential for investors and that dividend yield is critical.', 'Even if those share prices don’t rise that high, the consensus is that they will rise above $57. In that case, the $1.60 in dividends becomes even more attractive.', 'One of the primary reasons Wall Street is bullish on Cisco Systems is the simple fact that IP protocol demand should continue to rise in light of the continued emergence of AI. By the shares for their exposure to that potential growth and rest easy knowing that they provide income.', 'Source: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com', 'There is no doubt that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock is a high upside investment. Despite its meteoric growth over the past year there is likely more ahead. In fact, analysts believe it could rise as high as $600 this year. That would represent roughly 50% growth above its current price.', 'That potential is pushed marginally higher by Microsoft’s dividend which yields 0.75%. Microsoft pays $3 in annual dividends. In total, MSFT shares could rise as high as $603. The other thing to note is that Microsoft’s dividend is rock solid. The company has never reduced the dividend for the entirety of its existence. That’s probably not much of a surprise to readers: Microsoft is a cash rich firm that instituted the dividend as a bonus in reality. The likelihood that Microsoft reduces the payout is effectively zero.', 'The argument in favor of investing in Microsoft as a dividend stock is largely the same as that for the other tech giants with dividends: buy them for the growth potential and consider the dividend as a nice to have novelty.', 'Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com', 'Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) provides semiconductor products to firms around the world. Its stock is highly regarded and widely expected to grow from its current price of $103. The consensus opinion is that those shares will rise in value to $115 and potentially move as high as $140.', 'The company’s dividend adds an additional $2.72 to its potential returns.\xa0Should Skyworks Solutions shares reach the consensus price of $115, that equates to a difference between 11.65% returns and 14.3%. Investors can easily understand the value of a higher yield dividend such as that which Skyworks Solutions provides. The 2.63% yield may not sound particularly impressive but the figures show that it\xa0makes a large difference overall.', 'The company last reduced that dividend in 2014. However, the semi-annual dividend has been in existence since 1980. Higher yield dividends require more cash and are thus more likely to be reduced in leaner times. That doesn’t seem to be the case at the moment and Skyworks Solutions continues to be an excellent choice among tech dividend stocks.', 'Source: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com', 'Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) Is another of the leading tech firms that also pays a dividend. In fact, among the best known Silicon Valley firms, only Google (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) lacks a dividend entirely.', 'Until recently, Meta Platforms was similar to Google and did not pay any dividend. That changed on February 1st when the company reported 4th quarter earnings and initiated its first ever dividend of 50 cents.', 'The decision coincided with the company’s 20th anniversary. It also followed after the company beat 4th quarter expectations on Wall Street. Advertising revenues have rebounded as the unexpectedly strong economy continues to hum along.', 'While the move was welcomed by Wall Street, it is also curious given the fact that META needs all the cash it can get at the moment. The company is trying to satisfy the dual beasts of AI growth and its continued losses in its metaverse segment. Again, it is welcome none-the-less and makes META shares\xa0currently among dividend paying tech firms worth investing in.', 'Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com', 'Would you believe that AAPL (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been paying a dividend since 1987? It has, but there was a long pause during that period in which it paid no dividends at all. The company paused its dividend payment\xa0between late 1995 and the summer of 2012. That was the last time that the company reduced its dividend payment which currently yields 0.5%.', 'The decision heralded the beginning of a new era as Apple transitioned from the leadership of Steve Jobs into that of Tim Cook. The rationale for the reintroduction of the dividend was that it would attract liquidity in the form of institutional investment thus increasing share prices. The history of Apple’s share growth over the past decade makes it difficult to argue against the decision. AAPL shares have returned more than 27% on average annually over the past decade. That was enough to 11x an investment made at the beginning of that period.', 'Source: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com', 'Last but certainly not least on this list of dividend tech stocks is Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). The company provides investors with $3.20 annually in dividends per share owned. That equates to a yield of more than 2% which is relatively high in the tech world. The general thinking is that that cash would be better served pursuing growth prospects and thus yields of say 5%, for example, are exceedingly rare.', 'It’s fair to characterize Qualcomm’s dividend as being stable and relatively quickly growing. It was last reduced in 2003 and has grown at an annual rate of 5.3% over the last five years.', 'While those points of attraction are logical reasons to buy Qualcomm, there are others to consider. Qualcomm is well diversified and exposed to current growth trends. It is one of the better positioned tech firms in relation to the confluence of AI and phones. The company has released updated AI features on its flagship phones. Investors remain very curious to see how the application of advanced AI to phones will drive revenues.\xa0 Smartphone revenues have been extraordinarily high as the world remains glued to their handsets.

And this situation might mean that it's best to look elsewhere to gain exposure to the apparel industry. In fact, a smart idea now would be to consider Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ: LULU). Here's why."", ""It's hard to deny Nike's impressive long-term track record of increasing revenue and earnings. The business has one of the most powerful and widely recognized brands on the face of the planet. And this has kept it relevant, even though the fashion industry is characterized by changing tastes and preferences."", 'But more recently, macroeconomic headwinds are hurting Nike. The company reported 1% revenue growth in the latest fiscal quarter (Q2 2024 ended Nov. 30), with management forecasting a 1% gain for the full fiscal year. This marks a major slowdown from what shareholders are probably used to.', ""In what is supposed to be its fastest-growing region, Greater China, the situation isn't favorable.

Even more alarming, that figure was in line with the total in the same period four years ago."", '""We are seeing indications of more cautious consumer behavior around the world in an uneven macro environment,"" Nike CFO Matt Friend said on the Q2 2024 earnings call.', ""Looking at Nike's latest challenges makes Lululemon's performance all the more impressive. The Canada-based enterprise started as a yoga apparel maker targeting women, but it has now become a full activewear and lifestyle company for everyone."", ""Lululemon hasn't been fazed at all by the headwinds in the past few years that derailed Nike. The coronavirus pandemic, supply chain issues, inflationary pressures, higher interest rates, and economic uncertainty are what all businesses dealt with in recent times.

This is exemplified by its excellent profitability, with a Q3 2023 gross margin of 57% and operating margin of 15.3%. Both figures are better than Nike's margins."", ""As we look ahead, Lululemon has incredible growth prospects. Management's goal is to achieve revenue of $12.5 billion in fiscal 2026, double 2021's total. It looks like they are ahead of schedule. Key factors of this goal are to double men's, double digital, and quadruple international sales. This shouldn't be a problem."", ""That's because men's sales were up 15% in the latest quarter.

Corporation (NYSE:VFC) is about to go ex-dividend in just four days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Accordingly, V.F investors that purchase the stock on or after the 8th of March will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 20th of March."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.09 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$0.36 per share. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, V.F has a trailing yield of approximately 2.2% on its current stock price of US$16.24. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether V.F's dividend is reliable and sustainable. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing."", ' View our latest analysis for V.F ', ""Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. V.F reported a loss after tax last year, which means it's paying a dividend despite being unprofitable. While this might be a one-off event, this is unlikely to be sustainable in the long term. Considering the lack of profitability, we also need to check if the company generated enough cash flow to cover the dividend payment. If cash earnings don't cover the dividend, the company would have to pay dividends out of cash in the bank, or by borrowing money, neither of which is long-term sustainable. Fortunately, it paid out only 36% of its free cash flow in the past year."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", 'When earnings decline, dividend companies become much harder to analyse and own safely. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. V.F was unprofitable last year and, unfortunately, the general trend suggests its earnings have been in decline over the last five years, making us wonder if the dividend is sustainable at all.', ""Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. V.F's dividend payments per share have declined at 8.4% per year on average over the past 10 years, which is uninspiring. It's never nice to see earnings and dividends falling, but at least management has cut the dividend rather than potentially risk the company's health in an attempt to maintain it."", ""Get our latest analysis on V.F's balance sheet health here."", ""From a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid V.F? We're a bit uncomfortable with it paying a dividend while being loss-making. However, we note that the dividend was covered by cash flow. Overall it doesn't look like the most suitable dividend stock for a long-term buy and hold investor."", ""Having said that, if you're looking at this stock without much concern for the dividend, you should still be familiar of the risks involved with V.F. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for V.F you should know about."", ""Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

Even though Scharf has ticked off six consent orders that regulators had in place when he became boss, Scharf still has eight to go — including two added during his tenure.', 'The big one is a cap on the size of Wells Fargo imposed by the Federal Reserve. It can’t go past the $1.95 trillion in assets it had at the end of 2017 unless regulators say so. The Fed imposed the broad restriction in 2018, citing ""widespread consumer abuses"" at Wells Fargo.', 'Lifting that cap would allow Wells Fargo to boost activity in its capital-intensive markets business, CFO Mike Santomassimo said last Monday at a UBS conference in Florida.', '""I would just caution that when it does happen, it’s not this kind of light switch moment,"" Santomassimo said, but ""we do believe that there\'ll be some opportunity there.""

""To reach the company\'s full potential, they will certainly need more freedom over some period of time,"" he added.', 'The timing for when the Fed removes Wells Fargo\'s balance sheet limit remains ""hard to predict,"" according to Jefferies bank analyst Ken Usdin.', ""Even after this asset cap is removed, a second third-party review is required to assess the bank's improvements."", 'The irony of Wells Fargo’s regulatory predicament is that there was a time not that long ago when it faced fewer constraints than its peers.', 'It was able to dodge many of the problems that hobbled other big banks during the 2008 financial crisis and became a coast-to-coast giant with its purchase that year of Wachovia, a big Charlotte lender weakened by a national mortgage meltdown.', 'The bank emerged from the crisis with a reputation for being conservative, not taking a lot of risks, and relying on a plain-vanilla, old-fashioned strategy of boosting revenue by cross-selling various products to existing customers.', 'But that strength turned into a weakness after it became clear in the second half of last decade that the bank had opened millions of bank and credit card accounts without customers’ knowledge as employees raced to meet their sales goals.', 'CEO John Stumpf, who had been with the bank for three decades, resigned and was later barred by regulators from the banking industry.', 'His successor Tim Sloan left in 2019.

And it has admittedly been a loser for investors in recent years. Since late 2021, shares of the big drugmaker have plunged close to 56%."", ""Why has Pfizer stock fizzled? Blame it on COVID. To be more specific, blame it on declining demand for the company's COVID products."", ""Just a few years ago, Pfizer was flying high. Its Comirnaty coronavirus vaccine was making money hand over fist. So was the company's oral COVID medicine Paxlovid."", ""Times have changed. The pandemic is over. The U.S. government isn't directly buying coronavirus vaccines and antiviral therapies anymore. Many people don't have a sense of urgency in being vaccinated."", ""Pfizer's fourth-quarter results tell the company's sad tale. Sales for Comirnaty fell 54% year over year. Paxlovid's revenue was a negative $3.1 billion due to a reversal related to U.S. government inventory returns. These declines caused Pfizer's overall revenue to sink 42%."", ""There's even more bad news for Pfizer. The company faces patent expirations for top-selling drugs including Eliquis, Ibrance, and Vyndaqel over the next few years. It expects loss of patent exclusivity to whack around $17 billion from its annual revenue by 2030."", ""So why does buying Pfizer stock right now make any sense? I'll give you four great reasons."", ""First, the launches of new products and new indications for existing products should generate roughly $20 billion in additional annual revenue by 2030 -- excluding COVID products altogether. That's more than enough to offset the impact of Pfizer's looming patent cliff. Importantly, this revenue total is for products that the company has either already launched or will launch in the first half of 2024. We're not talking about a pie-in-the-sky number."", 'Second, Pfizer expects to add another $25 billion in annual revenue by 2030 from business development deals. Again, this seems to be a realistic estimate based on the acquisitions the company has already made (notably including Seagen).', ""Third, the market seems to be valuing Pfizer as if it doesn't have any growth drivers. Shares currently trade at a forward earnings multiple of less than 12. By my calculations, Pfizer is cheaper than nearly all of its big pharma peers even if we assume it won't make a penny from its coronavirus products. (It will.)"", ""Fourth, Pfizer pays investors handsomely to wait until the market regains its senses about the stock. The company's dividend yield tops 6.3%. It doesn't have to deliver much share price appreciation to achieve double-digit total returns."", ""Hopefully, I've made a compelling case for buying Pfizer. But is it really a stock to hold forever?"", 'Pfizer has been in business since 1849. The company has successfully navigated depressions, recessions, political crises, wars, and major changes in the biopharmaceutical industry. Most importantly, in my view, it has demonstrated that it can continue to innovate and make deals that drive growth.', ""As we've already seen, the big drugmaker also offers a dividend that many income investors would drool over.

Thanks to thousands of publicly traded companies and exchange-traded funds, there's a strategy that can fit any investment style and risk tolerance. But when push comes to shove, buying and holding dividend stocks is an investment plan that's tough to beat."", 'Last year, Hartford Funds issued a report {""The Power of Dividends: Past, Present, and Future"") that examined the outperformance and volatility-reducing tendencies of dividend stocks. In particular, a collaboration with Ned Davis Research revealed that companies paying dividends averaged an annual return of 9.18% over a half century (1973-2022). This compared to a considerably more modest average annual return of 3.95% for the public companies that didn\'t offer a payout over the same period.', 'What can make dividend investing challenging is the desire to maximize yield while also minimizing risk. Statistically speaking, the higher the yield, usually the more inherent risk. Thankfully, proper vetting can unveil some true gems with ultra-high yields -- i.e., yields that are four or more times greater than the benchmark S&P 500.', 'What follows are three magnificent ultra-high-yield dividend stocks -- sporting an average yield of 8.84% -- that are screaming buys in March.', ""The first sensational dividend stock with a high-octane yield that's worth scooping up in March is pharmaceutical juggernaut Pfizer (NYSE: PFE). Due to the poor performance of its stock in recent quarters, the company's yield has surged to 6.3%."", ""The weakness in Pfizer's stock can be traced to two issues. First, the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic is now over. Pfizer developed a vaccine (Comirnaty) and oral treatment (Paxlovid) for COVID-19, which resulted in more than $56 billion in combined sales in 2022. In 2024, the company is forecasting closer to $8 billion in combined revenue for both drugs. That's a wild ride in the span of a couple of years."", 'The other reason for investor skepticism is that its recent acquisition of cancer-drug developer Seagen will result in a roughly $0.40-per-share hit to its earnings this year.', 'On the other hand, the costs associated with buying Seagen are strictly confined to the current year. Looking beyond 2024, the combined company will enjoy cost savings and a considerably more robust oncology pipeline. The long-term benefits of this combination handily outweigh any very-near-term acquisition-related expenses.', ""As for Pfizer's wild revenue ride caused by its COVID-19 therapies, investors should note that sans COVID-19 products, Pfizer's sales have continued to climb and are expected to move higher, once more, in 2024. In particular, double-digit currency-neutral sales growth from its specialty care segment has been carrying the torch as COVID-19 drug sales normalize."", ""Something else working in Pfizer's favor is the fact that healthcare is an exceptionally defensive sector. Regardless of whether the U.S. economy is growing or contracting, patients will always need healthcare services and prescription medicines. Pfizer's operating cash flow is transparent and highly predictable, which is why its dividend is rock-solid."", 'Shares of Pfizer can currently be scooped up for less than 10 times forward-year earnings, which represents a 12% discount to its average forward-year earnings multiple over the trailing-five-year period.', ""A second ultra-high-yield dividend stock that stands out as a contrarian screaming buy in March is mortgage real estate investment trust (REIT) Annaly Capital Management (NYSE: NLY). Annaly has declared $25 billion worth of dividend payments since its initial public offering in October 1997, and it's averaged around a 10% yield over the past two decades. Its current yield of 13.6% isn't out of the norm."", ""The problem for the mortgage REIT industry is that it's highly interest sensitive. The Federal Reserve raising interest rates at the fastest clip in more than four decades left little time for Annaly and its peers to adjust their portfolios. Short-term borrowing costs quickly rose, which crimped the company's net interest margin."", ""Though there's arguably not an industry that's more universally disliked by Wall Street than mortgage REITs, there does appear to be a light at the end of the tunnel for Annaly Capital Management and its peers."", ""Although the industry performs its best when interest rates are low or declining, the simple fact that the nation's central bank has paused its rate-hiking cycle is giving Annaly time to adjust its holdings. Slow-stepped, methodical changes by the Fed can allow Annaly to maximize its profitability."", ""Additionally, the Fed's quantitative tightening measures also mean it's no longer purchasing mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Not having the nation's central bank scooping up lucrative MBSs should help Annaly snag higher-yielding MBS that raise the average yield of its asset portfolio over time."", 'Another important point that shouldn\'t be overlooked is the composition of Annaly Capital Management\'s investment portfolio. As of the end of 2023, $65.7 billion of its $74.3 billion portfolio was put to work in highly liquid agency assets. An ""agency"" asset is backed by the federal government in the unlikely event of default. This added protection is what allows Annaly the luxury of using leverage to its advantage.', ""With Annaly trading slightly below its book value, and the nation's central bank slow-stepping its next move, now is the perfect time to buy into this supercharged dividend stock."", ""The third magnificent ultra-high-yield stock that's begging to be bought in March is none other than telecom stalwart AT&T (NYSE: T)."", 'In addition to its short-lived wireless network outage last week, AT&T has been contending with two significant headwinds. Firstly, higher interest rates could make future refinancing and dealmaking costlier for the company. The other is the July 2023 report from The Wall Street Journal that alleged legacy telecom companies using lead-clad cables could face sizable environmental and health-related liabilities.', ""However, AT&T directly refuted the WSJ's findings. It's found no evidence of environmental or health hazards with its lead-sheathed cables. Further, if the company eventually does have some sort of financial liability, it would be determined by the U.S. court system. We're talking about something that would be many years down the road, if ever."", ""Current and prospective investors shouldn't concern themselves with rapidly rising interest rates, either. Since AT&T spun off its content arm WarnerMedia in April 2022, its net debt has declined from $169 billion to $128.9 billion.

Here is why putting $1,000 into one (or both) of these companies would be a great move."", ""Intuitive Surgical is a highly innovative medical device company best known for its da Vinci System, a robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) device. These machines allow physicians to perform minimally invasive surgeries that rely on small incisions and tiny instruments that can be manipulated with precision. These types of procedures have advantages over open surgeries, where doctors make large enough cuts to patients' skin to have a full view of the internal organs involved in the procedures."", ""Minimally invasive surgeries result in less scarring, faster recoveries, and shorter hospital stays.

However, neither obstacle should matter much over the long run."", 'The pandemic was an exceedingly rare event, and, at any rate, Intuitive Surgical has bounced back. All the outbreak did was create a backlog of elective surgeries waiting to be performed. ""Elective"" here doesn\'t mean ""optional."" It simply means ""can be scheduled in advance."" A mastectomy to treat breast cancer counts as an elective surgery. That\'s why pandemic-related troubles won\'t haunt Intuitive Surgical forever.', ""And while the increased popularity of GLP-1 medicines like Ozempic is having an impact, Intuitive Surgical estimates that weight-loss surgeries make up between 4% and 5% of total procedures worldwide. Given the massive whitespace remaining in the RAS market, that won't matter too much over the next 10 years and beyond.

DexCom's G6, one of its top products, can make measurements as often as every five minutes. By contrast, blood glucose meters are manually operated, use painful fingersticks, and only tell patients' blood glucose levels at a specific time."", ""It's no wonder that CGM devices have gained significant traction in recent years. They are the more convenient option and also lead to better health outcomes for diabetes patients. As one of the two leaders in the CGM space, DexCom's revenue and earnings have grown rapidly. Last year, the company's top line of $3.62 billion increased by 24% year over year. The adjusted EPS of $1.52 was up 74.7% compared to the previous fiscal year."", 'DexCom is also supposed to be struggling due to increased reliance on weight-loss medicines popular among diabetes patients. Their success will decrease the need for CGM devices, or so the argument goes. However, that argument is almost certainly off the mark.

These are complementary products that help diabetes patients live their healthiest lives.', ""DexCom's future is safe, especially considering that more than half a billion adults worldwide now have diabetes, just 1% of whom use CGM. A substantial percentage of this population is beyond DexCom's reach right now since they are located in developing countries. However, the company has long sought to expand its footprint. Last year, DexCom finally entered the Latin American market through Argentina."", ""At any rate, there is plenty of growth left even within DexCom's existing addressable market, including in the U.S., one of the more penetrated CGM regions.

Undoubtedly, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) pulled off yet another impressive quarter, helping lift the broader basket of AI chip stocks and most of the technology sector.', 'While I remain upbeat over Nvidia and CEO Jensen Huang’s ability to feed the incredible (and growing) demand for AI chips and software over the next few years, it’s not hard to imagine many investors feeling a tad uncomfortable with buying after sudden spikes in share price.', 'You’re not alone in shying away from the market’s high flyers, even if recent rallies were backed by robust growth and vast improvement in the underlying fundamentals. The good news is other breakout stocks are only starting to lift off the tarmac, with not nearly as much heat as the likes of Nvidia stock or some of the other semiconductor plays. Let’s look at three breakout stocks that value-conscious investors may be more comfortable pursuing in today’s red-hot market.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Costco (NASDAQ:COST) is a wholesale retailer that’s also seen its shares get hot since they broke through to new all-time highs towards the end of 2023. The new year has continued to be incredibly kind to Costco stock, with almost 13% in gains posted year-to-date. Undoubtedly, inflation-rattled, cost-conscious consumers cannot get enough of Costco’s top-notch value proposition, even if it means paying $60.00 for an annual membership (or $120.00 for that executive membership) and buying goods by the tens of pounds to get the best deals.', 'As inflation dies down (hopefully soon), loyal members may just be able to have some more disposable income to take the splurge factor up a notch at their local Costco. Given management’s knack for knowing just what its consumers want (they sure knew their customers had an appetite for gold last year!) and the promise of incredible deals, my guess is that a healthier consumer won’t think twice when they reach for more non-essential, non-grocery items scattered through Costco’s warehouse floors.', 'If you’re getting that promise of a great deal and need to spend money to justify your membership, why not go for the laptop alongside your bulk-buying spree of Kirkland Signature-branded pantry items? All considered, Costco stock looks like a breakout stock poised to keep winning well into the post-high inflation age.', 'Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com', 'Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) is another hot cutting-edge (forgive the pun) medical device tech stock that’s finally breaking out, with shares smashing through all-time highs on the back of an impressive 17% year-to-date gain. As others look to play chip stocks as a way to ride the AI wave, the field of robot-assisted surgery may be a somewhat less scorching way to ride an even larger wave, seeing as ISRG stock’s breakout just began a few weeks ago.', 'Just because shares have just broken past their prior 2021 highs doesn’t mean shares are cheap, though.

The da Vinci surgical robot in itself is a profound innovation with so much promise in the AI age.', 'With recent commentary about a new surgical robot, which may be looming, Intuitive Surgical may have a huge catalyst to move toward some of the Street-high price targets on Wall Street.', 'Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) stock’s recent breakout has been quite swift, with shares surging 21% year-to-date and 90% over the past year. As a company that provides essential wafer-fabrication equipment to the semiconductor industry, Lam stands to gain from the surging demand for a wide range of chip products.', 'If we are in the early stages of an AI boom, it’s the big-ticket machinery companies standing behind the chipmakers and designers that may have what it takes to lead the industry’s next upward charge.', 'Lam Research recently reported terrific fiscal second-quarter numbers alongside good guidance.

The COVID-19 contagion forced this industry to shut down for over a year, leaving it without a significant revenue source during that time and causing an extended period of lower revenue as it relaunched.', 'Today, bookings are at an all-time high for the top two cruise line companies, Carnival (NYSE: CCL) and Royal Caribbean Cruises (NYSE: RCL). However, that factor may leave investors wondering which cruise line stock has the potential for higher returns.', 'Carnival is the largest cruise line. According to Cruise Market Watch, it claims around 43% of all passenger bookings in the industry. Along with the Carnival brand, it also owns lines such as Princess, Holland America, and Cunard.', 'Fortunately for Carnival, fears about contagion have not dampened the appetite for cruises. The company entered 2024 in its best position ever with regard to bookings. Also, despite strong pricing, it has booked nearly two-thirds of all occupancy for 2024. So strong is demand that it plans to add to capacity by 5% in 2024.', 'Moreover, total debt has fallen to just over $31 billion versus nearly $36 billion at the end of 2022. During the year, it paid down $4.6 billion in debt, paying off all the debt maturing in 2023, while still holding $5.4 billion in liquidity.', 'Although Carnival lost $74 million in 2023, it generated about $2.1 billion in adjusted free cash flow. This has positioned Carnival to reduce its massive debt and add capacity as needed.', ""Still, many investors may have not yet caught on to its recovery. Carnival stock sells at a forward P/E ratio of just 16 times earnings, and that comes after a 50% gain in the stock price over the last year. Given that low valuation, more investors could buy into Carnival's sudden turn into smooth waters."", 'Still, before seeking permission to board Carnival, investors may also want to bask in the trade winds pushing Royal Caribbean forward. Royal Caribbean, along with the lines it owns, Celebrity and Silversea, now claim about 26% of the passenger counts in the market.', 'Amid an industry recovery, Royal Caribbean benefited from record bookings in 2023 and experienced its five best weeks for bookings in company history after its October earnings call. Due to this high demand, Royal Caribbean plans to increase capacity by 8.5% in 2024.', ""Additionally, Royal Caribbean's total debt fell to $22 billion versus $24 billion in 2022. Furthermore, around 80% of its debt is fixed-rate obligations. Given improved bookings, the company will likely pay off the $1.7 billion in debt coming due in 2024 without having to refinance at higher rates."", 'Moreover, the company returned to profitability in 2024, reporting $1.7 billion in net income versus a $2.2 billion loss the year before. Free cash flow was not as strong, coming in at $580 million. But with $3.1 billion in liquidity, the company is well-positioned to stay afloat in case of trouble.', 'So far, investors may have missed this recovery story. Currently, the stock trades at around 12 times forward earnings despite rising by over 75% over the last year. Such a valuation suggests Royal Caribbean stock may not be finished rising as it sails onward.', 'Although both stocks should experience market-beating gains for the foreseeable future, Royal Caribbean seems to have more growth potential. Indeed, it is a smaller cruise company and does not generate as much free cash flow.', 'However, unlike Carnival, it turned profitable last year. Also, it plans to add more capacity, indicating it is more likely to make market share gains over the next year. Additionally, that factor and the 75% gain in Royal Caribbean stock still left it with a lower forward P/E ratio.

When he was CFO of JPMorgan during the ""London Whale"" trading debacle, he had to testify before Senate lawmakers in 2013. At Wells Fargo, Braunstein will report directly to the CEO as vice chairman.', '""Doug is a world-class banker,"" Scharf said in a press release, noting that his ""expertise and business relationships reflect our continued commitment to strengthen"" Wells Fargo\'s Wall Street unit.', 'The CEO of the nation’s fourth-largest bank is not out of the woods with regulators, however. Even though Scharf has ticked off six consent orders that regulators had in place when he became boss, Scharf still has eight to go — including two added during his tenure.', 'The big one is a cap on the size of Wells Fargo imposed by the Federal Reserve. It can’t go past the $1.95 trillion in assets it had at the end of 2017 unless regulators say so. The Fed imposed the broad restriction in 2018, citing ""widespread consumer abuses"" at Wells Fargo.', 'Lifting that cap would allow Wells Fargo to boost activity in its capital-intensive markets business, CFO Mike Santomassimo said last Monday at a UBS conference in Florida.', '""I would just caution that when it does happen, it’s not this kind of light switch moment,"" Santomassimo said, but ""we do believe that there\'ll be some opportunity there."" At the moment, ""our focus is really to solve the risk and regulatory work first. ... We can\'t lose sight of that.""', 'Several analysts who follow the bank said Wells Fargo is taking steps in the right direction, and they do expect the Fed to eventually take the bank out of the penalty box.', '""They’ve done a tremendous amount under these highly idiosyncratic restrictions,"" said Scott Siefers, an analyst for Piper Sandler who has covered the bank over nearly two decades. ""To reach the company\'s full potential, they will certainly need more freedom over some period of time,"" he added.', 'The timing for when the Fed removes Wells Fargo\'s balance sheet limit remains ""hard to predict,"" according to Jefferies bank analyst Ken Usdin.', ""Even after this asset cap is removed, a second third-party review is required to assess the bank's improvements."", 'The irony of Wells Fargo’s regulatory predicament is that there was a time not that long ago when it faced fewer constraints than its peers.', 'It was able to dodge many of the problems that hobbled other big banks during the 2008 financial crisis and became a coast-to-coast giant with its purchase that year of Wachovia, a big Charlotte lender weakened by a national mortgage meltdown.', 'The bank emerged from the crisis with a reputation for being conservative, not taking a lot of risks, and relying on a plain-vanilla, old-fashioned strategy of boosting revenue by cross-selling various products to existing customers.', 'But that strength turned into a weakness after it became clear in the second half of last decade that the bank had opened millions of bank and credit card accounts without customers’ knowledge as employees raced to meet their sales goals.', 'CEO John Stumpf, who had been with the bank for three decades, resigned and was later barred by regulators from the banking industry.', 'His successor Tim Sloan left in 2019. He is now suing the bank in a California state court for $34 million, claiming the bank canceled stock grants and that Sloan was used as a ""scapegoat"" for the sales practices scandal.', 'The bank has said that it stands by its decisions and that ""compensation decisions are based on performance.""', 'The search for a replacement landed Scharf, who had been in charge of JPMorgan’s consumer bank while working for Dimon and then became the CEO of credit card giant Visa (V) and custody bank Bank of New York Mellon (BK).', 'His own overhaul has not been without surprises, including a $3.7 billion pact in December 2022 with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to resolve allegations that it illegally overcharged customers on their auto loans and mortgages. The actions at issue took place as recently as 2022.', 'Scharf has also significantly reduced the bank’s workforce. Since peaking during the pandemic in 2020 with 276,000 employees, Wells has eliminated roughly 18% of its headcount — or 50,000 employees. The bank’s CFO said this past week that Wells Fargo may also trim more real estate as a cost-cutting move.', 'There was also a new reminder this past week that the sales-practice scandal is still not totally behind the bank.', ""The company was sued in a San Francisco federal court by customers claiming the lender was not doing enough to assist those who were harmed by being signed up for products they didn't want."", 'The bank sent out letters asking for people to contact Wells Fargo if they had been enrolled in such products, but the lawsuit claims the letter burdens the customer to take action.', 'Wells Fargo tries ""to avoid, reduce, and delay its ultimate liability and sweep under the rug its long-standing, intentional misconduct,"" lawyers representing the bank\'s customers stated.', 'The bank said it is still reviewing the legal claims. ""Wells Fargo is a different company today, with new people, structure, processes, controls, and culture in place, and we have placed heavy emphasis on remediating customers for past practices,"" a spokeswoman for the bank added.', 'David Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.', 'Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.', 'Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance']"
97,829952ae-a6ae-3246-a3f9-ddc40a1a7aac,VZ,2024-03-04,Comcast: A Severely Mispriced Stock With Strong Upside,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/comcast-severely-mispriced-stock-strong-130002218.html,1709557202,STORY,"['CMCSA', 'VZ']","['Comcast Corp. (NASDAQ:CMCSA) has severely underperformed the S&P 500 in the last two years, disappointing shareholders. I do own the shares in my portfolio, as I see an attractive upside potential. As a matter of fact, I initiated my position last month. In this analysis, I will discuss the reasons for the severe underperformance and why I still bought it at the start of the year. My investment thesis is that the conglomerate nature of the company is its moat; the multiple revenue streams across a wide range of telecom and media segments make it a stable and growing one, with upside potential at the current price level.', 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with CMCSA.', ""The stock performed in line with the broader stock market from 2014 to 2021, but lost momentum in 2021 and has accumulated over 100% underperformance in three years. The S&P 500's 10-year performance stands at over 160%, while shares of Comcast declined to below 60% performance in 10 years."", 'We will go through the issues and struggles the company has been facing over the last three years, particularly the tough competition (lagging behind in the 5G rollout of the last few years, hitting the main revenue source of the company) and the lack of mergers and acquisitions, reflecting an exhausted management. And yet, I do see arguments in favor of a turnaround after an irrational overreaction by investors. A catch-up on the broader stock market is possible given the attractive valuation and the sustained business growth.', 'Comcast is comprised of two product lines.', ""The first is Connectivity & Platforms, generating two-thirds of the revenue but 80% of the Ebitda, meaning it is the most profitable. It includes three businesses. The first one is Xfinity, which is the largest internet provider in the U.S. Then there is Comcast, which is focused on business technology. ^he last one is Sky, composed of Sky Broadband, an internet provider in the U.K., and Sky Mobile, a fast-growing wireless provider. Connectivity & Platforms is the largest of the two product lines in both revenue and profitability. Indeed, Comcast's residential broadband segment has a wide reach with 32 million subscribers, but the numbers are falling. This is compensated by the company's wireless business, with approximately 6 million lines and a revenue growth of around 16% year over year, representing a growth opportunity through the 5G business. But it also faces tremendous competition from well-established 5G providers such as Verizon (NYSE:VZ)."", ""The second is Content & Experience. This product line comprises the media, studios and theme park segments. The main revenue segments are Peacock, a streaming service that has been growing quickly, NBCUniversal's film and television studios, including the famous Universal Pictures, one of the five major U.S. film production studios and the theme parks with Universal Theme Parks. Overall, Content & Experience represents only one-third of the revenue and one-fifth of the Ebitda, meaning it is less profitable. Content & Experience has, however, the highest growth potential thanks to its edge over competitors, in sharp contrast with the Connectivity & Platforms line that is losing momentum vis-a-vis the competition."", ""Let's take a look at the discounted cash flow calculations that pension funds and investment firms love to use in their analysis process. DCF models are easy to construct. However, if you don't have any at hand, there is a user-friendly model available on GuruFocus. Interestingly, I found the markets are currently pricing the stock as if it were to grow by 3%."", 'As you can see above, the DCF modelling available on GuruFocus based on the current stock price indicates the markets are assuming a modest 3% growth despite the company having grown at an average earnings per share growth rate of 9.40% in the last 10 years. If we remove the fear factor from the equation and stick to the historical earnings per share growth rate of the company of 9.40%, the fair value is approximately 50% above the current stock price, indicating an attractive risk-reward ratio given the fear factor in the equation is an overreaction, as I will explain later.', 'The fair value of the stock is likely to be closer to $60 than the current $40 level.', 'The Jan. 25 earnings announcement for the fourth quarter of 2023 further provides investors with additional comfort and good news. Net income per share stood at 81 cents, a 15.70% increase year over year. The dividend has increased by 6.90% to $1.24 per share and, given the stock sell-off of the last two years, the dividend yield has turned quite attractive at 3%. Comcast did continue to lose broadband subscribers (down 34,000 users, primarily due to cord-cutting) but compensated by adding 310,000 wireless subscribers, showing a shift in consumer preference. Peacock continued to be the fastest-growing U.S. streamer, adding 3 million subscribers as revenue increased 57% to a record of $1.03 billion.', 'The earnings per share acceleration of the last year is expected to continue to outperform in relation to the trendline in the next two years, reconfirming the 2022 stock price slump was fueled by exaggerated fears of competition. This leads to an overly attractive valuation that has yet to be corrected. This further confirms the 50% upside derived from the DCF model is not unreasonable.', 'I initiated a long position last month because Comcast hit a highly attractive valuation point. Indeed, one of the most favored metrics of investors is the price-earnings ratio. As you can see in the below chart, it broke under the rising trendline for the first time since 2017, after which it reverted to the mean two years later.', 'Looking from the figures side, the stock is trading, as of end of December 2023, below a multiple of 12 - the lowest multiple since December 2017.', 'To put this in perspective, the weighted average price-earnings ratio for the sector is around 16. The average ratio of the stock for the last 10 years is slightly above 17, as calculated from the above table. Both metrics indicate the current multiple under 12 times is significantly discounted. The fact the company is in capable hands of a management that already navigated tremendous challenges convinced me to initiate a long position last month.', 'Additionally, my favorite metric that flashed at the end of last year and triggered my buy is the market cap as a multiple of levered free cash flow.', 'Levered free cash flow its the amount of cash a company has after paying its financial obligations. It is the cash that is available for the company to invest: management can raise dividends (which it just announced), is more likely to acquire new businesses or reinvest in its own assets.', 'The current returns on assets of 5.60%, on capital of 10.90% and equity of 18.30% demonstrate management knows how to efficiently run the business and the cash it has at hand.', 'Finally, Comcast has a comfortable margin of free cash flow currently standing at 13.30% (4.30% year-over-year growth), which could turn to be an excellent edge in relation to its competition. Indeed, Comcast does not need to increase its external debt as it generates its own cash, and that could prove to be vital in a high interest rate environment.', ""Indeed, Comcast is in good hands. Brian Roberts is chairman and CEO of Comcast. He was named president in 1990 at 31 years of age when the company had $657 million in annual revenue. Its annual revenue has since grown to $94.50 billion. Management is stable and plays the long run. Its acquisition strategy supporting inorganic growth in difficult times has proven more than once that management knows how to turn around the business. After the dotcom bubble burst and the stock market crashed, Roberts acquired in 2000 AT&T's Broadband for $53.2 billion in stock and assumed debt. The deal allowed Comcast to become the largest cable operator in the world. And again, right after the global financial crisis hit the world and valuations, Comcast acquired NBCUniversal in 2009, which is yet another success story of the company."", ""With likely cuts in the interest rate by the Fed, I believe Comcast will benefit more than other stocks from an eased environment where mergers and acquisitions, which Comcast excels at, would become cheaper thanks to a reduced cost of debt and where expensive infrastructure projects would also be easier to finance again. It is no coincidence the stock underperformed the broader index in 2022-23. That is when the Fed raised the rate by over 500 bais points. Given the overall valuations have softened in relation to the Covid years (the valuations were powered by Fed's zero rate), I do think it is likely Roberts will announce in the next few quarters an acquisition that would boost the stock and fuel investors' optimism. There is one key risk to seriously consider though: competition."", ""Competition has fueled the fears of the markets on Comcast, particularly its Connectivity & Platforms business, leading to the stock's underperformance in the last three years. Long-established copper-dependent fixed line communication service providers such as Verizon and AT&T (NYSE:T) have been modernizing their networks by installing extensive fiber infrastructure that reaches into buildings, both residential and commercial. Government subsidies have also given them a boost to promote digital transformation, particularly in certain remote areas where these corporations would otherwise be reluctant to provide high-speed internet."", ""The rise of these substitute technologies has led to an increasing number of consumers terminating their 10-year cable contracts. In order to solve this issue, Comcast now provides 4G and 5G broadband plans in addition to other mobile phone services. The perceived problem is that Comcast provides it via a partnership with its competition. Comcast has a mobile virtual network operator agreement with Verizon for using its wireless infrastructure. And the users are actually happier with Comcast's Xfinity Mobile."", 'Source: fiercewireless.com', ""Despite the positive feedback, Comcast's issue is that the 1.3 million wireless accounts it added in the previous year pale in comparison to the 2.50 million added by Charter (a competitor that also relies on an MVNO with Verizon). Even though Comcast has surpassed the $1 billion quarterly revenue mark and the 1.30 million addition is a high number, the fact the number is much lower than Charter's raises questions about how quickly Comcast can develop its wireless services into a multibillion-dollar business. As mentioned, Verizon continues to be a competitor in the mobile market and Comcast's plan to provide 5G with its infrastructure fuels fears that the partnership established in 2011 could be unsustainable."", ""However, due to non-disclosure agreements, little is known about the arrangement. It is likely that the MVNO is perpetual or at least spans over several decades as infrastructure-related contracts tend to be established for a long period of time. Therefore, I do believe this key risk fueled an overreaction in the markets and that we will continue to see assurances from both Comcast and Verizon. Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg declared recently that Verizon is making money on this, but that he could not go into details due to the complexity and the non-disclosure agreements in place. This came as the Verizon CEO sought to calm stockholders' fear on Comcast's competition, which led to a stock sell-off in 2022 (the stock continued its sell-off in 2023, led by aging lead cable fears). Vestberg confirmed not being prone to try and alter the MVNO, as it drives some of the revenue growth of Verizon. Given the likely long-term nature of the MVNO and that the new users of Xfinity Mobile primarily come from Verizon, as you can see below, it does look like Comcast will ultimately preserve the sustained growth of Xfinity Mobile, further tapping into the competitors' user bases."", 'Souce: fiercewireless.com', 'Comcast is an attractive opportunity currently with the market having yet to readjust the discounted valuation after 2022 fears that the competition would harm its growth prospects. The stock has recently suffered from the high rate environment and a market overreaction fueled by fear, leading to a cheap valuation. The business being in the hands of a long-term thinking management, and its edge over competitors with an overall more satisfied and growing user base are both solid arguments for a bullish case. Market tailwinds, in particular with Fed rate cuts in sight and cheaper valuations of potential target business, could further boost the stock to achieve a new turn around and catch up with the broader index.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

But among the Magnificent Seven, Nvidia may be playing the most important role. The company's graphics processing units (GPU) are fueling applications across the generative AI spectrum -- from machine learning and quantum computing to data centers."", 'During its fiscal 2024 fourth-quarter earnings call on Feb. 21, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang declared that ""accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point."" With Nvidia stock up over 230% in the last year, some investors may be wondering what Huang meant, and if it\'s too late to buy shares.', ""Let's dig into Nvidia's earnings report and assess the secular trends fueling demand for generative AI GPUs. While Nvidia stock is certainly enjoying the moment, investors may still come away inspired to buy shares now."", ""Oftentimes when a company is experiencing unprecedented demand, it will see soaring revenue -- and that's it. In other words, companies sometimes have to reinvest heavily into manufacturing in order to meet that higher demand. This can put a strain on operating margins and profits, even during times of accelerated sales growth."", 'But Nvidia is a rare breed, make no mistake about it.', ""The chart above illustrates Nvidia's revenue, gross profit, net income, and free cash flow on a quarterly basis over the last 10 years. Just look at how steep the slope of each line has become. Not only is the company generating robust top-line growth, but its profits and cash flows are growing in lockstep."", 'Taking this a step further, Nvidia is not resting on its laurels. While demand for its industry-leading A100 and H100 GPUs remains strong, the company is investing its profits relentlessly into product innovation. The company is on track to begin shipments of next-generation chips, including the H200 in the second quarter. Moreover, reports suggest that Nvidia plans to release its most powerful chip to date, the B100, later in 2024.', ""The above trends underscore the fact that Nvidia's chips are in high demand. And with newer, improved models expected to reach customers soon, Nvidia's ride could just be getting started."", ""As use cases for AI continue to evolve, so do estimates about the total market size for the technology. A top Nvidia manager recently forecast that the market for AI-powered chips and software would grow to be worth $600 billion. The jury is still out on whether that prediction will prove accurate. However, what analysts are calling for in terms of growth can shed some light on Nvidia's potential."", ""While Nvidia's trailing-12-month revenue of $61 billion is impressive, perhaps even more encouraging are its long-term growth prospects as estimated by Wall Street analysts. Given Nvidia's status as a market leader in AI GPUs, many clearly believe that the current demand trends can be sustained over the next few years."", ""To me, the biggest risk associated with Nvidia is not its valuation. Rather, I think the competitive landscape is going to become increasingly intense. Nvidia's top rival at the moment is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). However, both Amazon and Microsoft are already developing their own inference and training chips for generative AI models. While Nvidia may have a head start, investors should not turn their backs on its big tech cohorts. While I suspect it'll take a few years for other chips to acquire meaningful market share, Nvidia investors should be considering what other growth drivers the company has beyond AI GPUs."", ""One area that investors may be overlooking at the moment is Nvidia's opportunity in software. While the company is still primarily a hardware developer, Nvidia's software and services business reached a $1 billion revenue run rate during the fourth quarter."", ""This is a big deal for a couple of reasons. First, software tends to come with high margins. Should Nvidia begin to eventually lose share in the chip market, it's likely that its margins will take a hit. However, this could be more than offset if Nvidia continues to see success in software. Additionally, since software services are typically more predictable in terms of demand, I wouldn't be surprised to see investors apply even more of a premium to Nvidia stock in the future."", ""At a price-to-sales ratio of 32, Nvidia stock is trading much higher than its historical levels. However, the company's soaring revenue and profits, coupled with its steadfast reinvestment into new products and its budding software business, could warrant the premium. Given its differentiated business model, full-spectrum platform, and the secular tailwinds fueling AI, I think now is as good a time as ever to scoop up shares of Nvidia and hold them for the long run."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

This has nothing to do with the amount of years of dividend growth under a particular company’s belt. There are plenty of not only mere “aristocrats,” but “dividend kings” (stocks with over 50 years of consecutive dividend growth) as well as questionable dividend growth prospects.', 'A prime example is 3M (NYSE:MMM). As I have discussed previously, following the settlement of billions worth of litigation, plus other headwinds like persistent weak growth, a dividend cut may be in its future.

While the stock’s 2.19% forward yield may look tiny in a high-interest environment, this payout is likely to grow considerably over time. At least, earnings forecasts for Automatic Data Processing.', 'These call for the company’s earnings to increase by more than 30% this fiscal year (ending June 2024), and by another 9.52% during the next fiscal year.

This is in line with Cincinnati Financial’s average annual dividend growth over the past five years (7.19%). Trading for 17.9 times forward earnings, a fair valuation for a property & casualty insurer, CINF may not be in the running to experience much earnings multiple expansion.', 'That said, shares could still appreciate in value, in tandem with increased earnings.

Yet while peers such as Clorox (NYSE:CLX) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) are also popular among long-term dividend investors, shares in this maker of products like its namesake toothpaste, Irish Spring soap, and household cleaner Ajax may be the better buy among the bunch.', 'Clorox has the highest forward yield among the three (3.14%, versus 2.23% for CL stock and 2.34% for PG). That said, issues like a post-Covid sales slump and the continued impact of last year’s cyber attack call into question Clorox’s dividend growth sustainability.', 'PG is similar to CL in terms of yield, its payout ratio, as well as in expected earnings growth.

There’s little end in sight to conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. New conflicts could emerge in Africa and Asia. Expect continued strong results for General Dynamics in the years ahead, as the U.S. keeps spending heavily on defense in light of this strife.', 'GD stock has a forward dividend yield of only 1.93%, but payouts have increased by an average of 7.26% per year over the past five years.

Some in the sell-side community has soured on Illinois Tool Works as of late. Over the past month, analysts at BofA and Wells Fargo have both downgraded ITW to “underweight.”', 'Challenges like weak demand and falling margins may persist for now.

A “dividend king,” with 60 years of consecutive dividend growth, the most recent payout increased happened last May.', 'The company increased its dividend by 5%. Currently paying investors $1.10 per share annually in dividends, LOW stock has a forward yield of 1.89%. There’s a good reason I kicked off discussion about Lowe’s by mentioning “return of capital.” Besides steady, ever-growing dividends, Lowe’s has since late 2022 been buying back stock, as part of a $15 billion share repurchase program.', 'In terms of company-specific catalysts, factors like a rebound in housing demand may positively affect Lowe’s fiscal performance in the future. JP Morgan’s Christopher Horvers recently noted this in an upgrade of the stock.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Realty Income (NYSE:O) is one of the few real estate investment trusts that’s in the “dividend aristocrats” category.

(NASDAQ:CMCSA) has severely underperformed the S&P 500 in the last two years, disappointing shareholders. I do own the shares in my portfolio, as I see an attractive upside potential. As a matter of fact, I initiated my position last month. In this analysis, I will discuss the reasons for the severe underperformance and why I still bought it at the start of the year. My investment thesis is that the conglomerate nature of the company is its moat; the multiple revenue streams across a wide range of telecom and media segments make it a stable and growing one, with upside potential at the current price level.', 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with CMCSA.', ""The stock performed in line with the broader stock market from 2014 to 2021, but lost momentum in 2021 and has accumulated over 100% underperformance in three years. The S&P 500's 10-year performance stands at over 160%, while shares of Comcast declined to below 60% performance in 10 years."", 'We will go through the issues and struggles the company has been facing over the last three years, particularly the tough competition (lagging behind in the 5G rollout of the last few years, hitting the main revenue source of the company) and the lack of mergers and acquisitions, reflecting an exhausted management. And yet, I do see arguments in favor of a turnaround after an irrational overreaction by investors. A catch-up on the broader stock market is possible given the attractive valuation and the sustained business growth.', 'Comcast is comprised of two product lines.', ""The first is Connectivity & Platforms, generating two-thirds of the revenue but 80% of the Ebitda, meaning it is the most profitable. It includes three businesses. The first one is Xfinity, which is the largest internet provider in the U.S. Then there is Comcast, which is focused on business technology. ^he last one is Sky, composed of Sky Broadband, an internet provider in the U.K., and Sky Mobile, a fast-growing wireless provider. Connectivity & Platforms is the largest of the two product lines in both revenue and profitability. Indeed, Comcast's residential broadband segment has a wide reach with 32 million subscribers, but the numbers are falling. This is compensated by the company's wireless business, with approximately 6 million lines and a revenue growth of around 16% year over year, representing a growth opportunity through the 5G business. But it also faces tremendous competition from well-established 5G providers such as Verizon (NYSE:VZ)."", ""The second is Content & Experience. This product line comprises the media, studios and theme park segments. The main revenue segments are Peacock, a streaming service that has been growing quickly, NBCUniversal's film and television studios, including the famous Universal Pictures, one of the five major U.S. film production studios and the theme parks with Universal Theme Parks. Overall, Content & Experience represents only one-third of the revenue and one-fifth of the Ebitda, meaning it is less profitable. Content & Experience has, however, the highest growth potential thanks to its edge over competitors, in sharp contrast with the Connectivity & Platforms line that is losing momentum vis-a-vis the competition."", ""Let's take a look at the discounted cash flow calculations that pension funds and investment firms love to use in their analysis process. DCF models are easy to construct. However, if you don't have any at hand, there is a user-friendly model available on GuruFocus. Interestingly, I found the markets are currently pricing the stock as if it were to grow by 3%."", 'As you can see above, the DCF modelling available on GuruFocus based on the current stock price indicates the markets are assuming a modest 3% growth despite the company having grown at an average earnings per share growth rate of 9.40% in the last 10 years. If we remove the fear factor from the equation and stick to the historical earnings per share growth rate of the company of 9.40%, the fair value is approximately 50% above the current stock price, indicating an attractive risk-reward ratio given the fear factor in the equation is an overreaction, as I will explain later.', 'The fair value of the stock is likely to be closer to $60 than the current $40 level.', 'The Jan. 25 earnings announcement for the fourth quarter of 2023 further provides investors with additional comfort and good news. Net income per share stood at 81 cents, a 15.70% increase year over year. The dividend has increased by 6.90% to $1.24 per share and, given the stock sell-off of the last two years, the dividend yield has turned quite attractive at 3%. Comcast did continue to lose broadband subscribers (down 34,000 users, primarily due to cord-cutting) but compensated by adding 310,000 wireless subscribers, showing a shift in consumer preference. Peacock continued to be the fastest-growing U.S. streamer, adding 3 million subscribers as revenue increased 57% to a record of $1.03 billion.', 'The earnings per share acceleration of the last year is expected to continue to outperform in relation to the trendline in the next two years, reconfirming the 2022 stock price slump was fueled by exaggerated fears of competition. This leads to an overly attractive valuation that has yet to be corrected. This further confirms the 50% upside derived from the DCF model is not unreasonable.', 'I initiated a long position last month because Comcast hit a highly attractive valuation point. Indeed, one of the most favored metrics of investors is the price-earnings ratio. As you can see in the below chart, it broke under the rising trendline for the first time since 2017, after which it reverted to the mean two years later.', 'Looking from the figures side, the stock is trading, as of end of December 2023, below a multiple of 12 - the lowest multiple since December 2017.', 'To put this in perspective, the weighted average price-earnings ratio for the sector is around 16. The average ratio of the stock for the last 10 years is slightly above 17, as calculated from the above table. Both metrics indicate the current multiple under 12 times is significantly discounted. The fact the company is in capable hands of a management that already navigated tremendous challenges convinced me to initiate a long position last month.', 'Additionally, my favorite metric that flashed at the end of last year and triggered my buy is the market cap as a multiple of levered free cash flow.', 'Levered free cash flow its the amount of cash a company has after paying its financial obligations. It is the cash that is available for the company to invest: management can raise dividends (which it just announced), is more likely to acquire new businesses or reinvest in its own assets.', 'The current returns on assets of 5.60%, on capital of 10.90% and equity of 18.30% demonstrate management knows how to efficiently run the business and the cash it has at hand.', 'Finally, Comcast has a comfortable margin of free cash flow currently standing at 13.30% (4.30% year-over-year growth), which could turn to be an excellent edge in relation to its competition. Indeed, Comcast does not need to increase its external debt as it generates its own cash, and that could prove to be vital in a high interest rate environment.', ""Indeed, Comcast is in good hands. Brian Roberts is chairman and CEO of Comcast. He was named president in 1990 at 31 years of age when the company had $657 million in annual revenue. Its annual revenue has since grown to $94.50 billion. Management is stable and plays the long run. Its acquisition strategy supporting inorganic growth in difficult times has proven more than once that management knows how to turn around the business. After the dotcom bubble burst and the stock market crashed, Roberts acquired in 2000 AT&T's Broadband for $53.2 billion in stock and assumed debt. The deal allowed Comcast to become the largest cable operator in the world. And again, right after the global financial crisis hit the world and valuations, Comcast acquired NBCUniversal in 2009, which is yet another success story of the company."", ""With likely cuts in the interest rate by the Fed, I believe Comcast will benefit more than other stocks from an eased environment where mergers and acquisitions, which Comcast excels at, would become cheaper thanks to a reduced cost of debt and where expensive infrastructure projects would also be easier to finance again. It is no coincidence the stock underperformed the broader index in 2022-23. That is when the Fed raised the rate by over 500 bais points. Given the overall valuations have softened in relation to the Covid years (the valuations were powered by Fed's zero rate), I do think it is likely Roberts will announce in the next few quarters an acquisition that would boost the stock and fuel investors' optimism. There is one key risk to seriously consider though: competition."", ""Competition has fueled the fears of the markets on Comcast, particularly its Connectivity & Platforms business, leading to the stock's underperformance in the last three years. Long-established copper-dependent fixed line communication service providers such as Verizon and AT&T (NYSE:T) have been modernizing their networks by installing extensive fiber infrastructure that reaches into buildings, both residential and commercial. Government subsidies have also given them a boost to promote digital transformation, particularly in certain remote areas where these corporations would otherwise be reluctant to provide high-speed internet."", ""The rise of these substitute technologies has led to an increasing number of consumers terminating their 10-year cable contracts. In order to solve this issue, Comcast now provides 4G and 5G broadband plans in addition to other mobile phone services. The perceived problem is that Comcast provides it via a partnership with its competition. Comcast has a mobile virtual network operator agreement with Verizon for using its wireless infrastructure. And the users are actually happier with Comcast's Xfinity Mobile."", 'Source: fiercewireless.com', ""Despite the positive feedback, Comcast's issue is that the 1.3 million wireless accounts it added in the previous year pale in comparison to the 2.50 million added by Charter (a competitor that also relies on an MVNO with Verizon). Even though Comcast has surpassed the $1 billion quarterly revenue mark and the 1.30 million addition is a high number, the fact the number is much lower than Charter's raises questions about how quickly Comcast can develop its wireless services into a multibillion-dollar business. As mentioned, Verizon continues to be a competitor in the mobile market and Comcast's plan to provide 5G with its infrastructure fuels fears that the partnership established in 2011 could be unsustainable."", ""However, due to non-disclosure agreements, little is known about the arrangement. It is likely that the MVNO is perpetual or at least spans over several decades as infrastructure-related contracts tend to be established for a long period of time. Therefore, I do believe this key risk fueled an overreaction in the markets and that we will continue to see assurances from both Comcast and Verizon. Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg declared recently that Verizon is making money on this, but that he could not go into details due to the complexity and the non-disclosure agreements in place. This came as the Verizon CEO sought to calm stockholders' fear on Comcast's competition, which led to a stock sell-off in 2022 (the stock continued its sell-off in 2023, led by aging lead cable fears). Vestberg confirmed not being prone to try and alter the MVNO, as it drives some of the revenue growth of Verizon. Given the likely long-term nature of the MVNO and that the new users of Xfinity Mobile primarily come from Verizon, as you can see below, it does look like Comcast will ultimately preserve the sustained growth of Xfinity Mobile, further tapping into the competitors' user bases."", 'Souce: fiercewireless.com', 'Comcast is an attractive opportunity currently with the market having yet to readjust the discounted valuation after 2022 fears that the competition would harm its growth prospects. The stock has recently suffered from the high rate environment and a market overreaction fueled by fear, leading to a cheap valuation. The business being in the hands of a long-term thinking management, and its edge over competitors with an overall more satisfied and growing user base are both solid arguments for a bullish case. Market tailwinds, in particular with Fed rate cuts in sight and cheaper valuations of potential target business, could further boost the stock to achieve a new turn around and catch up with the broader index.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

The broad market index has rallied nearly 28%. That has it trading at an all-time high. ', 'However, not all stocks participated in the rally. Energy stocks are up only about 1% over the past year, so the sector trades at a historically low valuation. That suggests energy stocks have significant upside potential during the next sector rotation.', 'The energy industry currently has a historically low weighting in the S&P 500:', ""That chart shows that energy stocks make up less than 4% of the S&P 500 by market cap. That's the second lowest level over the past few decades, including less than during the dot-com bubble. Because energy stocks supply 10% of the S&P 500's earnings, the sector should have around a 10% weighting since it has historically tracked its earnings contribution. That would put it near the historical average. "", 'Rick Muncrief, the CEO of oil and gas producer Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN), discussed the energy sector\'s currently compelling value proposition on its fourth-quarter conference call. He commented on what\'s likely driving the gap, stating, ""I believe this gap exists due to extreme valuations in tech, combined with a pervasive misunderstanding of hydrocarbon demand over time."" ', ""Whereas energy stocks have barely budged over the past year, tech stocks have rallied more than 50%, driving much of the S&P 500's rebound. Many technology companies trade at extremely frothy valuations today, driven by the hype surrounding artificial intelligence. For example, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 currently trades at a forward P/E ratio of more than 30, while the S&P 500 sells for about 21 times forward earnings. Both indexes have seen significant multiple expansion over the past year. The Nasdaq 100's P/E ratio was less than 25 a year ago, while the S&P 500's was around 18. "", 'The other factor weighing on energy stocks is the misplaced belief that demand for oil and gas is declining. That\'s not the case. Muncrief noted that: ""With global energy demand forecasted to increase 50% by 2050, the world is going to need growth from all sources of energy, including oil and natural gas. With the world\'s power needs continuing to grow, it is evident that peak oil demand is nowhere in sight and our industry will be an important contributor of energy growth for the foreseeable future."" Valuations in the energy sector should reflect this growth, not the decline that the market is currently pricing in for most energy stocks. ', ""Devon Energy is a prime example of the valuation disconnect. The oil company is on track to grow its free cash flow by 20% this year, fueled by service cost deflation and capital efficiency gains. That assumes oil averages about $80 per barrel, which is slightly above the current price point. Even at a more conservative $75 a barrel (slightly below the current price), Devon Energy trades at a free cash flow yield of 9%. That compares to 4% for the S&P 500 and 3% for the Nasdaq, meaning it's significantly cheaper. This discount is driving Devon's capital return strategy of prioritizing share repurchases in 2024 to capitalize on its dirt cheap stock. "", 'Fellow oil and gas producer Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ: FANG) also trades at a dirt cheap price. At $70 oil, Diamondback can produce more than $15 per share of free cash flow. That puts its free cash flow yield at more than 8%. Meanwhile, it can generate over $19 per share in free cash flow at $80 oil, giving it a free cash flow yield above 10%. That is a cheap price for a growing business. The company expects its oil production to grow by 5% per share this year, while free cash flow could rise more than 15% per share if oil averages around $80 a barrel. ', ""Commodity-priced exposed producers aren't the only energy stocks trading at low valuations. Natural gas pipeline giant Kinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI) expects to grow its free cash flow by 8% this year to $2.26 per share. That gives it a monster 13% free cash flow yield. Kinder Morgan uses half its steady cash flow to pay dividends (currently yielding 6.5%). It uses the rest to fund investments to grow its cash flow, repurchase its dirt cheap shares, and strengthen its already excellent balance sheet. The company expects to grow its cash flow as it capitalizes on the expected 19% rise in natural gas demand through 2030. "", 'Energy stocks trade at low valuations as investors bid up tech stocks and overlook the growth ahead for the sector. That makes the industry look very attractive. Valuations should improve as investors eventually realize that plenty of growth remains ahead for oil and gas demand and start rotating out of high-octane tech stocks.

Not only do they provide passive income, but they can also produce above-average total returns as they grow their earnings and shareholder payouts. Over the last 50 years, dividend stocks have outperformed the average return of stocks in the S&P 500, and dividend growers in particular have delivered the best total returns. ', ""Enbridge (NYSE: ENB), MPLX (NYSE: MPLX), and Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN) stand out to a few Fool.com contributors for their magnificent ability to pay and regularly hike their dividends. Here's why they think investors should buy them hand over fist this month. "", ""Reuben Gregg Brewer (Enbridge): If you buy North American midstream giant Enbridge you have to accept one negative -- its dividend will likely provide the bulk of your returns on the investment. But given that it yields a huge 7.9% at the current share price, that's probably not going to bother income-oriented investors. And while its dividend growth isn't likely to be huge, it should track the company's distributable cash flow growth, which management expects to be around 3% to 5% over the longer term. That's enough to keep up with, if not exceed, average inflation over time. Basically, Enbridge is a slow and steady tortoise."", ""The distributable cash flow payout ratio is currently about 65%, which is comfortably in the middle of the company's target range. And the balance sheet backing that dividend is investment-grade rated. In other words, the dividend sits on a solid financial foundation."", ""The company's collection of energy infrastructure, meanwhile, is vital, and would be difficult if not impossible to replace. It spans a wide gamut, including oil and natural gas pipelines, natural gas utilities, and renewable power. These assets all produce reliable cash flows from fees or they have regulated returns. Enbridge is set to add three more natural gas utilities to its portfolio in 2024, further increasing its exposure to regulated assets -- and making its cash flows even more boring and reliable."", ""That brings the story back to the dividend, which management has increased annually for an impressive 29 consecutive years. There's absolutely no indication that this streak is at risk of ending."", ""Matt DiLallo (MPLX): MPLX doesn't get enough credit for its ability to distribute cash to its investors. The master limited partnership (MLP) has increased its payouts every year since its formation in 2012, and delivered 10% hikes in each of the last two years. That would be impressive for any company, but it's even more so for one that offers a monster 8.8% yield at its current share price. "", 'That big-time payout is on an extremely firm foundation. MPLX generates stable cash flows backed by long-term contracts with high-quality customers, including its parent, refining giant Marathon Petroleum. Meanwhile, it distributes a conservative portion of that steady cash to investors -- its distribution coverage ratio was a comfortable 1.6 times last year. That enabled the MPLX to retain all the money it needed to fund expansion projects with more than $800 million to spare. ', ""That excess free cash added to its already fortress-like balance sheet. MPLX ended last year with $1 billion in cash and a low 3.3 times leverage ratio. That's comfortably below the 4.0 times leverage ratio its stable cash flow can support. "", ""MPLX has the financial flexibility to invest in expansion projects and make acquisitions that grow its cash flow. It's currently building several natural gas processing plants and has a couple of pipeline capacity expansion projects underway. These projects should grow its cash flow as they enter service over the next two years. The MLP will also make acquisitions as opportunities arise. For example, in December, it took full control of a gathering and processing joint venture, spending $270 million to buy the 40% interest that it hadn't previously owned. "", ""These growth-related investments will increase its cash flow, giving it more fuel to raise its distribution. Given the strength of MPLX's financial foundation, its payout makes the stock a no-brainer buy this month for income seekers."", ""Neha Chamaria (Devon Energy): Devon Energy has been one heck of a dividend stock in recent years, especially after it launched the oil and natural gas industry's first fixed-plus-variable dividend policy in 2021 following its merger with WPX Energy. In the three years that followed, dividends have contributed significantly to Devon shareholders' total returns."", ""Now is a great time to pick shares of this oil stock, considering that it has fallen nearly by 14% over the past six months and yields 5.5% as of this writing. Devon Energy's latest numbers prove that the company is on solid footing. Its fourth-quarter production surpassed its guidance, and solid oil volumes and cash flows even encouraged management to raise its fixed quarterly dividend payout by 10% to $0.22 a share, effective for March."", ""Devon now pays a fixed dividend every quarter, as well as a variable dividend of up to 50% of its excess free cash flow. In Q4, the oil and natural gas giant announced a fixed dividend of $0.22 per share plus a variable dividend of the same amount. Now, it's important to note here that Devon's total Q4 dividend was still significantly below the dividends it paid out through last year. But that's because of lower oil prices, which hit its free cash flows. What matters here is the hike in the fixed dividend, which is a testimony to the company's resilience and financial strength."", ""Devon plans to moderate its production growth as it focuses on value instead of volume, and this strategy should keep driving its earnings per share higher. The company's also buying back shares aggressively, so investors who buy Devon now should make solid returns in the long term, driven by both earnings and dividend growth."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Enbridge right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Enbridge, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Enbridge wasn’t one of them.

Whereas the benchmark S&P 500 has delivered a total return, including dividends, of a little north of 33,000% since the ""Oracle of Omaha"" took over as CEO in the mid-1960s, Berkshire\'s Class A shares (BRK.A) have galloped higher by an aggregate of more than 5,000,000% as of the closing bell on Feb. 28, 2024! An outperformance of this magnitude is going to get you noticed by professional and retail investors.', ""Warren Buffett's phenomenal track record is a big reason why there's a buzz surrounding Berkshire Hathaway every time the company files Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A 13F gives investors an over-the-shoulder look at what Wall Street's greatest money managers have been buying and selling, and is a required quarterly filing for institutions and investors with at least $100 million in assets under management."", ""Throughout 2023, the Oracle of Omaha and his investment aides, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, were very selective about their purchases. One core holding that's continued to see somewhat regular additions is energy stock Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY)."", ""Accounting for Berkshire's latest share purchases during the first week of February, Buffett's company has gobbled up more than 248 million shares of Occidental Petroleum since the start of 2022. That's a roughly $15 billion position, with $34 billion, in total, devoted to energy stocks, including Berkshire's position in Chevron."", ""Having 9% of Berkshire's invested assets tied up in two integrated oil and gas stocks is a pretty clear message that the company's brightest minds anticipate crude oil prices will remain elevated for an extended period. With the global supply of oil remaining tight following years of capital underinvestment tied to the COVID-19 pandemic, there's a real possibility the spot price of crude oil heads even higher."", ""What makes Occidental Petroleum an intriguing investment in the energy arena is its revenue breakdown. Despite being an integrated operator that generates some of its revenue from downstream chemical plants, Occidental derives the lion's share of its sales from drilling. If the spot price of crude oil climbs, it'll benefit more than virtually any other integrated oil and gas company."", ""Beyond Occidental, we've also seen Warren Buffett and his team piling back into satellite-radio operator Sirius XM Holdings (NASDAQ: SIRI). Though radio operators are often highly dependent on advertising revenue to keep the lights on, Sirius XM has an assortment of competitive advantages working in its favor that should help it navigate any economic climate better than terrestrial and online radio companies."", ""To start with the obvious, Sirius XM is the only licensed satellite-radio operator. While this doesn't mean it's free of competition for listeners, it does give the company reasonably strong subscription-pricing power."", ""What's arguably even more important with Sirius XM is how the company generates revenue. Whereas terrestrial and online radio providers are reliant on advertising revenue, only 20% of Sirius XM's sales came from advertising in 2023. Meanwhile, a whopping 77% of Sirius XM's revenue can be traced to subscriptions. Subscribers are less likely to cancel their service during an economic downturn than businesses are to meaningfully pare back their advertising budgets."", 'Sirius XM is also historically cheap. Shares are currently trading for a multiple of 13 times forward-year earnings, which is a 32% discount to its average forward-year earnings multiple over the trailing five-year period.', ""Although Berkshire's 13Fs have told an interesting story for more than a year -- Buffett and his team have been net sellers of equities for the past five quarters -- it's what's not in Berkshire's 13Fs that's an even bigger deal."", ""Warren Buffett's favorite stock to buy isn't Apple, Occidental Petroleum, or any of the nearly four dozen securities currently listed in Berkshire's quarterly filed 13F. The only way to find this mystery stock that the Oracle of Omaha can't stop buying is to dig into his company's operating results. That's where you'll find the quarterly share-repurchase activity, because Warren Buffett's favorite stock to buy is none other than shares of his own company! Don't you love a good plot twist?"", ""Prior to July 2018, the rules governing Berkshire's share-buyback program didn't allow its then-dynamic duo of Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger to get off the proverbial bench. Repurchases could only be undertaken if Berkshire's share price fell to or below 120% of book value (i.e., no more than 20% above its listed book value, as of the end of the latest quarter). Because Berkshire's share price never fell to or below this preset threshold, no buybacks were undertaken for years."", 'On July 17, 2018, everything changed for Buffett, Berkshire, and the company\'s shareholders. The company\'s board amended the buyback rules to allow their star players to ""get in the game."" As long as Berkshire holds at least $30 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries on its balance sheet, and Buffett and Munger agreed that their company\'s stock was intrinsically cheap, buybacks could commence without a ceiling.', ""During the December-ended quarter, Berkshire retired 3,623 shares of Class A stock and 660,585 shares of Class B stock (BRK.B) at a total cost of $2,147,823,075! This marked the 22nd consecutive quarter that Buffett's company has repurchased its own stock, and it brought the grand total of buybacks since July 2018 to more than $74 billion. To put this into context, Buffett and the late Charlie Munger spent roughly twice as much buying Berkshire stock compared to how much they spent purchasing shares of Apple."", ""Since Berkshire Hathaway doesn't pay a dividend, share repurchases are the direct way Warren Buffett and his investment team can reward investors who align with their long-term vision. Steadily buying back stock should increase the ownership stakes of the company's shareholders."", 'Furthermore, businesses like Berkshire Hathaway that tend to grow their operating income over time should enjoy a hearty boost to their earnings per share as their outstanding share count declines. This is only going to make the stock more attractive to fundamentally focused investors.', ""Buying back tens of billions in his own company's stock is also a pretty clear indication that Buffett is betting on himself and the business he, Munger, Combs, and Weschler have built to succeed over the long run."", ""With a record $167.6 billion in cash on hand and few, if any, values piquing the interest of the Oracle of Omaha and his team, look for repurchases of Warren Buffett's favorite stock to continue throughout the first quarter (and likely well beyond)."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

That's not surprising as some of its key components such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), AMD, Broadcom, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing have already jumped nicely thanks to their solid earnings reports -- which have revealed that these companies are benefiting from the growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) chips."", ""However, there's one PHLX Semiconductor Sector component that has failed to step on the gas thus far: Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU). Shares of the memory manufacturer are up just 5% in 2024. However, a recent development has given Micron stock a nice boost. Shares of the chipmaker jumped 4% on Feb. 26."", ""Let's see why that happened and check why this semiconductor stock could go on a bull run following this development."", 'In a press release dated Feb. 26, Micron pointed out that it has commenced the volume production of its high bandwidth memory 3E (HBM3E) chip. The company added that this particular chip ""will be part of NVIDIA H200 Tensor Core GPUs, which will begin shipping in the second calendar quarter of 2024."" Micron claims that HBM3E consumes 30% less power than what competitors offer.', 'It is not surprising to see Micron landing the HBM spot in Nvidia\'s upcoming processors. In its December 2023 earnings conference call, Micron pointed out that its HBM3E chip was in the final stages of qualification with Nvidia. Now that the company has won this business from Nvidia, it seems on its way to achieving its target of generating ""several hundred millions of dollars of HBM revenue in fiscal 2024.""', ""The good thing for Micron is that demand for Nvidia's upcoming H200 processors is already solid. Nvidia management remarked on its latest earnings call that demand for its next-generation products will be greater than supply. So the possibility of Micron selling out its entire output of HBM3E chips cannot be ruled out, especially considering that fellow memory manufacturer SK Hynix has already sold out its HBM inventory for 2024."", 'More importantly, Micron is reportedly boosting its HBM production capacity so that it can serve the growing demand for this memory type not only from Nvidia but also from other customers. In November 2023, the chipmaker reportedly opened a new facility dedicated to producing HBM3E on a mass scale. It is also worth noting that Micron is working on a bigger HBM3E memory size that could be rolled out next month.', 'All this indicates that the company is on track to make the most of the growing demand for HBM, a product that is in tremendous demand thanks to its deployment in AI processors. Market research firm Yole Group estimates that the HBM market could generate an annual revenue of almost $20 billion in 2025, up from $5.5 billion last year and an estimated $14.1 billion in 2024. By 2029, global HBM revenue is expected to jump to $38 billion.', ""As such, Micron could win big from this market in the long run, especially considering that it has already landed a significant customer in the form of Nvidia, which dominates the global AI chip market hands down. Not surprisingly, Micron's top-line growth is set to accelerate significantly in fiscal 2024, 2025, and 2026."", ""As the chart above indicates, Micron's revenue is expected to jump to almost $23 billion in fiscal 2024. That would be a big increase over the fiscal 2023 reading of $15.5 billion. By fiscal 2026, Micron's top line is expected to close in on the $35 billion mark, which means that the company is expected to more than double its revenue in the space of just three fiscal years."", ""Micron is currently trading at 6 times sales. While that's higher than the S&P 500 index's sales multiple of 2.8, the potential growth that this AI stock could deliver means that it seems worthy of a premium valuation. That's especially true considering that other chipmakers benefiting from AI adoption are trading at higher sales multiples."", 'So, if Micron Technology maintains its price-to-sales ratio of 6 after three years and indeed delivers $35 billion in annual revenue in fiscal 2026, its market capitalization could jump to $210 billion. That would be a 112% increase from current levels, which is why investors should consider buying this chipmaker before its stock market rally gains momentum.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Micron Technology right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Micron Technology wasn’t one of them.

The pizza delivery leader recently announced a return to revenue gains that were powered by rising sales volumes. Let's take a closer look."", ""Following a tough post-pandemic period, Domino's is on a stronger growth path heading into 2024. Sure, its 2.8% comparable-store sales increase was below McDonald's 4.3% boost in the same period. But while Mickey D's sales trends are slowing down, Domino's growth rate is accelerating. Comps fell 1% in the previous quarter, for context."", 'The chain is also getting its growth completely from expanding sales volumes, which is easier to maintain than constantly raising prices. Prices are falling for many key ingredients compared to last year\'s inflation spikes. But Domino\'s is handling more traffic in both its delivery and carryout segments. ""Our positive U.S. transactions and same-store sales growth ... underscore the strength and momentum in our business,"" CEO Russell Weiner said in a press release.', ""Domino's is having no trouble capitalizing on its growth, even though sales trends are modest compared to the pandemic-era demand spikes in 2020 and 2021. Net income expanded at a 15% rate for the full 2023 fiscal year. The chain now isn't far from fully recovering when it comes to operating profit as this metric approaches 19% of sales."", ""Look at cash flow and you'll be even more impressed with the latest results. Domino's generated almost $600 million of operating cash this year, up 24% compared to 2022. Gains here allowed management to spend more on advertising while still allocating extra cash toward direct shareholder returns."", ""Executives just announced a new $1 billion stock buyback authorization that paves the way for more repurchase spending in 2024. Its dividend is jumping 25%, too. The current dividend yield is slightly below average at 1.3%. But it's low partly because of the stock price strength seen over the past year (it's up 52%). Toss in the rising share repurchase spending, and you've got good reasons to expect higher cash returns from this stock in 2024 and beyond."", ""Domino's stock valuation is at a 12-month high as of late February, but shares still look cheap. Its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.6 is below the 5 times sales that investors were paying at the pandemic peak. It's also a big discount compared to McDonald's P/S ratio of 8.5."", ""Investors have to balance that attractive price against the pizza chain's low, but improving, profit margin and its modest sales growth trends. It will be another few quarters before we know for sure that Domino's has conclusively put its post-pandemic growth hangover behind it."", ""Yet the hardest part of boosting sales as a fast-food restaurant is winning market share without resorting to profit-busting price cuts. The fact that Domino's is achieving this result through rising sales volumes is a great sign for future shareholder returns."", ""Should you invest $1,000 in Domino's Pizza right now?"", ""Before you buy stock in Domino's Pizza, consider this:"", ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Domino's Pizza wasn’t one of them.

To skip our detailed analysis of the real estate sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Real Estate and Realty Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.', 'The real estate sector has been battling with elevated mortgage rates this year, resulting in the US housing market suffering from a lack of demand among the population. However, some may expect the struggles of the real estate sector to abate as the year progresses, especially as many financial professionals begin to analyze the state of US real estate markets. Several spaces within the real estate sector are under-invested in, leaving the arena free and open for investors looking to make a real estate play.', 'On February 29, Carly Trip, the Head of Investments at Nuveen Real Estate, joined CNBC\'s ""Closing Bell Overtime"" to discuss the state of the US real estate markets. Here\'s what she had to say:', '""On the residential market, it\'s kind of like no new news, however what\'s interesting is that the consumer is really starting to explain their tolerance for mortgage rates. In December we saw really strong numbers, mortgage rates had come in about 50 basis points, bouncing around six and a half. As they have suddenly come up since then and hover above 7%, consumers do not like that. And so we\'re seeing the results of that in pending home sales. So we expect that that is not gonna improve, inventory will remain low until rates come around 6%, in which case your cost to own versus cost to rent margin really starts to shrink.""', ""Despite the above observations, Tripp noted that other areas in the real estate markets are doing better. Here's what she said:"", '""Retail\'s doing amazingly well. So retail has been the underdog of the last decade. And what we\'re seeing in our centres is increased activity, a lot of demand, increased sales. The consumer is obviously very resilient and strong. That is accomodating to retail spending, 80% of retail sales do involve a physical store which is a positive for our centres. And not only that, there\'s no new supply added to retail. Over the last five years, about a 130 million square feet of retail has been converted to other uses, so it\'s really been under-invested in. So the outlook for retail is very, very strong.""', 'Similarly, for the industrial real estate side, Tripp had positive insights to share. Here are some of the comments she made:', '""Industrial\'s been incredible. It has performed exactly as real estate should perform. Income has outpaced inflation, right, real estate is expected to be an inflation hedge, that\'s why it\'s such a great diversifier to a portfolio. And so we continue to see incredibly strong demand for industrial. Supply has slowed, that was the concern pre-pandemic. However, due to lack of construction spending, lack of financing just generally speaking, bottlenecks in the construction system, we expect that demand is just gonna continue to flow. E-commerce spending is not going anywhere.', 'Considering these highlights, while the residential side of real estate seems to be still struggling in 2024, that does not mean all real estate should be avoided this year. Several other areas within the sector remain ripe for investment. As such, we have compiled a list of some of the best real estate stocks to invest in, including names such as KE Holdings Inc (NYSE:BEKE), Crown Castle International Corp.

Demand conditions for rental homes are attractive due to the sharp decline in home affordability; the propensity to rent in order to avoid mortgage down payments, avoid higher monthly mortgage costs, and maintain flexibility; and the stronger demand for home rentals in suburbs rather than apartment rentals in cities. Rising construction costs are limiting the supply of single-family rental homes in the U.S. housing market. This limited inventory combined with strong demand is leading to robust rent growth.', 'Invitation Homes have an opportunity to partially offset the impact of inflation given that their in-place annual leases are significantly below market rents.

If you want to skip our coverage of affordable stocks and how they, like all other stocks such as small cap and large cap stocks, benefit and suffer from the broader macroeconomic environment, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Single Digit Stocks To Invest In. ', 'Stocks can broadly be classified into three categories based on their market capitalization. Each of these represents firms whose shares operate with different dynamics within the broader market climate. The three primary stock categories are small, mid, and large caps, with the passage of time that has seen trillion dollar valuations the likes of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has also created new categories commonly called mega cap stocks.', ""Similarly, the proliferation of computing products across the financial industry has made stock trading easier, leading to thousands of firms in categories such as micro and nano cap stocks. These stocks, which include firms whose shares trade in the single digits, are on the more 'affordable' end of the spectrum in literal terms. Single digit stocks are a small upgrade over the broader category of well known stocks that are called penny stocks. Typically, these stocks refer to firms whose shares trade below $5, and when we consider the general benefits and drawbacks of investing, single digit stocks, and penny stocks follow the same rules."", ""Both offer a higher potential for larger percentage returns via share price appreciation. Similarly, since penny stocks and single digit stocks belong to companies that receive little media coverage, the potential of scammers exploiting unwitting investors is high. This is because during the initial stage of a 'pump' during a typical scam, the shares of a single digit or penny stock appreciate much faster than the media can respond to determine if the performance is driven by underlying fundamentals or other legitimate tailwinds. Then, as more investors pile on, should the price drop, then most people end up losing their money."", ""However, where there's risk there's a reward, and one key advantage that single digit stocks have over penny stocks is that since they also include firms whose shares trade between $5 and $10, the opportunities from profiting also increase with the growing comfort of a heftier share price. Additionally, another key benefit that is rather exclusive to single digit stocks is that they can often involve the shares of well established and sizeable foreign entities who also make their American Depository Receipts (ADRs) available for trading on American stock markets."", 'This trend is present predominantly in the banking sector, with foreign or ex-US banks such as Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (NYSE:MUFG), Lloyds Banking Group plc (NYSE:LYG), and Banco Santander, S.A. (NYSE:SAN) being apt examples. Each of these is a major player in the financial systems of their countries, with a role similar to U.S. banking giants such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS).', ""Therefore, investing in single digit stocks offers a chance of stability as well as profit taking. Continuing with our example of single digit banking stocks, MUFJ's shares are up by a respectable 16% year to date, despite the fact that Japan's economy, like other developed peers such as the United Kingdom and Germany, is not performing well. Similarly, even though Britain is officially in recession territory, Lloyd's stock has shed just 6% over the past twelve months and had the shares not dropped in January, then just like the British economy, the stock would also be nearly flat in growth terms."", ""Before we head to our list of the best single digit stocks, it's important to also keep in mind recent stock market and economic news. With NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s blockbuster earnings out of the way, investors will now focus on interest rates and U.S. GDP growth - both of which are quite interlinked. Starting with the latter, S&P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI), ahead of its flagship S&P 500 crossing the coveted 5,000 point barrier and setting a new record, also upgraded its forecasts for U.S. economic growth in 2024. The ratings agency now believes that the American economy will grow by 2.4% in 2024, for a significant upward revision over the previous estimate of 1.5%. As this would hint on its own, the Federal Reserve's latest meeting minutes also show that the central bank is worried about cutting rates too soon rather than too late."", 'So, with single digit stocks offering the promise of returns and stability, we decided to look at what stocks hedge funds are buying.

A value investor at heart, his shrewd business sense and calm during market corrections have rewarded Berkshire Hathaway\xa0shareholders handsomely.', ""One ingredient to Berkshire's secret sauce is simply finding good companies and holding them over time. Here's the reasoning behind Berkshire holding Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and American Express (NYSE: AXP) for over 30 years and the value in finding quality dividend stocks and holding them over multi-decade periods."", 'Berkshire first bought Coca-Cola in 1988 and American Express a few years later in the early 1990s. Buffett and his team purchased both stocks in stages. Still, both companies have produced a higher total return than the S&P 500 since 1988 and have made their investors phenomenally wealthy.', ""Today, Berkshire Hathaway's American Express and Coca-Cola positions are worth over $57 billion. But Berkshire's cost basis on both stocks is just a few billion combined. Both companies have been above-average investments but not exceptional ones."", 'As Buffett wrote in his 2023 annual letter, discussing the qualities that make good dividend stocks, why American Express and Coca-Cola have worked well for Buffett, and why sticking with a good company over time is the easiest way to compound wealth: ""The lesson from Coke and AMEX? When you find a truly wonderful business, stick with it. Patience pays, and one wonderful business can offset the many mediocre decisions that are inevitable.""', 'The performance shows the impact of patience and how buying and holding quality companies over a multi-decade time frame can produce excellent returns.', 'The S&P 500 has produced an average annual return of 10.2% over the last three decades. Although the annual returns tend to be far above or below 10% in a given year, the 10% base of reference is still good to know.', ""You may be surprised to learn that $100 invested at a compound annual growth rate of 10.2% for 35 years will increase by -- wait for it -- 30-fold to $3,000. This is more or less what has happened with Berkshire's American Express and Coke positions. It's not so much about the return as it is about time."", ""If you wanted to increase your investment by 30-fold in just 10 years, you'd have to average a return of over 40% per year. And that assumes consistently huge gains and no losses -- which is unrealistic.\xa0The key takeaway is that regular saving and giving investments time to grow can turn a good company into an engine for powering generational wealth."", ""If you go back and read the last few years of shareholder letters, you'll notice a common theme: Buffett loves a strong business that grows its dividend and buys back its stock. You can see this dynamic at play in the following chart."", ""American Express, Coke, and Apple\xa0have all repurchased a lot of stock and raised their dividends significantly. This X pattern is what you'll want to look for when it comes to buybacks and dividends."", ""One reason Buffett hasn't felt pressured to buy more shares of American Express and Coke in recent years is because of buybacks. Today, Berkshire owns 20.9% of American Express and 9.3% of Coke. But it hasn't always been that high of a stake."", 'For instance, American Express has reduced its share count by 31.7% over the last 10 years from about 1.06 billion shares outstanding to 724 million. With about 152 million shares, Berkshire owned just 14.3% of American Express 10 years ago.', 'American Express has repurchased its shares but from other investors and not Berkshire. So, with fewer shares to go around, Berkshire has managed to increase its stake in the company without buying more shares -- not to mention collecting billions in dividend income in the process.', ""Buffett has made the same argument for why Berkshire isn't in a rush to boost its Apple stake. Today, Berkshire owns 5.9% of Apple. But at the rate Apple buys back its stock, Berkshire could eventually own 7% or even 8% of the company 10 years from now without buying another share."", ""Berkshire has invested far more capital in newer holdings, like Occidental Petroleum and Chevron, than in Coke or American Express. Coke and American Express are staple holdings in Berkshire's portfolio, not because Berkshire invested a ton in either company but because it was patient enough to hold these stocks over time."", ""Now, it's worth mentioning that you shouldn't expect the same returns from these companies going forward. When Buffett bought these stocks, there was far more uncertainty. Today, Coke, American Express, Chevron, Apple, and other Berkshire holdings are all components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The story has largely been told, so the monster gains are in the past."", ""Replicating Buffett's success with both companies would take finding a smaller business with a multi-decade runway for organic growth and dividend growth. Investors who don't need explosive gains may do well to invest in proven companies. The Dow and Berkshire's holdings are excellent places to start if you're looking for ideas."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Mondelez International ', ""We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$4.32b', 'US$4.93b', 'US$5.25b', 'US$5.75b', 'US$6.10b', 'US$6.37b', 'US$6.62b', 'US$6.84b', 'US$7.05b', 'US$7.25b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x10', 'Analyst x10', 'Analyst x7', 'Analyst x2', 'Analyst x2', 'Est @ 4.49%', 'Est @ 3.83%', 'Est @ 3.37%', 'Est @ 3.05%', 'Est @ 2.82%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.0% ', 'US$4.1k', 'US$4.4k', 'US$4.4k', 'US$4.6k', 'US$4.6k', 'US$4.5k', 'US$4.4k', 'US$4.3k', 'US$4.2k', 'US$4.1k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$43b', ""After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.3%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.0%."", 'Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$7.2b× (1 + 2.3%) ÷ (6.0%– 2.3%) = US$201b', 'Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$201b÷ ( 1 + 6.0%)10= US$113b', 'The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$156b.

The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.', ""Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Mondelez International as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

It isn't the size of Apple, Bank of America, American Express, Coca-Cola, or Chevron (NYSE: CVX) -- Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) top five holdings (all have a market cap over $150 billion)."", 'Yet, Berkshire has invested over $15 billion in Oxy, owning a staggering 28.2% of the entire company. Five years ago, Berkshire owned no Oxy stock.', ""At this rate, it would be easy to assume that Buffett and his team would buy out the whole company. But Buffett sent a clear message that this wouldn't be the case. Here's why."", 'Buffett wrote the following in his 2023 letter to shareholders:', ""At year-end, Berkshire owned 27.8% of Occidental Petroleum's common shares and also owned warrants that, for more than five years, give us the option to materially increase our ownership at a fixed price. Though we very much like our ownership, as well as the option, Berkshire has no interest in purchasing or managing Occidental. We particularly like its vast oil and gas holdings in the United States, as well as its leadership in carbon-capture initiatives, though the economic feasibility of this technique has yet to be proven. Both of these activities are very much in our country's interest."", ""He then spent the next few paragraphs discussing the shale revolution, U.S. energy independence, and why the oil and gas industry is good for America. He also praised Oxy's management."", ""Under Vicki Hollub's leadership, Occidental is doing the right things for both its country and its owners. No one knows what oil prices will do over the next month, year, or decade. But Vicki does know how to separate oil from rock, and that's an uncommon talent, valuable to her shareholders and to her country."", ""In sum, Buffett likes being a participant in Oxy but not necessarily managing the business. The hands-off approach makes sense once factoring in Berkshire's total holdings."", ""Oxy is the sixth-largest public equity holding in Berkshire's portfolio. The fifth-largest is Chevron. Also, as a newcomer, the position has been built up in less than four years. In fact, Chevron was the only significant stock purchase Berkshire made in the fourth quarter of 2023 -- besides repurchasing Berkshire Hathaway shares. Berkshire increased its Chevron stake by 14.4%, marking the first time Berkshire bought the stock in over a year. Berkshire now owns 6.8% of Chevron."", ""Combined, Berkshire's stakes in Chevron and Oxy are worth over $34 billion, nearly as much as Berkshire's second-largest public equity holding -- Bank of America. Yet Berkshire's true exposure to energy extends far beyond that through its 92% stake in Berkshire Hathaway Energy (BHE). It's hard to put a price tag on BHE, but some estimates say it is worth $90 billion."", ""Analyzing Oxy within the context of Berkshire's overall exposure to oil and gas and utilities, particularly in conjunction with its Chevron stake, makes it easier to understand why Berkshire doesn't want to go full throttle and buy out Oxy."", ""Not only is Oxy a smaller company than many of Berkshire's other top holdings, but it is also far riskier. Oxy is known for supporting an expensive capital spending program, leveraging its balance sheet with debt to accelerate growth or afford an acquisition, and being extremely optimistic about the output of the Permian Basin in West Texas and Eastern New Mexico."", ""CEO Vicki Hollub has been a somewhat controversial executive. In retrospect, Oxy's purchase of Anadarko Petroleum in 2019 (when it outbid Chevron) was a bad deal, especially considering how much cheaper it would have been to buy Anadarko in the years that followed. But the deal and leverage helped Oxy post a phenomenal performance in 2022 and, to a lesser extent, 2023."", 'The outperformance allowed Oxy to pay down debt and improve its balance sheet. But in December, Oxy announced it would buy Permian producer CrownRock L.P. with, you guessed it, mostly debt.', ""Hollub's ultra-aggressive style in a cyclical and highly volatile industry couldn't be more different than stodgy Buffett stocks like Coca-Cola. By comparison, Chevron has an incredible balance sheet with barely any debt for its size and a diversified business that spans more than just upstream production."", ""Berkshire's notable increase in its Chevron stake, paired with Buffett's statement that Berkshire isn't interested in buying out Oxy, showcases that Berkshire is bullish on U.S. oil and gas, just not solely through the lens of an aggressive upstream producer."", 'I could see Berkshire simply holding its existing Oxy stake and slowly increasing its stake in Chevron, another major, or maybe even another Permian producer like ConocoPhillips or EOG Resources.', ""The headline news may indicate that Berkshire isn't bullish on Oxy or oil and gas. But once we dig deeper into the inner workings of the overall portfolio, it becomes more apparent that the decision isn't so much about the industry as it is about position sizing and allocation."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Occidental Petroleum right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Occidental Petroleum, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Occidental Petroleum wasn’t one of them.

Whereas the benchmark S&P 500 has delivered a total return, including dividends, of a little north of 33,000% since the ""Oracle of Omaha"" took over as CEO in the mid-1960s, Berkshire\'s Class A shares (BRK.A) have galloped higher by an aggregate of more than 5,000,000% as of the closing bell on Feb. 28, 2024! An outperformance of this magnitude is going to get you noticed by professional and retail investors.', ""Warren Buffett's phenomenal track record is a big reason why there's a buzz surrounding Berkshire Hathaway every time the company files Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A 13F gives investors an over-the-shoulder look at what Wall Street's greatest money managers have been buying and selling, and is a required quarterly filing for institutions and investors with at least $100 million in assets under management."", ""Throughout 2023, the Oracle of Omaha and his investment aides, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, were very selective about their purchases. One core holding that's continued to see somewhat regular additions is energy stock Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY)."", ""Accounting for Berkshire's latest share purchases during the first week of February, Buffett's company has gobbled up more than 248 million shares of Occidental Petroleum since the start of 2022. That's a roughly $15 billion position, with $34 billion, in total, devoted to energy stocks, including Berkshire's position in Chevron."", ""Having 9% of Berkshire's invested assets tied up in two integrated oil and gas stocks is a pretty clear message that the company's brightest minds anticipate crude oil prices will remain elevated for an extended period. With the global supply of oil remaining tight following years of capital underinvestment tied to the COVID-19 pandemic, there's a real possibility the spot price of crude oil heads even higher."", ""What makes Occidental Petroleum an intriguing investment in the energy arena is its revenue breakdown. Despite being an integrated operator that generates some of its revenue from downstream chemical plants, Occidental derives the lion's share of its sales from drilling. If the spot price of crude oil climbs, it'll benefit more than virtually any other integrated oil and gas company."", ""Beyond Occidental, we've also seen Warren Buffett and his team piling back into satellite-radio operator Sirius XM Holdings (NASDAQ: SIRI). Though radio operators are often highly dependent on advertising revenue to keep the lights on, Sirius XM has an assortment of competitive advantages working in its favor that should help it navigate any economic climate better than terrestrial and online radio companies."", ""To start with the obvious, Sirius XM is the only licensed satellite-radio operator. While this doesn't mean it's free of competition for listeners, it does give the company reasonably strong subscription-pricing power."", ""What's arguably even more important with Sirius XM is how the company generates revenue. Whereas terrestrial and online radio providers are reliant on advertising revenue, only 20% of Sirius XM's sales came from advertising in 2023. Meanwhile, a whopping 77% of Sirius XM's revenue can be traced to subscriptions. Subscribers are less likely to cancel their service during an economic downturn than businesses are to meaningfully pare back their advertising budgets."", 'Sirius XM is also historically cheap. Shares are currently trading for a multiple of 13 times forward-year earnings, which is a 32% discount to its average forward-year earnings multiple over the trailing five-year period.', ""Although Berkshire's 13Fs have told an interesting story for more than a year -- Buffett and his team have been net sellers of equities for the past five quarters -- it's what's not in Berkshire's 13Fs that's an even bigger deal."", ""Warren Buffett's favorite stock to buy isn't Apple, Occidental Petroleum, or any of the nearly four dozen securities currently listed in Berkshire's quarterly filed 13F. The only way to find this mystery stock that the Oracle of Omaha can't stop buying is to dig into his company's operating results. That's where you'll find the quarterly share-repurchase activity, because Warren Buffett's favorite stock to buy is none other than shares of his own company! Don't you love a good plot twist?"", ""Prior to July 2018, the rules governing Berkshire's share-buyback program didn't allow its then-dynamic duo of Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger to get off the proverbial bench. Repurchases could only be undertaken if Berkshire's share price fell to or below 120% of book value (i.e., no more than 20% above its listed book value, as of the end of the latest quarter). Because Berkshire's share price never fell to or below this preset threshold, no buybacks were undertaken for years."", 'On July 17, 2018, everything changed for Buffett, Berkshire, and the company\'s shareholders. The company\'s board amended the buyback rules to allow their star players to ""get in the game."" As long as Berkshire holds at least $30 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries on its balance sheet, and Buffett and Munger agreed that their company\'s stock was intrinsically cheap, buybacks could commence without a ceiling.', ""During the December-ended quarter, Berkshire retired 3,623 shares of Class A stock and 660,585 shares of Class B stock (BRK.B) at a total cost of $2,147,823,075! This marked the 22nd consecutive quarter that Buffett's company has repurchased its own stock, and it brought the grand total of buybacks since July 2018 to more than $74 billion. To put this into context, Buffett and the late Charlie Munger spent roughly twice as much buying Berkshire stock compared to how much they spent purchasing shares of Apple."", ""Since Berkshire Hathaway doesn't pay a dividend, share repurchases are the direct way Warren Buffett and his investment team can reward investors who align with their long-term vision. Steadily buying back stock should increase the ownership stakes of the company's shareholders."", 'Furthermore, businesses like Berkshire Hathaway that tend to grow their operating income over time should enjoy a hearty boost to their earnings per share as their outstanding share count declines. This is only going to make the stock more attractive to fundamentally focused investors.', ""Buying back tens of billions in his own company's stock is also a pretty clear indication that Buffett is betting on himself and the business he, Munger, Combs, and Weschler have built to succeed over the long run."", ""With a record $167.6 billion in cash on hand and few, if any, values piquing the interest of the Oracle of Omaha and his team, look for repurchases of Warren Buffett's favorite stock to continue throughout the first quarter (and likely well beyond)."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

A value investor at heart, his shrewd business sense and calm during market corrections have rewarded Berkshire Hathaway\xa0shareholders handsomely.', ""One ingredient to Berkshire's secret sauce is simply finding good companies and holding them over time. Here's the reasoning behind Berkshire holding Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and American Express (NYSE: AXP) for over 30 years and the value in finding quality dividend stocks and holding them over multi-decade periods."", 'Berkshire first bought Coca-Cola in 1988 and American Express a few years later in the early 1990s. Buffett and his team purchased both stocks in stages. Still, both companies have produced a higher total return than the S&P 500 since 1988 and have made their investors phenomenally wealthy.', ""Today, Berkshire Hathaway's American Express and Coca-Cola positions are worth over $57 billion. But Berkshire's cost basis on both stocks is just a few billion combined. Both companies have been above-average investments but not exceptional ones."", 'As Buffett wrote in his 2023 annual letter, discussing the qualities that make good dividend stocks, why American Express and Coca-Cola have worked well for Buffett, and why sticking with a good company over time is the easiest way to compound wealth: ""The lesson from Coke and AMEX? When you find a truly wonderful business, stick with it. Patience pays, and one wonderful business can offset the many mediocre decisions that are inevitable.""', 'The performance shows the impact of patience and how buying and holding quality companies over a multi-decade time frame can produce excellent returns.', 'The S&P 500 has produced an average annual return of 10.2% over the last three decades. Although the annual returns tend to be far above or below 10% in a given year, the 10% base of reference is still good to know.', ""You may be surprised to learn that $100 invested at a compound annual growth rate of 10.2% for 35 years will increase by -- wait for it -- 30-fold to $3,000. This is more or less what has happened with Berkshire's American Express and Coke positions. It's not so much about the return as it is about time."", ""If you wanted to increase your investment by 30-fold in just 10 years, you'd have to average a return of over 40% per year. And that assumes consistently huge gains and no losses -- which is unrealistic.\xa0The key takeaway is that regular saving and giving investments time to grow can turn a good company into an engine for powering generational wealth."", ""If you go back and read the last few years of shareholder letters, you'll notice a common theme: Buffett loves a strong business that grows its dividend and buys back its stock. You can see this dynamic at play in the following chart."", ""American Express, Coke, and Apple\xa0have all repurchased a lot of stock and raised their dividends significantly. This X pattern is what you'll want to look for when it comes to buybacks and dividends."", ""One reason Buffett hasn't felt pressured to buy more shares of American Express and Coke in recent years is because of buybacks. Today, Berkshire owns 20.9% of American Express and 9.3% of Coke. But it hasn't always been that high of a stake."", 'For instance, American Express has reduced its share count by 31.7% over the last 10 years from about 1.06 billion shares outstanding to 724 million. With about 152 million shares, Berkshire owned just 14.3% of American Express 10 years ago.', 'American Express has repurchased its shares but from other investors and not Berkshire. So, with fewer shares to go around, Berkshire has managed to increase its stake in the company without buying more shares -- not to mention collecting billions in dividend income in the process.', ""Buffett has made the same argument for why Berkshire isn't in a rush to boost its Apple stake. Today, Berkshire owns 5.9% of Apple. But at the rate Apple buys back its stock, Berkshire could eventually own 7% or even 8% of the company 10 years from now without buying another share."", ""Berkshire has invested far more capital in newer holdings, like Occidental Petroleum and Chevron, than in Coke or American Express. Coke and American Express are staple holdings in Berkshire's portfolio, not because Berkshire invested a ton in either company but because it was patient enough to hold these stocks over time."", ""Now, it's worth mentioning that you shouldn't expect the same returns from these companies going forward. When Buffett bought these stocks, there was far more uncertainty. Today, Coke, American Express, Chevron, Apple, and other Berkshire holdings are all components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The story has largely been told, so the monster gains are in the past."", ""Replicating Buffett's success with both companies would take finding a smaller business with a multi-decade runway for organic growth and dividend growth. Investors who don't need explosive gains may do well to invest in proven companies. The Dow and Berkshire's holdings are excellent places to start if you're looking for ideas."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

The payment will take the dividend yield to 3.3%, which is in line with the average for the industry."", ' See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola ', ""Unless the payments are sustainable, the dividend yield doesn't mean too much. Prior to this announcement, Coca-Cola was paying out 74% of earnings and more than 75% of free cash flows. This is usually an indication that the focus of the company is returning cash to shareholders rather than reinvesting it for growth."", 'The next year is set to see EPS grow by 27.6%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 62% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.', 'The company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2014, the annual payment back then was $1.12, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $1.94. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 5.6% a year over that time. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.', 'Investors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. We are encouraged to see that Coca-Cola has grown earnings per share at 10% per year over the past five years. The payout ratio is very much on the higher end, which could mean that the growth rate will slow down in the future, and that could flow through to the dividend as well.', ""In summary, it's great to see that the company can raise the dividend and keep it in a sustainable range. The payments look okay by most measures, the lack of cash flow could definitely cause problems for them in the future. Taking all of this into consideration, the dividend looks viable moving forward, but investors should be mindful that the company has pushed the boundaries of sustainability in the past and may do so again."", ""Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. As an example, we've identified 2 warning signs for Coca-Cola that you should be aware of before investing.

For a quick glimpse, these charts tell part of the story."", ""Coca-Cola stock wasn't performing well because the company wasn't. It got a new CEO in 2017, and it took a few years and a global pandemic for it to make the right corrections and get back on track. Actually, just prior to COVID-19, as you can see, it began to turn around."", 'Sales plummeted again, but Coca-Cola made some major structural changes as the pandemic landed. It restructured its operating groups and slashed its brand portfolio from 400 to 200 brands. Those were bold actions, and they have led to incredible results.

Owning these stocks offers the opportunity for solid long-term total returns because of the steady, increasing payouts.', 'However, even among the aristocrats, there are some that are more regal than others. This has nothing to do with the amount of years of dividend growth under a particular company’s belt. There are plenty of not only mere “aristocrats,” but “dividend kings” (stocks with over 50 years of consecutive dividend growth) as well as questionable dividend growth prospects.', 'A prime example is 3M (NYSE:MMM). As I have discussed previously, following the settlement of billions worth of litigation, plus other headwinds like persistent weak growth, a dividend cut may be in its future. With this, the key to steady, growing payouts in the long haul may entail finding the aristocrats with the best chances of maintaining their royal status.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'That’s the situation here, with these seven dividend stocks.', 'Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock', 'Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP), best known for being the world’s leading payroll processing company, is a top choice among blue-chips with dividend quality and growth potential. Not only is the business services firm in the “dividend aristocrats” category.', 'Over the past five years, dividends for ADP stock have increased by an average of 12.96% annually. While the stock’s 2.19% forward yield may look tiny in a high-interest environment, this payout is likely to grow considerably over time. At least, earnings forecasts for Automatic Data Processing.', 'These call for the company’s earnings to increase by more than 30% this fiscal year (ending June 2024), and by another 9.52% during the next fiscal year. Besides pointing to higher payouts, steady earnings growth also points to further price appreciation. In turn, leading to strong potential for above-average total returns from buying/holding this stock.', 'Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com', 'With a 63-year track record of dividend growth, Cincinnati Financial (NASDAQ:CINF) is up there with 3M, as one of the “kings” among dividend stocks. However, unlike the possibly-threatened dividend of the aforementioned industrial conglomerate, payout growth from this property & casualty insurer is likely sustainable.', 'Forecasts for CINF stock call for the insurer to report earnings growth in the high single-digit/low-teens range over the next two years. This is in line with Cincinnati Financial’s average annual dividend growth over the past five years (7.19%). Trading for 17.9 times forward earnings, a fair valuation for a property & casualty insurer, CINF may not be in the running to experience much earnings multiple expansion.', 'That said, shares could still appreciate in value, in tandem with increased earnings. This, coupled with the dividend (currently giving CINF a 2.87% forward yield), could result in satisfactory long-term total returns.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) is of course not the only consumer staples stock in the “dividend aristocrats” category. Yet while peers such as Clorox (NYSE:CLX) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) are also popular among long-term dividend investors, shares in this maker of products like its namesake toothpaste, Irish Spring soap, and household cleaner Ajax may be the better buy among the bunch.', 'Clorox has the highest forward yield among the three (3.14%, versus 2.23% for CL stock and 2.34% for PG). That said, issues like a post-Covid sales slump and the continued impact of last year’s cyber attack call into question Clorox’s dividend growth sustainability.', 'PG is similar to CL in terms of yield, its payout ratio, as well as in expected earnings growth. However, Colgate-Palmolive (at 24.6 times forward earnings) is slightly cheaper than Procter & Gamble (which trades for 25.1 times forward earnings).', 'Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com', 'Long-term dividend stocks are usually defensive stocks, but in the case of General Dynamics (NYSE:GD), it’s a defensive stock in the defense industry. General Dynamics has a 29 year dividend growth track record. The current geopolitical environment strongly suggests this streak will continue.', 'Irrespective of how the global economy fares in 2024, one thing is certain. There’s little end in sight to conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. New conflicts could emerge in Africa and Asia. Expect continued strong results for General Dynamics in the years ahead, as the U.S. keeps spending heavily on defense in light of this strife.', 'GD stock has a forward dividend yield of only 1.93%, but payouts have increased by an average of 7.26% per year over the past five years. The forecasts predict earnings will increase by 22% this year and by 12.2% in 2025.', 'Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com', 'Illinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW) is a name I’ve discussed previously, in coverage of the best long-term “buy and hold” stocks. Largely, because of the industrial conglomerate’s dividend growth history. Besides being an “aristocrat,” ITW has increased its payout at a high single-digit clip (8.77% annually on average) over the past five years.', 'This dividend (2.15% at current prices) provides a steady baseline of returns for ITW stock investors. Some in the sell-side community has soured on Illinois Tool Works as of late. Over the past month, analysts at BofA and Wells Fargo have both downgraded ITW to “underweight.”', 'Challenges like weak demand and falling margins may persist for now. Even so, as macro factors like inflation and interest rates normalize, ITW could soon get back on track, in terms of earnings growth. Earnings and dividend growth will help drive a move to higher prices for shares.', 'Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com', 'With the management of Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) strongly committed to return-of-capital efforts, it’s no surprise that this is one of the top dividend stocks. A “dividend king,” with 60 years of consecutive dividend growth, the most recent payout increased happened last May.', 'The company increased its dividend by 5%. Currently paying investors $1.10 per share annually in dividends, LOW stock has a forward yield of 1.89%. There’s a good reason I kicked off discussion about Lowe’s by mentioning “return of capital.” Besides steady, ever-growing dividends, Lowe’s has since late 2022 been buying back stock, as part of a $15 billion share repurchase program.', 'In terms of company-specific catalysts, factors like a rebound in housing demand may positively affect Lowe’s fiscal performance in the future. JP Morgan’s Christopher Horvers recently noted this in an upgrade of the stock.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Realty Income (NYSE:O) is one of the few real estate investment trusts that’s in the “dividend aristocrats” category. For 25 years in a row, the self-proclaimed “Monthly Dividend Company” has increased its payout rate, which currently stands at $3.08 per share annually (5.81% forward yield).', 'Admittedly, cash dividends for O stock have only increased by a low-to-mid single-digit percentage, but over time, these increases have a big impact on long-term returns. In the near-term, there’s a catalyst that could have a major impact on Realty Income’s valuation: the expected lowering of interest rates.', 'Uncertainty above the Federal Reserve’s so-called “pivot” has weighed on O shares since the start of the year, as I noted earlier this month. However, with lower rates still more of a matter of “when” then “if,” you may want to enter a long-term position ahead of a resurgence in rate cut confidence.', 'On the date of publication, Thomas Niel\xa0did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.', 'ChatGPT IPO Could Shock the World, Make This Move Before the Announcement', '“America’s Top Trader” Issues A.I.

While that might not seem a big deal, compare it with fellow industrial giant 3M, whose investors are still in the dark over many details over the guidance of the remaining 3M company and its forthcoming healthcare spinoff, Solventum.', 'In a nutshell, GE expects another year of double-digit revenue growth at GE Aerospace and mid-teens profit growth, excluding corporate and standalone costs resulting from the spinoff.', 'Meanwhile, GE Vernova is expected to generate free cash flow in 2024, with two of its three segments -- power and electrification -- continuing to contribute solid profit, while the wind power business works through less profitable legacy contracts in offshore wind, having already returned the onshore wind business to profitability.', ""Culp's tenure began in October 2018, and the company's share price has doubled since then. In addition, management has achieved its aim of breaking up and delivering three businesses with investment-grade debt.

Owning these stocks offers the opportunity for solid long-term total returns because of the steady, increasing payouts.', 'However, even among the aristocrats, there are some that are more regal than others. This has nothing to do with the amount of years of dividend growth under a particular company’s belt. There are plenty of not only mere “aristocrats,” but “dividend kings” (stocks with over 50 years of consecutive dividend growth) as well as questionable dividend growth prospects.', 'A prime example is 3M (NYSE:MMM). As I have discussed previously, following the settlement of billions worth of litigation, plus other headwinds like persistent weak growth, a dividend cut may be in its future. With this, the key to steady, growing payouts in the long haul may entail finding the aristocrats with the best chances of maintaining their royal status.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'That’s the situation here, with these seven dividend stocks.', 'Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock', 'Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP), best known for being the world’s leading payroll processing company, is a top choice among blue-chips with dividend quality and growth potential. Not only is the business services firm in the “dividend aristocrats” category.', 'Over the past five years, dividends for ADP stock have increased by an average of 12.96% annually. While the stock’s 2.19% forward yield may look tiny in a high-interest environment, this payout is likely to grow considerably over time. At least, earnings forecasts for Automatic Data Processing.', 'These call for the company’s earnings to increase by more than 30% this fiscal year (ending June 2024), and by another 9.52% during the next fiscal year. Besides pointing to higher payouts, steady earnings growth also points to further price appreciation. In turn, leading to strong potential for above-average total returns from buying/holding this stock.', 'Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com', 'With a 63-year track record of dividend growth, Cincinnati Financial (NASDAQ:CINF) is up there with 3M, as one of the “kings” among dividend stocks. However, unlike the possibly-threatened dividend of the aforementioned industrial conglomerate, payout growth from this property & casualty insurer is likely sustainable.', 'Forecasts for CINF stock call for the insurer to report earnings growth in the high single-digit/low-teens range over the next two years. This is in line with Cincinnati Financial’s average annual dividend growth over the past five years (7.19%). Trading for 17.9 times forward earnings, a fair valuation for a property & casualty insurer, CINF may not be in the running to experience much earnings multiple expansion.', 'That said, shares could still appreciate in value, in tandem with increased earnings. This, coupled with the dividend (currently giving CINF a 2.87% forward yield), could result in satisfactory long-term total returns.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) is of course not the only consumer staples stock in the “dividend aristocrats” category. Yet while peers such as Clorox (NYSE:CLX) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) are also popular among long-term dividend investors, shares in this maker of products like its namesake toothpaste, Irish Spring soap, and household cleaner Ajax may be the better buy among the bunch.', 'Clorox has the highest forward yield among the three (3.14%, versus 2.23% for CL stock and 2.34% for PG). That said, issues like a post-Covid sales slump and the continued impact of last year’s cyber attack call into question Clorox’s dividend growth sustainability.', 'PG is similar to CL in terms of yield, its payout ratio, as well as in expected earnings growth. However, Colgate-Palmolive (at 24.6 times forward earnings) is slightly cheaper than Procter & Gamble (which trades for 25.1 times forward earnings).', 'Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com', 'Long-term dividend stocks are usually defensive stocks, but in the case of General Dynamics (NYSE:GD), it’s a defensive stock in the defense industry. General Dynamics has a 29 year dividend growth track record. The current geopolitical environment strongly suggests this streak will continue.', 'Irrespective of how the global economy fares in 2024, one thing is certain. There’s little end in sight to conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. New conflicts could emerge in Africa and Asia. Expect continued strong results for General Dynamics in the years ahead, as the U.S. keeps spending heavily on defense in light of this strife.', 'GD stock has a forward dividend yield of only 1.93%, but payouts have increased by an average of 7.26% per year over the past five years. The forecasts predict earnings will increase by 22% this year and by 12.2% in 2025.', 'Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com', 'Illinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW) is a name I’ve discussed previously, in coverage of the best long-term “buy and hold” stocks. Largely, because of the industrial conglomerate’s dividend growth history. Besides being an “aristocrat,” ITW has increased its payout at a high single-digit clip (8.77% annually on average) over the past five years.', 'This dividend (2.15% at current prices) provides a steady baseline of returns for ITW stock investors. Some in the sell-side community has soured on Illinois Tool Works as of late. Over the past month, analysts at BofA and Wells Fargo have both downgraded ITW to “underweight.”', 'Challenges like weak demand and falling margins may persist for now. Even so, as macro factors like inflation and interest rates normalize, ITW could soon get back on track, in terms of earnings growth. Earnings and dividend growth will help drive a move to higher prices for shares.', 'Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com', 'With the management of Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) strongly committed to return-of-capital efforts, it’s no surprise that this is one of the top dividend stocks. A “dividend king,” with 60 years of consecutive dividend growth, the most recent payout increased happened last May.', 'The company increased its dividend by 5%. Currently paying investors $1.10 per share annually in dividends, LOW stock has a forward yield of 1.89%. There’s a good reason I kicked off discussion about Lowe’s by mentioning “return of capital.” Besides steady, ever-growing dividends, Lowe’s has since late 2022 been buying back stock, as part of a $15 billion share repurchase program.', 'In terms of company-specific catalysts, factors like a rebound in housing demand may positively affect Lowe’s fiscal performance in the future. JP Morgan’s Christopher Horvers recently noted this in an upgrade of the stock.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Realty Income (NYSE:O) is one of the few real estate investment trusts that’s in the “dividend aristocrats” category. For 25 years in a row, the self-proclaimed “Monthly Dividend Company” has increased its payout rate, which currently stands at $3.08 per share annually (5.81% forward yield).', 'Admittedly, cash dividends for O stock have only increased by a low-to-mid single-digit percentage, but over time, these increases have a big impact on long-term returns. In the near-term, there’s a catalyst that could have a major impact on Realty Income’s valuation: the expected lowering of interest rates.', 'Uncertainty above the Federal Reserve’s so-called “pivot” has weighed on O shares since the start of the year, as I noted earlier this month. However, with lower rates still more of a matter of “when” then “if,” you may want to enter a long-term position ahead of a resurgence in rate cut confidence.', 'On the date of publication, Thomas Niel\xa0did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.', 'ChatGPT IPO Could Shock the World, Make This Move Before the Announcement', '“America’s Top Trader” Issues A.I.

But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. One great example is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) which saw its share price drive 139% higher over five years. It's also good to see the share price up 20% over the last quarter. But this move may well have been assisted by the reasonably buoyant market (up 12% in 90 days)."", ""So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns."", ' See our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals ', 'While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.', ""During five years of share price growth, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 10% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 19% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth."", ""The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers)."", ""It's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. This free interactive report on Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further."", ""Regeneron Pharmaceuticals shareholders have received returns of 26% over twelve months, which isn't far from the general market return. Most would be happy with a gain, and it helps that the year's return is actually better than the average return over five years, which was 19%. Even if the share price growth slows down from here, there's a good chance that this is business worth watching in the long term.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. That's why when we briefly looked at Quest Diagnostics' (NYSE:DGX) ROCE trend, we were pretty happy with what we saw."", ""Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Quest Diagnostics, this is the formula:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.11 = US$1.3b ÷ (US$14b - US$1.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""So, Quest Diagnostics has an ROCE of 11%.  That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 10% generated by the Healthcare industry."", ' See our latest analysis for Quest Diagnostics ', ""In the above chart we have measured Quest Diagnostics' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Quest Diagnostics ."", ""While the returns on capital are good, they haven't moved much. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 11% and the business has deployed 28% more capital into its operations. 11% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that Quest Diagnostics has consistently earned this amount. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders."", ""The main thing to remember is that Quest Diagnostics has proven its ability to continually reinvest at respectable rates of return. Therefore it's no surprise that shareholders have earned a respectable 62% return if they held over the last five years. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further."", ""Quest Diagnostics does have some risks though, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Quest Diagnostics  that you might be interested in."", ""While Quest Diagnostics may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.
