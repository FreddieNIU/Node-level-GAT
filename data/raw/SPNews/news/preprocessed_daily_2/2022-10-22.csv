Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Verisk Analytics (NASDAQ:VRSK). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. Check out our latest analysis for Verisk Analytics How Fast Is Verisk Analytics Growing?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. It certainly is nice to see that Verisk Analytics has managed to grow EPS by 22% per year over three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away satisfied.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Verisk Analytics shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 36% to 38%, and revenue is growing. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Verisk Analytics?Story continuesAre Verisk Analytics Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Verisk Analytics has a market capitalisation of US$26b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$244m. We note that this amounts to 0.9% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Verisk Analytics but it's still worth mentioning. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.While it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. Our quick analysis into CEO remuneration would seem to indicate they are. For companies with market capitalisations over US$8.0b, like Verisk Analytics, the median CEO pay is around US$13m.The Verisk Analytics CEO received total compensation of just US$3.9m in the year to December 2021. That's clearly well below average, so at a glance that arrangement seems generous to shareholders and points to a modest remuneration culture. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.Is Verisk Analytics Worth Keeping An Eye On?You can't deny that Verisk Analytics has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. If you still have your doubts, remember too that company insiders have a considerable investment aligning themselves with the shareholders and CEO pay is quite modest compared to similarly sized companiess. The overarching message here is that Verisk Analytics has underlying strengths that make it worth a look at. It's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 3 warning signs  with Verisk Analytics (at least 1 which is a bit concerning)  , and understanding these should be part of your investment process.Although Verisk Analytics certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares. If you like to see insider buying, then this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying, could be exactly what you're looking for.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the elevated P/E.With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Charles Schwab has been doing relatively well. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. Check out our latest analysis for Charles Schwab peKeen to find out how analysts think Charles Schwab's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Is There Enough Growth For Charles Schwab?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as high as Charles Schwab's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 25%. The latest three year period has also seen a 22% overall rise in EPS, aided extensively by its short-term performance. So we can start by confirming that the company has actually done a good job of growing earnings over that time.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 18% per annum during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. With the market only predicted to deliver 9.3% each year, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.With this information, we can see why Charles Schwab is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.The Key TakeawayGenerally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.Story continuesWe've established that Charles Schwab maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.Before you take the next step, you should know about the 1 warning sign for Charles Schwab that we have uncovered.Of course, you might also be able to find a better stock than Charles Schwab. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that sit on P/E's below 20x and have grown earnings strongly.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?

5,f1ddb8d9-48d6-38f2-ba31-8b0e5f3c9802,TXN,2022-10-22,October Stock Picks: 7 Chip Stocks to Buy on Dips,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/october-stock-picks-7-chip-023357076.html,1666146837,STORY,"['TXN', 'QCOM', 'LRCX', 'AMAT', 'INTC', 'CAMT']","[Technology stocks have been battered and bruised in 2022, with the Nasdaq down 32% year to date. As bad as that is, semiconductor stocks have easily outpaced the downturn in the broader tech sector, with the PHLX Semiconductor Index falling 44% so far this year. However, unlike some high-flying tech stocks that had no basis for their lofty valuations, the companies that make semiconductor chips and equipment are vital to the economy. Their products are the basis of the world as we know it. Of course, that’s not to say their share prices can’t go lower from here. With this in mind, today I have seven chip stocks to buy on dips.The short-term outlook for semiconductor stocks remains challenging, with companies facing demand issues, as well as higher costs. Yet, a few recent developments bode well for the sector longer term.The first is the passage of the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, which “provides $52.7 billion for American semiconductor research, development, manufacturing, and workforce development.” The bill has already spurred some major semiconductor companies to announce plans to expand manufacturing in the U.S.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMore recently, the Biden administration announced export controls that will greatly impede the ability of Chinese tech firms to buy semiconductor-making equipment, technology and software from American vendors. Chinese officials have complained this will quash the chip industry there, stifling China’s ability to innovate in areas such as autonomous vehicles and genetic sequencing. However, China’s loss could be America’s gain.These seven chip stocks to buy are particularly well-positioned given the renewed focus on the domestic semiconductor industry.TXNTexas Instruments$151.51LRCXLam Research$322.06AMATApplied Materials$75.23QCOMQualcomm$111.21CAMTCamtek$21.96INTCIntel$25.87MUMicron Technology$52.55Texas Instruments (TXN)Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comStory continuesTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is your classic sleep-well-at-night chip stock. The firm is incredibly resilient due to its differentiated business model. Instead of chasing fast-moving semiconductor markets like chips for consumer electronics, Texas Instruments has built its business around slower-moving analog semiconductors.These are chips that process real-world information and turn it into data. They are vital for applications such as autonomous driving, remote monitoring and internet of things devices. Texas Instruments has a catalog of around 80,000 products, which covers tons of application-specific niches. Because of this, the firm has created a business that is recession-resistant and not particularly tied to any specific product or technology trend.Texas Instruments is also a shareholder-friendly operation. Management prioritizes growing free cash flow per share above all else. This has allowed the company to give tons of cash back to shareholders via its dividend and sizable share repurchase program.TXN stock currently trades for less than 17 times forward earnings and offers a solid 3.3% dividend yield.Lam Research (LRCX)Lam Research sign and logo at semiconductor company Lam Research Corporation headquarters in Silicon Valley. LRCX StockSource: Michael Vi / ShutterstockLam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) is a semiconductor equipment maker that currently commands about 10% of the market. The stock performed well over the long term as the company capitalized on the rapid growth of the global semiconductor market.Shares are down sharply over the past month, thanks in large part to the new China export restrictions. A significant portion of Lam’s overall revenue comes from China. Thus, Lam may face a short-term hit from the Biden administration’s new policy.Over the longer term, though, Lam could benefit from these changes. After all, demand for semiconductors is unlikely to fall given current technological trends. Lam can earn similar profits selling to vendors in China as ones based out of Europe or North America. Meanwhile, efforts to slow China’s semiconductor industry growth should, over time, create a bigger moat for Lam’s own products and intellectual property.Following a 55% year-to-date decline in LRCX stock, shares now trade for just 8.6 times forward earnings.Applied Materials (AMAT)Applied Materials company sign outside officeSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.comApplied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) is a direct rival to Lam Research and, thus, faces many of the same challenges and opportunities. This summer, AMAT stock sold off on worries about a cyclical downturn in chip demand and competition from China undercutting Applied Materials’ prices. The CHIPS and Science Act seemed like a clear positive for American semiconductor companies like Applied Materials, but some analysts feared it would be too little, too late in terms of stemming the competitive tide from cheaper overseas vendors.Now that the Biden administration has upped the ante with far-stricter export restrictions, this should greatly slow competition from China. Ironically enough, AMAT stock sold off on the news as investors worried about the short-term revenue hit from not selling to Chinese firms. However, over the longer term, the renewed focus on American manufacturing in this industry is a positive for the company.Investors’ reaction illustrates a larger issue in the chips sector right now. Lately, it seems all news is bad news for chips stocks. Competition from overseas? That’s bad. Government efforts to slow down that competition? Apparently also bad. It’s as if traders are using any excuse to sell chips stocks. When the tide turns, however, there will be a tremendous revaluing of core semiconductor names such as Applied Materials.After dropping by 52% this year, AMAT stock is now selling for just 10.2 times forward earnings.Qualcomm (QCOM)Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on a large sign with another sign that says 5GSource: Xixi Fu / Shutterstock.comQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) has built its business around mobile communications ecosystems. The company is a leader in the design and intellectual property around 3G and 4G and has earned hefty licensing fees from handset makers for its technology.Qualcomm continues to bring in tons of revenue from its work in these areas, and the company has defended its patents in court to ensure that the money keeps coming in. However, the company isn’t resting on its laurels.Qualcomm is at the center of 5G rollouts. It’s developed its own chips like Snapdragon for high-end applications such as newer Android phones. The firm is also broadening its reach beyond smartphones, with moves into connected cars and the internet of things.With shares down 40% year to date, QCOM stock is selling for 8.6 times forward earnings. That will look like a bargain once the current sector slump starts to let up.Camtek (CAMT)Camtek Ltd logo visible on display screen.Source: Pavel Kapysh via shutterstockCamtek (NASDAQ:CAMT) is an Israeli company with a global footprint that offers high-end inspection and metrology equipment to the semiconductor industry. When semiconductor companies are building or expanding fabrication facilities, they need to ensure that everything is in perfect working order. Even the tiniest defect or a poorly calibrated machine can render expensive semiconductor materials worthless. With the shortages in the semiconductor supply chain, avoiding waste has become more important than ever.This has put Camtek in a great position. The company has grown revenue from $93 million in 2017 to an estimated $322 million in 2022. Meanwhile, shares are up 284% over the past five years, and that includes the 52% drop in 2022.Camtek is well-positioned in the coming years. The CHIPS Act will subsidize a lot of new semiconductor fabs in the United States. These new facilities will need testing and inspection equipment, and Camtek should be able to find a leading role in filling that demand.Intel (INTC)Close up of Intel sign at their San Jose campus in Silicon ValleySource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock has lost half of its value so far this year. That’s an incredible decline for such a dominant blue-chip company.After a surge in personal computer sales during the pandemic, demand has now collapsed. Research firm Gartner reported a 19.5% decline in PC sales in Q3 versus the same period in 2021. This was the worst drop in two decades.Intel is still reliant on personal computing, along with the server and database market, to generate a large portion of its revenue. So the company’s profits, not surprisingly, are declining.However, the long-term outlook remains bright. Intel spends more than $15 billion annually on research and development, which allows it to remain in a leadership position in its core markets. It also invests heavily in growth initiatives, such as self-driving vehicle technology.After this year’s big decline in shares, INTC stock trades for 9.2 times forward earnings and offers a 5.5% dividend yield.Micron Technology (MU)mu stockSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) rounds out this list of chip socks to buy. A year ago, the company appeared to have turned the corner. The memory chip leader was producing tremendous earnings and appeared to have finally overcome the historical boom/bust cycle in the memory and storage industry.Fast forward a year, however, and things are currently looking grim. Micron is fresh off earning $8.35 per share for its fiscal 2022, which ended Sept. 1. That is a tremendous level of profitability for a company with a $53 share price. But those earnings aren’t set to last. Analysts are currently forecasting a stunning 96.5% drop in Micron’s current fiscal year earnings to just 29 cents per share. Partially as a result of this dismal outlook, shares are down 44% year to date.However, things aren’t as bad as they might seem. Many of the weaker players in the memory industry are merging with stronger companies or shutting down operations. The growth of consumer electronics, as an industry, has created more stable longer-term demand. Micron is going to have a rough 2023, no doubt, but analysts see earnings jumping back to $3.88 a share for fiscal 2024.That should be enough to get Micron shares trending in the right direction, especially since it is one of the more prominent beneficiaries of the CHIPS Act.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in QCOM, TXN and INTC stock.

(NYSE:TMO), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 89% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.And institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's share price fell by 4.6% last week. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 20% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. Hence, if weakness in Thermo Fisher Scientific's share price continues, institutional investors may feel compelled to sell the stock, which might not be ideal for individual investors.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Thermo Fisher Scientific. View our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Thermo Fisher Scientific?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Thermo Fisher Scientific already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Thermo Fisher Scientific's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Thermo Fisher Scientific. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.1% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.8% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.8% by the third-largest shareholder.A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 25 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Thermo Fisher ScientificThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$313m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 11% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Thermo Fisher Scientific. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company.

You step into the grocery store with a short list of essentials to pick up — and end up hauling home a trunk-load of goods and a floor-length receipt.With prices for goods continuing to rise across the country, you might be looking for ways to cut down on costs wherever you can.Don’t missAmericans are paying nearly 40% more on home insurance compared to 12 years ago — here's how to spend less on peace of mindCentibillionaire Jeff Bezos says don’t waste your money on a new car or household purchase: invest in these 3 better recession-proof buys insteadGoldman Sachs says bitcoin is not investable — they think you should put 33% of your wealth in this asset insteadAnd who could blame you? Consumer prices in January were 6.4% higher than they were a year ago, according to yesterday's report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Looking just at food, prices are up 10.1%.It's always a good idea to check sales flyers, start clipping coupons and do some price comparisons online, but you may be missing the obvious solution.While it might be more convenient to buy everything on your list in one go, you’re likely splurging on overpriced items at the grocery store when you can find them cheaper (or for free) elsewhere.We compared prices across several key brands and stores and sourced tips from money-saving experts for recommendations on how to cut down your grocery bill.Here’s a list of 21 items you shouldn’t buy at the grocery store and what you should be doing instead to make your budget go further.21. Greeting cardsA birthday card from the brand American Greetings can cost you as much as $7 at Kroger.com — but there’s no need to splurge on something fancy that will probably just get tossed in the trash later.“The cost has a lot more to do with the perceived value of the card,” Ginger McClesky, a manufacturer’s representative in the greeting card industry, told CBS Minnesota in 2017.Some greeting card companies tend to print on thicker cardstock and add features like music or letterpress, which may also up the price.Story continuesReader’s Digest recommends buying greeting cards at the dollar store — you may be able to get a two-for-$1 deal — or looking for generic card sets that you can use for any occasion.You can even consider crafting your own greeting cards or sending your loved one a free e-card instead.20. Beauty productsYou might find it more convenient to pick up your lipstick and mascara while also grabbing your potatoes and onions — but watch out for higher markups.For example, a L’Oréal Paris Color Riche lipstick costs over $12 at Kroger.com, but retails for almost half the price at Walmart.com. You may also see similar markups on skincare or haircare products.To save a few bucks, always check the flyers, wait for sales or use coupons at the drugstore or at department stores like Walmart.""From body lotion to shampoo and toothpaste, unless it's on sale, skip it. The best deals are offered at various drug stores like CVS (with coupons), Walmart, and even cheapest at dollar stores (makeup applicators, cotton swabs, shampoo, etc.),” consumer savings expert Andrea Woroch told PopSugar in 2016.19. Cooking toolsIf you just bought pancake mix and realized you don’t have a spatula at home, think again before running out to purchase one at the grocery store.“Those types of items are usually much cheaper at discount retailers like Walmart,” personal finance expert Rachel Cruze advises in Reader’s Digest.It may also be more cost effective to pick up a set rather than purchasing individual utensils.Voraciously by The Washington Post even recommends purchasing kitchen tools at restaurant supply stores for better quality and cheaper prices. These products are more likely to withstand damage, last longer and they often cost less because supply stores price their items to sell to businesses in bulk.18. Prepared meals@AZ.BLT / Twenty20Didn’t have time to pack a lunch for work the night before? You might be tempted to grab a ready-to-eat sandwich from your nearby grocery store.But while you’re saving yourself time and effort, you’re still paying more for the convenience of an already prepared meal.You could save up to 90% on items like deli meals and pre-made salads just by making them at home, says consumer savings expert Jill Caponera in Reader’s Digest.Savings like that may incentivize you to just hit up the grocery store in advance and buy your cold cuts, cheeses and bread separately.Pro tip: Schedule out time in your week for meal prep so you’re not scrambling to assemble a sandwich before work.17. Name-brand cerealsYou’re often overpaying for just the packaging design and advertising when you opt for the branded versions of your favorite cereals over the generic variety, says Kitchn.For example, you’ll fork over $4.28 for an 18-ounce box of Kellogg’s Corn Flakes at Walmart.com, but you can save more than half the cost by purchasing the store brand version instead.“Compare ingredients of name brand with generic — if the ingredients are the same, you won't taste much of a difference. In fact, most store labels (generic) are actually produced by the big-name brands,” Andrea Woroch told PopSugar. “This difference in packaging results in prices that are as much as 50% cheaper!”She adds that some stores may even offer a money-back guarantee on their own brands, in which case you can always keep the receipt and return the cereal if you’re dissatisfied with the taste.16. Pre-cut produceBuying your fruit and veggies in pre-cut chunks sure saves you the time (and cleanup) of chopping away at them yourself, but it will cost you more in the end.For example, an 8-ounce container of diced yellow onions costs $2.78 at Walmart.com, but you could pay around $2.38 for a three-pound bag of uncut yellow onions instead. There's similar markup on fruit: A whole watermelon costs about $4.68, but just two pounds of the pre-cut melon goes for over $8.“Generally speaking, I think that it’s better for most people to buy whole fruit from an economic standpoint; it’s going to be less expensive,” Max Lugavere, health and science journalist and author told HuffPost in 2021. “It’s going to be fresher, also.”Pre-cut produce typically comes packaged in plastic, too — which poses a serious environmental issue when that plastic ends up in a landfill.Consider taking an hour of your week to prep all your fruits and veggies in advance and avoid the hassle of doing it throughout the week. It’s an eco-friendly and cost-effective way to avoid splurging at the grocery store.15. DiapersIt’s tough being a new parent, and baby stuff can be expensive — diapers alone use up a big chunk of those funds.The exhausted parent making an emergency run to grab a box of nappies may simply not have the time to travel to a specific location or hunt for the best deal.But, save yourself the time (and money) by making your one stop at a big box store instead of the supermarket — check out warehouse clubs like Costco where you can buy them in bulk.You can also look out for coupons or sales, join loyalty rewards programs with popular diaper brands like Huggies and Pampers or sign up for Amazon Family, which allows you to get up to 20% off with a diaper subscription.Another option is to invest in cloth diapers — although The New York Times reports that there’s been some debate over their cost effectiveness and environmental benefit.14. Prepared meat@photovs / Twenty20We all love the convenience of pouring your marinated chicken right out of the package and into the oven. No need to prep hours in advance, no cleanup — it’s the ultimate ready-to-go meal at the end of a long work day.However, food magazine Kitchn says you might be paying up to 60% more when you purchase your meat pre-chopped or marinated.For example, at Walmart.com thin-sliced chicken breast retails for $4 per pound, but you’ll pay only about $3 per pound for a family-pack of unsliced chicken breast.Like the pre-cut produce, you can set aside time in the week to prep your meat in advance. If you’re looking for even more ways to save at the meat counter, Kitchn also suggests looking for marked-down meat that is nearing its sell-by date. Just be sure to cook or freeze it right away.13. Name-brand spicesSpices have one of the highest markups, as much as an eye-popping 100%, according to Woroch, so consider buying your pepper and paprika off-brand next time.""Seasonings and spices are another good bet for going generic, because the taste difference is minimal, but you'll also save a lot,"" personal finance writer David Bakke said in a 2016 CBS News article.While spices can certainly vary in quality, and it can be difficult to determine whether one spice brand is better than another, you don’t always need to opt for the expensive packages at the grocery store.You might also be able to save more by purchasing your spices whole and in bulk — these typically stay fresher longer than ground spices, as well.12. Baked goodsSure, the smell of freshly baked croissants and chocolate chip cookies wafting toward you when you step into the grocery store can be tantalizing.But Kitchn claims you can face markups of up to 300% on baked goods at the grocery store’s bakery counter. That’s a steep increase.Home cooking site Allrecipes also reports that some offerings at the in-house bakery aren’t prepared fresh and may be frozen in advance.If you don’t have the luxury of preparing your baked goods from scratch, consider buying a box of pre-made cake mix to whip up at home instead. Or, look for discounts on day-old items at the bakery — just be sure to check the expiry date.11. Bottled waterThis one isn’t specific to just grocery stores — think twice before you grab that bottle of water from any checkout line cooler. It might not take a lot out of your wallet at the moment, but it’ll add up over time.Reader’s Digest claims that bottled water can have a markup of as much as 4,000% — the site says a $2 water bottle costs manufacturers a mere 5 cents to produce.The CDC reports that over 90% of Americans have access to safe, potable water straight from their kitchen tap. If you don’t trust the source, you can also get a water filtration system to clear out any contaminants.If you’re only purchasing bottled water on the go, remember that disposable bottles are not only pricey — they’re also damaging to the environment. Invest in a reusable water bottle instead — glass, stainless steel or BPA-free plastic are ideal — and stop worrying about having to pay everytime you're thirsty while out and about.Read more: Earn extra cash this week with these quick money hacks10. Canned beansTY Lim / ShutterstockCanned beans are a filling and effortless addition to your dinner — but while you’ll save on soaking and preparation time, the dried variety is by far the more cost-effective option.Nutrition site The Bean Institute says a family of four that eats beans once a week could save almost $80 a year by choosing dry beans over a national brand of canned beans.For example, a 16-ounce bag of dried pinto beans costs $1.69 at Kroger, according to the store website. The Bean Institute says this amounts to 12 half-cup servings of cooked beans. On the other hand, a 15.5-ounce can of Kroger pinto beans is priced a little lower at $0.79, but will make you only 3.5 half-cup servings.Dried beans aren’t just cheaper, they could also be healthier (canned beans are often high in sodium) and you might achieve better flavor when you add your own spices as you cook them, says HuffPost.9. Batteries@przemekklos / Twenty20Don’t get charged more on batteries. This household staple is another bad buy from the grocery store when you’re trying to budget — experts recommend buying from other retailers or purchasing them in bulk.“Batteries are definitely a better buy at club warehouse stores,” Erin Konrad, a spokesperson for CouponPal.com, told Business Insider in 2015. You might be able to stock up on a larger quantity for a cheaper price, compared to buying a small six-pack at the grocery store.For example, a 40-pack of Duracell AAA batteries costs $19 at Costco.com, but a 16-pack of the same brand is priced at $16.45 on H-E-B’s store website.Konrad also suggests purchasing batteries from Amazon or stocking up on generic batteries from the dollar store.8. Alcohol@wanaktek / Twenty20Before a big party, you might be tempted to save time by just picking up the booze while you grab your snacks and other essentials.But don’t buy your beer at the grocery store — you can actually save by buying in bulk at the warehouse clubs.Beer and wine could be priced 10% to 20% more at grocery stores than at warehouse clubs like Costco and Sam’s Club, according to consumer reporter and author Jeanette Pavini, who spoke to Business Insider in 2015.You might not even have to pay the membership fee: “Alcohol laws vary state to state, but in general it is against the law to charge a membership fee for alcohol purchases, so score deals on your favorite wine and spirits even if you’re not a member,” she said.7. Snack packsThose small bags of chips and Goldfish crackers might be a convenient buy for your kids’ lunch bags, but you can score lower prices online or at warehouse clubs.Woman’s Day magazine says snack packs often get marked up by as much as 50%. Take Walmart for example — an 8-ounce bag of Lay’s classic potato chips retails for $3.48 (or 43 cents per ounce), but a package of 10 1-ounce bags costs $6.48 at the same store.Joanie Demer, co-founder of The Krazy Coupon Lady, told Business Insider in 2015 that shoppers can shave 10% or more off what they’d typically pay at the grocery store by purchasing their little snack bags off Amazon instead.Or, skip the individual portion bags entirely, and just buy the regular-sized bags — you can portion out your chips into smaller containers at home.6. Pet foodMarkBuckawicki / Wikimedia commonsYou can’t forget about your fur babies when you do your grocery haul, but you can save on pet food depending on where and how you purchase it.Skip out on buying cans of wet food one by one, which can be costlier, and consider buying them in a bulk package from Costco.Or, you can sign up for the loyalty program at your local pet store to earn rewards, snag coupons and get discounts.For example, PetSmart offers a free membership program called Treats, which lets pet parents earn points on purchases, services and donations to PetSmart charities, which can later be redeemed for discounts. You’ll also receive access to some members-only deals.“Ordering pet food online can often save you more by selecting the ‘repeat delivery’ deal option [for] savings of up to 15% off orders,” savings expert Andrea Woroch says in Business Insider’s 2015 article.5. Fresh seafoodSave on your salmon by grabbing it from the frozen section of the grocery store instead of hitting up the seafood counter.Frozen fish tends to be 20% cheaper than the fresh variety, says food and recipe magazine The Spruce Eats. And you’re not always skimping on quality.“From the introduction of micro-misting to more powerful and rapid deep-freeze technologies at lower temperatures, the process has really turned frozen product . . . into a means to capture pristine quality,” chef and author Barton Seaver told The Washington Post in 2018.The newspaper also reports that shoppers should take a look at the label on “fresh” seafood at the counter — some items might be labeled “previously frozen,” which means they were only thawed out once they hit the store.4. MagazinesDon’t get distracted by those big, bold headlines and flashy stills of your favorite celebrities while you wait at the checkout counter.Instead of paying $5 for a magazine that you’ll probably end up tossing in the trash later, there are several ways to read them for free or for a discounted price.Check with your local library — they may offer digital magazines that you can borrow and read off your tablet, including both the latest and back issues.If you’re an Amazon Prime member, you’ll enjoy access to some digital magazines through Prime Reading. You can also find deals on print and digital magazine subscriptions on Amazon, even if you don't have Prime, which can cost you less over the long term.And look into other sites, like Magazines.com and DiscountMags.com, which feature discounts and deals on magazine subscriptions.3. Party suppliesSo, you’re throwing a birthday bash and are hitting the grocery store to pick up snacks, drinks and cake — but save yourself the stroll down the party supplies aisle.You can save big on things like paper plates, balloons and candles by hopping over to the dollar store instead. For example, a pack of paper plates might cost you $6 at Kroger, but half the price at Dollar General.Remember to also check online stores that offer cheap or discounted party goods and favors. You might be able to save at stores like Amazon by purchasing party supplies in full sets rather than picking out individual items.Another great idea is to stock up on party supplies during end-of-season clearance sales at stores like Target or Walmart. The discounted beach-themed napkins will certainly keep until next summer.Or, why not skip the disposable dishes altogether and use plates and cups from your cupboard to save some money and the environment?2. Toothbrushes and dental flossWhy get your oral care products from the grocery store (or any other store) when you can get it for free?If you go to the dentist regularly, you’ll probably receive a little goodie bag with a toothbrush, floss and perhaps even a sample toothpaste. If you don’t, it never hurts to ask for one.Just bear in mind that the CDC advises you to replace your toothbrush every three to four months, especially if the bristles are looking worn out. They’d also like to set the record straight that a replacement isn’t needed due to bacteria or germs, but because a worn out toothbrush is less effective at cleaning your teeth.You can also look out for deals and coupons at retailers and save more on value packs as opposed to just buying one toothbrush at a time.Check the brand websites and social media pages of products like Oral-B in case they’re offering exclusive deals or complimentary gifts with purchases on oral care.1. Toilet paper@Boris79 / Twenty20Remember the era of toilet paper shortages at the onset of the pandemic? Shoppers were stocking up as quickly as possible and Costco had to enforce limitations on how much you could buy at a time.Here’s the thing — buying your toilet paper in bulk at warehouse clubs or office supply stores is your best bet for savings, according to MoneyTalksNews.That doesn’t mean you need to buy multiple packs at a time, but it is cheaper than frequently grabbing smaller packs at the grocery store. It means fewer trips to the store as well, and we all know how expensive gasoline is these days.You can also clip coupons and check the flyers regularly for cheaper prices at other retailers. It's also a good idea to do the math so you know exactly how much you’re paying per roll.What to read nextWant to invest with just your spare change?

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Huntington Bancshares in FocusBased in Columbus, Huntington Bancshares (HBAN) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of -14.4%. The regional bank holding company is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.16 per share, with a dividend yield of 4.7%. This compares to the Banks - Midwest industry's yield of 2.97% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.81%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $0.62 is up 2.5% from last year. In the past five-year period, Huntington Bancshares has increased its dividend 3 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 6.42%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Huntington Bancshares's current payout ratio is 45%, meaning it paid out 45% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for HBAN for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 is $1.45 per share, with earnings expected to increase 34.26% from the year ago period.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.For instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, HBAN is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The reported figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents. The company reported 22 cents in the comparable period last year.The third-quarter 2022 results have benefitted from notable increases in net interest income (NII) and a decline in expenses. However, a fall in fee income and higher provision from credit losses were headwinds.Management noted, “We successfully executed on our business strategies, delivering robust loan growth, higher deposit balances, and expanded fee income. These results, and the benefit from the higher interest rate environment, combined to produce sequential pre provision net revenue growth of 14% for the quarter when excluding Notable Items.”The company has reported a net income applicable to common shares of $565 million in the quarter, up 70% year over year.Revenues Rise, Expenses FallTotal revenues (on a fully-taxable equivalent or FTE basis) climbed 12% year over year to $1.91 billion in the third quarter. Also, the top line surpassed the consensus estimate of $1.84 billion.NII (FTE basis) was $1.41 million, up 21% from the prior-year quarter. The upside resulted from an increase in the net interest margin (NIM), which rose to 3.42% from 2.91%, and higher average earning assets.Non-interest income moved down 7% year over year to $498 million. The decline mainly stemmed from lower service charges on deposit accounts, mortgage banking, and leasing revenues, partially offset by higher card and payment processing income, and capital market fees.Non-interest expenses were down 18% on a year-over-year basis to $1.05 billion. This was due to a fall in primarily all components like professional services costs, outside data processing and other service costs, and net occupancy expenses.The efficiency ratio was 54.4%, down from the prior-year quarter’s 74.9%. A decline in the ratio indicates a rise in profitability.Story continuesAs of Sep 30, 2022, average loans and leases at Huntington improved 3% on a sequential basis to $116.9 billion. Average total deposits rose 1% from the prior quarter to $146 billion.Credit Quality ImprovesNet charge-offs were $44 million or an annualized 0.15% of average total loans in the reported quarter, down from $55 million or 0.20% recorded in the prior year. In addition, total non-performing assets were $627 million as of Sep 30, 2022, down from $893 million in the prior-year quarter.However, the quarter-end allowance for credit losses increased 1.1% to $2.23 billion. In the third quarter, the company recorded a provision from credit losses of $106 million against $62 million of reversal in the prior-year quarter.Capital Ratios FallCommon equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and regulatory Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio were 9.27% and 10.83%, respectively, compared with 9.57% and 11.35% reported in the year-ago quarter. The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 5.32%, down from 6.95% as of Sep 30, 2021.Our ViewpointHuntington put up a decent performance in the third quarter. The momentum in average earning asset growth will drive NII in the upcoming quarters.  Also, its credit quality is likely to keep witnessing improvement.Currently, Huntington carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

It may not have been easy to hold on to MGM for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?MGM Resorts' Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at MGM Resorts' main business drivers.MGM Resorts International is a holding company and primarily owns and operates casino resorts through wholly owned subsidiaries. The company’s resort portfolio incorporates 30 unique hotel offerings, including some of the most familiar resort brands in the industry such as Bellagio, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay and The Mirage.The company reports under three operating segments: Las Vegas Strip (49% of total revenues in 2021), Regional Operations (35%), MGM China (12.5%) and Management and other operations (3.5%). MGM China’s operations consist of the MGM Macau resort and casino (MGM Macau) and the company is currently developing an integrated casino, hotel, and entertainment resort on the Cotai Strip in the region. Meanwhile, in Oct 2015, MGM Resorts created a controlled real estate investment trust (REIT) named MGM Growth Properties LLC (MGP), which began trading in April 2016.MGM Resorts International holds 73% interest in MGM Growth Properties LLC (MGP), a premier real estate investment trust engaged in the acquisition, ownership and leasing of large-scale resorts. It also owns 56% stake in MGM China Holdings Limited, which owns MGM MACAU and 50% of CityCenter in Las Vegas.MGM Resorts recently acquired the operations of Empire City Casino in New York and Hard Rock Rocksino in Ohio, which was rebranded as MGM Northfield Park. In 2018, MGM Resorts opened MGM Springfield in Massachusetts, MGM COTAI in Macau, and the first Bellagio-branded hotel in Shanghai.The company’s superior business model, extensive non-gaming revenue opportunities, high-quality assets and attractive property locations are the primary growth drivers. In the past few years, it has taken various initiatives to align every recognized brand into one global entertainment brand. This resulted in a disciplined business model, with a unified view of strategy.Story continuesBottom LinePutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For MGM Resorts, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in October 2012 would be worth $2,934.90, or a gain of 193.49%, as of October 21, 2022, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.The S&amp;P 500 rose 155.78% and the price of gold increased -9.30% over the same time frame in comparison.Going forward, analysts are expecting more upside for MGM.Shares of MGM Resorts have underperformed the industry in the past six months. The dismal performance was mainly due to the coronavirus crisis. During second-quarter 2022, the company witnessed a dismal performance in the Macau region owing to subdued visitation. Notwithstanding the easing of certain COVID-19 protective measures by authorities worldwide, certain travel restrictions, quarantine measures, testing requirements and capacity limitations remain in effect at its Macau Operations. Although casinos in Macau are now open, visitation is still below the pre-pandemic level. Given the uncertainties revolving around the crisis, the company expects the pandemic to keep affecting operations for some time. Earnings estimates for 2022 have declined in the past 60 days, depicting analysts concern regarding the stock growth potential.Over the past four weeks, shares have rallied 6.04%, and there have been 1 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2022 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

And he did neither,"" said Curtis.A U.S. Department of Energy spokesperson was not immediately available to comment.Oil is now selling for about $85 a barrel and the about $70 offer ""is a price where there is no supply growth,"" said Abhiram Rajendran, a director at consultancy Energy Intelligence.U.S. oil prices hit $120 per barrel this year and did not trigger a production boom because of shortages and high costs for labor and equipment, said Hunter Kornfeind, oil market analyst at Rapidan Energy Group.Rebecca Babin, senior energy trader at CIBC Private Wealth, said tight oil supplies have pushed up price expectations into 2024. But that occurred apart from the SPR offer, she said.Oil-futures through mid- to late-2024 are trading about $72 a barrel, meaning oil producers can lock in the sales price of future production around the level set for SPR purchases, said Kornfeind.If the Biden administration wants to boost oil supplies, it ""should change its policies around producing more oil and gas in the United States,"" said Frank Macchiarola, a senior vice president at trade group American Petroleum Institute.(By Arathy Somasekhar in Bangalore, Stephanie Kelly in New York; writing by Gary McWilliams; Editing by Robert Birsel)]"

It is always easy for cynical but conflicted industry analysts and commentators to lob politicized beanbags at the administration’s decisions. Sure, the White House may have had ups and downs with some mistakes early on—as well as poor messaging on energy solutions. But listening to these biased industry complaints has increasingly become a tale of two realities.The prevailing narrative presented by most energy analysts is that of a dire and dystopian global oil “supply shock” outlook. They portray the administration as largely rudderless on energy challenges, politicizing releases of the fast-dwindling strategic petroleum reserves (SPR) to put a band-aid on lowering prices before the midterm elections, unable to tackle supply challenges. They further fault the administration for simultaneously offending the second- and third-largest oil producers, Saudi Arabia and Russia, amidst drastic OPEC+ production cuts and the European Union’s sixth sanctions package to ban Russian oil in December. And they accuse the White House of murdering U.S. energy independence by launching an ESG crusade against oil, blocking pipelines, cutting federal leases and threatening energy companies’ access to capital and the outlook for long-term demand.But this dystopic vision is grounded in misleading information. Perhaps these energy analysts would be wise to redirect their fire from President Biden and target their skepticism towards the duplicitous Saudi-Russian OPEC+ cartel instead. These biased analysts, who projected that oil would be $400/barrel by now instead of the current $84/barrel, do not acknowledge certain key realities, including:Story continues* The U.S. is now the world’s largest oil producer and needs almost no Saudi oil; as the U.S. has already cut its imports of Saudi oil by over 90% over the last decade to a mere 356,000 barrels a day.* The U.S. owned Aramco but recklessly gave it to the Saudis when President Nixon and Henry Kissinger panicked in the 1970s.* Gasoline prices should have fallen recently to match the decline in crude oil, but refineries are enjoying a soaring windfall, with profits quadrupling from 2021 levels. Refiners have added $30 a barrel in refining margins on top of the price of crude—even though 1 million barrels per day in refining capacity was added in 2022 with more coming in 2023. That’s not counting the return of hundreds of thousands of barrels of capacity which was taken offline due to idiosyncratic outages and disruptions the last couple months due to refinery mismanagement.* The billions of dollars oil producers lost in 2020 was not due to Biden, who had not been elected yet, but due to COVID-related economic shutdowns.* Federal leases under Biden far exceed those under Trump—with 3,557 permits for oil and gas drilling on public lands in Biden’s first year, far outpacing the Trump Administration’s first year total of 2,658, with record numbers of unused leases. That’s the case even though all federal leases combined account for less than 20% of all U.S. oil and gas production.* The U.S. already provides more gas to the EU than Russia did at its peak, and now the EU buys 80% less from Russia than they did before Russia’s attack on Ukraine.* The recent Saudi/OPEC price hike was not justified by oil markets as producers were already making 80% profit margins. Only the inefficient oil producer Russia, with break-even production costs twice that of Saudi Arabia, needed these price hikes, to fuel its war.* U.S. SPR releases are not political. Every modern president has authorized significant SPR releases, including Donald Trump—who likewise faced attacks from self-serving industry voices. Furthermore countries like Saudi and China maintain their own sizable strategic petroleum reserves from which they released ample supplies at least until this year.* Biden’s new policy of replenishing the SPR through futures contracts, taking advantage of backward-dated futures markets where oil is hovering cheaply around $70 a barrel, locks in hefty profits for domestic oil producers for years to come—which Riyadh refused to do.Similarly, contrary to Vladimir Putin propaganda that Western sanctions will lead to energy supply shocks, it is in fact Putin who is willingly withholding both oil and gas supplies. The U.S. Treasury Department has proactively put forward the price cap scheme explicitly to stave off a supply shock come Dec. 5, when further EU sanctions kick in, ensuring Russian oil continues flowing to global markets while simultaneously limiting Putin’s revenue.Any decision by Putin to withhold oil supply after Dec. 5 the way he is withholding gas supply from Europe would be a catastrophic, unforced mistake. He will likely have to reverse himself, much the same way he is now begging Europe to buy more Russian gas after months of blackmail.And to the great chagrin of many environmental advocates, Biden has been laying the groundwork for a gradual transition to clean energy, not the overnight transformation that boogeyman industry critics have been urging him to make. His speech this week explicitly called for an increase in domestic oil and gas production as well as much-needed permitting reform to expedite the construction of energy infrastructure, particularly gas pipelines which can be converted to green hydrogen pipelines over time.Perhaps it is even more surprising that many analysts retain any market credibility at all, considering the number of missed calls by many analysts the last year alone. Among them.* Some denied that OPEC+ was going to have an unscheduled October surprise with a production cutback of 2 million barrels.* Many believed Saudi propaganda that the kingdom had no spare capacity, when in fact the Saudis are 33% off production levels from two years prior, while refusing to release SPR inventory. * These experts believed Riyadh’s pleas that a production cut was needed to maintain profitability, never appreciating that U.S. technology enables the Saudis to extract oil as far less than half the cost of Russian oil, with low break-evens of ~$22 a barrel.* They forgot to figure in the massively higher shipping costs for getting Russian oil to Asia, buying into Putin’s “pivot to Asia” mythology. They likewise wrongly believed that gas was fungible and that Putin could pivot from selling piped gas to Europe to China—though he does not have the needed pipelines.* Many, including JP Morgan, said oil by now would cost $380/barrel* They underestimated the speed of liquified natural gas (LNG) to backfill for Russian gas to the EU (the U.S. now sells more gas to the EU than Russia did at its peak in February). Fully 86% of Russian gas went to the EU but the EU didn’t need it as much as Putin needed to sell it to them.* They didn’t imagine that Germany could construct six massive LNG conversion plants in record time to supplement existing 150 bcm of re-gasification capacity.Evidently, when it comes to energy industry analysts, sometimes the emperor is naked—with these conflicted experts too close to their own biased industry sources, repeatedly mistakenly falling for Saudi and Russian misinformation. Riyadh no longer even bothers to disguise its blatant manipulation of industry analysts. Recently the Saudi oil minister publicly, mercilessly berated a Reuters reporter and banned Reuters from OPEC+ meetings while showering favored analysts he deemed “kind friends” with extensive access during the most recent OPEC+ press conference. No wonder that with so many industry experts on the Saudi payroll or reliant on access to Saudi sources, experts shudder in fear at the thought of crossing Riyadh.Transcending the industry analysts parroting the heavy-handed misinformation of the Saudi-Russia OPEC+ alliance, U.S. energy policy is quite promising—neither giving industry a blank check nor folding to Saudi blackmail like lawn furniture.

BTC prices remain range-bound and, at just south of $20,000, is trading almost identically to its June price level.One of the more interesting themes for bitcoin in 2022 has been the lack of volatility in overall BTC daily price movement.The price is down approximately 3% for October, having opened the month at $19,400 compared with its current $19,100.BTC appears to be firmly entrenched along a line of support, with little impetus to break outside the range in either direction. Using the Volume Profile Visible Range (VPVR) tool to measure BTC trading volume by price illustrates this.Measuring from the beginning of 2022 highlights a “high volume node” (indicating an area of significant price agreement), at the $19,300 level.Incorporating VPVR with BTC’s Bollinger Bands shows additional areas of high agreement at prices that coincide with bitcoin’s upper and lower bands. Bollinger bands are a technical indicator that measure an asset’s moving average (often the 20-day) and calculates two standard deviations above and below that price.BTC now appears poised to continue trading in a range between approximately $18,600 and $20,200. A slight bullish divergence appears to be forming as momentum has recently accelerated at a faster pace than price.Signals to monitor would be a bullish crossing of the 10-day moving average (currently $19,200) above the 50-day moving average ($19,800), but conditions don’t seem ripe for that at the moment.Read the full article by CoinDesk analyst Glenn Williams Jr. Altcoin RoundupTHE Memes Won’t DIE: Crypto Hopefuls Seek Value in Joke Tokens After Vitalik Buterin’s Tweets: One of the most-traded tokens on the decentralized exchange Uniswap is called THE, which has seen some $10 million in on-chain trading volume and counts over 5,000 holders as of Friday afternoon.

The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 21% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Often called “market makers”, institutions wield significant power in influencing the price dynamics of any stock. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell Morgan Stanley, which might have negative implications on individual investors.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Morgan Stanley. View our latest analysis for Morgan Stanley ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Morgan Stanley?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Morgan Stanley. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time.

Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Morgan Stanley is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 22% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.2% and 7.0%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesWe did some more digging and found that 7 of the top shareholders account for roughly 50% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Morgan StanleyThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Morgan Stanley. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$333m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 13% stake in Morgan Stanley. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Public Company OwnershipPublic companies currently own 22% of Morgan Stanley stock. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Morgan Stanley better, we need to consider many other factors.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of $1.34 per share on revenues of $6.7 billion.Let’s delve into the factors that might have influenced the power supplier’s performance in the September quarter. But it’s worth taking a look at Southern Company’s previous-quarter results first.Highlights of Q2 Earnings &amp; Surprise HistoryIn the last reported quarter, the Atlanta, GA-based service provider beat the consensus mark due to the positive effects of rates, usage and pricing changes, plus a demand boost from warmer-than-normal weather. Southern Company had reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.07, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 84 cents. Revenues of $7.2 billion had also come in 28.1% above the consensus mark.SO topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters. The utility has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 9.4%, on average. This is depicted in the graph below: Southern Company The Price and EPS SurpriseSouthern Company The Price and EPS SurpriseSouthern Company The price-eps-surprise | Southern Company The Quote Factors to ConsiderSouthern Company's seven major regulated utilities serve approximately nine million electric and natural gas customers. Leveraging the demographics of its operating territories, the firm has been successfully expanding its regulated business customer base. As proof of that effort, Southern Company added some 12,000 new residential electric customers and more than 7,000 residential natural gas customers in the second quarter. This trend most likely continued in the July-September period of 2022 because of healthy economic development across its service territories.In particular, the firm is expected to have benefited from higher retail electricity sales, reflecting economic recovery in the Southeast in the form of demand from industrial buyers. Finally, investment in state-regulated electric/gas franchises and continued trends in hybrid working have most likely buoyed Southern Company’s revenues and cash flows.On a somewhat bearish note, the power supplier’s total operating cost in the second quarter increased 23.6% year over year to $5.6 billion. The upward cost trajectory is likely to have continued in the second quarter due to inflationary pressures.Story continuesWhat Does Our Model Say?The proven Zacks model does not conclusively show that Southern Company is likely to beat estimates in the third quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates.

This payment means the dividend yield will be 1.7%, which is below the average for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for Sealed Air Sealed Air's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWhile yield is important, another factor to consider about a company's dividend is whether the current payout levels are feasible. Before making this announcement, Sealed Air was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 33.9%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 17% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendSealed Air Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2012, the annual payment back then was $0.52, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $0.80. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 4.4% over that duration. Dividends have grown relatively slowly, which is not great, but some investors may value the relative consistency of the dividend.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. We are encouraged to see that Sealed Air has grown earnings per share at 31% per year over the past five years. Earnings have been growing rapidly, and with a low payout ratio we think that the company could turn out to be a great dividend stock.Sealed Air Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is good to see that the dividend is staying consistent, and we don't think there is any reason to suspect this might change over the medium term. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

The company has a four-quarter average negative earnings surprise of 2.25%.Let's take a closer look at the factors that are likely to get reflected in PG&amp;E’s upcoming results.Factors to NoteDuring the July-September 2022 quarter, the company’s service territories witnessed warmer-than-normal temperatures accompanied by drought conditions in most regions.  Such weather patterns are likely to have boosted electricity demand among customers for cooling purposes. This, in turn, is expected to have favored the to-be-reported quarter's top line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $5.92 billion, suggesting growth of 8.3% from the year-ago quarter.Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. Price and EPS SurprisePacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. Price and EPS SurprisePacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. price-eps-surprise | Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. QuoteThe above-average temperature prevalent at PG&amp;E Corp’s territory resulted in a few wildfire activities during the third quarter of 2022. This might have hampered PG&amp;E Corp’s infrastructure, thereby pushing up its operating costs and, in turn, hurting the Q3 bottom-line performance.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at 22 cents per share, indicating a decline of 8.3% from the prior-year reported figure.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for PCG this time. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is not the case here.PG&amp;E has an Earnings ESP of -16.28% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.

57,6a88c7bf-068e-39a7-97d8-40873cb3cdc9,PCG,2022-10-22,Analysts Estimate Fortis (FTS) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-fortis-fts-report-140002740.html,1666360802,STORY,['PCGU'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Fortis (FTS) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 28, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis electric and gas utility is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.49 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -3.9%.Revenues are expected to be $1.8 billion, up 3.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.73% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Fortis?For Fortis, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Fortis will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Fortis would post earnings of $0.48 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.44, delivering a surprise of -8.33%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Fortis doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerPG&amp;E (PCG), another stock in the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.22 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -8.3%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $5.92 billion, up 8.3% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for PG&amp;E has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -16.28%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that PG&amp;E will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Trading 31% off its highs, it will be important to see if Microsoft was able to sustain growth in the majority of its business segments.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLast quarter, Microsoft said it expects double-digit revenue and operating income growth in FY23. Investors were delighted about the outlook despite the company mentioning forex (FX) volatility could slightly decrease total revenue growth, cost of goods sold (COGS), and operating expense growth.Outside of currency headwinds, Wall Street will be monitoring Microsoft’s prior outlook that weakness in PC market demand and lower advertising spend will impact Windows OEM, Surface, and LinkedIn.Acquisitions &amp; Cloud GrowthAcquisitions have helped boost Microsoft’s growth, the company has shown the ability to acquire popular companies like LinkedIn and many others over the years. Investors hope that LinkedIn can continue adding to Microsoft’s revenue and that operating costs can be contained.Last quarter LinkedIn revenue increased by $3.5 billion year over year, up 34%.This was driven by a strong job market and advertising demand in its Marketing Solutions business. It will be important to see if this can continue with many social media companies such as Meta Platforms’ META Facebook also warning of slower advertising spending.Investors will also be looking for confirmation on the planned close of the Activision Blizzard deal. As of now, Microsoft’s guidance for FY23 does not include any impact from Activision Blizzard. Microsoft has been expecting the $68.7 billion acquisition to close by the end of FY23.Microsoft hopes that Activision Blizzard can bring in additional revenue streams to go along with LinkedIn and its growing cloud technology Azure. In its most recent quarter, Microsoft Cloud services brought in revenue of $25 billion, up 28% year over year. The company saw strong demand, gained market share, and increased customer commitment to its cloud platform.Story continuesIt will be important to see if Microsoft was able to keep taking market share in cloud services from other big tech competitors like Amazon AMZN, and Alphabet GOOGL. Despite Azure’s year over year growth, it slowed from the previous quarter and missed analysts’ expectations last quarter.Fiscal Q1 OutlookThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for MSFT’s fiscal Q1 earnings is $2.30 a share, which would represent a 1% increase from Q1 2022. Sales for the quarter are also expected to be up 9% at $49.57 billion. However, it is important to note that estimates for the quarter have gone down in the last week and are lower than the $2.44 per share expectations at the beginning of the quarter. Year over year, MSFT is projected to post 8% earnings growth in fiscal 2023 with its FY24 earnings set to grow another 15%. Solid top line growth is also expected, with FY23 sales projected to climb 10% and another 13% in FY24 to $247.57 billion.Performance &amp; ValuationYear to date MSFT is down -28% near the S&amp;P 500’s -24% drop. However, over the last decade, MSFT is up +760% to crush the benchmark. Investors will hope that MSFT can get back to its dominant performance despite the tougher operating environment.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTrading around $242 a share, MSFT has a P/E of 23.4X. This is near the industry average and much lower than its decade high of 37.4X and close to its median of 23.2X. MSFT trades a discount relative to its past but an earnings beat and reaffirming FY23 guidance will be key for investors to see in the current unfavorable market conditions for tech stocks.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineDespite missing fiscal Q4 earnings expectations, MSFT stock rallied after the quarterly report as investors became optimistic about its better than expected FY23 guidance. With earnings estimates revisions trending down throughout the quarter much of the optimism began to fade. Wall Street wants to see Microsoft produce strong fiscal Q1 results and more importantly reaffirm its FY23 guidance as the economic downturn and operating environment has worsened since the company gave its outlook.MSFT currently lands a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in correlation with the downward earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter, fiscal 2023, and FY24.

(Graphic: Megacaps market values vs stock market, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zdvxdydxzvx/Pasted%20image%201666369186528.png)The S&amp;P 500 is up nearly 5% from its Oct 12 closing low for the year after posting its biggest weekly gain since late June. Even with stocks' latest rebound, the index has dropped 21% so far in 2022, on track for its biggest decline since 2008.Resilient corporate profits have been one bright spot this year, though doubts are growing over how sustainable they will be. With the bulk of S&amp;P 500 companies still to report, third-quarter profits are estimated to have climbed 3.1% versus the year-ago period, which would be the weakest performance in two years, according to Refinitiv IBES, while earnings growth expectations for 2023 have fallen to 7.2% from 7.8% on Oct 1.Next week's reports from the four megacaps may show whether companies with dominant positions can post solid performance despite worries of a potential economic downturn.Because of their heavy weightings, ""if those stocks don’t get it done, that puts pressure on the indices to continue to go down,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services.Story continuesMicrosoft and Alphabet are due to report on Tuesday, with Amazon and Apple set for Thursday.Apple shares are the only ones of the megacaps that have outperformed the broader market this year. Shares of the iPhone maker, which account for a 7% weight in S&amp;P 500, are down about 17% in 2022; Microsoft and Amazon are each off roughly 28%, Alphabet is down 30%. (Graphic: Megacaps vs the U.S. stock market, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/MEGACAPS/gkvlwmwlepb/chart.png)Despite those steep losses, investors have maintained exposure to the megacap stocks. Actively managed U.S. mutual and exchange-traded funds held 11.41% of their portfolios in those four stocks combined as of the most recently available data, versus 11.44% at the end of 2021, according to Morningstar Direct.Investors have been drawn to the large companies broadly because of their financial strength and competitive advantages that, in theory, will drive profits even during uncertain economic times.Still, only Apple has topped analyst estimates for earnings and revenue in both of their most recent quarterly reports, according to Refinitiv data.""The bar is higher for Apple because it has outperformed and because you haven’t seen the earnings blink yet,” said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital.Questions loom over the other companies' key market areas, including personal computers for Microsoft, advertising spending for Alphabet and consumer strength for Amazon.All three rely on cloud computing businesses, which will be in focus next week, according to Charlie Ryan, partner and portfolio manager at Evercore Wealth Management.“Cloud would be the pillar that one would put their hopes on when they report,” Ryan said. “It has been continued strength for quite some time now and any deviation from that would be a concern.”Meanwhile, soaring U.S. bond yields are pressuring valuations and complicating the picture for tech and other growth stocks, whose expected future earnings are discounted steeply by higher yields. Yields continued to rise this week, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note hitting a fresh 14-year high.All four stocks command higher valuations than the S&amp;P 500, which trades at nearly 16 times forward earnings estimates. The P/Es for Apple and Microsoft are both about 22 times, Alphabet trades at 17.5 times, while Amazon sits at 60 times, according to Refinitiv Datastream.“Those stocks have typically sold at earnings multiples that are on the higher side,” said Carlson, of Horizon Investment Services.“How they are going to continue to perform from here gives some insight into what investors are ultimately willing to pay for growth stocks.”(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and David Gregorio)]"

The business was a large beneficiary of stay-at-home orders which drove a demand spike for home office and video communication equipment as most employees shifted to working remotely. This not only drove a pull-forward of growth, but margins also experienced a step-up due to the lack of promotions. The market started to extrapolate these dynamics as a permanent change in Logitech’s economics, whereas we took the opposite view which has proved closer to reality given a string of disappointing results.”09.

(NYSE:EGHT) is a cloud communications provider that offers businesses a unified voice, contact center, video, and chat platform. The company hired a new CEO in late 2020 who has since refocused the company on areas of the market where 8×8 has competitive advantages and the potential to earn higher margins. In conjunction with this change in strategy, the company exited low-growth and low-margin product lines, which has led to what we believe is a temporary slowdown in revenue growth. A recent acquisition that decreased 8×8’s cash position also weighed on investor sentiment. We believe the company will overcome these short-term issues and that, at its current price, the stock is attractively valued. We are willing to be patient as the company works through these setbacks and trimmed our position in the stock during the period.”07. RingCentral, Inc. (NYSE:RNG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2, 2022: 42RingCentral, Inc. (NYSE:RNG) is an American company that provides a software as a service (SaaS) platform that allows businesses to communicate with each other. The service includes several features such as video calls and SMS messaging. The company is headquartered in Belmont, California.The communications market for RingCentral, Inc. (NYSE:RNG) is anticipated to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13% and reach $69 billion by the end of 2028. In its third fiscal quarter, the firm reported 28% annual revenue growth, while at the same time, subscription revenue increased by 32% annually. In September 2022, Credit Suisse projected that the company's shares would be worth $40, noting that it was operating in a very lucrative market.Here is what RiverPark Funds specifically said about RingCentral, Inc. (NYSE:RNG) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“RingCentral, Inc. (NYSE:RNG) is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider of communications solutions to large enterprises. The company’s solutions replace legacy office phone systems or Private Branch Exchanges (PBX) with a cloud-based virtual solution that enables a customer’s employees to communicate via voice, text, video/web conferencing, and fax over multiple devices including cell phones, tablets, and computers from any location. This cloud-based phone systems market, typically referred to as Unified-Communication-as-a-Service (UCaaS) is a roughly $10 billion market today and is projected to grow to over $100 billion over the next ten years as companies move their communications systems to the cloud.The move to UCaaS adoption is being driven by both the obsolescence of PBX hardware underlying current office phone systems, and, like cloud adoption across the software stack, cloud-based phone systems being less expensive, more feature rich, and accessible anywhere. RingCentral (which went public in 2013) is the leading vendor to the UCaaS market and has enjoyed greater than 28% revenue growth in every year since its IPO, a growth rate that continued in the company’s recently reported 1Q22 in which it grew revenue 33%. We believe the company can continue to grow revenue north of 25% for many years to come, driven by the global conversion of more than 400 million on-premises phone systems to the cloud. RingCentral is well positioned to continue to win the lion’s share of this UCaaS migration, as the company has partnered with many of the largest legacy PBX vendors (including Avaya, Atos, AlcatelLucent, and Mitel) to be their recommended cloud solution for customers whose maintenance period on their installed systems ends (and the vendors no longer support them). RNG has also partnered with communications giants like Vodafone, AT&amp;T and Verizon to sell co-branded cloud solutions into their customer bases.As the company’s revenue scales, we expect gross margin to continue to improve from its already strong 80%, while we expect the company to continue to expand its EBITDA margin from 18% in 2022, toward typical SaaS margins of 40% or higher over the next several years…” (Click Here to read the full text)06. Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2, 2022: 44Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) provides a unified communications platform worldwide. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) revenues increased by more than 5 times and it has kept these gains and profits. Famous hedge fund managers like Jim Simons, Ken Fisher and Cathie Wood has major stakes in the company.

(NASDAQ:ZM), compared to 43 in the previous quarter worth $3.2 billion.In its Q1 2022 investor letter, Horos Asset Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“What about the other asset class that has attracted the most attention from the investment community in recent times? Here we can distinguish three major groups. First, those companies without earnings that had convinced investors of their great future growth prospects, pushing up their valuations to irrational levels. A clear example of this, which we mentioned almost two years ago (see here) is Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM) (“Zoom”), whose market cap exceeded that of companies such as IBM or came close to that of Cisco Systems. Well, from the time we wrote about this odd situation until today, Zoom shares have collapsed nearly 80%.Therefore, if interest rates rise (or are expected to rise), company valuations are negatively impacted. This is especially true for those businesses that generate little cash today and the market expects them to generate a lot of cash in the future. Hence the severe losses in companies that promised a lot of cash generation in the future (such as Zoom).” Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Video Conferencing Stocks To Buy. Suggested articles:15 Best Countries To Live In11 Best Financial Services Stocks To Buy Now20 Largest Stock Exchanges in the WorldDisclosure.

On a positive note, amid the supply-chain disruption and staffing shortages within healthcare, the retail pharmacy business has been in high demand, thanks to the exponentially growing demand for distant medical services and remote patient care. Particularly, mail-order pharmacies are registering growth on account of telehealth and remote monitoring services, creating unique opportunities for stalwarts within the industry like CVS Health CVS, Walgreens Boots Alliance WBA and Rite Aid RAD, which invested strategically in easy patient access to prescription and maintenance medications during this period.However, the majority of the retail drug store heavyweights have been southbound on the ongoing pressure of drug pricing and reimbursement. Further, with a decline in the severity of COVID-19, the demand for related retail health support has decreased meaningfully, resulting in a significant drop in pandemic-led revenue generation for the industry players. Last but not the least, perceiving the huge growth prospects of this space, there has been a number of new entries in this industry, increasing the competitiveness of the space. Especially, a stalwart like Amazon’s AMZN entry into the retail drugstore space has created a survival issue among the existing entities.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry includes retailing of a range of prescription and over-the-counter medications. The broad retail network of companies within the retail pharmacy industry delivers advanced health solutions to patients, customers and caregivers. Over the past few years, the scope of the retail pharmacy and drugstore market has expanded exponentially. In North America, some of these entities evolved to add wellness products and groceries to their traditional portfolio of prescription and over-the-counter medications. According to recent reports, CVS Health, Walgreens Boots and Rite Aid are among the ""big three"" in the drugstore space. However, non-healthcare leaders like Amazon, in 2018, acquired pharmacy delivery startup PillPack to enter the U.S. healthcare space.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores IndustryIndustry Trend Remains Dismal Amid Reimbursement Pressure: Brand-name drugs, which hold wide profit margins, are protected with a reliable supply chain. However, the low-margin generic drugs, which have a fragile supply chain network, have been bearing the brunt of the pandemic-induced economic slump. Drug retailers are also witnessing a constant rise in medicine prices, stemming from the rising cost of raw materials of drugs. The industry players are currently grappling with continued pressure from non-reimbursable pharmacy expenses, which are significantly pulling down the mass demand for prescription as well as over-the-counter drugs and vaccinations. It has been widely observed that patients are replacing prescription medicines with low-cost generic drugs.Threat of Amazon Entering Brick-And-Mortar: A Business Insider report on May 26, 2021 came up with the speculation that there have been discussions about Amazon setting up stand-alone stores in a few locations, including Boston and Phoenix. Further, per the report, which cites insider sources, Amazon is exploring plans to place the pharmacies inside Amazon-owned Whole Foods locations. Earlier, following its entry, the e-commerce giant grabbed a significant chunk of the online pharmacy market from the legacy retail drug store space. Needless to say, this latest speculation has come as a major blow to the industry, putting retail pharmacy and drugstore stocks in a tighter spot.Online Pharmacy and Mail Order Boom: The widespread shelter-in-place regulations since the beginning of the pandemic have created a significant shift in demand toward mail order and online pharmacies. Experts say that this transition is expected to last even after the pandemic is over. Data claims that COVID-19 has only accelerated the already-growing demand for e-pharmacy and mail-ordered home delivery systems. Going by a Patch report, “Two years ago, 11% of U.S. adult pharmacy customers got their prescription from an online pharmacy, based on a survey conducted by market research firm CivicScience, [.] That figure has been steadily rising over the years, according to Statista.com, an online statistics portal.” With Amazon’s big move into the healthcare space, the retail pharmacy industry entered a new phase of fierce competition. To counter this rivalry, the companies are strategically attempting to gain in size and scale.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull Near-Term ProspectsThe industry’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects.

(NASDAQ:PZZA) stock and lowered price target to $115 from $130, highlighting that at some of the company's franchisees over the past week, sales trends slowed. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm Starboard Value LP is a leading shareholder in Papa John’s International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA), with 2.8 million shares worth more than $230.5 million. In its Q3 2021 investor letter, Artisan Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Papa John’s International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Papa John’s International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA) is a global operator and franchisor of pizza delivery and carryout restaurants. The company is tracking nicely against our turnaround thesis which hinges upon an improvement in store-level economics leading to accelerating growth in restaurant development activity. Improved store-level economics is being driven in part by market share gains resulting from menu innovation. New menu items—parmesan crusted Papadias, Epic Stuffed Crust, Shaq-a-roni— coupled with enhancements to the digital/loyalty platform and supportive advertising are attracting new customers to the brand, increasing frequency of its existing customers and driving higher unit volumes and returns. As a result, the company is experiencing incremental interest from new and existing franchisees to develop new restaurants. Papa John’s opened a record 123 units in the first half of 2021 and now expects to open 220-260 new stores this year (vs. 140-180 previously)—most of which are outside of the US. Combined with ample white space globally, we believe a higher unit growth trajectory will drive an attractive and sustainable profit cycle.”7. Restaurant Brands International Inc.

(NYSE:QSR), compared to 23 in the previous quarter worth $1.8 billion.Here is what Pershing Square Holdings has to say about Restaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR) in its Q2 2021 investor letter:“QSR’s franchised business model is a high-quality, capital-light, growing annuity that generates high-margin brand royalty fees from three leading brands: Burger King, Tim Hortons and Popeyes. The company has nimbly navigated the COVID-19 pandemic and continues to make progress on returning its brands to sustainable long-term growth.Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company has bolstered its safety procedures and is accelerating its digital investments by expanding its delivery footprint, modernizing its drive-thru experience, increasing mobile ordering adoption, and improving its loyalty programs. As the global recovery continues to be uneven, these initiatives will allow the company and its franchisees to serve customers in a safe and reliable manner.Each of the company’s brands are at various stages in recovery, with Burger King and Popeyes having returned to growth, while Tim Hortons is well on its way to recovering. On a two-year basis, same-store-sales grew 2.4% at Burger King and 24.4% at Popeyes during the last quarter. Meanwhile, Tim Hortons in Canada has improved to a mid-single digit decline in July, with each month during the second quarter showing sequential improvement. Tim Hortons’ slower recovery is largely driven by strict COVID-19 restrictions in Canada, which were only recently lifted in large provinces such as Ontario. In rural and suburban parts of Canada where restrictions were lifted earlier, Tim Hortons has already returned to growth. Given the habitual nature of Tim Hortons’ customer base, the recovery in sales will be tied to mobility and reopening.The company expects to return to its historical mid-single-digit unit growth this year, and recently announced expansions for both Tim Hortons and Popeyes in large international markets. As underlying sales trends at each of its brands continue to improve, and as the impact from COVID-19 restrictions ease, we believe Restaurant Brands’ share price will more accurately reflect our view of its improving business fundamentals.”6.

And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. For example, the Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) share price is up 58% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 37% (ignoring dividends).With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. See our latest analysis for Starbucks In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Starbucks managed to grow its earnings per share at 13% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 10% over the same period. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Starbucks, it has a TSR of 75% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveStarbucks shareholders are down 22% over twelve months (even including dividends), which isn't far from the market return of -24%. The silver lining is that longer term investors would have made a total return of 12% per year over half a decade. If the stock price has been impacted by changing sentiment, rather than deteriorating business conditions, it could spell opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should learn about the   3 warning signs  we've spotted with Starbucks (including 2 which are potentially serious) .Starbucks is not the only stock insiders are buying.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 28. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis parent company of Florida Power &amp; Light Co. Is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.79 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +5.3%.Revenues are expected to be $6.34 billion, up 45% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.84% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for NextEra?For NextEra, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.91%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that NextEra will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that NextEra would post earnings of $0.75 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.81, delivering a surprise of +8%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.NextEra appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, Xcel Energy (XEL) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.25 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +10.6%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $3.56 billion, up 2.6% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Xcel has been revised 6.3% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -0.40%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Xcel will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company’s volumes in the third quarter are expected to have benefited from the elasticity in the marketplace despite the ongoing global challenges. Coca-Cola’s third-quarter top line is likely to have gained from strong revenue growth across its operating segments, aided by an improved price/mix and an increase in concentrate sales. Sales gains from underlying share gains in both at-home and away-from-home channels are likely to have aided the third-quarter performance.Continued volume gains in the trademark Coca-Cola; sparkling flavors; the nutrition, juice, dairy and plant-based beverages; and hydration, sports, coffee and tea categories are expected to get reflected in the company’s third-quarter results.Coca-Cola’s third-quarter results are likely to reflect gains from innovations and accelerating digital investments. The company has been witnessing a splurge in e-commerce, with the growth rate of the channel doubling in many countries. KO has been accelerating investments to build strong digital capabilities. The company has been consistently strengthening consumer connections and piloting various digital-enabled initiatives through fulfillment methods to capture the online demand, which are likely to have boosted third-quarter sales.However, Coca-Cola has been witnessing pressures from higher supply-chain costs, including rising commodity input costs and transportation expenses. The pressures from input cost inflation and other costs are likely to have hurt the company’s performance in the third quarter.Coca-Cola has been investing in its markets and brands to support sales growth, with higher spending on consumer-facing activities. This has led to higher marketing investments in the past few quarters. Higher marketing spending, and an increase in short-term incentives and stock-based compensation are expected to have led to increased selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, the company expected adverse currency rates to hurt the top and bottom lines in the third quarter. It expects a currency headwind of 7-8% on revenues and 9-10% on comparable earnings per share for the third quarter.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Coca-Cola this time around.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best High Beta Stocks To Buy Now. Beta, a statistical measure of a stock's relative volatility to the broader market index, is often interpreted as a measure of riskiness. A beta of more than 1.0 means that the stock is more volatile than the overall market and a beta less than 1.0 indicates lower volatility than the benchmark index. Thus, stocks with higher betas tend to gain more in bull markets but also plummet harder in bear markets. High beta stocks are positively correlated with returns of the S&amp;P 500, but at an escalated rate. Famous equity bull Jeremy Siegel, a professor of finance at the University of Pennsylvania, told Bloomberg on October 15 that American stocks are still a “marvelous” bet for investors with a long-term horizon, despite the Federal Reserve’s intense rate policies pushing the S&amp;P 500 into bear territory. He believes that although high interest rates and recession fears are casting a shadow over the stock market currently, it might not be the case for much longer if rates succumb to their long-term trends. That could elevate stocks, in Siegel’s opinion. He explained his stance further:“I’m staying put, I certainly wouldn’t be surprised if a year, year and half from now we’re 20-30% higher. I think stocks are undervalued greatly in the long-run.”To prepare for an eventual bull market, it is prudent to invest in high beta stocks which are trading at attractive discounts right now. Some of the best high beta stocks include Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), and HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA). Our MethodologyWe have selected the stocks with a beta value of more than 1 as of October 21. We have shortlisted the high beta stocks that offer growth fundamentals, have positive analyst ratings, and display the potential to generate resilient returns in the future.

In addition, we have been impressed with the operational progress this management team has made since taking the helm in 2017. We acknowledge e-commerce trends have been challenged as consumers shift toward in-person experiences post[1]pandemic, but over time we expect industry growth to return to the long-term trend. Shares have pulled back 75% since topping out in late 2021. Examining this opportunity through a longer-term lens, we initiated a GardenSM position during the quarter at an attractive discount to our PMV estimate.”9.

Although their share prices have increased considerably, both companies still look quite undervalued even using longer term oil prices in the $65-70 dollar range. Meanwhile, if times are good over the next couple of years, we expect these companies to return significant percentages of their market caps to shareholders.”8. ON Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:ON)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Beta Value: 1.73ON Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:ON) is an Arizona-based company that provides intelligent sensing and power solutions worldwide.

Fears of fundamental deterioration are ""leading to very bearish investor positioning"" into the Q3 results for semiconductors.

The company reported 49% gross margins in 1Q22 which met the new management team’s 48%-50% long-term target after revising it higher just one quarter ago. We believe ON has a clear path to &gt;50% gross margins, and its financial results reflect the ongoing structural improvements in both manufacturing and products, cost initiatives, product mix and rising prices. Growing demand for chips in electric vehicles, renewable energy infrastructure, advanced driver assistance (multiple cameras), factory automation and machine vision should drive sustainable high single-digit top-line growth.

Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 3.1%, which is fairly typical for the industry. View our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group Goldman Sachs Group's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWhile it is always good to see a solid dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is feasible. Goldman Sachs Group is quite easily earning enough to cover the dividend, however it is being let down by weak cash flows. We think that cash flows should take priority over earnings, so this is definitely a worry for the dividend going forward.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 3.9%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 24% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendGoldman Sachs Group Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $1.40 in 2012, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $10.00. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 22% a year over that time. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Goldman Sachs Group has impressed us by growing EPS at 16% per year over the past five years. With a decent amount of growth and a low payout ratio, we think this bodes well for Goldman Sachs Group's prospects of growing its dividend payments in the future.In SummaryOverall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment. With cash flows lacking, it is difficult to see how the company can sustain a dividend payment. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance.

But if you try your hand at stock picking, your risk returning less than the market. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term Ventas, Inc. (NYSE:VTR) shareholders, since the share price is down 48% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 27%. And more recent buyers are having a tough time too, with a drop of 33% in the last year. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 28% in the last 90 days.It's worthwhile assessing if the company's economics have been moving in lockstep with these underwhelming shareholder returns, or if there is some disparity between the two. So let's do just that. Check out our latest analysis for Ventas There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Ventas saw its EPS decline at a compound rate of 69% per year, over the last three years. This fall in the EPS is worse than the 20% compound annual share price fall. This suggests that the market retains some optimism around long term earnings stability, despite past EPS declines. This positive sentiment is also reflected in the generous P/E ratio of 927.19.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Ventas' key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Ventas's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Ventas the TSR over the last 3 years was -41%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 24% in the twelve months, Ventas shareholders did even worse, losing 31% (even including dividends). Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 4% per year over five years. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks, for example - Ventas has   4 warning signs  (and 1 which is concerning)  we think you should know about.But note: Ventas may not be the best stock to buy.

The Breast Health arm is expected to have seen signs of recovery amid the ongoing chip shortage.We anticipate the company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results, scheduled for release on Oct 31 after the closing bell, to reflect these aspects.Click here to know how the company’s overall fiscal fourth-quarter performance is expected to be.DiagnosticsHologic’s Molecular Diagnostics sales for the fiscal fourth quarter are likely to have been impacted by a significant drop in the demand for COVID-19 testing. However, the company seems to be optimistic about the benefits of non-COVID assays on the Panther system. Particularly, with COVID-19 severity gradually subsiding, women are fast returning to their wellness exams and procedures over the past few months. This might have significantly boosted the segment’s revenues in fiscal Q4.On the fiscal Q3 earnings call, Hologic noted strong global diagnostic business growth amid the adversities. According to the company, this is aclear sign that its expanded Panther installed base is being utilized. This also indicates that Panther is gaining position as an instrument of choice as customers consolidate their molecular testing menu to high throughput, high automation platforms. With the non-COVID testing market improving further through the months of fiscal Q4, we expect improved utilization of the Panther installed base. More specifically, the fourth-quarter performance is expected to have been driven by a combination of both legacy and new assays, namely the BBCVTV vaginitis panel, MGen, CTMG and respiratory menu on the Panther Fusion.Breast HealthDespite being faced with supply chain headwinds related to the semiconductor chip shortage, Hologic has been leaving no stone unturned to address the robust underlying demand for its breast health products. There is likely to have been an improvement in sequential performance by the segment during the fiscal fourth quarter on a robust product portfolio and increasing backlog growth. As the economies around the world return to normalcy, we anticipate a rebound in breast screenings to significantly contribute to the segment’s upcoming results.Story continuesHologic, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseHologic, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseHologic, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Hologic, Inc. QuoteThe ongoing positive trends within Breast Health include stabilizing lead times, procurement through a combination of channels and narrowing the breadth and depth of tight supply. In addition, during the last earnings call, Hologic noted that the sales force continues to place orders in line with quotas set prior to the chip headwind surfacing, and there has been no meaningful change to the rate of canceled orders. A similar trend is expected to get reflected in the Q4 results.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has higher chances of beating estimates.

First off, Snap. Now it moved on the heels of its earnings report. The company posted a further slowdown in sales in its most recent quarter. And it also signaled no growth here going forward. When you take a look at Snap shares, closing the week well in the red. The five-day chart there, you can see it off just around 22%. It's the latest sign that advertisers are still cutting back on spending. The disappointing results dragging some competitors lower today. Meta and Pinterest, both of those stocks ending the day in the red. You can see that off just over 1%. Pinterest, on the other hand, off 6 and 1/2%.Another big mover of the week is Tesla. Now shares sank after the company missed on third quarter revenue and warned that deliveries may fall just short of that 50% annual growth target. Despite that miss, CEO Elon Musk, he, of course, remained upbeat on the earnings call, telling analysts that Tesla remains, quote, ""pedal to the metal,"" even as a potential recession looms. Now shares fell about 6% on Thursday, but taking a look at the week to date chart, you can see it up still in the green, up just around 4.6%, selling the week at 214.44 a share.Now let's round it out with Netflix. The stock also moving on earnings, but this time, a surprise beat on subscriber growth is sending the stocks soaring. Now, shares soared about 13% earlier this week. It's been a top performer in the S&amp;P. This coming after the gain of 2.4 million new users during the third quarter, more than double what they had just projected a quarter ago. The streaming giant also giving details on how it plans to crack down on password sharing. Take a look at this five-day chart. You can see the shares up 25%, selling the week at 289.57. On a year to date basis, though, still well in the red, with shares off just over 50%.]"

And this is over the last five days. Netflix here is the leader. If we sort by equal weight, you can see up in the upper left, Netflix up 25% for the week. And here is a 20-year chart. Now this looks a little bit different. It had been in a nice uptrend and severely broke that. That's what happens with some of these growth stocks. But I just want to show you on a two-year basis what that's looking-- what that is looking like.Now we know the news this week, Netflix has somewhat improved their response to subscriber losses. And it seems like they have that on track right now. Lots of hope with their reengineering strategy, also pushing to increase their revenues through that ad-supported service and also to monetize the freeloaders, a.k.a. me. So we'll see how that works out, guys.DAVE BRIGGS: You are full of surprises today, brother. Oopsies, you had me at that. Netflix is really interesting. Obviously, the story moving forward is the ad tier and the password sharing. But in terms of the actual content, I think it's interesting because they have this sequel to ""Knives Out"" coming, and I always forget the name. It's called ""Glass Onion."" And while the theaters want them to do more of that, this is limited-- one week, 600 theaters. And on the other hand, they've seen ""Dahmer,"" 10th most streamed show of all time.JARED BLIKRE: It's not bad.DAVE BRIGGS: And so you can't help but wonder which direction they'll take in terms of content moving forward. I think the ""Dahmer"" type model seems to favor them a lot more, finding these franchises that put up these massive numbers.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, it certainly does. And it also-- I think it just begs the question, just in terms of what that subscriber growth is going to look like. Like, yes, we got a very, very strong number for the third quarter. I think questions the ad tier is going to boost numbers, at least in the short-term.But how many of those subscribers are going to potentially downgrade? I know you and I have talked about that many times. And how many new subscribers are really going to be able to pull in? Because yes, it's cheaper than what the entry-- what the base price is now. But it's still a lot. And people already are subscribed to so many different services that you've got a question where that saturation number is.DAVE BRIGGS: It will be an interesting story ahead.]"

117,97f1a247-fa51-3862-9c13-a8ae13db2ec1,NEM,2022-10-22,7 Gold Price Predictions for 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-gold-price-predictions-2023-151555662.html,1666106155,STORY,"['HG=F', 'PL=F', 'PA=F', 'SI=F', 'GC=F', 'BHP', 'WPM', 'NEM', 'GOLD', 'RGLD']","[With circumstances continuing to devolve into madness following the onset of the pandemic-fueled new normal, queries regarding gold price predictions for 2023 naturally picked up. Historically, precious metals offer a hedge against currency erosion since they feature intrinsic value. That’s part of the reason why I personally own some physical gold. As well, the metals cynically benefit from the fear trade or broader concerns about economic and perhaps societal instability.Still, the issue about gold price predictions center on the Federal Reserve and its monetary policy. Unfortunately, the Fed fights against macroeconomic dynamics such as rising energy costs, geopolitical flashpoints and a stout labor market, among other factors. Certainly, the Fed succeeded in introducing countervailing deflationary forces, as judged by the rise in purchasing power in July. However, inflationary forces again dominated in September.Therefore, no easy answer exists regarding gold price predictions for 2023. All eyes are on the Fed, true, but it can only do so much. The macros will almost certainly influence the central bank’s decision on how to proceed. Under this context, I’m going to provide two sets of price predictions depending on which force (inflationary or deflationary) wins out.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNEMNewmont$41.54GOLDBarrick Gold$14.81BHPBHP Group$49.15SBSWSibanye Stillwater$9.42WPMWheaton Precious Metals$31.84RGLDRoyal Gold$93.33JAGGFJaguar Mining$2.04Newmont (NEM)A photo of a gold nugget on a table, being picked up by tweezers, with more gold behind it.Source: aerogondo2 / Shutterstock.comA stalwart in the metals mining business, Newmont (NYSE:NEM) is the world’s leading gold company and a producer of copper, silver, zinc and lead, per its website. Currently, the company carries a market cap of $32.99 billion. It also offers a forward yield of 5.32% and commands two years of consecutive dividend increases.According to Gurufocus.com, Newmont may represent a value trap. Simply, the company cratered after a tough second-quarter earnings report. Presently, shares slipped 32% on a year-to-date basis.Story continuesIn terms of gold price predictions, if the Fed succeeds in raising the benchmark interest rate to control inflation, NEM may start 2023 well into the $30 range. Technically, a baseline of support exists at around $38, which is the level shares might “de-risk” at.However, if the macroeconomic forces push inflation higher, NEM could easily retake the $60 level and beyond. Fundamentally, Newmont still carries a decent-quality business, with a return on equity of 3.6% that ranks higher than 78.5% of the competition.Barrick Gold (GOLD)An image of a rising bar graph on top of gold bars, representing gold stocksSource: Alexander Limbach / ShutterstockAnother top name in the gold space, Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) produces the underlying metal and copper with 16 operating sites in 13 countries. Presently, Barrick carries a market cap of $25.9 billion. It also carries a dividend yield of 5.48% at the moment.As of the moment, Gurufocus.com labels GOLD modestly undervalued. Although Barrick presented some encouraging figures such as increases in gold output, the vagaries of this year hurt shares. Since the beginning of this year, GOLD finds itself 21% below parity.For gold price predictions, a deflationary dynamic will continue to weigh heavily on the sector. Technically speaking, a support baseline exists around $12 to $13. That’s probably where shares will head if the Fed aggressively raises the benchmark interest rate.On the other hand, if inflation wins the day, could make a charge back toward the $30 level. Keep in mind that Barrick features a high-quality business. Its return on equity stands at 8.44%, ranked higher than 83% of the competition.BHP Group (BHP)Bitcoin BTC Gold coins with bills of euro banknotes and gold bullion.

Asia Broadband is mixing crypto and gold with its AABBG token.Source: Ewa Studio / Shutterstock.comFor those seeking exposure to gold but not too much exposure, BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) offers a compelling idea. Primarily, the company specializes in copper, iron ore, metallurgical coal, nickel and potash. All of these feature significant applications in industry or agriculture. However, BHP also enjoys exposure to the gold and silver market via its Olympic Dam project.Financially, BHP rates as a modestly undervalued business. While mining always presents certain risks, because of BHP’s broad portfolio, the company is less exposed to any one commodity. For instance, the security lost only 7.5% so far this year. That’s a win under the present bearish conditions.For gold price predictions, BHP largely enjoys a neutral position. Again, a wide canvas allows investors to sleep easier at night. To be sure, inflationary forces should help BHP make a charge back up to $70.On the other hand, deflationary forces may see BHP meander but not lose too much. I say this because the company produces commodities featuring inelastic or critical demand profiles.Sibanye Stillwater (SBSW)A gold bar along with some coins made of precious metals. gold stocksSource: allstars / Shutterstock.comWhile risky, investors ought to give some consideration to diversified precious metals miner Sibanye Stillwater (NYSE:SBSW). Per its website, “Sibanye-Stillwater has established itself as one of the world’s largest primary producers of platinum, palladium, and rhodium and is also a top tier gold producer.”Currently, Sibanye has a market cap of $6.63 billion. Shares slipped over 25% since the beginning of this year, which doesn’t initially offer much encouragement. However, its palladium production should offer a mitigatory effect. Scream all you want about electric vehicles being the future. They are still expensive for many if not most households. Therefore, palladium’s use in catalytic converters should offer much relevance for SBSW.Of course, the topic of the day is gold price predictions. If circumstances become decisively inflationary, I expect SBSW to eventually return to the $20 threshold. Along with gold, other critical metals like palladium and platinum should rise.However, even if circumstances become deflationary, SBSW might just meander sideways. First, Sibanye offers critical metals necessary for industrial applications. Second, the company commands stout profitability metrics, reflecting a high-quality enterprise.Wheaton Precious Metals (WPM)Gold nuggets on top of American paper money representing gold stocksSource: ShutterstockOne of the more reliable market ideas in the gold sector, Wheaton Precious Metals (NYSE:WPM) deploys a streaming business model. Per Motley Fool, streaming refers to “a financial transaction in which a company provides cash up front to a mining company for the right to buy gold at reduced prices in the future.”Theoretically, streaming companies (all other things being equal) provide greater price predictability than direct mining firms. After all, parties to streaming contracts understand what the terms are prior to entering the agreement. Unfortunately, for WPM this year, this thesis did not pan out so well. Since the beginning of this year, WPM lost 25% of equity value, a not untypical loss.That said, if gold prices rise due to stronger-than-expected inflationary forces, Wheaton will likely target $50 and above. Undergirding such a framework are robust financials. Anchored by a very stable balance sheet, Wheaton next enjoys strong growth and profitability metrics.On the other hand, if gold price predictions end up materializing in the southbound direction, WPM may end up dropping to around $26 to $27. That’s where strong technical support lies.Royal Gold (RGLD)Closeup of a large gold nugget. stocks under $10Source: ShutterstockBilled as one of the world’s leading precious metals stream and royalty companies, Royal Gold (NASDAQ:RGLD) engages in the in the acquisition and management of precious metal streams, royalties and similar production-based interests.Per the company’s explanation, a royalty is “a non-operating interest in a mining project that provides the right to a percentage of revenue or metal produced from the project after deducting specified costs, if any.” As with streaming companies, royalty-based enterprises facilitate price predictability. In RGLD’s case, the thesis worked out well. Since the beginning of this year, RGLD slipped 11.5%. It’s not great but comparatively, it’s winning.As for gold price predictions, inflationary tailwinds should bolster RGLD. Incorporating a mix of streaming and royalty business models, RGLD provides concerned investors with convenient exposure to precious metals. Believe me, lugging around bullion is no fun. Look for shares to swing above the psychologically important $140 level.However, under negative gold price predictions, RGLD risks falling into the $80 range. The hope, though, is that its high-quality business should spare it extreme volatility.Jaguar Mining (JAGGF)gold stored in a vault to represent gold stocksSource: ShutterstockOne of the riskiest ideas within the precious metals sector, Jaguar Mining (OTCMKTS:JAGGF) nevertheless deserves consideration for speculators. A Canadian-listed junior gold mining, development, and exploration company, Jaguar conducts operations in Brazil. Immediately, its share price of a few cents above $2 will discourage many investors. However, let’s look at some facts.On a YTD basis, JAGGF hemorrhaged 39.4% of equity value. However, let’s recall Newmont, which didn’t pare losses significantly, down a little over 32%. Use Google Finance’s tool to stack the two charts together. Sure, NEM managed to swing higher into the second half of April. But eventually, both NEM and JAGGF succumbed to broader market forces. So, eschewing the junior miners in favor of the blue chips doesn’t always work out successfully.Regarding gold price predictions, if inflation wins the day, I expect JAGGF shares to fly higher. At minimum, look for shares to double by late 2023 to early 2024 under inflationary conditions. Unlike garbage gold stocks, Jaguar enjoys surprisingly solid financials, including a 14.2% return on equity that ranks higher than 88% of the competition.Should gold prices succumb to deflationary pressures, though, I believe JAGGF risks a trip to $1, if not worse.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Value Stocks That Are Too Cheap To Ignore.The current bloodbath that stock markets are facing could not have been predicted by Nostradamus himself if he were alive last year. The ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine has led to the disruption of the global energy markets, which, when paired with the lax monetary policies of central banks all around, has resulted in skyrocketing inflation. The banks are now on an interest rate hike spree, which is leading to capital flowing out of the markets into more secure assets such as the U.S. dollar.This has caused high growth stocks, and those that have invested in them, such as Cathie Wood's Ark Investment, to make big losses this year. For instance, shares of the consumer electronics giant Apple, Inc are down a massive 21% year to date and those of Tesla have bled an even more massive 45% in value this year. Similarly, Ms. Wood's Ark Investment has lost large sums of money as well, with its flagship Ark Innovation fund down a painful 60% year to date as of October 2022.Against this backdrop, value stocks, or those that are trading in more modest price to earnings ranges, are starting to look attractive. As opposed to eye catching technology players that have the potential for vast amounts of growth due to disruptive technologies forming the backbone of their operations, value stocks are those that chug along at a stable pace, in the background, and without demanding much attention. The price to earnings ratio is used to measure the 'premium' that market participants are willing to pay for a company over its bottom line earnings, and high growth stocks have higher P/E ratios as their future earnings potential is judged to be higher than current earnings.Not only the P/E ratio but industries can also be used to pick out value stocks. For example, large-scale pharmaceutical retailers tend to have low growth estimates but stable revenues - with the latter becoming even more important now as the threat of a recession looms in the not so distant future. While all stocks lose their value in a recession, value stocks are less prone to large swings in investor or market sentiment, and some have even managed to grow during troubling times due to stable earnings from essential products such as medicines.Story continuesIn today's piece, we have selected some top value stocks for you, and some notable picks include CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS), and QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM).Photo by Ruben Sukatendel on UnsplashOur Methodology We took a broad look at several industries to identify the value players in sectors such as energy, pharmaceuticals, and retail.

Yet, after the maintenance, they will run at full capacity for the next year, implying that there is a strong potential upside to the shares.Additionally, UAN28 nitrogen prices have started to rise again after dropping earlier this year, and the shortage of gas in Europe is believed to further contribute to the growing prices.

Last month, Puerto Rico Governor Pedro Pierluisi asked the White House for a waiver to increase the availability of fuel after the storm.The lawmakers agreed with the Maritime Administration that consideration of a waiver while a vessel is already underway is ""novel and problematic"" and said they ""would like to better understand the reasoning for your decision to issue a waiver for a company that appeared to be gaming the Jones Act waiver process.""BP and DHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for Buttigieg said the department would respond to the lawmakers.On Sunday, DHS granted a second waiver to address Puerto Rico's urgent need for liquefied natural gas.On Monday, the White House said ""fuel companies are reminded that any request to waive the Jones Act ... should be made using the standard processes and timelines with which these companies are very familiar.""

It is always easy for cynical but conflicted industry analysts and commentators to lob politicized beanbags at the administration’s decisions. Sure, the White House may have had ups and downs with some mistakes early on—as well as poor messaging on energy solutions. But listening to these biased industry complaints has increasingly become a tale of two realities.The prevailing narrative presented by most energy analysts is that of a dire and dystopian global oil “supply shock” outlook. They portray the administration as largely rudderless on energy challenges, politicizing releases of the fast-dwindling strategic petroleum reserves (SPR) to put a band-aid on lowering prices before the midterm elections, unable to tackle supply challenges. They further fault the administration for simultaneously offending the second- and third-largest oil producers, Saudi Arabia and Russia, amidst drastic OPEC+ production cuts and the European Union’s sixth sanctions package to ban Russian oil in December. And they accuse the White House of murdering U.S. energy independence by launching an ESG crusade against oil, blocking pipelines, cutting federal leases and threatening energy companies’ access to capital and the outlook for long-term demand.But this dystopic vision is grounded in misleading information. Perhaps these energy analysts would be wise to redirect their fire from President Biden and target their skepticism towards the duplicitous Saudi-Russian OPEC+ cartel instead. These biased analysts, who projected that oil would be $400/barrel by now instead of the current $84/barrel, do not acknowledge certain key realities, including:Story continues* The U.S. is now the world’s largest oil producer and needs almost no Saudi oil; as the U.S. has already cut its imports of Saudi oil by over 90% over the last decade to a mere 356,000 barrels a day.* The U.S. owned Aramco but recklessly gave it to the Saudis when President Nixon and Henry Kissinger panicked in the 1970s.* Gasoline prices should have fallen recently to match the decline in crude oil, but refineries are enjoying a soaring windfall, with profits quadrupling from 2021 levels. Refiners have added $30 a barrel in refining margins on top of the price of crude—even though 1 million barrels per day in refining capacity was added in 2022 with more coming in 2023. That’s not counting the return of hundreds of thousands of barrels of capacity which was taken offline due to idiosyncratic outages and disruptions the last couple months due to refinery mismanagement.* The billions of dollars oil producers lost in 2020 was not due to Biden, who had not been elected yet, but due to COVID-related economic shutdowns.* Federal leases under Biden far exceed those under Trump—with 3,557 permits for oil and gas drilling on public lands in Biden’s first year, far outpacing the Trump Administration’s first year total of 2,658, with record numbers of unused leases. That’s the case even though all federal leases combined account for less than 20% of all U.S. oil and gas production.* The U.S. already provides more gas to the EU than Russia did at its peak, and now the EU buys 80% less from Russia than they did before Russia’s attack on Ukraine.* The recent Saudi/OPEC price hike was not justified by oil markets as producers were already making 80% profit margins. Only the inefficient oil producer Russia, with break-even production costs twice that of Saudi Arabia, needed these price hikes, to fuel its war.* U.S. SPR releases are not political. Every modern president has authorized significant SPR releases, including Donald Trump—who likewise faced attacks from self-serving industry voices. Furthermore countries like Saudi and China maintain their own sizable strategic petroleum reserves from which they released ample supplies at least until this year.* Biden’s new policy of replenishing the SPR through futures contracts, taking advantage of backward-dated futures markets where oil is hovering cheaply around $70 a barrel, locks in hefty profits for domestic oil producers for years to come—which Riyadh refused to do.Similarly, contrary to Vladimir Putin propaganda that Western sanctions will lead to energy supply shocks, it is in fact Putin who is willingly withholding both oil and gas supplies. The U.S. Treasury Department has proactively put forward the price cap scheme explicitly to stave off a supply shock come Dec. 5, when further EU sanctions kick in, ensuring Russian oil continues flowing to global markets while simultaneously limiting Putin’s revenue.Any decision by Putin to withhold oil supply after Dec. 5 the way he is withholding gas supply from Europe would be a catastrophic, unforced mistake. He will likely have to reverse himself, much the same way he is now begging Europe to buy more Russian gas after months of blackmail.And to the great chagrin of many environmental advocates, Biden has been laying the groundwork for a gradual transition to clean energy, not the overnight transformation that boogeyman industry critics have been urging him to make. His speech this week explicitly called for an increase in domestic oil and gas production as well as much-needed permitting reform to expedite the construction of energy infrastructure, particularly gas pipelines which can be converted to green hydrogen pipelines over time.Perhaps it is even more surprising that many analysts retain any market credibility at all, considering the number of missed calls by many analysts the last year alone. Among them.* Some denied that OPEC+ was going to have an unscheduled October surprise with a production cutback of 2 million barrels.* Many believed Saudi propaganda that the kingdom had no spare capacity, when in fact the Saudis are 33% off production levels from two years prior, while refusing to release SPR inventory. * These experts believed Riyadh’s pleas that a production cut was needed to maintain profitability, never appreciating that U.S. technology enables the Saudis to extract oil as far less than half the cost of Russian oil, with low break-evens of ~$22 a barrel.* They forgot to figure in the massively higher shipping costs for getting Russian oil to Asia, buying into Putin’s “pivot to Asia” mythology. They likewise wrongly believed that gas was fungible and that Putin could pivot from selling piped gas to Europe to China—though he does not have the needed pipelines.* Many, including JP Morgan, said oil by now would cost $380/barrel* They underestimated the speed of liquified natural gas (LNG) to backfill for Russian gas to the EU (the U.S. now sells more gas to the EU than Russia did at its peak in February). Fully 86% of Russian gas went to the EU but the EU didn’t need it as much as Putin needed to sell it to them.* They didn’t imagine that Germany could construct six massive LNG conversion plants in record time to supplement existing 150 bcm of re-gasification capacity.Evidently, when it comes to energy industry analysts, sometimes the emperor is naked—with these conflicted experts too close to their own biased industry sources, repeatedly mistakenly falling for Saudi and Russian misinformation. Riyadh no longer even bothers to disguise its blatant manipulation of industry analysts. Recently the Saudi oil minister publicly, mercilessly berated a Reuters reporter and banned Reuters from OPEC+ meetings while showering favored analysts he deemed “kind friends” with extensive access during the most recent OPEC+ press conference. No wonder that with so many industry experts on the Saudi payroll or reliant on access to Saudi sources, experts shudder in fear at the thought of crossing Riyadh.Transcending the industry analysts parroting the heavy-handed misinformation of the Saudi-Russia OPEC+ alliance, U.S. energy policy is quite promising—neither giving industry a blank check nor folding to Saudi blackmail like lawn furniture.

With the price of bitcoin stubbornly hanging around in the $20,000 area, the boosted costs make it even more difficult for miners to break even.Hosting is a service that data centers provide to crypto miners so that customers can store their mining rigs and mine digital assets for a fee without having to build the infrastructure themselves. Core Scientific has both a hosting and mining business, with 22.5 exahash/second (EH/s) of its own and others' computing power in its data centers across the U.S. The company is actually losing money of late on hosting operations, according to its most recent earnings report.A Core Scientific spokesperson declined to comment on the specifics, but said that ""increased power costs are passed through"" to customers ...

The Canadian oil and gas industry wants a level playing field as Ottawa targets net zero emissions by 2050, the same goal set by U.S. President Joe Biden.Canada is home to the world's third-largest oil reserves and is the fifth-biggest producer of natural gas, and the industry says it needs more government rebates to help scale up CCS technology.In the federal budget, Canada estimated it would spend C$2.6 billion ($1.9 billion) on the tax credits in the first five years, and then C$1.5 billion per year through 2030.""We've given a lot... If more money is needed, then it should come from the provinces,"" a senior government source said this week, adding that requests for more federal spending on carbon capture are coming ""mostly from Alberta.""Oil and gas is Canada's highest-polluting sector, but also contributes around 7.5% annually to national GDP and is a major employer in Alberta. Supporters of CCS say it is key to keeping the western oil patch at work while at the same time allowing Canada to meet its commitment to cutting carbon emissions.Story continues""We've ponied up big time,"" said a second senior source on Friday. ""The province can have a role here, too... They can totally be partners in this.""Both sources were not authorized to speak on the record.URGING OTTAWA TO DO MOREThe province responded by batting the ball back at the federal government.""We are strongly urging Ottawa to expand the proposed investment tax credit to meet or exceed the Inflation Reduction Act – otherwise, carbon capture investments will be drawn south of the border,"" Alberta Energy ministry spokesperson Alex Puddifant said.The province has already ""invested or committed"" C$1.8 billion ($1.3 billion) to develop CCS, Puddifant said. Neither the oil and gas companies nor the province have said how much in additional spending is needed.Over the last decade, the Alberta government has invested in infrastructure including the Quest carbon capture project, operated by Shell and the Alberta Carbon Trunk Line.Canada has welcomed introduction of the IRA because it puts the United States on a path toward the green transition without penalizing Canada with electric vehicle consumer tax credits only for American carmakers, as had initially been announced.Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland said this week that she would look to bolster incentives in some areas - without saying which ones - to help industry scale up clean technologies and level the playing field with the United States.In March, Alberta picked six proposals to move forward on developing a carbon storage hub near Edmonton. Earlier this month, it released a list of 19 other projects chosen to explore developing potential storage hubs, including one by the Oilsands Pathways Alliance to Net Zero, which includes Canada's biggest oil producers Canadian Natural Resources Ltd and Suncor Energy.""We continue to have discussions with both federal and provincial governments about the level of financial support needed to kickstart major CCS investment in Canada,"" said Mark Cameron, vice president of external relations for Pathways Alliance.""The United States... offers financial incentives that are much more generous to build major CCS projects in the U.S. than in Canada,"" he added.($1 = 1.3663 Canadian dollars)(Reporting by Steve Scherer in Ottawa and Nia Williams in British Columbia, additional reporting by Rod Nickel in Winnipeg; Editing by Bill Berkrot)]"

(NYSE:ZTS) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Zoetis Zoetis Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Catherine Knupp, for US$2.2m worth of shares, at about US$217 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$147. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.In the last year Zoetis insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year.

(Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider Ownership Of ZoetisFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Insiders own 0.07% of Zoetis shares, worth about US$49m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Zoetis Insiders?The fact that there have been no Zoetis insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. Still, the insider transactions at Zoetis in the last 12 months are not very heartening. But it's good to see that insiders own shares in the company. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

(NYSE:NEE) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/79-ownership-shares-nextera-energy-110048690.html,1666436448,STORY,"['NEE', 'NEE-PR']","[To get a sense of who is truly in control of NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 79% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about NextEra Energy. See our latest analysis for NextEra Energy ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About NextEra Energy?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in NextEra Energy. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of NextEra Energy, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in NextEra Energy. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.4%. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.4% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 5.7% of the company stock.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of NextEra EnergyWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of NextEra Energy, Inc.. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$238m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 21% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand NextEra Energy better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for NextEra Energy  that you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

134,94aef029-a338-369d-b083-3c199fcdd1d3,NEE,2022-10-22,NextEra Energy (NEE) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nextera-energy-nee-earnings-expected-140002808.html,1666360802,STORY,"['NEE', 'NEE-PR', 'XEL']","[NextEra Energy (NEE) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 28. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis parent company of Florida Power &amp; Light Co. Is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.79 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +5.3%.Revenues are expected to be $6.34 billion, up 45% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.84% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for NextEra?For NextEra, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.91%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that NextEra will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that NextEra would post earnings of $0.75 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.81, delivering a surprise of +8%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.NextEra appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, Xcel Energy (XEL) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.25 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +10.6%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $3.56 billion, up 2.6% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Xcel has been revised 6.3% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -0.40%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Xcel will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of $1.34 per share on revenues of $6.7 billion.Let’s delve into the factors that might have influenced the power supplier’s performance in the September quarter. But it’s worth taking a look at Southern Company’s previous-quarter results first.Highlights of Q2 Earnings &amp; Surprise HistoryIn the last reported quarter, the Atlanta, GA-based service provider beat the consensus mark due to the positive effects of rates, usage and pricing changes, plus a demand boost from warmer-than-normal weather. Southern Company had reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.07, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 84 cents. Revenues of $7.2 billion had also come in 28.1% above the consensus mark.SO topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters. The utility has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 9.4%, on average. This is depicted in the graph below: Southern Company The Price and EPS SurpriseSouthern Company The Price and EPS SurpriseSouthern Company The price-eps-surprise | Southern Company The Quote Factors to ConsiderSouthern Company's seven major regulated utilities serve approximately nine million electric and natural gas customers. Leveraging the demographics of its operating territories, the firm has been successfully expanding its regulated business customer base. As proof of that effort, Southern Company added some 12,000 new residential electric customers and more than 7,000 residential natural gas customers in the second quarter. This trend most likely continued in the July-September period of 2022 because of healthy economic development across its service territories.In particular, the firm is expected to have benefited from higher retail electricity sales, reflecting economic recovery in the Southeast in the form of demand from industrial buyers. Finally, investment in state-regulated electric/gas franchises and continued trends in hybrid working have most likely buoyed Southern Company’s revenues and cash flows.On a somewhat bearish note, the power supplier’s total operating cost in the second quarter increased 23.6% year over year to $5.6 billion. The upward cost trajectory is likely to have continued in the second quarter due to inflationary pressures.Story continuesWhat Does Our Model Say?The proven Zacks model does not conclusively show that Southern Company is likely to beat estimates in the third quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates. But that’s not the case here.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, for this company is -0.38%.Zacks Rank: Southern Company currently carries a Zacks Rank #1.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for Southern Company, here are some firms from the utilities space that you may want to consider on the basis of our model:FirstEnergy Corp. FE has an Earnings ESP of +3.45% and a Zacks Rank #2. The firm is scheduled to release earnings on Oct 25.Over 60 days, FE has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 increase 1.3%.

Positive factors for QuantumScape include that the company has the potential to become a leader in the industry, and its technology has generated interest from innumerable auto manufacturers.Despite the positive outlook for its contribution to EV performance and cost, QS stock currently has limited upside in the current market.Honeywell International (HON)Honeywell (HON) logo on front of glass buildingSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.comHoneywell International (NASDAQ:HON) produces various products for both the commercial and consumer markets. It is one of the oldest companies in the United States and has been operating since 1906.Due to its size and strength, the company is a relatively safe play when discussing battery stocks to buy and hold. Honeywell has performed well during challenging economic conditions. It has allowed the company to become a solid income play as well.

Jonas explained that FREYR has the right talent and strategy to dominate a currently undersupplied market. It is high praise for a company that is still pre-revenue.Despite being a young company, FREYR Battery has assembled an impressive roster of partners. Recently, it inked a deal with Japanese electric motor giant Nidec for a joint venture.Freyr will supply a total of up to 50 GWh of Li-ion battery cells from 2025-2030. For now, it’s aiming for 38GWh, but under the agreement, it can deliver a higher volume from 2025-2030 and increase delivery even after 2030. The binding 38 GWh sales contract has a gross value of $3 billion and is one of the largest energy storage systems deals globally.The combination of robust prospects, strong partnerships, and an excellent management team make FREYR Battery one of the best battery stocks to buy and hold.Albemarle (ALB)Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screenSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.comAlbemarle (NYSE:ALB) has subsidiaries in the United States and Europe and is a global producer of chemicals.Albemarle’s products are used to manufacture Li-ion batteries for electric vehicles. Lithium hydroxide provides a source of lithium ions during battery charging, while lithium carbonate provides a source of lithium ions during battery discharge.Albemarle is developing several major production projects in Chile, Australia, and China to meet the increased global demand for lithium. As prices have risen for lithium and as demand has surged, Albemarle has invested more significantly to maintain its position as one of the best battery stocks to buy and hold.Albemarle’s business could go up and down like that of commodity producers. This is because the lithium and other important materials it mines for will fluctuate in availability and price. Some years will be good, others may not be as good. However, for the next decade, demand for batteries will likely remain elevated due to the uptake of EVs.Battery Stocks to Buy and Hold: BYD (BYDDF)BYD Company Limited logo in front of their website.

The consensus estimate for market data and information services is pegged at $153 million, up 5.5% from the year-ago reported figure.Expenses are likely to have decreased in the to-be-reported quarter due to lower compensation and benefits, technology, reduced professional fees and outside services, amortization of purchased intangibles, lower depreciation and amortization.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings per share is pegged at $1.93, indicating an increase of 20.6% from the year-ago quarter reported figure.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for CME Group this time around.

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Value Stocks That Are Too Cheap To Ignore.The current bloodbath that stock markets are facing could not have been predicted by Nostradamus himself if he were alive last year. The ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine has led to the disruption of the global energy markets, which, when paired with the lax monetary policies of central banks all around, has resulted in skyrocketing inflation. The banks are now on an interest rate hike spree, which is leading to capital flowing out of the markets into more secure assets such as the U.S. dollar.This has caused high growth stocks, and those that have invested in them, such as Cathie Wood's Ark Investment, to make big losses this year. For instance, shares of the consumer electronics giant Apple, Inc are down a massive 21% year to date and those of Tesla have bled an even more massive 45% in value this year. Similarly, Ms. Wood's Ark Investment has lost large sums of money as well, with its flagship Ark Innovation fund down a painful 60% year to date as of October 2022.Against this backdrop, value stocks, or those that are trading in more modest price to earnings ranges, are starting to look attractive. As opposed to eye catching technology players that have the potential for vast amounts of growth due to disruptive technologies forming the backbone of their operations, value stocks are those that chug along at a stable pace, in the background, and without demanding much attention. The price to earnings ratio is used to measure the 'premium' that market participants are willing to pay for a company over its bottom line earnings, and high growth stocks have higher P/E ratios as their future earnings potential is judged to be higher than current earnings.Not only the P/E ratio but industries can also be used to pick out value stocks. For example, large-scale pharmaceutical retailers tend to have low growth estimates but stable revenues - with the latter becoming even more important now as the threat of a recession looms in the not so distant future. While all stocks lose their value in a recession, value stocks are less prone to large swings in investor or market sentiment, and some have even managed to grow during troubling times due to stable earnings from essential products such as medicines.Story continuesIn today's piece, we have selected some top value stocks for you, and some notable picks include CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS), and QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM).Photo by Ruben Sukatendel on UnsplashOur Methodology We took a broad look at several industries to identify the value players in sectors such as energy, pharmaceuticals, and retail. The firms were then selected after analyzing their financials and market dynamics, following which they were ranked through Insider Monkey's 895 hedge fund survey for the second quarter of this year. These stocks are cheap when compared to their peers and true value.10 Value Stocks That Are Too Cheap To Ignore10. CVR Partners, LP (NYSE:UAN) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 4 CVR Partners, LP (NYSE:UAN) is a nitrogen fertilizer company that is headquartered in Sugar Land, Texas, the United States. The firm provides its products to both industrial and agricultural customers, and it deals through retailers and distributors.CVR Partners, LP (NYSE:UAN) is one of the cheapest stocks in the fertilizer industry, as it is currently priced only four times its expected earnings for the full year 2022. Additionally, there is some negative sentiment about the firm's upcoming third quarter earnings, since its plants had to be shut off for unavoidable maintenance. Yet, after the maintenance, they will run at full capacity for the next year, implying that there is a strong potential upside to the shares.Additionally, UAN28 nitrogen prices have started to rise again after dropping earlier this year, and the shortage of gas in Europe is believed to further contribute to the growing prices. By the end of this year's second quarter, four out of the 895 hedge funds polled by Insider Monkey had invested in CVR Partners, LP (NYSE:UAN).

Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's limited.QUALCOMM certainly has been doing a good job lately as it's been growing earnings more than most other companies. It might be that many expect the strong earnings performance to degrade substantially, which has repressed the P/E. If not, then existing shareholders have reason to be quite optimistic about the future direction of the share price. View our latest analysis for QUALCOMM peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on QUALCOMM.How Is QUALCOMM's Growth Trending?In order to justify its P/E ratio, QUALCOMM would need to produce sluggish growth that's trailing the market.Retrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 41% gain to the company's bottom line. The strong recent performance means it was also able to grow EPS by 330% in total over the last three years. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been superb for the company.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 1.5% during the coming year according to the analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 8.3%, which is noticeably more attractive.In light of this, it's understandable that QUALCOMM's P/E sits below the majority of other companies. Apparently many shareholders weren't comfortable holding on while the company is potentially eyeing a less prosperous future.The Key TakeawayWe'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.We've established that QUALCOMM maintains its low P/E on the weakness of its forecast growth being lower than the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for an improvement in earnings isn't great enough to justify a higher P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price rising strongly in the near future under these circumstances.Story continuesIt is also worth noting that we have found 2 warning signs for QUALCOMM (1 is a bit concerning!) that you need to take into consideration.You might be able to find a better investment than QUALCOMM.

146,f1ddb8d9-48d6-38f2-ba31-8b0e5f3c9802,QCOM,2022-10-22,October Stock Picks: 7 Chip Stocks to Buy on Dips,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/october-stock-picks-7-chip-023357076.html,1666146837,STORY,"['TXN', 'QCOM', 'LRCX', 'AMAT', 'INTC', 'CAMT']","[Technology stocks have been battered and bruised in 2022, with the Nasdaq down 32% year to date. As bad as that is, semiconductor stocks have easily outpaced the downturn in the broader tech sector, with the PHLX Semiconductor Index falling 44% so far this year. However, unlike some high-flying tech stocks that had no basis for their lofty valuations, the companies that make semiconductor chips and equipment are vital to the economy. Their products are the basis of the world as we know it. Of course, that’s not to say their share prices can’t go lower from here. With this in mind, today I have seven chip stocks to buy on dips.The short-term outlook for semiconductor stocks remains challenging, with companies facing demand issues, as well as higher costs. Yet, a few recent developments bode well for the sector longer term.The first is the passage of the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, which “provides $52.7 billion for American semiconductor research, development, manufacturing, and workforce development.” The bill has already spurred some major semiconductor companies to announce plans to expand manufacturing in the U.S.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMore recently, the Biden administration announced export controls that will greatly impede the ability of Chinese tech firms to buy semiconductor-making equipment, technology and software from American vendors. Chinese officials have complained this will quash the chip industry there, stifling China’s ability to innovate in areas such as autonomous vehicles and genetic sequencing. However, China’s loss could be America’s gain.These seven chip stocks to buy are particularly well-positioned given the renewed focus on the domestic semiconductor industry.TXNTexas Instruments$151.51LRCXLam Research$322.06AMATApplied Materials$75.23QCOMQualcomm$111.21CAMTCamtek$21.96INTCIntel$25.87MUMicron Technology$52.55Texas Instruments (TXN)Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comStory continuesTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is your classic sleep-well-at-night chip stock. The firm is incredibly resilient due to its differentiated business model. Instead of chasing fast-moving semiconductor markets like chips for consumer electronics, Texas Instruments has built its business around slower-moving analog semiconductors.These are chips that process real-world information and turn it into data. They are vital for applications such as autonomous driving, remote monitoring and internet of things devices. Texas Instruments has a catalog of around 80,000 products, which covers tons of application-specific niches. Because of this, the firm has created a business that is recession-resistant and not particularly tied to any specific product or technology trend.Texas Instruments is also a shareholder-friendly operation. Management prioritizes growing free cash flow per share above all else. This has allowed the company to give tons of cash back to shareholders via its dividend and sizable share repurchase program.TXN stock currently trades for less than 17 times forward earnings and offers a solid 3.3% dividend yield.Lam Research (LRCX)Lam Research sign and logo at semiconductor company Lam Research Corporation headquarters in Silicon Valley. LRCX StockSource: Michael Vi / ShutterstockLam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) is a semiconductor equipment maker that currently commands about 10% of the market. The stock performed well over the long term as the company capitalized on the rapid growth of the global semiconductor market.Shares are down sharply over the past month, thanks in large part to the new China export restrictions. A significant portion of Lam’s overall revenue comes from China. Thus, Lam may face a short-term hit from the Biden administration’s new policy.Over the longer term, though, Lam could benefit from these changes. After all, demand for semiconductors is unlikely to fall given current technological trends. Lam can earn similar profits selling to vendors in China as ones based out of Europe or North America. Meanwhile, efforts to slow China’s semiconductor industry growth should, over time, create a bigger moat for Lam’s own products and intellectual property.Following a 55% year-to-date decline in LRCX stock, shares now trade for just 8.6 times forward earnings.Applied Materials (AMAT)Applied Materials company sign outside officeSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.comApplied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) is a direct rival to Lam Research and, thus, faces many of the same challenges and opportunities. This summer, AMAT stock sold off on worries about a cyclical downturn in chip demand and competition from China undercutting Applied Materials’ prices. The CHIPS and Science Act seemed like a clear positive for American semiconductor companies like Applied Materials, but some analysts feared it would be too little, too late in terms of stemming the competitive tide from cheaper overseas vendors.Now that the Biden administration has upped the ante with far-stricter export restrictions, this should greatly slow competition from China. Ironically enough, AMAT stock sold off on the news as investors worried about the short-term revenue hit from not selling to Chinese firms. However, over the longer term, the renewed focus on American manufacturing in this industry is a positive for the company.Investors’ reaction illustrates a larger issue in the chips sector right now. Lately, it seems all news is bad news for chips stocks. Competition from overseas? That’s bad. Government efforts to slow down that competition? Apparently also bad. It’s as if traders are using any excuse to sell chips stocks. When the tide turns, however, there will be a tremendous revaluing of core semiconductor names such as Applied Materials.After dropping by 52% this year, AMAT stock is now selling for just 10.2 times forward earnings.Qualcomm (QCOM)Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on a large sign with another sign that says 5GSource: Xixi Fu / Shutterstock.comQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) has built its business around mobile communications ecosystems. The company is a leader in the design and intellectual property around 3G and 4G and has earned hefty licensing fees from handset makers for its technology.Qualcomm continues to bring in tons of revenue from its work in these areas, and the company has defended its patents in court to ensure that the money keeps coming in. However, the company isn’t resting on its laurels.Qualcomm is at the center of 5G rollouts. It’s developed its own chips like Snapdragon for high-end applications such as newer Android phones. The firm is also broadening its reach beyond smartphones, with moves into connected cars and the internet of things.With shares down 40% year to date, QCOM stock is selling for 8.6 times forward earnings. That will look like a bargain once the current sector slump starts to let up.Camtek (CAMT)Camtek Ltd logo visible on display screen.Source: Pavel Kapysh via shutterstockCamtek (NASDAQ:CAMT) is an Israeli company with a global footprint that offers high-end inspection and metrology equipment to the semiconductor industry. When semiconductor companies are building or expanding fabrication facilities, they need to ensure that everything is in perfect working order. Even the tiniest defect or a poorly calibrated machine can render expensive semiconductor materials worthless. With the shortages in the semiconductor supply chain, avoiding waste has become more important than ever.This has put Camtek in a great position. The company has grown revenue from $93 million in 2017 to an estimated $322 million in 2022. Meanwhile, shares are up 284% over the past five years, and that includes the 52% drop in 2022.Camtek is well-positioned in the coming years. The CHIPS Act will subsidize a lot of new semiconductor fabs in the United States. These new facilities will need testing and inspection equipment, and Camtek should be able to find a leading role in filling that demand.Intel (INTC)Close up of Intel sign at their San Jose campus in Silicon ValleySource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock has lost half of its value so far this year. That’s an incredible decline for such a dominant blue-chip company.After a surge in personal computer sales during the pandemic, demand has now collapsed. Research firm Gartner reported a 19.5% decline in PC sales in Q3 versus the same period in 2021. This was the worst drop in two decades.Intel is still reliant on personal computing, along with the server and database market, to generate a large portion of its revenue. So the company’s profits, not surprisingly, are declining.However, the long-term outlook remains bright. Intel spends more than $15 billion annually on research and development, which allows it to remain in a leadership position in its core markets. It also invests heavily in growth initiatives, such as self-driving vehicle technology.After this year’s big decline in shares, INTC stock trades for 9.2 times forward earnings and offers a 5.5% dividend yield.Micron Technology (MU)mu stockSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) rounds out this list of chip socks to buy. A year ago, the company appeared to have turned the corner. The memory chip leader was producing tremendous earnings and appeared to have finally overcome the historical boom/bust cycle in the memory and storage industry.Fast forward a year, however, and things are currently looking grim. Micron is fresh off earning $8.35 per share for its fiscal 2022, which ended Sept. 1. That is a tremendous level of profitability for a company with a $53 share price. But those earnings aren’t set to last. Analysts are currently forecasting a stunning 96.5% drop in Micron’s current fiscal year earnings to just 29 cents per share. Partially as a result of this dismal outlook, shares are down 44% year to date.However, things aren’t as bad as they might seem. Many of the weaker players in the memory industry are merging with stronger companies or shutting down operations. The growth of consumer electronics, as an industry, has created more stable longer-term demand. Micron is going to have a rough 2023, no doubt, but analysts see earnings jumping back to $3.88 a share for fiscal 2024.That should be enough to get Micron shares trending in the right direction, especially since it is one of the more prominent beneficiaries of the CHIPS Act.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in QCOM, TXN and INTC stock.

It's something we have proudly maintained to this day. Now, we are looking further, exploring opportunities to align our business with a Net Zero future.A MORE EFFICIENT EXPEDIA GROUPTo minimize our impact, we must find ways to do more with less. Whether it's making the switch to LED lighting or transferring data storage to cloud-based systems, we are continually pursuing better, more efficient ways to power operations.SUSTAINABLE OPERATIONSThe first step to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is understanding our current impact. We annually calculate and report our emissions, helping track year-over-year changes and are creating a transparent, publicly available record of efforts.As it was for so many other companies, 2021 was a complicated year in terms of our operational carbon footprint. While some of our office spaces remained closed to ensure employee safety, utilities had to remain running to keep facilities functioning.

The recent data signals that we may be headed further into the depths before there is any respite from Wall Street. Hence, it’s likely to be a torrid time ahead for investors.The Federal Reserve will continue raising interest rates aggressively to cool down the economy. This will be done despite the controversy among market participants, who feel it will lead to a financial crisis.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe recently-released consumer price index is at a 40-year high and, given the labor market’s strength, the equity market will continue to buckle under pressure.Wall Street seems to agree that we are heading for a recession, but no one can tell how bad it will get. Hence, it’s time to get serious about reducing your risk. Investors need to sell off investments in companies with poor outlooks and fundamentals, along with strong headwinds.NLYAnnaly Capital Management$17.27TLRYTilray Brands$3.39RDFNRedfin$4.40PTONPeloton $7.70ZMZoom Video $78.54VRMVroom$1.00COINCoinbase$68.12Annaly Capital Management (NLY)Toy houses rest atop stacks of coins while a hand dangles a set of keys in the air.Source: ShutterstockAnnaly Capital Management (NYSE:NLY) is a mortgage real estate investment trust that has been a popular income stock option over the years.Over the past decade, it has been a poor investment, shedding more than 70% of its value. With the current mortgage rates rising amidst Fed tightening, NLY stock is in more for an even more challenging time ahead.It recently undertook a reverse stock split to inflate its stock value, but the market didn’t take too kindly to the development. The stock down by double-digit margins since the split.Inflation numbers for September were far from encouraging, too, which points to more rate hikes in the upcoming months. Therefore, things aren’t going to get any easier for NLY anytime soon.Story continuesTilray Brands (TLRY)In this photo illustration Tilray logo of a Canadian pharmaceutical and cannabis company is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.Source: viewimage / Shutterstock.comTilray Brands (NASDAQ:TLRY) has been one of the more popular cannabis stocks. However, it hasn’t produced any results warranting praise from investors. In the past four quarters, it has beat revenue estimates just one time.In its recently reported fiscal 2023 first quarter results, it missed analyst targets by $3.6 million, generating just $152 million. Its combination with Aphria hasn’t paid many dividends despite the Canadian market’s progress. Its results show that the company has failed to manage its business operations effectively.Prime cannabis sales saw a revenue drop of $12 million year-over-year, with the only bright spot being its beverage alcohol business.Furthermore, it has limited access to the U.S. market on legalization. Its only investment is in MedMen Enterprises, while its peers are far ahead in their positioning in the U.S. Therefore, TLRY is a stock to avoid.Redfin (RDFN)Redfin sign posted in front of a house for sale; Redfin (RDFN) is a real estate brokerage whose business model is based on sellers paying Redfin a small feeSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comRedfin (NASDAQ:RDFN) is another stock that has witnessed massive price erosion in the past 12 months. Its stock has lost a frightening 88% of its value year to date and continues to trade in the red amidst an unprecedented economic situation.In a more conducive housing environment, Redfin’s revenues had been growing by triple-digit margins last year. However, it suffered a dramatic revenue growth slowdown in its second quarter. Gross margins are sliding for its real estate transactions and properties segments with net debt over $1 billion.A key problem with Redfin is that it employs real-estate agents directly, making its cost structure more fixed than its peers. Moreover, the company’s supply of homebuyers is drying up with rising mortgage prices. Homebuyers are in a tough spot with the Fed vowing to raise rates at a frantic pace.Peloton (PTON)Peloton (PTON stock) sign on city storefrontSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comHome-gym equipment provider Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) was a pandemic darling, with its stock price appreciating from $20 in March 2020 to $168 in January last year.It benefitted from the closure of gyms across the country, with people changing their lifestyles. Consequently, its sales grew by a whopping $850.9 million, representing 87.27% growth in fiscal 2020. The following year, it witnessed an even bigger surge in sales, adding an additional $2.2 billion to revenues.However, the scenario has changed completely in the post-pandemic world. Its total revenues declined by $439.7 million, losing $2.8 billion.The company simply cannot replace the opportunity to exercise outdoors, which is why its business will continue to roll downhill. With the bear market looking unstoppable, PTON stock is an investment you should avoid.Zoom Video (ZM)Zoom (ZM) logo on a buildingSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comZoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) is another pandemic hero that experienced massive growth in its user base due to the shift toward online communication.However, with the lockdown restrictions removed, it’s been struggling to grow at the same pace it did during the pandemic. Its revenue growth of 8% during the second quarter pales compared to the numbers it generated over the past couple of years.At the same time, operational income is dropping at an alarming pace for the firm as it struggles to navigate through the current market headwinds.Zoom doesn’t have a moat or competitive advantage against other companies in its niche, complicating its long-term investment case. Multiple communication softwares have sprung up over the past couple of years, which continue to chomp away at Zoom’s market share. Despite its challenges, ZM stock still trades at more than 5 times forward sales.Vroom (VRM)American on-demand car buying and selling startup Vroom's (VRM stock) mobile app welcome page is seen on a smartphone.Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comVroom (NASDAQ:VRM) is an end-to-end eCommerce platform for selling used vehicles.The company was well-suited for social distancing and generated massive sales during the pandemic. As with most pandemic stocks, though, its shares have taken a major haircut. Its stock has fallen over 90% from its peak with the normalization of the expansion of its sales.The company has struggled to demonstrate profitability, with losses accelerating at an incredible pace of late. Its management has introduced turnaround plans to improve cash burn, margins, and operational expenses to improve profits.It could generate EBITDA margins at around 5 to 10% if it can achieve all its targets. That seems unlikely in the current market situation, though.Its profitability profile has been under the radar from the get-go, which calls into question the quality of its business model.Coinbase (COIN)Flags of Coinbase and NYSE flying in the wind.Source: rarrarorro / Shutterstock.comCoinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) is a leading crypto company that faces strong fundamental headwinds and a tough crypto market.Its recent results have been remarkably negative, while short-term prospects aren’t any better. Though the long-term outlook for the crypto market is favorable, its lack of diversification makes it a highly risky bet. Coinbase’s share price is linked to crypto prices, which points to massive volatility over the long term.Moreover, its business hasn’t been profitable and isn’t expected to be profitable for the next three years. Its valuation is speculative, while fundamental strength remains incredibly weak. Additionally, its stock isn’t particularly cheap either, making it one of the worst bets in the current bear market.On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing GuidelinesMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this homebuilder have returned -6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -5.1% change. The Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry, to which PulteGroup belongs, has lost 6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, PulteGroup is expected to post earnings of $2.75 per share, indicating a change of +51.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $11.14 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +52.6%. This estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.69 indicates a change of -13% from what PulteGroup is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, PulteGroup is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PHM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of PulteGroup, the consensus sales estimate of $4.04 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +16.3%. The $16.72 billion and $17.09 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +20.1% and +2.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPulteGroup reported revenues of $3.93 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.9%. EPS of $2.73 for the same period compares with $1.72 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.03 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.52%. The EPS surprise was +5.81%.Over the last four quarters, PulteGroup surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PulteGroup is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PulteGroup. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Don't Ignore These 2 Construction Stocks Set to Beat Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/want-better-returns-dont-ignore-130001172.html,1666357201,STORY,['PHM'],"[Earnings are arguably the most important single number on a company's quarterly financial report. Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Boise Cascade (BCC) earns a Zacks Rank #1 10 days from its next quarterly earnings release on October 31, 2022, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $4.60 a share.By taking the percentage difference between the $4.60 Most Accurate Estimate and the $4.45 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Boise Cascade has an Earnings ESP of 3.29%.BCC is part of a big group of Construction stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at PulteGroup (PHM) as well.PulteGroup is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on October 25, 2022. PHM's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.75 a share four days from its next earnings release.PulteGroup's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 0.18% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.75.Because both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, BCC and PHM could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Story continuesFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The consensus mark for earnings stands at $2.12 per share, indicating an improvement of 2.9% from the prior-year quarter.Factors to NoteWest Pharmaceutical’s Proprietary Products business continues to exhibit sustained strength and has been an important contributor to the company’s top-line growth. In the first half of 2022, sales improved significantly on the back of double-digit growth in high-value products (HVP). The trend is likely to have continued in the third quarter.Apart from this, the company is likely to have witnessed margin expansion in the aforementioned segment in the to-be-reported quarter, owing to a favorable mix of products sold (stemming from the demand in HVP), production efficiencies and higher sales price.It has been witnessing strong uptake of HVP components, which include Westar and NovaPure offerings. This momentum is likely to have been sustained in the quarter to be reported.West Pharmaceutical has been making significant efforts to retain customers’ faith in the company amid the uncertainty triggered by the pandemic. Apart from ensuring the well-being and safety of team members worldwide, it has successfully maintained the continuity of manufacturing and supply of components to customers. This, in turn, might have favored its third-quarter performance.West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. Price and ConsensusWest Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. Price and ConsensusWest Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. price-consensus-chart | West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. QuoteWest Pharmaceuticals’ business is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which is likely to have adversely impacted the company’s third-quarter performance. The company had lowered its full-year guidance for revenues and adjusted earnings per share on its second-quarter earnings call, primarily citing unfavorable foreign currency movements. It also expects COVID-related sales to decline further in the second half of 2022, after slightly declining year over year in the second quarter.Story continuesWhat Our Quantitative Model SuggestsPer our proven model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.

Improvement in volumes of products contributed to the upside, partially offset by lower prices. This momentum is likely to have continued in the third quarter.With respect to the Orthopaedics &amp; Spine segment, growth across Hips and Knees subsegments, is likely to have favored the segment's third-quarter performance. The acquisition of Wright Medical is likely to have given a boost to the Trauma &amp; Extremities business as in the first half of 2022.Stryker Corporation Price and ConsensusStryker Corporation Price and ConsensusStryker Corporation price-consensus-chart | Stryker Corporation QuoteStryker is committed to the sustained expansion of Mako. This growth reflects the demand for its differentiated Mako robotic technology. The company witnessed both domestic and international growth (in Japan, Korea and emerging markets) in the second quarter of 2022. The launch of the new Insignia Hip Stem, along with the Mako 4.1 software, is likely to have driven the Hips business during the second quarter. The robust demand for Mako is likely to have contributed to the Orthopaedics &amp; Spine segment's performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Stryker completed the acquisition of all the issued and outstanding shares of the common stock of Vocera Communications in February. Per management, the buyout will enable Stryker to enter the fast-growing digital care coordination and communications segment. Investors will likely look for the potential impact of this integration during the third quarter.Story continuesHowever, ongoing supply chain disruptions and hospital staffing shortages are likely to have hurt sales volume growth during the soon-to-be-reported quarter.

Weak sales of COVID-related medicines and tests hurt Roche’s RHHBY third-quarter sales. Eli Lilly LLY and AbbVie ABBV announced small acquisitions.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesJ&amp;J Begins Q3 Earnings Season: J&amp;J reported better-than-expected third-quarter results as it beat estimates for both earnings and sales. Its Pharmaceuticals unit sales continued to do well. Sales also improved in the MedTech and Consumer segments. However, currency headwinds reduced its sales growth by 6% in the quarter amid a strengthening U.S. dollar. J&amp;J slightly lowered its sales outlook for the year due to expected currency headwinds. It also tightened its adjusted earnings guidance range.Roche’s Q3 Revenues Dip: Roche’s revenues in the third quarter declined 6% due to lower COVID-related sales in both the Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics divisions as the effects of the pandemic declined in many countries. Roche said that the increase in COVID cases has not simultaneously boosted demand for tests and drugs. Sales in the Pharmaceuticals Division were down 6% in the third quarter, while the Diagnostics division sales declined 4%. Roche expects sales to remain stable or grow in the low-single digits (at constant exchange rates) in 2022. Core earnings per share are estimated to grow in the low- to mid-single-digit range.Lilly to Buy Akouos for $610M: Lilly said that it is acquiring Boston-based Akouos for approximately $487 million plus a contingent value right for an aggregate amount up to approximately $610 million. Akouos is developing gene therapies for the treatment of inner ear conditions, including hearing loss. Akouos’ lead pipeline candidate is AK-OTOF, a gene therapy intended for the treatment of OTOF-mediated hearing loss, a form of sensorineural hearing loss caused by mutations in the OTOF gene. Last month, the FDA cleared an investigational new drug submission to begin clinical studies on AK-OTOF. Akouos plans to initiate a pediatric phase I/II study on AK-OTOF for OTOF-mediated hearing loss soon.Story continuesAbbVie’s New Antibody Deal: AbbVie announced the acquisition of private biotech, DJS Antibodies that makes antibody medicines targeting difficult-to-drug protein targets. The acquisition will add the latter’s lead pipeline candidate, DJS-002, which is in pre-clinical studies for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and other fibrotic diseases. The candidate is a potential first-in-class antibody directed to LPAR1 antagonist antibody. The deal will provide AbbVie access to DJS’ proprietary HEPTAD platform, which, coupled with its capabilities in biotherapeutics research, can be used to make antibody therapeutics against difficult-to-drug protein targets in immunology.The NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index declined 1% in the last five trading sessions.Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnHere’s how the eight major stocks performed in the last five trading sessions.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the last five trading sessions, Merck rose the most (0.5%), while AstraZeneca declined the most (2.1%).In the past six months, Lilly has gained the highest (18.1%), while AstraZeneca declined the most (17.5%).(See the last pharma stock roundup here: FDA Nod to Omicron Jabs for Kids, MRK, MRNA Partner for Cancer Jab)What's Next in the Pharma World?Watch out for Merck, Sanofi and AbbVie’s Q3 earnings releases and regular pipeline and regulatory updates next week.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Medtronic PRIDE Network was launched in 2019 and worked quickly to make a difference - including helping expand the company's self-identification campaign to include sexual orientation and gender identity.""At a time when the rights of the LGBTQ+ community are at risk, employers have an important role in safeguarding our community,"" said Erin Uritus, CEO of Out &amp; Equal. ""We are grateful to Medtronic for their exemplary leadership in creating inclusive workplaces where everyone belongs.""Out &amp; Equal also named Johnny Mendez, a Medtronic communications manager based in Santiago, Chile, as a finalist for its Global LGBTQ+ Advocate of the Year Award. Mendez helped expand the PRIDE Network hub throughout Latin America and persuaded Medtronic to join a coalition of corporations supporting marriage equality in Chile.""We are so proud of the accomplishments of the PRIDE Network and Johnny. Our members have worked tirelessly to build an inclusive workplace where everyone feels like they belong, are respected, and feel valued for who they are,"" said Shawn Monaghan, the Network's co-chair, and vice president of Transformation, Global Regions at Medtronic. ""The work the PRIDE Network does benefit everyone, everywhere, every day. And we're just getting started.""A gem of an ERGThe roots of the PRIDE Network first sprouted in 1994 - the year two Medtronic employees in Minnesota quietly came out to each other in search of mutual moral support, and formed a group called Gay Employees of Medtronic (GEM).Story continuesOver time, the group evolved into the Medtronic Triangle Alliance, which eventually became the PRIDE ERG. In 2019, the ERG became a Medtronic Diversity Network, which gives employees from underrepresented populations a voice, exposure, and development opportunities on a global scale.In addition to supporting employees, Medtronic also recognizes the importance of fighting for progress for the larger LGBTQ+ community. Some of the actions the company has taken include:Participating in the Partnership for Global LGBTI EqualitySigning the Human Rights Campaign's business statement on anti-LGBTQ+ state legislation and being a member of the Human Rights Campaign's Business Coalition for the Equality ActJoining 173 companies to call on the U.S. Senate to pass the Respect for Marriage Act.Fighting for LGBTQ+ equality in Latin AmericaWhen Johnny Mendez and a few of his co-workers started an ERG for LGBTQ+ employees and their allies in Chile in 2020, there were no marriage equality laws in place there.Recognizing the power corporations have to create positive social change, Mendez convinced Medtronic to join the ""Yes, I do"" movement, a coalition representing more than 60 Chilean and multinational companies supporting marriage equality. Chile's Equal Marriage Law went into effect in March 2022.""Marriage equality is a human rights issue,"" Mendez said. ""And I've spent many years focused on improving human rights because I want my life to be meaningful.""Mendez also helped support the expansion of PRIDE ERGs in Latin America. Today, eight hubs there support more than 4,000 employees, many of whom live in countries where LGBTQ+ discrimination is rampant.""I am incredibly honored by this recognition from Out &amp; Equal,"" Mendez said. ""But it's not about me. It's really about the work and making society a better place for LGBTQ+ employees and their families, especially in Latin America, where there's such cultural and political diversity. It's a complicated place, but it's also very beautiful.""Making historyThe recognition from Out &amp; Equal comes at a particularly meaningful time - in several countries, October is LGBT History Month, a time to celebrate the community's accomplishment.And the PRIDE Network has accomplished a great deal in three years. From its annual #LoveisLove campaign to increasing its support of transgender and non-binary employees, the Network continues to find new ways to encourage and assist LGBTQ + employees and their allies.""It's been wonderful to see so many Medtronic employees who are visible and vocal in their support of the LGBTQ+ community over the years,"" Monaghan said. ""While there is still much work to be done, we are creating a culture of belonging where employees feel comfortable bringing their authentic selves to work each day.""Read more about our year-round actions and impact - including a feature on support for LGBTQ+ employees in Chile - in our Global Inclusion, Diversity &amp; Equity 2021 Annual Report.Medtronic, Friday, October 21, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Medtronic on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: MedtronicWebsite: http://www.medtronic.comEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: MedtronicView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/721723/Out-Equal-Honors-Medtronic-PRIDE]"

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this medical device company have returned -1.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -5.1% change. The Zacks Medical - Products industry, to which Medtronic belongs, has lost 5.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Medtronic is expected to post earnings of $1.28 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0%.The consensus earnings estimate of $5.53 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -0.4%. This estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.82 indicates a change of +5.4% from what Medtronic is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Medtronic.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Medtronic, the consensus sales estimate of $7.72 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -1.7%. The $31.55 billion and $32.84 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -0.4% and +4.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMedtronic reported revenues of $7.37 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -7.7%. EPS of $1.13 for the same period compares with $1.41 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.2 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.34%. The EPS surprise was +0.89%.Over the last four quarters, Medtronic surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Medtronic is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Medtronic. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Boston Scientific (BSX) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.46 a share five days away from its upcoming earnings release on October 26, 2022.BSX has an Earnings ESP figure of 2.63%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.46 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.44.BSX is one of just a large database of Medical stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Medtronic (MDT).Medtronic, which is readying to report earnings on November 22, 2022, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $1.28 a share, and MDT is 32 days out from its next earnings report.Story continuesFor Medtronic, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.28 is 0.06%.BSX and MDT's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including AstraZeneca PLC (AZN), Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) and Crown Castle Inc. (CCI). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of AstraZeneca have underperformed against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (-12.0% vs. +4.6%). The company’s diabetes franchise faces stiff competition while pricing pressure is hurting sales in the respiratory unit. Sales of some cancer medicines are being hurt due to COVID-19. Sales are slowing down in key market, China, due to pricing pressure.Estimates have gone up slightly ahead of the Q3 earnings release on November 10th. The company has a mixed record of earnings surprises in the recent quarters. However, AstraZeneca’s cancer medicines, Lynparza, Tagrisso and Imfinzi should keep driving revenues.AstraZeneca has been engaged in external acquisitions and strategic collaborations to boost its pipeline while investing in geographic areas of high growth like emerging markets. The Alexion buyout strengthens its immunology franchise, adding several drugs that can boost its top line.(You can read the full research report on AstraZeneca here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Caterpillar shares have declined -9.3% over the past year against the Zacks Manufacturing - Construction and Mining industry’s decline of -11.7%. The company is facing issues like ongoing supply chain snarls and cost pressures. Nevertheless, its revenues and earnings grew year over year for six straight quarters thanks to its cost-saving actions, strong end-market demand and pricing actions.The Zacks analyst expect the company’s adjusted earnings per share for 2022 to grow 11.6%, while revenues are predicted to rise 11.2%. The Construction Industries segment is expected to benefit from the rising construction activities in the United States and other parts of the world.Backed by demand for commodities fueled by the energy-transition trend, a thriving mining sector will aid the Resource Industries segment. Its dividend yield and payout ratio are higher than its peers. A strong liquidity position, investments in expanding services and digital initiatives will help Caterpillar deliver outsized returns.(You can read the full research report on Caterpillar here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Crown Castle shares have underperformed against the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry over the past year (-29.7% vs. -28.0%). The consolidation in the wireless industry will likely affect the company’s top line while higher interest rates are expected to add to expenses and make borrowings to fund development costlier. Also, customer concentration is a woe.However, given the increase in mobile data usage, spectrum availability and high network investments by wireless carriers to deploy 5G networks, Crown Castle is poised to gain from this upbeat trend in the upcoming period.Its efforts to double small-cell deployments in 2023 will likely act as a tailwind. The company hiked its quarterly dividend payment by 6.5% on the back of expected strong cashflows.(You can read the full research report on Crown Castle here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Cheniere Energy, Inc.

168,9c61ab87-6970-3400-8859-f464aac050c3,MRK,2022-10-22,AbbVie (ABBV) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/abbvie-abbv-reports-next-week-140002111.html,1666360802,STORY,"['ABBV', 'MRK']","[The market expects AbbVie (ABBV) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 28. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis drugmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.56 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +6.9%.Revenues are expected to be $14.92 billion, up 4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.17% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for AbbVie?For AbbVie, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.05%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that AbbVie will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that AbbVie would post earnings of $3.31 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.37, delivering a surprise of +1.81%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.AbbVie doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerMerck (MRK), another stock in the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.68 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -4%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $14.19 billion, up 7.9% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Merck has been revised 0.5% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.02%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Merck will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:ROK) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 82%",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rockwell-automation-inc-nyse-rok-125729455.html,1666357049,STORY,['ROK'],"[A look at the shareholders of Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK) can tell us which group is most powerful. With 82% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Rockwell Automation. Check out our latest analysis for Rockwell Automation ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Rockwell Automation?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Rockwell Automation. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Rockwell Automation, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Rockwell Automation is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 12% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.5% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.0% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 23 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Rockwell AutomationWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Rockwell Automation, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$53m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 18% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered 4 warning signs for Rockwell Automation (1 can't be ignored!) that you should be aware of before investing here.Ultimately the future is most important. You can access this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

With 50% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).After a year of 34% losses, last week’s 6.1% gain would be welcomed by institutional investors as a likely sign that returns might start trending higher.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Boeing. View our latest analysis for Boeing ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Boeing?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Boeing does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Boeing's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthBoeing is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 7.5% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.4% and 5.5%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Story continuesWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of BoeingThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of The Boeing Company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$59m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 43% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Boeing. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Boeing , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

""Had Boeing not committed its crime"" pilots in Ethiopia and Indonesia would have ""received training adequate to respond to the MCAS activation that occurred on both aircrafts,"" O'Connor ruled.Story continuesThe crashes, which have cost Boeing more than $20 billion in compensation, production costs, and fines, and led to a 20-month grounding for the best-selling plane, prompted Congress to pass legislation reforming FAA airplane certification.Boeing wants Congress to waive a December deadline imposed by the legislation for the FAA to certify the MAX 7 and MAX 10. After that date, all planes must have modern cockpit alerting systems, which the 737 planes do not have.Last month, Boeing paid $200 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges it misled investors about the MAX.

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of $1.34 per share on revenues of $6.7 billion.Let’s delve into the factors that might have influenced the power supplier’s performance in the September quarter. But it’s worth taking a look at Southern Company’s previous-quarter results first.Highlights of Q2 Earnings &amp; Surprise HistoryIn the last reported quarter, the Atlanta, GA-based service provider beat the consensus mark due to the positive effects of rates, usage and pricing changes, plus a demand boost from warmer-than-normal weather. Southern Company had reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.07, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 84 cents. Revenues of $7.2 billion had also come in 28.1% above the consensus mark.SO topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters. The utility has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 9.4%, on average. This is depicted in the graph below: Southern Company The Price and EPS SurpriseSouthern Company The Price and EPS SurpriseSouthern Company The price-eps-surprise | Southern Company The Quote Factors to ConsiderSouthern Company's seven major regulated utilities serve approximately nine million electric and natural gas customers. Leveraging the demographics of its operating territories, the firm has been successfully expanding its regulated business customer base. As proof of that effort, Southern Company added some 12,000 new residential electric customers and more than 7,000 residential natural gas customers in the second quarter. This trend most likely continued in the July-September period of 2022 because of healthy economic development across its service territories.In particular, the firm is expected to have benefited from higher retail electricity sales, reflecting economic recovery in the Southeast in the form of demand from industrial buyers. Finally, investment in state-regulated electric/gas franchises and continued trends in hybrid working have most likely buoyed Southern Company’s revenues and cash flows.On a somewhat bearish note, the power supplier’s total operating cost in the second quarter increased 23.6% year over year to $5.6 billion. The upward cost trajectory is likely to have continued in the second quarter due to inflationary pressures.Story continuesWhat Does Our Model Say?The proven Zacks model does not conclusively show that Southern Company is likely to beat estimates in the third quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates.

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.One stock to keep an eye on is Cigna (CI). CI is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is CI's P/B ratio of 1.95. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 2.13. CI's P/B has been as high as 1.98 and as low as 1.34, with a median of 1.73, over the past year.Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. CI has a P/S ratio of 0.5. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.75.Another great Insurance - Multi line stock you could consider is Prudential (PUK), which is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value Score of A.Prudential is currently trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 8.51 while its PEG ratio sits at 0.95. Both of the company's metrics compare favorably to its industry's average P/E of 9.28 and average PEG ratio of 0.92.Story continuesOver the last 12 months, PUK's P/E has been as high as 17.77, as low as 8.10, with a median of 11.32, and its PEG ratio has been as high as 1.97, as low as 0.90, with a median of 1.26.Additionally, Prudential has a P/B ratio of 1.72 while its industry's price-to-book ratio sits at 2.13. For PUK, this valuation metric has been as high as 3.53, as low as 1.64, with a median of 2.15 over the past year.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Cigna and Prudential are likely undervalued currently. And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook, CI and PUK sticks out as one of the market's strongest value stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

182,86e651e1-cb7d-3660-97c8-993a1b77dfce,NOC,2022-10-22,An Intrinsic Calculation For Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) Suggests It's 27% Undervalued,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-northrop-grumman-corporation-120305989.html,1666440185,STORY,['NOC'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Northrop Grumman The MethodWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.89bUS$3.32bUS$3.86bUS$4.28bUS$4.58bUS$4.84bUS$5.06bUS$5.25bUS$5.43bUS$5.58bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x11Analyst x4Analyst x2Est @ 7.23%Est @ 5.65%Est @ 4.55%Est @ 3.78%Est @ 3.24%Est @ 2.86% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.0% US$2.7kUS$3.0kUS$3.2kUS$3.4kUS$3.4kUS$3.4kUS$3.4kUS$3.3kUS$3.2kUS$3.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$32bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.6b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.0%– 2.0%) = US$142bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$142b÷ ( 1 + 6.0%)10= US$79bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$111b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$523, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 27% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Northrop Grumman as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.858. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Northrop Grumman, we've compiled three further factors you should assess:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

This company, which is in the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This defense contractor has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 1.51%.For the last reported quarter, Northrop Grumman came out with earnings of $6.06 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.03 per share, representing a surprise of 0.50%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $5.95 per share and it actually produced earnings of $6.10 per share, delivering a surprise of 2.52%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Northrop Grumman lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Northrop Grumman currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.83%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on October 27, 2022.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. With that in mind, the ROCE of PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) looks decent, right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on PayPal Holdings is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.11 = US$3.7b ÷ (US$78b - US$45b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).Therefore, PayPal Holdings has an ROCE of 11%. That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 12% generated by the IT industry. Check out our latest analysis for PayPal Holdings roceIn the above chart we have measured PayPal Holdings' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for PayPal Holdings.How Are Returns Trending?While the returns on capital are good, they haven't moved much. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 11% and the business has deployed 96% more capital into its operations. Since 11% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders.Another thing to note, PayPal Holdings has a high ratio of current liabilities to total assets of 58%. This effectively means that suppliers (or short-term creditors) are funding a large portion of the business, so just be aware that this can introduce some elements of risk. While it's not necessarily a bad thing, it can be beneficial if this ratio is lower.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On PayPal Holdings' ROCETo sum it up, PayPal Holdings has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return. In light of this, the stock has only gained 18% over the last five years for shareholders who have owned the stock in this period. That's why it could be worth your time looking into this stock further to discover if it has more traits of a multi-bagger.On a separate note, we've found   3 warning signs for PayPal Holdings   you'll probably want to know about.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

(NASDAQ:AMZN), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL). Despite these brands dominating the space, there are several lesser known companies in the industry that offer the same bang for the buck. As global ecommerce sales remain on track to reach 27% of retail sales by 2026, despite macro headwinds and recession fears, investors should take notice of these small cap growth stocks. A recent report by investment bank Morgan Stanley reveals that even in countries where online shopping is already popular, ecommerce will continue to gain further market share. For example, in parts of Southeast Asia and Latin America, ecommerce could grow 17% and 20%, respectively, over the next five years and compound annually. In South Korea, the sector could grow an astonishing 45% in the next five years, driven by food delivery and same-day options, as well as other innovations. Even in the United States, ecommerce could reach 31% of sales by 2026, up from 23% now, as brick-and-mortar stores close and consumers prioritize convenience. Andrew Ruben, an analyst covering retail and ecommerce in Latin America, believes that digital sales are growing across new verticals such as beauty, apparel, and grocery. He has said that even though there are headwinds in certain countries and verticals, there was a strong belief in the industry that these barriers will continue to come down. Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the ecommerce sector and have market capitalizations between $200 million and $2 billion were selected for the list. The analyst ratings of these firms and the latest updates related to them are also discussed to provide some additional context.

(NASDAQ:POSH), compared to 23 the preceding quarter worth $82.6 million.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, MPE Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Poshmark, Inc. (NASDAQ:POSH) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Two (very) costly mistakes I’ve made over the last twelve months have been my investments in Altice USA and Poshmark, Inc. (NASDAQ:POSH). Both are down over 50% from my initial purchase price. I not only poorly appraised business quality; I also incorrectly appraised the intrinsic value of both of these companies. It should rarely end up the case that we pay over intrinsic value, at worst case we should never lose money on an investment.One serious risk is the huge amount of leverage and the possibility of prolonged inflation leading to higher rates. They don’t have any major debt maturities coming due for a few years, but it’s possible that rates are much higher then and they have issues refinancing at favorable terms or at all. I’ve always detested companies with too much leverage not sure why I didn’t consider this enough upon my initial analysis. I guess I figured it’s a stable business that can handle some leverage. However, a business with a lot of leverage will always be at the mercy of capital markets, a fact I can’t ever feel very comfortable with.In summary, I overstated steady state free cash flows, poorly appraised their value proposition versus peers, didn’t consider new entrants and technologies thoroughly enough, and I didn’t consider the risk of rising inflation and rates. I think once they fiberize their footprint and if they can bring their leverage down, and it’s clear that new entrants aren’t having much effect on their business, Altice might only then be a decent investment candidate.”7.

If you want to read about some more ecommerce stocks, go directly to 5 Best Ecommerce Stocks to Buy Now.The global ecommerce marketplace was one of the biggest winners of the coronavirus pandemic at the stock market. However, as the pandemic has waned, so have sales for online shopping stocks. This slowdown has coincided with a macro environment in which soaring inflation, rising interest rates, and bloated inventories are exacerbating the slump in the ecommerce world. However, top economic experts remain bullish on the industry. According to a report by Morgan Stanley, the global ecommerce market will be worth $5.4 trillion in 2026.For context, presently, the global ecommerce marketplace is worth around $3.3 trillion. Per the analysts at Morgan Stanley, this growth will be driven by logistics, mobile device ownership, and marketplace expansion. Brian Nowak, an equity analyst covering the US internet industry, believes that across the world, economic models are yet to predict a ceiling for e-commerce penetration. Some of the top stocks in the sector include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL). Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the ecommerce sector were selected for the list.

(NYSE:FIGS) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Figs Inc. (NYSE:FIGS) is a direct-to-consumer health care apparel brand. The stock price fell in the earlier part of the quarter due to a combination of poor market conditions for newly public companies and a reduction in guidance given the volatile backdrop for consumer spending. Shares contributed during the period owned after we took advantage of the weakness to initiate a position. We like Figs’ long-term growth prospects as the company disrupts the commoditized and unbranded scrubs industry with its superior, premium product offering.”13. Chewy, Inc. (NYSE:CHWY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25    Chewy, Inc. (NYSE:CHWY) engages in the pure play e-commerce business in the United States. It is one of the top ecommerce stocks to invest in. On September 21, Chewy announced that it has launched a new 795,000 square feet fulfillment center in North Reno which allows the company to better serve customers across the West and pet owners living in the Pacific Northwest. This is the 13th fulfillment center of Chewy.On October 6, Oppenheimer analyst Rupesh Parikh initiated coverage of Chewy, Inc.

While we continue to have a favourable opinion of the online pet products retailer, we decided to consolidate our exposure to the pet industry.”12. Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29  Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY) operates two-sided online marketplaces that connect buyers and sellers. On October 17, Etsy announced that it is running tests with Printify and Shutterfly to promote printing and framing for people who buy digital products. Etsy will only show buyers what is in ad for those services by just selling digital items in its marketplace. On October 10, BTIG analyst Marvin Fong maintained a Buy rating on Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY) stock and lowered the price target on Etsy to $119 from $122, noting that the company's Q3 results show sequential growth. At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 29 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $595.9 million in Etsy, Inc.

(NASDAQ:ETSY) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“We became interested in Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) when Josh Silverman took over as CEO in 2017. The company had long been recognized as a great marketplace, but prior management was not focused on maximizing shareholder value. In short order, Silverman transformed Etsy from a borderline non-profit into a higher-margin, faster-growing enterprise. The pandemic helped accelerate already strong fundamental business results as millions of new customers were introduced to the platform while stuck at home. But like so many other Covid-19 “winners,” Etsy has since fallen deeply out of favor with investors, which prompted us to take a closer look. Following a 75% decline in its stock price, the company now trades for 3.5x next year’s revenue or just a low double-digit multiple of operating profit using our estimate of normalized margins. We believe this is an attractive price to pay for a unique digital marketplace with a long runway for future growth. Note that our exposure to Etsy is currently established via options.”11. DoorDash, Inc. (NYSE:DASH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31    DoorDash, Inc. (NYSE:DASH) operates a logistics platform that connects merchants, consumers, and dashers in the United States and internationally. It is one of the elite ecommerce stocks to invest in.

While the stock sold off, the business remains robust, growing revenues by 32% in the most recent quarter (year-over-year in constant currency) while gaining market share (the industry grew 8%) and reaching profitability in its product commerce segment three quarters ahead of plan.”9. eBay Inc.

(NASDAQ:EBAY), with 4.89 million shares worth more than $203.8 million. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Smead Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“We believe you need to avoid these formerly glamorous stock groups for many years. We loved to use eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) as a poster child back in 1999 for the dotcom bubble. We bought it eight years later and have done very well on it. We wouldn’t have done well if we bought it in the early years of that bear market, or even five years later. If you think this bear will be shorter and or less damaging than the dotcom bear market of 2000-2003, you could be showing your inexperience!”8. Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60  Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) is a commerce company that provides an e-commerce platform and services. On October 19, Shopify stated that it is in partnership with Novel, a no code Web3 commerce platform, to make Web3 technologies accessible and approachable for all merchants. Novel launched an app on Shopify which enables the merchants to experience Web3 innovation without any technical knowledge.On September 20, Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss maintained an Equal Weight rating on Shopify Inc.

(NYSE:SHOP), with 14.5 million shares worth more than $391.5 million. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP) is a cloud-based software provider offering an operating system for multi-channel commerce. Shares fell due to continued post-pandemic e-commerce normalization as economies reopen, concerns about competition following Amazon’s announcement of Buy with Prime, as well as the broader sell-off in growth stocks. We remain shareholders due to Shopify’s strong competitive positioning, innovative culture, and long runway for growth as it currently addresses less than 1% of global commerce spend.”7. JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62    JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) provides supply chain-based technologies and services in China. It is one of the prominent ecommerce stocks to invest in.

(NASDAQ:JD), compared to 59 in the previous quarter worth $5.4 billion.In its Q3 2021 investor letter, Argosy Investors, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“We sold JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) as a result of the furor over Chinese stocks during the quarter. We had been concerned about China’s lack of respect for investor rights for some time, and Beijing has become significantly more aggressive in asserting itself of late. In addition, the legal structure Chinese companies use to come public in the U.S., a Cayman Islands shell corporation leaves American investors with an unsure path to recovering value should these companies cease to trade on U.S. exchanges. Because of the uncertainty, we exited our position in JD completely. We still love JD’s long-term prospects, but we cannot estimate the legal/regulatory risk associated with these companies anymore. More broadly, we are freeing up cash for some other positions we already own which have declined in this market, and after additional review, remain attractive.”6. Sea Limited (NYSE:SE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65   Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) engages in the digital entertainment, e-commerce, and digital financial services businesses. On August 18, Barclays analyst Jiong Shao maintained an Overweight rating on Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) stock and lowered the price target to $114 from $125, noting that many macro factors, currency headwinds, and inflation had led the firm to withdraw fiscal 2022 revenue guidance.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm Tiger Global Management is a leading shareholder in Sea Limited (NYSE:SE), with 8.2 million shares worth more than $548 million. In addition to Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) is one of the best ways to play the boom in the ecommerce sector. In its Q1 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Sea Limited (NYSE:SE), a global digital gaming and e-commerce company, detracted from performance for the period held. Similar to other online consumer businesses, Sea faced significant multiple compression in the quarter, exacerbated by a slowdown in user growth at its key Free Fire digital game and mounting investments in its e-commerce operation, particularly in new markets like Brazil. We exited our position as we lost confidence in the long- term unit economics in some of Sea’s new markets and were concerned by the simultaneous slowdown in revenue growth and increase in underlying cash burn.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Ecommerce Stocks to Buy Now. Suggested Articles:20 Cheapest States To Live In The US10 Best Money Making Stocks To Invest In10 Warren Buffett Stocks That Are Too Cheap To Ignore Disclosure.

207,e1ae8035-0245-3290-b3d5-dfd6b63e4871,IBM,2022-10-22,International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) insiders made a handsome sum after selling stock worth US$128 per share at present for US$139,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/international-business-machines-corporation-nyse-130109647.html,1666357269,STORY,['IBM'],"[International Business Machines Corporation's (NYSE:IBM) stock rose 5.3% last week, but insiders who sold US$222k worth of stock over the last year are probably in a more advantageous position. Selling at an average price of US$139, which is higher than the current price, may have been the best move for these insiders because their investment would have been worth less now than when they sold.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for International Business Machines The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At International Business MachinesOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the insider, Robert Del Bene, for US$222k worth of shares, at about US$139 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$128. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive). Robert Del Bene was the only individual insider to sell over the last year.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 1.08k shares for US$135k. But insiders sold 1.60k shares worth US$222k. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.International Business Machines Insiders Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last quarter, International Business Machines insiders have spent a meaningful amount on shares. Independent Director David Farr spent US$125k on stock, and there wasn't any selling. This could be interpreted as suggesting a positive outlook.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of International Business MachinesFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. International Business Machines insiders own about US$92m worth of shares. That equates to 0.08% of the company. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About International Business Machines Insiders?The recent insider purchase is heartening. On the other hand the transaction history, over the last year, isn't so positive. We don't take much heart from transactions by International Business Machines insiders over the last year. But they own a reasonable amount of the company, and there was some buying recently. Overall they seem reasonably aligned. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Case in point: We've spotted 4 warning signs for International Business Machines you should be aware of, and 1 of them doesn't sit too well with us.Of course International Business Machines may not be the best stock to buy.

Refinery for One of the 12 Top Projects in Energy Efficiency,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/epa-recognizes-marathon-petroleum-corp-194500216.html,1666381500,STORY,['MPC'],"[An energy efficiency project at Marathon Petroleum Corporation's Robinson, Illinois, refinery was named one of the Top Projects of the year at the U.S. EPA's recent ENERGY STAR® Industrial Partner Meeting.The steam turbine optimization project lowered the refinery's demand for purchased electricity by 630 kilowatt-hours by increasing the steam available as an energy supply.This reduction will avoid almost 2,500 metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions annually, the equivalent of eliminating the burning of 2.8 million pounds of coal a year.NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / October 21, 2022 / Using steam to lower electricity demand and emissions has earned a Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC) refinery recognition from companies inside and outside the refining industry. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) recent ENERGY STAR® Industrial Partner Meeting showcased a steam turbine optimization project at MPC's Robinson, Illinois, refinery as one of the 12 Top Projects for energy efficiency this year across the country's industrial sector.The project resulted from the refinery's analysis of possible ways to further improve its energy efficiency, which determined the site was underutilizing a compressor turbine. This machine uses high-pressure steam to assist in starting up a major process unit and then sends medium-pressure exhaust steam throughout the refinery to provide thermal energy that helps meet a variety of refinery needs.In the past, the turbine routinely operated at a steam flow rate of 75,000 pounds per hour. By raising the turbine's steam flow rate to its maximum capacity of 100,000 pounds per hour, the refinery increased the amount of exhaust steam available as an energy supply, lowering the site's demand for purchased electricity by 630 kilowatt-hours. Annually, this reduction will avoid almost 2,500 metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions that would have been associated with generating the electricity and save an estimated $325,000.Story continuesAt the ENERGY STAR meeting, Robinson Sustainability Coordinator and Refining Engineer Barret Von Behren presented an overview of the project.""Our refinery is in a region where the electric grid is supplied largely by coal-fired power plants,"" Von Behren said.

General Motors unveiled its latest electric truck yesterday, the 2024 GMC Sierra EV. It's now taking reservations for the $107,000 fully-loaded version, called the Sierra EV Denali edition.Thankfully, we've got Pras Subramanian to break down all the details for us. That is a hefty price tag, but it's not the only truck on the market that's an EV. How does it compare?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Well, you know, it's twin is basically the Silverado, the Chevy Silverado, which I find to have a design that's more adventure, lifestyle truck. Whereas, if you look at the new Sierra EV over here, it's more traditional truck, like looks like a work truck. I think it might appeal to a broader set of people.Power wise, it actually has more power than the top line Silverado. It has around 750 horsepower, 400 miles of range in that top trim, so that's pretty competitive. But you did mention that price, $107,000 for that top tier. It's very pricey, very high, and very premium, I would say.But I did get a chance to speak to the chief engineer Nichole Kraatz about lower trim levels that are actually gonna compete against the Ford Lightning Pro. Here's what she had to say.NICHOLE KRAATZ: $50,000 model for the Sierra EV is an Elevation. It is it's an Elevation trim, so it's not a work truck in the standpoint of a model named a work truck or a fleet truck, if you will.We're bringing some really compelling capability from a basic perspective on the Sierra EV into all price points. The trucks are capable of different ranges and different option content. So the Sierra EV Denali, that we're talking about for 2024, with our addition one is a fully-loaded, full all of the technology that we can possibly imagine. And then in the future, you know, many of these things become options and then various range picks as well available.Story continuesSo it really brings an EV pickup for everyone. I mean, we talk about that. And people kind of think that's a little cliche, perhaps. But we are really committed to bringing folks into our EVs, specifically in the EV pickup truck segment. And by offering them, you know, all of the capability and all of the technology that they desire, we can, you know, establish to these various ranges of our price points as well.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: So we don't have the specs yet for that Elevation from that base model. But we do know that the Sierra Denali EV1, the high end one, is gonna come out in 2024, with the lower trims coming out in 2025.AKIKO FUJITA: So how does this compare to the gas-powered Sierras? And is that the exact target they're going for, in terms of who's likely to switch over?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Well, I think with the lower trims they're gonna-- if they do stick with that $50,000 price tag, which is, as you know, things have been changing, that would be comparable to a Sierra work-- Elevation work truck at that-- I shouldn't say work truck-- at that trim level. It would be comparable price-wise and even have a bit more power.But the question is, are you gonna able to convince these guys who drive traditional trucks, I want an EV with potentially less than 400 miles of range? And then I'm gonna take them to the job site, is that gonna be as capable and sturdy as my traditional gas-power, can go anywhere, sort of thing? So I think that's the big sort of question that GM is trying to answer or how their clients or customers answer.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, still a lot of concerns about range, about infrastructure, charging stations, making sure that's all in place--PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Right, right.AKIKO FUJITA: --so they can drive it just like they would their normal car.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Right. I do want to add one thing that it does have the GM-- kind of like the ability to power a worksite, power your home, and also power the grid, potentially, with their GM energy products. So that will work with that, with Ultium battery packs. So they do have that additional capability that you might not find in like a Rivian, for example.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, an added benefit there. All right, thanks so much for that, Pras.]"

The traditional styling may appeal to a broader group of buyers, including those looking for work trucks.The high-trim model GMC unveiled last night is the 2024 Sierra EV Denali Edition 1, which will have 400 miles of estimated range, a dual-motor setup with 754 horsepower and 785 lb-ft of torque, and an 800-volt architecture that can handle 350 kW DC fast charging.2024 GMC Sierra EV Denali Edition 1 (credit: GMC)GMC, which sells a range of SUVs, CUVs, and pickups that usually have a corresponding Chevrolet model in tow, is actually the first GM brand with an EV pickup and SUV on sale right now with the Hummer EVs. And since there are no corresponding Chevrolet “Hummer” twins if you will, GMC will soon have three EV trucks on offer.“The 2024 Sierra EV Denali Edition 1 is just the beginning,” said Duncan Aldred, vice president of Global Buick and GMC, in a statement. “It will offer customers our very latest in technology, capability and luxury delivered in a way only GMC can do — with much more to come. From the HUMMER EV supertruck to the first-ever Sierra EV, GMC continues to write the next chapter in its future as a premium truck and SUV brand.”In addition, the Sierra EV pickups will have Onboard Power Station Pro capability, which turns the Sierra EV Denali into a mobile power source, with up to 10.2kW of off-board power to use to power a job site or campsite. The Sierra EV will also be able to provide V to G (vehicle to grid) and V to H (vehicle to home) capabilities through the automaker’s new GM Energy solutions, where the truck can be used to power a home when need be or provide energy from the truck’s battery to the grid.Story continues2024 GMC Sierra EV Denali Edition 1 (credit: GMC)Though the Sierra EV Denali Edition 1 will come with a fairly high price tag of $107,000 at launch, GMC is offering lower trim models like the AT4 and Elevation models, that will have surprising price point, one that can go head to head with Ford’s Lightning Pro (F) base model.“The $50k model for the Sierra EV is the Elevation trim,” says Nichole Kraatz, GMC Sierra EV chief engineer to Yahoo Finance. “It’s not a ‘work truck’ from the standpoint of a model named a work truck or a fleet truck, if you will, but we’re bringing some really compelling capability from a basic perspective on the Sierra EV into all price points.”2024 GMC Sierra EV Denali Edition 1 (credit: GMC)Kraatz says the Sierra EV Denali is a fully loaded model with every conceivable option GMC has in mind, and eventually the lower trim Sierra EVs will then be offered some of the features of the Denali trim as options, in addition to different battery packs for range.GMC has not revealed what the specs will be for the lower trim Sierra EVs, but it is assumed to be less power and range compared to the Sierra EV Denali. For comparison, the Ford (F) F-150 Lightning Pro base model has 426 hp and 240 miles of range from its standard battery setup.The 2024 Sierra EV Denali Edition 1 will be available at launch in early 2024.

With 80% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Last week's US$6.2b market cap gain would probably be appreciated by institutional investors, especially after a year of 37% losses.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Target, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Target ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Target?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Target does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Target's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Target. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.2% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.4% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 7.2% by the third-largest shareholder.Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Story continuesWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of TargetThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Target Corporation in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$163m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 20% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Target. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

BXP is slated to report third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 25, after market close. Its quarterly results are likely to reflect year-over-year growth in both funds from operations (FFO) per share and revenues.In the last reported quarter, this office real-estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a surprise of 4.86% in terms of FFO per share. BXP’s performance during the quarter reflected strong leasing activity and bottom-line growth.Over the preceding four quarters, Boston Properties’ FFO per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on each occasion, the average beat being 3.30%. This is depicted in the graph below:Boston Properties, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseBoston Properties, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseBoston Properties, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Boston Properties, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayPer a Cushman &amp; Wakefield CWK report, the U.S. office market’s overall office absorption continued to be negative even though office-using employment increased in the first three quarters of this year. Notably, on a four-quarter moving average basis, for third-quarter 2022, the U.S. office sector’s overall net absorption improved from negative 26 million square feet (msf) to negative 5.9 msf year over year.A survey by Cushman &amp; Wakefield shows that the life sciences markets, such as San Jose, San Diego, Suburban MD, Boston, San Mateo County and Northern NJ, are experiencing strong demand for both lab and office space.Moreover, gross leasing activity has rebounded from its lows in first-quarter 2021. The four-quarter rolling total leasing has increased 45%. Also, third-quarter 2022 marked the third consecutive quarter wherein the four-quarter rolling total leasing was more than 350 msf.Boston Properties’ portfolio of modern, class A office buildings in Boston, Los Angeles, New York, Seattle, San Francisco and Washington, DC, is likely to have benefited from this upbeat trend.In addition, with the post-pandemic reopening of the economy, office usage by BXP’s clients is likely to have gained momentum, driving the demand for its premium office assets. This is expected to have aided its third-quarter top-line performance.Further, BXP’s life-science assets are anticipated to have witnessed solid demand during the quarter to be reported on the back of the growing need for drug research and innovation.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $726.8 million, suggesting growth of nearly 5% from the prior-year quarter’s reading. Also, the consensus estimate for quarterly parking and other revenues is pegged at $26.2 million, implying an 11.6% increase from the year-ago period’s reported number.The Seattle market has experienced substantial job growth from the technology and life sciences sectors in recent years. Boston Properties is focusing on expanding into this market. In line with this strategy, it disposed of 601 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Washington, DC, this September to fund the May 2022 acquisition of Madison Center in Seattle’s Downtown area. Such efforts highlight the company’s prudent capital management practices and relieve the pressure off its balance sheet.However, the prevailing inflationary environment is likely to have had an adverse impact on BXP’s operating activities during the to-be-reported quarter. Also, with interest rates rising, the company’s construction costs for new development projects are anticipated to have increased. In all likelihood, we expect the company to report higher interest expenses in the quarter under preview.BXP’s activities during the third quarter were not adequate to secure analyst confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly FFO per share has been revised marginally downward to $1.87 over the past month. Nonetheless, the same suggests an 8.1% increase from the prior-year period’s reported number.Story continuesEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an FFO beat for Boston Properties this time. The right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — increases the odds of a beat. However, that is not the case here.Earnings ESP: Boston Properties has an Earnings ESP of -0.18%.

Merchandise volumes remained almost flat at $657 million. Segmental revenue per unit increased 12%.Intermodal revenues augmented 19% year over year to $604 million. Volumes rose 2% year over year. The strength in the international business was partially offset by lower domestic volumes. Segmental revenue per unit increased 16%.Coal revenues ascended 36% year over year to $624 million in the reported quarter. The upside came as pricing continued to benefit from solid export benchmarks.Coal volumes decreased 2% due to production issues at the mine, infrastructure constraints at the export terminals and general manpower shortages.

Revenues from the segment totaled $251 million, up 26% year over year. The uptick was backed by solid core pricing and higher fuel recovery.Story continuesOther revenues jumped 13% to $273 million in the reported quarter. The uptick was owing to higher intermodal storage and equipment usage fees.Liquidity, Dividends and BuybackCSX exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2,311 million compared with $724 million at the end of June 2022.

Multiple flight cancelations and booking weaknesses due to Hurricane Ian also hurt results. DAL reported earnings of 30 cents per share a year ago, dull in comparison to the current scenario, as air-travel demand was not so buoyant then.DAL reported revenues of $13,975 million, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14,157.2 million. Driven by the high air-travel demand, total revenues increased more than 52% on a year-over-year basis.United Airlines’ UAL third-quarter 2022 earnings (excluding 5 cents from non-recurring items) of $2.81 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.21 and our estimate of $2.17. An upbeat in air-travel demand aided results.In the year-ago quarter, UAL incurred a loss of $1.02 per share when air-travel demand was not as buoyant as in the current scenario. The third quarter of 2022 was the second consecutive profitable quarter at UAL since the onset of the pandemic.Operating revenues of $12,877 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12,709.5 million and our estimate of $12, 631.6 million. UAL’s revenues increased more than 66% year over year owing to an upbeat in air-travel demand.

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Royal Caribbean (RCL) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.24 a share, just 14 days from its upcoming earnings release on November 4, 2022.Royal Caribbean's Earnings ESP sits at 5.26%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.24 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.23.RCL is one of just a large database of Consumer Discretionary stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Jakks Pacific (JAKK).Jakks Pacific, which is readying to report earnings on October 27, 2022, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $3.81 a share, and JAKK is six days out from its next earnings report.Jakks Pacific's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 3.25% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.69.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, RCL and JAKK could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

232,cb0404d7-c24e-35a8-a9eb-8ddbca0553f9,ADI,2022-10-22,Analog Devices' (NASDAQ:ADI) five-year earnings growth trails the 12% YoY shareholder returns,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analog-devices-nasdaq-adi-five-110034542.html,1666436434,STORY,['ADI'],"[While Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) shareholders are probably generally happy, the stock hasn't had particularly good run recently, with the share price falling 10% in the last quarter. While that's not great, the returns over five years have been decent. It's good to see the share price is up 61% in that time, better than its market return of 55%. Unfortunately not all shareholders will have held it for the long term, so spare a thought for those caught in the 18% decline over the last twelve months.The past week has proven to be lucrative for Analog Devices investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's five-year performance. See our latest analysis for Analog Devices To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Analog Devices achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 13% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 10% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Analog Devices' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Analog Devices the TSR over the last 5 years was 77%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's never nice to take a loss, Analog Devices shareholders can take comfort that , including dividends,their trailing twelve month loss of 16% wasn't as bad as the market loss of around 23%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 12% for each year. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Even so, be aware that  Analog Devices is showing  3 warning signs in our investment analysis , you should know about...Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

ADI need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Oct 21, 2022 $85.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Analog Devices shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Analog Devices is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry that ranks in the Bottom 20% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $2.57 per share to $2.58 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Analog Devices right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

Born and raised in Colombia, she came to the United States when she was 18 years old, ""full of hopes and dreams and looking for a better future.""She went to college full-time while working two or three jobs to support herself and pay for those expensive dreams - that were ultimately fulfilled.""I realized through my own personal experiences that we all need to share our knowledge and experiences, to help others who are in the same situation we were once in,"" Alvarez said.""I am a strong believer that pursuing higher education brings many opportunities in life, so I made the decision early on to join two amazing non-profit organizations that support education and entrepreneurship.""Alvarez is the current president of the Hispanic Professional Women's Association in Tampa, an organization that provides mentorship to Hispanic professional women and promotes the value of higher education.She also serves as a regional board member for Prospera Tampa, an economic development program that supports Hispanic business owners starting or expanding their businesses by providing bilingual resources.""Just by finding some time to volunteer with an organization whose mission you are confident in, you are creating a positive change.""Ivonne Alvarez, SBA Lending Specialist for Regions""We all need to give back in ways we believe will make an impact in our community,"" she said. ""And there are many ways to do that. Just by finding some time to volunteer with an organization whose mission you are confident in, you are creating a positive change.""Story continuesAlvarez's passion for education is shared by fellow Floridian Alex Gonzalez, Private Wealth Management executive in Orlando. Gonzalez explained how a desire to help others achieve began in his early years.""I am Cuban, and our family fled communism in 1968,"" said Gonzalez. ""We were fortunate enough to be part of the Freedom Flights, which was a cooperative effort between the United States and Cuban governments.""""My parents are my heroes. It is hard for me to fathom how difficult it must have been for them to leave all that they knew - their culture, language, homes, businesses, real estate, and family,"" he said.This close bond with his family, along with the values his parents instilled in him such as faith and a strong work ethic, contributed to his desire to serve others.""My parents taught us the importance of gratitude and generosity,"" Gonzalez said. ""Both my wife and I have embraced those lessons and have passed them on to our children.

Also, the results compare unfavorably with the prior-year figure of 66 cents.Results have been driven by a rise in net interest income (NII) and average loan balances. However, rising expenses and the provision for credit losses affected the bottom line.Net income available to common shareholders was $404 million, declining 35% from the year-ago period.Revenues Rise on NII Strength, Expenses Flare UpTotal revenues were $1.87 billion in the reported quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.81 billion. Also, the top line rose 15.7% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.NII was $1.26 billion, up 30.8% year over year. Also, the net interest margin rose 77 basis points to 3.53%.Non-interest income dipped 6.8% year over year to $605 million. The downside mainly resulted from lower service charges on deposit accounts and mortgage income, partially offset by higher capital market income and wealth management income.Non-interest expenses rose 24.7% year over year to $1.17 billion mainly due to increased expenses related to salaries and employee benefits, and FDIC insurance assessment.The efficiency ratio was 62.3% for the third quarter.As of Sep 30, 2022, average loans and leases increased 4.3% on a sequential basis to $94.68 billion.

Non-performing assets, as a percentage of loans, foreclosed properties and non-performing loans held for sale, were down to 0.54% from the prior-year quarter’s 0.66%. Non-performing loans, excluding loans held for sale as a percentage of net loans, were 0.52%, declining from 0.64% in the prior year.Annualized net charge-offs, as a percentage of average loans, were 0.46% compared with 0.14% in the prior-year quarter. However, a provision for credit losses of $135 million was recorded in the quarter against the year-earlier quarter’s benefit of $155 million.Story continuesCapital Ratios WeakRegions Financial’s estimated ratios remained well above the regulatory requirements under the Basel III capital rules.

(NYSE:V) as a stock to avoid entirely with its 27.6x P/E ratio. However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.Recent times have been advantageous for Visa as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. Check out our latest analysis for Visa peKeen to find out how analysts think Visa's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.How Is Visa's Growth Trending?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as Visa's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.Taking a look back first, we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 37% last year. The strong recent performance means it was also able to grow EPS by 32% in total over the last three years. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably welcomed those medium-term rates of earnings growth.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 16% each year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 9.3% per annum growth forecast for the broader market.With this information, we can see why Visa is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.The Key TakeawayTypically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.Story continuesWe've established that Visa maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.Many other vital risk factors can be found on the company's balance sheet. Take a look at our free balance sheet analysis for Visa with six simple checks on some of these key factors.If you're unsure about the strength of Visa's business, why not explore our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals for some other companies you may have missed.Have feedback on this article?

Contributions from the acquisitions of NPI Solutions, MTS Sensors, Halo, Positronic, El-Cab, Unlimited Services, Cablecon and Euromicron are expected to aid its third-quarter results.Military market sales are expected to have increased sequentially due to the addition of MTS sensors to the product offerings, as well as the strong demand for interconnect and sensor products.However, commercial aerospace market revenues are expected to decline on a sequential basis but increase on a year-over-year basis. Strong demand for the interconnect and sensor technology is expected to have benefited top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.Industrial end-market sales are expected to have witnessed steady growth in the to-be-reported quarter.Automotive sales are also expected to decline slightly on a sequential basis, due to supply chain constraints.Amphenol’s third-quarter 2022 top line is expected to have suffered from supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures, as well as lingering impacts of the pandemic.Story continuesWhat Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Amphenol (NYSE:APH). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Amphenol with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Amphenol How Quickly Is Amphenol Increasing Earnings Per Share?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. We can see that in the last three years Amphenol grew its EPS by 14% per year. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. EBIT margins for Amphenol remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 22% to US$12b. That's a real positive.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time.

So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Amphenol's forecast profits?Are Amphenol Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Amphenol, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$239m. We note that this amounts to 0.6% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Amphenol but it's still worth mentioning. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Story continuesDoes Amphenol Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?One positive for Amphenol is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists. Still, you should learn about the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Amphenol.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best High Beta Stocks To Buy Now. Beta, a statistical measure of a stock's relative volatility to the broader market index, is often interpreted as a measure of riskiness. A beta of more than 1.0 means that the stock is more volatile than the overall market and a beta less than 1.0 indicates lower volatility than the benchmark index. Thus, stocks with higher betas tend to gain more in bull markets but also plummet harder in bear markets. High beta stocks are positively correlated with returns of the S&amp;P 500, but at an escalated rate. Famous equity bull Jeremy Siegel, a professor of finance at the University of Pennsylvania, told Bloomberg on October 15 that American stocks are still a “marvelous” bet for investors with a long-term horizon, despite the Federal Reserve’s intense rate policies pushing the S&amp;P 500 into bear territory. He believes that although high interest rates and recession fears are casting a shadow over the stock market currently, it might not be the case for much longer if rates succumb to their long-term trends. That could elevate stocks, in Siegel’s opinion. He explained his stance further:“I’m staying put, I certainly wouldn’t be surprised if a year, year and half from now we’re 20-30% higher. I think stocks are undervalued greatly in the long-run.”To prepare for an eventual bull market, it is prudent to invest in high beta stocks which are trading at attractive discounts right now. Some of the best high beta stocks include Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), and HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA). Our MethodologyWe have selected the stocks with a beta value of more than 1 as of October 21. We have shortlisted the high beta stocks that offer growth fundamentals, have positive analyst ratings, and display the potential to generate resilient returns in the future.

In addition, we have been impressed with the operational progress this management team has made since taking the helm in 2017. We acknowledge e-commerce trends have been challenged as consumers shift toward in-person experiences post[1]pandemic, but over time we expect industry growth to return to the long-term trend. Shares have pulled back 75% since topping out in late 2021. Examining this opportunity through a longer-term lens, we initiated a GardenSM position during the quarter at an attractive discount to our PMV estimate.”9. APA Corporation (NASDAQ:APA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36Beta Value: 3.69Next on our list of the best high beta stocks is APA Corporation (NASDAQ:APA), a Texas-based company that develops and operates oil and gas properties.

Although their share prices have increased considerably, both companies still look quite undervalued even using longer term oil prices in the $65-70 dollar range. Meanwhile, if times are good over the next couple of years, we expect these companies to return significant percentages of their market caps to shareholders.”8. ON Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:ON)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Beta Value: 1.73ON Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:ON) is an Arizona-based company that provides intelligent sensing and power solutions worldwide.

The company reported 49% gross margins in 1Q22 which met the new management team’s 48%-50% long-term target after revising it higher just one quarter ago. We believe ON has a clear path to &gt;50% gross margins, and its financial results reflect the ongoing structural improvements in both manufacturing and products, cost initiatives, product mix and rising prices. Growing demand for chips in electric vehicles, renewable energy infrastructure, advanced driver assistance (multiple cameras), factory automation and machine vision should drive sustainable high single-digit top-line growth.

(NASDAQ:MAR), compared to 52 funds in the prior quarter.

During the pandemic, the company reduced expenses which improved operating leverage as revenue recovers. Expectations for travel in 2022 have improved as COVID cases have declined.

The company reported strong 3Q results beating on the top and bottom line. The company reported revenue of $1.9B beating consensus of $1.5B with EPS of $2.94 beating expectations for $2.79.

Trade between the two nations continued, with some collateral damage where Trump lobbed a tariff, or China lobbed back retaliatory measures.With far less fanfare, the Biden administration has launched a new broadside against China that could do far more damage to its economy than anything Trump contemplated, and trigger unprecedented retaliation by China. On Oct. 7, the Biden administration surprised the world with new export controls that effectively prohibit the sale of advanced American computer chips and chipmaking technology to China. While several nations make advanced chips, much of the technology behind that production is American, which means the Biden ban will impede China’s ability to develop artificial intelligence, supercomputers, advanced weaponry and other crown jewels of the modern digital economy.“These new controls [are] a genuine landmark in US-China relations,” Gregory Allen of the Center for Strategic and International Studies wrote in a recent analysis of the new rules. “These actions demonstrate an unprecedented degree of US government intervention to begin a new US policy of actively strangling large segments of the Chinese technology industry—strangling with an intent to kill.”Until now, Biden’s China policy had been fuzzy. He kept in place the Trump tariffs on some $350 billion worth of Chinese imports, without saying whether he might review them as part of a broader strategy or continue Trump’s piecemeal approach to China. What’s clear now is that Biden plans to treat China as more of a military and economic threat than any of his predecessors. Some economic ties will undoubtedly continue, but the US government is now practicing a kind of economic containment strategy—subordinating trade and commerce to national security for the first time since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001 and became the “world’s factory.”Story continuesThe growing risks China posesUS relations with China have been fraying since the Obama administration, as China developed an aggressive program of stealing Western technology, using government subsidies to grab market share in key global industries, and building a muscular military able to enforce China’s communist ideology in Asia and beyond. At the same time, it became apparent that the mass movement of factory work to China had hollowed out America’s blue-collar labor force, with little or nothing to replace millions of lost jobs.[Follow Rick Newman on Twitter, sign up for his newsletter or sound off.]Trump focused mostly on the US trade deficit with China, which economists broadly regard as a misdirected way to address the growing risk China poses. The Trump tariffs were supposed to stimulate new American manufacturing, by raising the cost of Chinese imports and making US production more competitive. But there’s been no meaningful change in US industrial production since the Trump tariffs went into effect. There has been one other notable change, however: Many imports of tariffed goods from China have been replaced with imports of non-tariffed goods from other countries, as Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Studies has demonstrated. That’s just a shuffling of import flows, which doesn’t do anything to boost the US economy or create American jobs.U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is flanked by members of Congress as she signs the ""Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act of 2022,"" legislation that will subsidize the domestic semiconductor industry as it competes with companies in China and other countries, during a bill enrollment ceremony on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., July 29, 2022. REUTERS/Jonathan ErnstIn the aftermath of the 2020 COVID pandemic, which revealed an alarming US over-dependence on imported goods from China and elsewhere, Biden vowed to strengthen domestic supply chains for critical products and technologies. The Inflation Reduction Act, for instance, incudes high domestic content requirement for electric vehicles in order to qualify for federal subsidies. It also includes powerful incentives for the domestic development of critical minerals such as lithium, cobalt and nickel.The CHIPs+ Act, which Congress passed in July, was an unusual bipartisan effort to boost US production of semiconductors. Most Republicans and some Democrats normally oppose such “industrial policy,” deeming it better for private-market incentives to determine who builds what where. But there’s a growing consensus on the need to combat government support for key industries in China and even some democratic nations with similar programs here at home.In September, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan gave a speech in which he signaled a change in long-standing US policy on technology exports. “We have to revisit the longstanding premise of maintaining ‘relative’ advantages over competitors in certain key technologies,” he said. “Given the foundational nature of certain technologies, such as advanced logic and memory chips, we must maintain as large of a lead as possible.”Sullivan’s remarks got tech companies’ attention, but nobody was sure what he meant, exactly, until the government announced the new export controls on Oct. 7. Gregory Allen of CSIS detects four main thrusts to the new Biden policy, which broadly seeks to disrupt China’s artificial-intelligence industry: denying access to advanced chips, the software used to design those chips, the equipment used to produce those chips, and the components that go into the production equipment. There's also a restriction on ""US persons"" working with Chinese companies—as vendors or consultants, say—in the targeted industries.“In summary,” Allen concludes, “the United States does not want China to have advanced AI computing and supercomputing facilities. In weaponizing its dominant chokepoint position in the global semiconductor value chain, the United States is exercising technological and geopolitical power on an incredible scale.”'Something significant will happen in terms of retaliation'The effect has been immediate. US chip suppliers such as Intel (INTC), Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), KLA (KLAC), Applied Materials (AMAT) and LAM Research (LRCX) have halted deliveries to China as they figure out what’s allowed under the new rules and what’s not. Apple (AAPL) has dropped a plan to use chips made by Chinese firm YMTC in upcoming iPhones, according to Nikkei Asia. Tech giants based in other countries, such as Taiwan’s TSMC, are likely to be affected as well, given close ties with US industry. Tech stocks, which have had a bad year, sold off further after the Oct. 7 announcement.China will likely respond. “I’m assuming something significant will happen in terms of retaliation, because the impact of this rule is quite significant,” Kevin Wolf, former Assistant Commerce Secretary for Export Administration, said on a recent podcast. China could block US imports of critical minerals from China or punish US companies doing business in China, which would be muscular forms of escalation. It could also target US allies that must comply with some elements of the new US rule, including South Korea, Japan and Taiwan. Chinese President Xi Jinping will likely cite the move as evidence of America's effort to keep China down, perhaps fueling nationalistic sentiment.There are risks to this economic containment effort. There will still be openings for firms from other nations to fill the gap with their own chip technology, for instance. American officials say they’ll spend the next year or two trying to get allies to join the Chinese chip embargo, but some nations could see it as a chance to turbocharge the development of their own chip industries. China could also defy expectations and make more technological progress on their own than expected.Politically, however, the new Biden restrictions seem likely to stick, no matter which party wins the White House in 2024. China’s militant capitalism and hostility toward Taiwan and other neighbors have left it with few friends in Washington, and no “soft on China” wing in either party willing to advocate moderation. As Biden has kept Trump’s tariffs in place, the next president will probably cement Biden’s chip embargo, and perhaps look for other ways to tighten the screws on China.Trade wars aren’t good, but some may be necessary.Rick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

Most Republicans and some Democrats normally oppose such “industrial policy,” deeming it better for private-market incentives to determine who builds what where. But there’s a growing consensus on the need to combat government support for key industries in China and even some democratic nations with similar programs here at home.In September, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan gave a speech in which he signaled a change in long-standing US policy on technology exports. “We have to revisit the longstanding premise of maintaining ‘relative’ advantages over competitors in certain key technologies,” he said. “Given the foundational nature of certain technologies, such as advanced logic and memory chips, we must maintain as large of a lead as possible.”Sullivan’s remarks got tech companies’ attention, but nobody was sure what he meant, exactly, until the government announced the new export controls on Oct. 7. Gregory Allen of CSIS detects four main thrusts to the new Biden policy, which broadly seeks to disrupt China’s artificial-intelligence industry: denying access to advanced chips, the software used to design those chips, the equipment used to produce those chips, and the components that go into the production equipment. There's also a restriction on ""US persons"" working with Chinese companies—as vendors or consultants, say—in the targeted industries.“In summary,” Allen concludes, “the United States does not want China to have advanced AI computing and supercomputing facilities. In weaponizing its dominant chokepoint position in the global semiconductor value chain, the United States is exercising technological and geopolitical power on an incredible scale.”'Something significant will happen in terms of retaliation'The effect has been immediate. US chip suppliers such as Intel (INTC), Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), KLA (KLAC), Applied Materials (AMAT) and LAM Research (LRCX) have halted deliveries to China as they figure out what’s allowed under the new rules and what’s not. Apple (AAPL) has dropped a plan to use chips made by Chinese firm YMTC in upcoming iPhones, according to Nikkei Asia. Tech giants based in other countries, such as Taiwan’s TSMC, are likely to be affected as well, given close ties with US industry. Tech stocks, which have had a bad year, sold off further after the Oct. 7 announcement.China will likely respond. “I’m assuming something significant will happen in terms of retaliation, because the impact of this rule is quite significant,” Kevin Wolf, former Assistant Commerce Secretary for Export Administration, said on a recent podcast. China could block US imports of critical minerals from China or punish US companies doing business in China, which would be muscular forms of escalation. It could also target US allies that must comply with some elements of the new US rule, including South Korea, Japan and Taiwan. Chinese President Xi Jinping will likely cite the move as evidence of America's effort to keep China down, perhaps fueling nationalistic sentiment.There are risks to this economic containment effort. There will still be openings for firms from other nations to fill the gap with their own chip technology, for instance. American officials say they’ll spend the next year or two trying to get allies to join the Chinese chip embargo, but some nations could see it as a chance to turbocharge the development of their own chip industries. China could also defy expectations and make more technological progress on their own than expected.Politically, however, the new Biden restrictions seem likely to stick, no matter which party wins the White House in 2024. China’s militant capitalism and hostility toward Taiwan and other neighbors have left it with few friends in Washington, and no “soft on China” wing in either party willing to advocate moderation. As Biden has kept Trump’s tariffs in place, the next president will probably cement Biden’s chip embargo, and perhaps look for other ways to tighten the screws on China.Trade wars aren’t good, but some may be necessary.Rick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

During TechCrunch Disrupt earlier this week, VP of gaming Mike Verdu said it's “seriously exploring a cloud gaming offering.”Sounds like a surefire win right? Not necessarily. Take a look at Google (GOOG, GOOGL), which announced last month it’s axing its own cloud gaming service Stadia due to a lack of players.Cloud gaming is still in its early stages. It requires huge infrastructure, no latency, and plenty of games. Consumers generally tolerate a bit of lag when starting up a show, but that won’t fly with cloud gaming. Even the slightest slowdown or lag in your connection can ruin your gaming experience. And while Netflix is a massive organization with huge resources at its disposal, even that isn’t enough to win over gamers""Google has a lot of things theoretically in place that would make you think they could succeed at a cloud streaming gaming service,” IDC research director of gaming, eSports and VR/AR Lewis Ward told Yahoo Finance. “Even [Amazon’s] (AMZN) Luna, 18 months past its official launch date, isn't exactly crushing it either with all of Amazon's resources.""He added, ""So I just think it's very tough to make these things succeed.”Cloud gaming is more difficult than streaming moviesWhile cloud gaming might be a powerful way to keep customers from ditching their subscriptions when they finish their favorite shows, running a successful cloud gaming business poses major challenges.Cloud gaming allows users to stream games to low-powered devices like Chromebooks, phones, and smart TVs. The latency issue can be huge. Imagine you’re in a tense standoff with another player and just as you’re about to make your move, your connection freezes for two seconds. Next thing you know, your character is dead and the 11-year-old you were playing is laughing at you in your headset.Netflix might launch its own cloud gaming service. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)Even if companies have the technology, success in cloud gaming has proven relatively elusive.Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) seem to be performing well in the area, though they don’t release exact user numbers. Microsoft’s cloud games augment its library of downloadable games, giving users more options to play and a better reason to stick around. Nvidia lets you stream games you already own.Story continuesBoth services essentially give you the option of playing games on your console or PC and then jumping to the cloud when you don’t have an available TV or are on the go.Still a growth opportunityIf Netflix does get into cloud gaming, it’s going to need to ensure it has the technology to do so, and provide gamers with something akin to Microsoft or Nvidia’s services.But if Netflix can pull it off, a cloud gaming offering could boost a company that's just now pulling out of a post-COVID tailspin that sent customers fleeing and shares plummeting 57% over the last 12 months.During the pandemic, when millions became one with their couches, Netflix saw its user numbers explode. In the first quarter of 2020, the company had 182.86 million global subscribers. By the fourth quarter of 2021, it had 221.84 million. But that growth was untenable; between the first and second quarter of 2022, Netflix lost 1.17 million subscribers.While Netflix added 2.41 million subscribers in the third quarter, it's going to need to keep working to retain the subscribers it has. That’s where gaming comes in.“The challenge is when the content schedule is a little more uneven, when there's not content that people are urgently wanting to watch, that’s where you see churn tick up, and people cut off their service for a while,” Dave Heger, Edward Jones senior equity analyst, told Yahoo Finance Live.Gaming could keep people engaged with Netflix during those lulls between show debuts. It’s not just about holding on to existing subscribers, though. Netflix could also use its cloud gaming business to attract younger consumers who are more interested in gaming than simply watching TV and movies.“They're looking at trends of where people are spending their entertainment time — they're seeing gaming rise faster than linear TV shows, or streaming TV shows, [video on demand],” Ward said. “And, oh, by the way, the demographics looking forward are going to favor gaming in the sense that those users tend to be younger overall.”That combination has likely led Netflix to view cloud gaming as a growth opportunity — even with its challenges.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Tech newsletterMore from DanMicrosoft CEO explains the 'paradox' of the remote work debateMicrosoft CEO: 'Software is ultimately the biggest deflationary force' for businessesGoogle’s Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro: Top tier smartphones with tons of Google smartsGot a tip?

The consensus mark for earnings stands at $2.12 per share, indicating an improvement of 2.9% from the prior-year quarter.Factors to NoteWest Pharmaceutical’s Proprietary Products business continues to exhibit sustained strength and has been an important contributor to the company’s top-line growth. In the first half of 2022, sales improved significantly on the back of double-digit growth in high-value products (HVP). The trend is likely to have continued in the third quarter.Apart from this, the company is likely to have witnessed margin expansion in the aforementioned segment in the to-be-reported quarter, owing to a favorable mix of products sold (stemming from the demand in HVP), production efficiencies and higher sales price.It has been witnessing strong uptake of HVP components, which include Westar and NovaPure offerings. This momentum is likely to have been sustained in the quarter to be reported.West Pharmaceutical has been making significant efforts to retain customers’ faith in the company amid the uncertainty triggered by the pandemic. Apart from ensuring the well-being and safety of team members worldwide, it has successfully maintained the continuity of manufacturing and supply of components to customers.

ABMD recently received the FDA’s 510(k) clearance for its Impella Low Profile Sheath. The company plans to commence its phased roll-out in the fiscal third quarter of 2023.The latest regulatory clearance for Impella Low Profile Sheath is a significant stepping stone for Abiomed’s coronary business across the world.Significance of the ApprovalAbiomed’s latest Impella Low Profile Sheath has a slightly lesser outer diameter (unlike the existing 14 French sheath) with the same inner diameter used for placement of Impella CP. The smaller size of the Low Profile Sheath and other technological advancements will likely facilitate easier Impella insertion and removal and reduce procedural steps, thereby improving patient outcomes.The Low Profile Sheath is currently the first sheath which has been specifically designed to be compatible with the Impella single-access technique. This eliminates the need for any additional access site, besides having a few other advantages like minimizing vascular complications and bleeding, among others.Per management, the Low Profile Sheath is expected to further improve patient outcomes by making it easier for physicians to insert, manage and remove Impella heart pumps.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Research and Markets, the global heart pump device market is anticipated to reach $5.5 billion by 2026 from $2.1 billion in 2021 at a CAGR of 21.6%. Factors like the rising prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and long waiting periods for heart transplants are likely to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest regulatory approvals are likely to provide a significant boost to Abiomed’s business globally.Recent DevelopmentsAbiomed, this month, announced that the FDA has accepted and closed the post-approval study reports related to the pre-market approvals for Impella heart pumps.Last month, Abiomed announced the result of a three-year, investigator-led study of all Impella-supported patients treated at 109 hospitals in Japan.

DVA is scheduled to release third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 28, before market open.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings of $2.30 per share topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9%. Over the trailing four quarters, its earnings outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and lagged the same in one, delivering an earnings surprise of 3.8%, on average.Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayOn the second-quarter 2022 call in August, DaVita confirmed that it registered an uptick in revenue per treatment, partially driven by the continued shift to Medicare Advantage plans. This trend is likely to have continued into the third quarter, thereby driving up the quarter’s revenues. However, decreased government rate related to the reinstatement of 1% Medicare sequestration beginning Apr 1 is likely to have a negative impact on third-quarter revenues.DaVita acquired MedSleuth in early January. MedSleuth’s software enables closer partnerships and better coordination between transplant centers, nephrologists and kidney care providers, with all three working together to support the company’s patient transplant journey. This is also likely to have aided DaVita in the to-be-reported quarter, thereby pushing up the overall top line.DaVita Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseDaVita Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseDaVita Inc. price-eps-surprise | DaVita Inc. QuoteDaVita has been engaged in a value-based partnership with more than 1,800 nephrologists across the United States, with more than 600 nephrologists using an integrated chronic kidney disease electronic health record. This buoys our optimism about the stock.During the second-quarter earnings call, management confirmed that COVID-19 infections and mortality in DaVita’s patient pool declined after the Omicron surge in the first quarter of 2022 through May but increased again in June and July. The uncertainty of the impact of COVID on mortality, mistreatment and treatment volumes looms large on DaVita’s performance in the third quarter.Story continuesMoreover, labor costs have continued to remain a challenge over the past few months with higher contracted labor utilization and base wage increases. Despite management’s efforts to offset the impact of wage and other inflationary increases, these are likely to have weighed on the company’s third-quarter 2022 top line.The Estimate PictureFor third-quarter 2022, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.98 billion for total revenues calls for an improvement of 1.5% from the prior-year reported figure.We estimate third-quarter total revenues to be $2.97 billion, reflecting an uptick of 1.2% year over year.The consensus estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $1.67, indicating a decline of 29.2% from the prior-year reported number.We estimate third-quarter earnings to be $1.72, reflecting a decline of 27.2% year over year.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), along with a positive Earnings ESP has higher chances of beating estimates.

Don't Ignore These 2 Medical Stocks Set to Beat Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/want-better-returns-dont-ignore-130001918.html,1666357201,STORY,['MCK'],"[Two factors often determine stock prices in the long run: earnings and interest rates. Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. McKesson (MCK) earns a Zacks Rank #2 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $6.15 a share, just 11 days from its upcoming earnings release on November 1, 2022.McKesson's Earnings ESP sits at 0.27%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $6.15 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.13.MCK is part of a big group of Medical stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at AVEO Pharmaceuticals (AVEO) as well.AVEO Pharmaceuticals is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on November 14, 2022. AVEO's Most Accurate Estimate sits at -$0.15 a share 24 days from its next earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AVEO Pharmaceuticals is -$0.16, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 8.16%.Story continuesMCK and AVEO's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The Breast Health arm is expected to have seen signs of recovery amid the ongoing chip shortage.We anticipate the company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results, scheduled for release on Oct 31 after the closing bell, to reflect these aspects.Click here to know how the company’s overall fiscal fourth-quarter performance is expected to be.DiagnosticsHologic’s Molecular Diagnostics sales for the fiscal fourth quarter are likely to have been impacted by a significant drop in the demand for COVID-19 testing. However, the company seems to be optimistic about the benefits of non-COVID assays on the Panther system. Particularly, with COVID-19 severity gradually subsiding, women are fast returning to their wellness exams and procedures over the past few months. This might have significantly boosted the segment’s revenues in fiscal Q4.On the fiscal Q3 earnings call, Hologic noted strong global diagnostic business growth amid the adversities. According to the company, this is aclear sign that its expanded Panther installed base is being utilized. This also indicates that Panther is gaining position as an instrument of choice as customers consolidate their molecular testing menu to high throughput, high automation platforms. With the non-COVID testing market improving further through the months of fiscal Q4, we expect improved utilization of the Panther installed base. More specifically, the fourth-quarter performance is expected to have been driven by a combination of both legacy and new assays, namely the BBCVTV vaginitis panel, MGen, CTMG and respiratory menu on the Panther Fusion.Breast HealthDespite being faced with supply chain headwinds related to the semiconductor chip shortage, Hologic has been leaving no stone unturned to address the robust underlying demand for its breast health products. There is likely to have been an improvement in sequential performance by the segment during the fiscal fourth quarter on a robust product portfolio and increasing backlog growth. As the economies around the world return to normalcy, we anticipate a rebound in breast screenings to significantly contribute to the segment’s upcoming results.Story continuesHologic, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseHologic, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseHologic, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Hologic, Inc. QuoteThe ongoing positive trends within Breast Health include stabilizing lead times, procurement through a combination of channels and narrowing the breadth and depth of tight supply. In addition, during the last earnings call, Hologic noted that the sales force continues to place orders in line with quotas set prior to the chip headwind surfacing, and there has been no meaningful change to the rate of canceled orders. A similar trend is expected to get reflected in the Q4 results.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has higher chances of beating estimates.

269,fb0ad94a-123d-3bc7-a30d-f155235f2b7e,MCK,2022-10-22,5 Solid Dividend Growth Stocks for Q4,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-solid-dividend-growth-stocks-112911401.html,1666351751,STORY,"['BCC', 'IRM', 'NFG', 'MCK']","[Dividend investing is in vogue amid huge volatility and uncertainty. Persistently high inflation and Fed’s aggressive rate hikes might push the economy into a recession and have been making investors jittery.In such a scenario, dividends are major sources of consistent income for investors though they do not offer dramatic price appreciation. These stocks can reduce the volatility of a portfolio and tend to outperform in a choppy market.In fact, stocks with a strong history of year-over-year dividend growth form a healthy portfolio, with a greater scope of capital appreciation, as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those that have high yields. We have selected five dividend growth stocks — Boise Cascade BCC, RCI Hospitality Holdings Inc. RICK, Iron Mountain IRM, McKesson Corporation MCK and National Fuel Gas Company NFG — that could be compelling picks amid market volatility.Dividend Growth: A Winning StrategyStocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a dividend increase is likely in the future.Moreover, a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation than simple dividend-paying stocks or those with high yields. Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appears as a winning strategy when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenues.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3-5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&amp;P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&amp;P 500 over the past year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environments.Growth Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just 18.Here are five of the 18 stocks that fit the bill:Idaho-based Boise Cascade operates as a wood products manufacturer and building materials distributor. It has seen a solid earnings estimate revision of 42 cents for this year over the past month and has an expected earnings growth rate of 13.97%.Boise Cascade has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of B.

It saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 12 cents over the past 30 days for the fiscal year (ending Sep 2022) and has an expected earnings growth rate of 29.2%.RCI Hospitality has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of A.Massachusetts-based Iron Mountain provides records &amp; information management services and data center space &amp; solutions in 59 countries. It has estimated earnings growth of 37% for this year and delivered an average earnings surprise of 9.5% in the past four quarters.Iron Mountain has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of B.California-based McKesson is a healthcare services and information technology company.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Value Stocks That Are Too Cheap To Ignore.The current bloodbath that stock markets are facing could not have been predicted by Nostradamus himself if he were alive last year. The ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine has led to the disruption of the global energy markets, which, when paired with the lax monetary policies of central banks all around, has resulted in skyrocketing inflation. The banks are now on an interest rate hike spree, which is leading to capital flowing out of the markets into more secure assets such as the U.S. dollar.This has caused high growth stocks, and those that have invested in them, such as Cathie Wood's Ark Investment, to make big losses this year. For instance, shares of the consumer electronics giant Apple, Inc are down a massive 21% year to date and those of Tesla have bled an even more massive 45% in value this year. Similarly, Ms. Wood's Ark Investment has lost large sums of money as well, with its flagship Ark Innovation fund down a painful 60% year to date as of October 2022.Against this backdrop, value stocks, or those that are trading in more modest price to earnings ranges, are starting to look attractive. As opposed to eye catching technology players that have the potential for vast amounts of growth due to disruptive technologies forming the backbone of their operations, value stocks are those that chug along at a stable pace, in the background, and without demanding much attention. The price to earnings ratio is used to measure the 'premium' that market participants are willing to pay for a company over its bottom line earnings, and high growth stocks have higher P/E ratios as their future earnings potential is judged to be higher than current earnings.Not only the P/E ratio but industries can also be used to pick out value stocks. For example, large-scale pharmaceutical retailers tend to have low growth estimates but stable revenues - with the latter becoming even more important now as the threat of a recession looms in the not so distant future. While all stocks lose their value in a recession, value stocks are less prone to large swings in investor or market sentiment, and some have even managed to grow during troubling times due to stable earnings from essential products such as medicines.Story continuesIn today's piece, we have selected some top value stocks for you, and some notable picks include CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS), and QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM).Photo by Ruben Sukatendel on UnsplashOur Methodology We took a broad look at several industries to identify the value players in sectors such as energy, pharmaceuticals, and retail. The firms were then selected after analyzing their financials and market dynamics, following which they were ranked through Insider Monkey's 895 hedge fund survey for the second quarter of this year. These stocks are cheap when compared to their peers and true value.10 Value Stocks That Are Too Cheap To Ignore10.

Yet, after the maintenance, they will run at full capacity for the next year, implying that there is a strong potential upside to the shares.Additionally, UAN28 nitrogen prices have started to rise again after dropping earlier this year, and the shortage of gas in Europe is believed to further contribute to the growing prices.

289,8743f5cf-b2dd-3301-a8e0-20b3f9995b04,CL,2022-10-22,Earnings Preview: Colgate-Palmolive (CL) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-colgate-palmolive-cl-140002479.html,1666360802,STORY,['CL'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Colgate-Palmolive (CL) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 28. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis consumer products maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.74 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -8.6%.Revenues are expected to be $4.5 billion, up 1.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.51% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Colgate-Palmolive?For Colgate-Palmolive, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.29%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Colgate-Palmolive will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Colgate-Palmolive would post earnings of $0.71 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.72, delivering a surprise of +1.41%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Colgate-Palmolive doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

294,089716b2-0c0c-3340-b9c5-249fd47cfb6b,CMCSA,2022-10-22,Charter Communications (CHTR) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charter-communications-chtr-reports-next-140002345.html,1666360802,STORY,"['CHTR', 'CMCSA']","[The market expects Charter Communications (CHTR) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 28. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis cable provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $7.98 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +22.8%.Revenues are expected to be $13.67 billion, up 4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.23% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Charter?For Charter, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.50%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Charter will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Charter would post earnings of $6.92 per share when it actually produced earnings of $8.80, delivering a surprise of +27.17%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Charter doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Cable Television industry, Comcast (CMCSA), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.89 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +2.3%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $29.71 billion, down 1.9% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Comcast has been revised 0.2% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 3.04%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Comcast will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Devon Energy (DVN), which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This oil and gas exploration company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 8.43%.For the most recent quarter, Devon Energy was expected to post earnings of $2.38 per share, but it reported $2.59 per share instead, representing a surprise of 8.82%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.74 per share, while it actually produced $1.88 per share, a surprise of 8.05%.Price and EPS SurpriseWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Devon Energy. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Devon Energy currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.29%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects.

We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on November 1, 2022.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best High Beta Stocks To Buy Now. Beta, a statistical measure of a stock's relative volatility to the broader market index, is often interpreted as a measure of riskiness. A beta of more than 1.0 means that the stock is more volatile than the overall market and a beta less than 1.0 indicates lower volatility than the benchmark index. Thus, stocks with higher betas tend to gain more in bull markets but also plummet harder in bear markets. High beta stocks are positively correlated with returns of the S&amp;P 500, but at an escalated rate. Famous equity bull Jeremy Siegel, a professor of finance at the University of Pennsylvania, told Bloomberg on October 15 that American stocks are still a “marvelous” bet for investors with a long-term horizon, despite the Federal Reserve’s intense rate policies pushing the S&amp;P 500 into bear territory. He believes that although high interest rates and recession fears are casting a shadow over the stock market currently, it might not be the case for much longer if rates succumb to their long-term trends. That could elevate stocks, in Siegel’s opinion. He explained his stance further:“I’m staying put, I certainly wouldn’t be surprised if a year, year and half from now we’re 20-30% higher. I think stocks are undervalued greatly in the long-run.”To prepare for an eventual bull market, it is prudent to invest in high beta stocks which are trading at attractive discounts right now. Some of the best high beta stocks include Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), and HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA). Our MethodologyWe have selected the stocks with a beta value of more than 1 as of October 21.

(NASDAQ:PLUG) with a Buy rating and a $28 price target. Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG) manufactures PEM fuel cell systems and seeks to cover the entire hydrogen value chain by marketing electrolyzers and its own green H2 volumes, said the analyst, who believes Plug Power Inc.

(NASDAQ:ETSY) is a New York-based company that operates an online marketplace which connects buyers and sellers in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, Australia, France, and India. Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY) is one of the best high beta stocks to invest in. Goldman Sachs analyst Alexandra Steiger on October 10 initiated coverage of Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY) with a Buy rating and a $130 price target. Through continuous macro headwinds, Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY) has demonstrated a ""great level of resiliency"" compared to many of its e-commerce peers, the analyst told investors. The analyst said Etsy, Inc.

John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 1.5 million shares worth $114 million. Here is what Artisan Partners specifically said about Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY) is the leading e-commerce marketplace for buyers and sellers of unique, hard-to-find products that are “handmade, vintage, or a craft supply.” We believe the company has a long runway for continued top-line growth given its large addressable market and distinct product assortment. In addition, we have been impressed with the operational progress this management team has made since taking the helm in 2017. We acknowledge e-commerce trends have been challenged as consumers shift toward in-person experiences post[1]pandemic, but over time we expect industry growth to return to the long-term trend. Shares have pulled back 75% since topping out in late 2021. Examining this opportunity through a longer-term lens, we initiated a GardenSM position during the quarter at an attractive discount to our PMV estimate.”9. APA Corporation (NASDAQ:APA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36Beta Value: 3.69Next on our list of the best high beta stocks is APA Corporation (NASDAQ:APA), a Texas-based company that develops and operates oil and gas properties. The company announced on October 3 that it expects Q3 U.S. production of 212,000 boe/day, topping the high end of previous guidance. On September 14, APA Corporation (NASDAQ:APA) declared a $0.25 per share quarterly dividend, a 100% increase from its prior dividend of $0.13. The dividend is payable on November 24, to shareholders of record on October 21. The board of directors also approved a further 40 million common shares for repurchase. On October 19, Barclays analyst Jeanine Wai maintained an Overweight rating on APA Corporation (NASDAQ:APA) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $46 from $53 ahead of the Q3 results.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 36 hedge funds were bullish on APA Corporation (NASDAQ:APA) at the end of the second quarter of 2022, compared to 46 funds in the last quarter. Harris Associates is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 16.7 million shares worth nearly $582 million. Here is what Oakmark Select Fund has to say about APA Corporation (NASDAQ:APA) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Our oil holding, APA Corporation (NASDAQ:APA) (+54%) was one of our top contributors in the quarter as oil prices rallied due to tight supplies, which were then exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Although their share prices have increased considerably, both companies still look quite undervalued even using longer term oil prices in the $65-70 dollar range. Meanwhile, if times are good over the next couple of years, we expect these companies to return significant percentages of their market caps to shareholders.”8. ON Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:ON)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39Beta Value: 1.73ON Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:ON) is an Arizona-based company that provides intelligent sensing and power solutions worldwide. According to the company’s Q3 2022 outlook, the revenue will range from $2.07 billion to $2.17 billion, versus a consensus of $2.02 billion. ON Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:ON)’s adjusted EPS is forecasted to be in the range of $1.25 to $1.37, compared to a consensus of $1.22. ON Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:ON) is one of the best high beta stocks to buy now. On October 18, Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore reiterated a Buy recommendation on ON Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:ON) but trimmed the price target on the stock to $70 from $75. Fears of fundamental deterioration are ""leading to very bearish investor positioning"" into the Q3 results for semiconductors. However, the analyst is becoming ""incrementally more constructive,"" noting the drop in the sector compared to the S&amp;P 500 has been priced into the shares in terms of revenue and EPS estimate cuts and the group valuation is 20% under its 5-year average.According to Insider Monkey’s Q2 data, 39 hedge funds were bullish on ON Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:ON), compared to 48 funds in the last quarter. Jeffrey Smith’s Starboard Value LP is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 5.6 million shares worth $282.6 million. Here is what Artisan Partners specifically said about ON Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:ON) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“ON Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:ON) is a global market leader in power management and image sensors. The company reported 49% gross margins in 1Q22 which met the new management team’s 48%-50% long-term target after revising it higher just one quarter ago. We believe ON has a clear path to &gt;50% gross margins, and its financial results reflect the ongoing structural improvements in both manufacturing and products, cost initiatives, product mix and rising prices. Growing demand for chips in electric vehicles, renewable energy infrastructure, advanced driver assistance (multiple cameras), factory automation and machine vision should drive sustainable high single-digit top-line growth.

(NASDAQ:MAR) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $185, up from $165. The analyst noted that the swift recovery in lodging has yet to be factored into the shares. ""Even allowing for the threat of a recession moving into 2023, the shape of the recovery means that we expect strong RevPAR increases in 2023 across the sector,"" the analyst told investors in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s Q2 data, 46 hedge funds were bullish on Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR), compared to 52 funds in the prior quarter. Boykin Curry’s Eagle Capital Management is the biggest position holder in the company, with 8.8 million shares worth $1.2 billion. Here is what Aristotle Capital Management Small Cap Equity has to say about Marriott International Inc. (NYSE:MAR) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Marriott International outperformed in the first quarter following a better-than-expected earnings report for the company’s fourth quarter of 2021. During the pandemic, the company reduced expenses which improved operating leverage as revenue recovers. Expectations for travel in 2022 have improved as COVID cases have declined. The company has a strong pipeline of new hotels coming into the Marriott system. There are some indications that business-related travel is starting to recover.”6. Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54Beta Value: 2.01Another important high beta stock to monitor is Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG), a Texas-based independent oil and natural gas company that operates in the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico.

(NASDAQ:FANG) at the end of June 2022, compared to 47 funds in the prior quarter worth $887 million. Harris Associates held the leading stake in the company, comprising 1.5 million shares valued at $181.2 million. Like Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), and HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA), Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG) is one of the best high beta stocks to buy according to elite hedge funds. Here is what Miller Opportunity Equity has to say about Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“Diamondback Energy (FANG) returned 14.4% in the quarter as oil price rose and fell during the quarter ending the period largely in the same place that it started. The company reported strong 3Q results beating on the top and bottom line. The company reported revenue of $1.9B beating consensus of $1.5B with EPS of $2.94 beating expectations for $2.79. The beat was driven by a combination of higher volumes, higher realizations, and efficiency gains. The company increased its total production guidance for the year to 370-372mboe/d1 (up from 363-370mboe/d) while lowering Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) guidance for the second time this year to $1.49-1.53B.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this software maker have returned +4.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -5.1% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Oracle belongs, has lost 1.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Oracle is expected to post earnings of $1.18 per share, indicating a change of -2.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.97 points to a change of +1.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.2%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.52 indicates a change of +11% from what Oracle is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for Oracle.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for ORCL _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Oracle, the consensus sales estimate of $12.05 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +16.3%. The $49.62 billion and $52.9 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +16.9% and +6.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryOracle reported revenues of $11.45 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.7%. EPS of $1.03 for the same period compares with $1.03 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.47 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.18%. The EPS surprise was -3.74%.Over the last four quarters, Oracle surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Oracle is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Oracle. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

307,4a15faac-73df-3b1b-987d-cf13a61e1fd5,HAS,2022-10-22,ExxonMobil and Hasbro have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exxonmobil-hasbro-highlighted-zacks-bull-130701284.html,1666357621,STORY,"['XOM', 'HAS', 'TSLA', '^GSPC']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – October 21, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares ExxonMobil XOM as the Bull of the Day and Hasbro, Inc. HAS as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Tesla TSLA and Ford F.Here is a synopsis of all four stocks.Bull of the Day:ExxonMobil is one of the leaders in the hottest sector of 2022: energy. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is busting out to new 5-year highs when almost everyone else is breaking down.ExxonMobil is one of the largest energy companies in the world. It explores, produces, refines and owns service stations around the world. But it's also one of the largest chemical companies as well.In the 2000s, ExxonMobil was one of the largest companies in the world. Will it regain its crown during this commodities cycle?Earnings Coming on Oct 28, 2022On Oct 28, ExxonMobil will report third quarter earnings. It has beat 3 out of the last 4 quarters but has had a nice streak during the pandemic.Analysts remain bullish with oil and natural gas prices remaining elevated. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is looking for $3.60 in the quarter with 4 estimates revised higher in the last 30 days but just 2 lowered during that time.Big Earnings Growth in 2022With other companies cutting guidance or seeing declining earnings, ExxonMobil is sitting pretty in 2022.Earnings are expected to rise 146.7% year-over-year to $13.27 from just $5.38 last year. Analysts have gotten more bullish over the last 90 days, with earnings jumping to $13.27 from $11.95 in that time.Analysts are conservative about next year, however, currently seeing earnings softening by 18.6% to $10.81. However, it's still too early to have any insights into commodity prices in 2023, which are the main driver of earnings.Dividend All-StarExxonMobil has long been a favorite of income investors as it has paid a dividend for decades. ExxonMobil says on its website that payments to shareholders have grown at an average annual rate of 6% over the last 39 years.Story continuesThat's a nice added bonus for shareholders as the stock has been challenged during some of that time period.Despite shares being up 69.9% this year and breaking out to a new 5-year high, over that 5-years, shares are up just 25%. For comparison purposes, the S&amp;P 500 was up 43% during that same time period.ExxonMobil's dividend is currently yielding 3.4%.Shares are Dirt CheapEven with shares at new 5-year highs, earnings are soaring so the shares are still cheap.It trades with a forward P/E of 7.8. The S&amp;P 500 is trading at 17x.ExxonMobil also has a PEG Ratio of just 0.3. A PEG under 1.0 usually indicates a company has both value and growth, which is a powerful combination.For investors looking to get into oil stocks, ExxonMobil is one of the leaders and one to keep on your short list.Bear of the Day:Hasbro, Inc. is seeing a slowdown as consumers feel inflationary pressures. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) is expected to see earnings decline 11% this year.Hasbro is a global branded entertainment leader through gaming, consumer products and entertainment. Some of its brands include Magic: The Gathering, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Hasbro Gaming, Nerf, Transformers, Play-doh and Peppa Pig.A Miss in the Third Quarter of 2022On Oct 18, 2022, Hasbro reported its third quarter earnings and missed on the Zacks Consensus by $0.11. Earnings were $1.42 versus the Zacks Consensus of $1.53.Revenue fell 15%, or 12% on a constant currency basis, to $1.68 billion. The results were impacted by the acceleration of Consumer Products shipments by its retailers into the second quarter due to anticipated supply chain challenges, as well as Magic: The Gathering set releases and entertainment content scheduled for release in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter like last year.All three of its segments saw declines. Consumer Products, it's largest segment, fell 10% to $1.16 billion from $1.28 billion a year ago.Wizards and Digital Gaming fell 16% to $303.5 million from $360.2 million in 2021. Entertainment dropped 35% to $211.6 million from $327.1 million a year ago.Hasbro also saw ""increasing price sensitivity for the average consumer"" in the quarter.As a result, Hasbro guided to flat fourth quarter year-over-year revenue, with strength coming from its Wizards and Digital Gaming segment.The company also has a 3-year cost cutting program which is aimed to drive $250 to $300 million per year in savings.Full Year 2022 and 2023 Earnings Estimates CutGiven the earnings miss and the company's guidance, it's not surprising that analysts have been lowering earnings estimates.For 2022, 6 estimates were cut in the last 30 days, including 1 in the last week, which has pushed the Zacks Consensus Estimate down to $4.65 from $5.09. That's an earnings decline of 11% because the company made $5.23 last year.Analysts are also bearish on 2023, with 6 estimates cut in the last 30 days and 2 cut in the last week. The 2023 Zacks Consensus Estimate has come down to $5.38 from $5.68 during that time. However, that's still earnings growth of 15.7% from 2022.Committed to Its DividendHasbro pays a juicy dividend, currently yielding 4.3%.If you're worried that it may not be ""safe"" from cuts, in its press release, Hasbro said it was ""committed"" to its ""industry-leading"" dividend.The next quarterly dividend of $0.70 will be paid on Nov 15, 2022, to shareholders of record as of Nov 1, 2022.Shares are CheapHasbro shares are down 37% year-to-date and have entered into value territory.It trades with a forward P/E of 13.9 and has a P/S ratio of just 1.5.But if the US enters into a recession in 2023, will these shares get even cheaper?Investors interested in entertainment and gaming might want to wait on the sidelines for those earnings to turn back around before diving in.Additional content:Should You Sell the Tesla Sales Miss?Tesla is the leading EV maker by far and the world is doubling down on EV adoption with government subsidies, policy changes and infrastructure buildup. This should be the perfect backdrop for solid growth into the foreseeable future, which is what CEO Elon Musk has talked about on the earnings call.The competition is not sitting idle either because as Musk himself says, “We are still a very small percentage of the total vehicles on the road” and “We're about a long way to go to even reach 1% of the global fleet.” The scope for expansion is huge and there is obviously room to accommodate more than one player. Therefore, share erosion at Tesla is only to be expected even as its volumes grow.According to elektrek which quotes registration data from Experian, Tesla currently accounts for 68% of registered electric vehicles in the U.S., one of the largest EV markets. That’s great, but it’s down from 79% at the end of 2020 and close to 70% at the end of 2021, as more players enter the market. But as the site points out, Tesla conceded a little over 1% of its revenue in the first half of this year to rivals, which grew their U.S. deliveries 58%. All four Tesla models were in the top 5, with only Ford’s Mustang Mach-E pushing into the third position. Being the first mover, Tesla has had the time to create its own fan base, which is just as well because the established players now taking share already have theirs.As this analysis by Troy Teslike shows, Tesla’s international deliveries are gradually catching up with demand, as seen from the declining backlog, although some regions continue to see extended wait times. Musk explained on the call that the main problem is outbound logistics because production is typically backend-loaded (“roughly two-thirds of our Q3 deliveries occurred in September and one-third in the final two weeks”). There simply aren’t enough ships from Shanghai to Europe or local trucking in parts of the U.S. and Europe to deal with this sudden burst in demand. This problem will take time to iron out, so the fourth quarter won’t be immune to it.The delivery issue stems from more demand not less and so, should be viewed as a problem that is good to have. Especially since management is on it. The goal is to spread out builds to ease pressure at the end of the period and we may expect some improvement next year.It is hard to view the above situation negatively. And it’s worth noting that Tesla also has an energy business that is expected to grow faster than its vehicles business, which Musk thinks will grow at 30% a year for the foreseeable future. And any recession that may happen next year will not have them taking down vehicle production. There is just so much demand out there.Therefore, I would be the last person asking you to sell Tesla shares. If you’re concerned about valuation, you could sit on it, because valuation has fluctuated wildly, as the company gradually proved its business (and production) model. Although expensive at 47.71X P/E, it is the lowest level the shares have traded this year.Tesla does have problems related to raw material procurement as well as the logistics problems discussed above. The strong U.S. dollar also doesn’t help a company that generates a significant percentage of sales overseas and does a significant amount of production within the country.The recession could create the perfect opportunity to load up, as the shares could get beaten down further (they are down 37% year to date). Or the persistent rate hikes could do it. The Zacks #3 (Hold) rank on Tesla shares appears to support this strategy.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

(NASDAQ:WING) franchises and operates restaurants under the Wingstop brand name. It is one of the premier fast food stocks to invest in. On October 17, Wingstop announced that it will give away free chicken sandwiches for a year in the form of a gift card to the first 50 fans at various locations in New York City. On October 12, Wingstop revealed the opening of its new restaurant in Emmaus. The restaurant will be owned and operated by Wingstop and Talon Restaurants.On October 11, Deutsche Bank analyst Brian Mullan maintained a Hold rating on Wingstop Inc. (NASDAQ:WING) stock and raised the price target to $135 from $117, highlighting that investors expected the company’s Q3 domestic same-store-sales results to be below the current consensus estimates. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, London-based investment firm Fundsmith LLP is a leading shareholder in Wingstop Inc. (NASDAQ:WING), with 825,464 shares worth more than $61.7 million.  In its Q2 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Wingstop Inc.

(NASDAQ:WING). Wingstop, meanwhile, in the consumer discretionary sector, is doing to chicken wings what Domino’s did to pizza. With a strong digital model, the franchise-based business has a long runway for growth with an existing base of 1,500 stores expanding to potentially 6,000 units and compelling franchisee economics.”8. Papa John’s International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 20 Papa John’s International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA) operates and franchises pizza delivery and carryout restaurants under the Papa John's trademark in the United States and internationally. It is one of the major fast food stocks to invest in. On October 19, Papa John's International launched its latest Halloween-themed international market campaign. On October 7, BTIG analyst Peter Saleh maintained a Buy rating on Papa John's International, Inc.

(NASDAQ:PZZA), with 2.8 million shares worth more than $230.5 million. In its Q3 2021 investor letter, Artisan Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Papa John’s International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Papa John’s International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA) is a global operator and franchisor of pizza delivery and carryout restaurants. The company is tracking nicely against our turnaround thesis which hinges upon an improvement in store-level economics leading to accelerating growth in restaurant development activity. Improved store-level economics is being driven in part by market share gains resulting from menu innovation. New menu items—parmesan crusted Papadias, Epic Stuffed Crust, Shaq-a-roni— coupled with enhancements to the digital/loyalty platform and supportive advertising are attracting new customers to the brand, increasing frequency of its existing customers and driving higher unit volumes and returns. As a result, the company is experiencing incremental interest from new and existing franchisees to develop new restaurants. Papa John’s opened a record 123 units in the first half of 2021 and now expects to open 220-260 new stores this year (vs. 140-180 previously)—most of which are outside of the US. Combined with ample white space globally, we believe a higher unit growth trajectory will drive an attractive and sustainable profit cycle.”7. Restaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 20     Restaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR) operates as a quick service restaurant company. It is one of the elite fast food stocks to invest in.

(NYSE:QSR) stock and lowered the price target to $68 from $70. Analyst Brian Mullan issued the ratings update. At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 20 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.5 billion in Restaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR), compared to 23 in the previous quarter worth $1.8 billion.Here is what Pershing Square Holdings has to say about Restaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR) in its Q2 2021 investor letter:“QSR’s franchised business model is a high-quality, capital-light, growing annuity that generates high-margin brand royalty fees from three leading brands: Burger King, Tim Hortons and Popeyes. The company has nimbly navigated the COVID-19 pandemic and continues to make progress on returning its brands to sustainable long-term growth.Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company has bolstered its safety procedures and is accelerating its digital investments by expanding its delivery footprint, modernizing its drive-thru experience, increasing mobile ordering adoption, and improving its loyalty programs. As the global recovery continues to be uneven, these initiatives will allow the company and its franchisees to serve customers in a safe and reliable manner.Each of the company’s brands are at various stages in recovery, with Burger King and Popeyes having returned to growth, while Tim Hortons is well on its way to recovering. On a two-year basis, same-store-sales grew 2.4% at Burger King and 24.4% at Popeyes during the last quarter. Meanwhile, Tim Hortons in Canada has improved to a mid-single digit decline in July, with each month during the second quarter showing sequential improvement. Tim Hortons’ slower recovery is largely driven by strict COVID-19 restrictions in Canada, which were only recently lifted in large provinces such as Ontario. In rural and suburban parts of Canada where restrictions were lifted earlier, Tim Hortons has already returned to growth. Given the habitual nature of Tim Hortons’ customer base, the recovery in sales will be tied to mobility and reopening.The company expects to return to its historical mid-single-digit unit growth this year, and recently announced expansions for both Tim Hortons and Popeyes in large international markets. As underlying sales trends at each of its brands continue to improve, and as the impact from COVID-19 restrictions ease, we believe Restaurant Brands’ share price will more accurately reflect our view of its improving business fundamentals.”6. The Wendy’s Company (NASDAQ:WEN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28   The Wendy’s Company (NASDAQ:WEN) operates as a quick-service restaurant company. It is one of the prominent fast food stocks to invest in. On September 26, Wendy’s stated that it is adding technology to its delivery process at thousands of its restaurants in the US and Canada by partnering with an order integrator, ItsACheckmate. 6,000 locations are selected all over Canada and the US for the purpose.   On September 22, Stephens analyst Joshua Long initiated coverage of The Wendy’s Company (NASDAQ:WEN) stock with an Overweight rating and a $25 price target, highlighting that ongoing menu and breakfast innovation would be an important driver of same-store sales and continued momentum in the growth of the firm. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm Trian Partners is a leading shareholder in The Wendy’s Company (NASDAQ:WEN), with 25 million shares worth more than $478 million.Alongside Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), and Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM), The Wendy’s Company (NASDAQ:WEN) is one of the best fast food stocks to buy now according to elite investors.  Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Fast Food Stocks to Buy Now. Suggested Articles:12 Best Momentum Stocks To Invest In10 Best Guru Stocks To Buy11 Best Income Stocks to Buy Right Now Disclosure.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis insurance brokerage is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.01 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +15.5%.Revenues are expected to be $2.8 billion, up 3.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.65% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Aon?For Aon, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.68%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Aon will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Aon would post earnings of $2.57 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.63, delivering a surprise of +2.33%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Aon doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Insurance - Brokerage industry, Arthur J. Gallagher (AJG) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.67 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +25.6%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $2.04 billion, down 3% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Arthur J. Gallagher has been revised 0.5% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.25%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Arthur J. Gallagher will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

310,a7160fdf-9b09-334b-9bdb-ecbf4ce09199,MCD,2022-10-22,Insiders who sold US$3.7m worth of McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) stock last year were handsomely rewarded,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-sold-us-3-7m-110106810.html,1666436466,STORY,['MCD'],"[Last week, McDonald's Corporation's (NYSE:MCD) stock jumped 4.7%, but insiders who sold US$3.7m worth of stock in over the past year are likely to be in a better position. Selling at an average price of US$258, which is higher than the current price, may have been the wisest decision for these insiders as their investment would have been worth less now than when they sold.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for McDonald's McDonald's Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP &amp; CFO, Ian Borden, for US$2.0m worth of shares, at about US$256 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$255. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.In total, McDonald's insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeI will like McDonald's better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insiders At McDonald's Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of McDonald's shares. Specifically, insiders ditched US$3.2m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Insider Ownership Of McDonald'sFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. McDonald's insiders own 0.09% of the company, currently worth about US$177m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At McDonald's Tell Us?Insiders haven't bought McDonald's stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. At Simply Wall St, we found 2 warning signs for McDonald's that deserve your attention before buying any shares.Of course McDonald's may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

The stock lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 2.37%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 2.47%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.07%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the world's biggest hamburger chain had gained 0.74% over the past month. This has outpaced the Retail-Wholesale sector's loss of 6.06% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 4.82% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from McDonald's as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be October 27, 2022. On that day, McDonald's is projected to report earnings of $2.57 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 6.88%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $5.71 billion, down 7.9% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $9.79 per share and revenue of $22.62 billion. These totals would mark changes of +5.5% and -2.58%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for McDonald's. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.39% lower within the past month. McDonald's is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Story continuesDigging into valuation, McDonald's currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 25.51. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 21.03.We can also see that MCD currently has a PEG ratio of 2.74. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. Retail - Restaurants stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 1.88 based on yesterday's closing prices.The Retail - Restaurants industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 87, putting it in the top 35% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

(NASDAQ:WING) franchises and operates restaurants under the Wingstop brand name. It is one of the premier fast food stocks to invest in. On October 17, Wingstop announced that it will give away free chicken sandwiches for a year in the form of a gift card to the first 50 fans at various locations in New York City. On October 12, Wingstop revealed the opening of its new restaurant in Emmaus. The restaurant will be owned and operated by Wingstop and Talon Restaurants.On October 11, Deutsche Bank analyst Brian Mullan maintained a Hold rating on Wingstop Inc. (NASDAQ:WING) stock and raised the price target to $135 from $117, highlighting that investors expected the company’s Q3 domestic same-store-sales results to be below the current consensus estimates. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, London-based investment firm Fundsmith LLP is a leading shareholder in Wingstop Inc. (NASDAQ:WING), with 825,464 shares worth more than $61.7 million.  In its Q2 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Wingstop Inc. (NASDAQ:WING) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Other new buys included Wingstop Inc. (NASDAQ:WING). Wingstop, meanwhile, in the consumer discretionary sector, is doing to chicken wings what Domino’s did to pizza. With a strong digital model, the franchise-based business has a long runway for growth with an existing base of 1,500 stores expanding to potentially 6,000 units and compelling franchisee economics.”8. Papa John’s International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 20 Papa John’s International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA) operates and franchises pizza delivery and carryout restaurants under the Papa John's trademark in the United States and internationally. It is one of the major fast food stocks to invest in. On October 19, Papa John's International launched its latest Halloween-themed international market campaign. On October 7, BTIG analyst Peter Saleh maintained a Buy rating on Papa John's International, Inc.

(NASDAQ:PZZA), with 2.8 million shares worth more than $230.5 million. In its Q3 2021 investor letter, Artisan Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Papa John’s International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Papa John’s International, Inc. (NASDAQ:PZZA) is a global operator and franchisor of pizza delivery and carryout restaurants. The company is tracking nicely against our turnaround thesis which hinges upon an improvement in store-level economics leading to accelerating growth in restaurant development activity. Improved store-level economics is being driven in part by market share gains resulting from menu innovation. New menu items—parmesan crusted Papadias, Epic Stuffed Crust, Shaq-a-roni— coupled with enhancements to the digital/loyalty platform and supportive advertising are attracting new customers to the brand, increasing frequency of its existing customers and driving higher unit volumes and returns. As a result, the company is experiencing incremental interest from new and existing franchisees to develop new restaurants. Papa John’s opened a record 123 units in the first half of 2021 and now expects to open 220-260 new stores this year (vs. 140-180 previously)—most of which are outside of the US. Combined with ample white space globally, we believe a higher unit growth trajectory will drive an attractive and sustainable profit cycle.”7. Restaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 20     Restaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR) operates as a quick service restaurant company. It is one of the elite fast food stocks to invest in. On September 9, Burger King, a chain of Restaurant Brands International, stated that it is planning for significant spending in the next two years towards reconstructing restaurants and marketing. $400 million will be allocated to increase advertisement firepower. On October 12, investment advisory Deutsche Bank maintained a Buy rating on Restaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR) stock and lowered the price target to $68 from $70. Analyst Brian Mullan issued the ratings update. At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 20 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.5 billion in Restaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR), compared to 23 in the previous quarter worth $1.8 billion.Here is what Pershing Square Holdings has to say about Restaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR) in its Q2 2021 investor letter:“QSR’s franchised business model is a high-quality, capital-light, growing annuity that generates high-margin brand royalty fees from three leading brands: Burger King, Tim Hortons and Popeyes. The company has nimbly navigated the COVID-19 pandemic and continues to make progress on returning its brands to sustainable long-term growth.Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company has bolstered its safety procedures and is accelerating its digital investments by expanding its delivery footprint, modernizing its drive-thru experience, increasing mobile ordering adoption, and improving its loyalty programs. As the global recovery continues to be uneven, these initiatives will allow the company and its franchisees to serve customers in a safe and reliable manner.Each of the company’s brands are at various stages in recovery, with Burger King and Popeyes having returned to growth, while Tim Hortons is well on its way to recovering. On a two-year basis, same-store-sales grew 2.4% at Burger King and 24.4% at Popeyes during the last quarter. Meanwhile, Tim Hortons in Canada has improved to a mid-single digit decline in July, with each month during the second quarter showing sequential improvement. Tim Hortons’ slower recovery is largely driven by strict COVID-19 restrictions in Canada, which were only recently lifted in large provinces such as Ontario. In rural and suburban parts of Canada where restrictions were lifted earlier, Tim Hortons has already returned to growth. Given the habitual nature of Tim Hortons’ customer base, the recovery in sales will be tied to mobility and reopening.The company expects to return to its historical mid-single-digit unit growth this year, and recently announced expansions for both Tim Hortons and Popeyes in large international markets. As underlying sales trends at each of its brands continue to improve, and as the impact from COVID-19 restrictions ease, we believe Restaurant Brands’ share price will more accurately reflect our view of its improving business fundamentals.”6. The Wendy’s Company (NASDAQ:WEN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28   The Wendy’s Company (NASDAQ:WEN) operates as a quick-service restaurant company. It is one of the prominent fast food stocks to invest in. On September 26, Wendy’s stated that it is adding technology to its delivery process at thousands of its restaurants in the US and Canada by partnering with an order integrator, ItsACheckmate. 6,000 locations are selected all over Canada and the US for the purpose.   On September 22, Stephens analyst Joshua Long initiated coverage of The Wendy’s Company (NASDAQ:WEN) stock with an Overweight rating and a $25 price target, highlighting that ongoing menu and breakfast innovation would be an important driver of same-store sales and continued momentum in the growth of the firm. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm Trian Partners is a leading shareholder in The Wendy’s Company (NASDAQ:WEN), with 25 million shares worth more than $478 million.Alongside Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), and Yum!

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for American Express American Express Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chairman &amp; CEO, Stephen Squeri, sold US$8.6m worth of shares at a price of US$178 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$140. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.Insiders in American Express didn't buy any shares in the last year.

Equities have been under pressure this year as the central bank has embarked on an aggressive rate hike path as it attempts to reign in stubbornly high inflation, increasing worries of a policy error that will send the economy into a recession.""You had the (report) and then you had some confirmation that 75 seems to be pretty baked in for November here but perhaps there is room to slow and extend... rather than front-load so high and then have to peel off, you kind of ease to your 4.75% or 5% peak,"" said Tom Hainlin, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis, Minnesota.Story continues""Then maybe just hold there for a while so you are getting a little bit of relief.""The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 748.97 points, or 2.47%, to 31,082.56, the S&amp;P 500 gained 86.97 points, or 2.37%, to 3,752.75 and the Nasdaq Composite added 244.87 points, or 2.31%, to 10,859.72.For the week, the S&amp;P 500 climbed 4.74%, the Dow gained 4.89% and the Nasdaq rose 5.22%. Each of the three major indexes notched their biggest weekly percentage gains in four months.The report helped stocks recover from early losses as Snap Inc plunged 28.08% after posting its slowest quarterly revenue growth in five years as advertisers cut spending due to inflation and geopolitical woes.That weighed on other companies that rely heavily on ad revenue such as Meta Platforms Inc, down 1.16% and Pinterest, off 6.40%.Also falling after reporting quarterly earnings were American Express, which lost 1.67% and Verizon Communications, down 4.46%.American Express said it built bigger provisions to prepare for potential defaults as an economic downturn looms while Verizon's profit slid 23% and the carrier missed estimates for wireless subscriber additions.Next week will bring earnings from names such as Twitter , Microsoft Corp, Alphabet and Apple Inc.Despite the recent batch of disappointing results, third-quarter earnings season has so far has been better-than-feared, with growth expectations for S&amp;P 500 companies at 3.1%, according to Refinitiv data, up from 2.8% earlier in the week but still well below the 11.1% forecast at the start of July.Schlumberger shot up 10.33% to help to lift the S&amp;P 500 energy sector 2.76% after reporting a quarterly profit above expectations.Volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.15 billion shares, compared with the 11.57 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.59-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.03-to-1 ratio favored advancers.The S&amp;P 500 posted 9 new 52-week highs and 32 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 60 new highs and 322 new lows.

But that wasn't enough for the Street. Now for the quarter, though, the numbers were pretty strong, sales jumping at 24% to 13 and 1/2 billion. That's a new record for the company. CEO Stephen Squeri saying that the upbeat-- that he was still upbeat on the consumer, travel demand exceeding expectations. Customers are not changing spending behavior, at least for now.One thing I do want to note, though, profits were up only 3% during the quarter, Jared. A lot of that has to do with the fact that American Express has set aside more than $700 million in anticipation of a tougher macroeconomic environment. You're looking at year to date, with shares off just around 15%.Compare that to the broader market. American Express is actually doing pretty well. So no signs yet, Jared, that the consumer is pulling back. You've got to question, though, what these numbers could potentially look like for the current quarter, and then, of course, maybe for the early quarters of 2023.JARED BLIKRE: Yes, and American Express wasn't the only one that was increasing their loan loss reserves. Let's go to the YFi Interactive. I'm going to do a quick charting on this. We just showed a year to date. This is a one year. And we are, indeed, by some critical levels here. But let me just put a 20-year chart. Oopsies, let's try to get that 20-year chart up one more time as I fat finger this tiny little tablet. All right, here we go. Now, see what we're looking at here. Everybody focus on that, Seana. There we go.SEANA SMITH: You got it.JARED BLIKRE: All right, so we've got a series of consolidations and breaks to new highs, but this is like a textbook upward trend here. It's just taking place over a very, very long period of time. And the current lows are actually the prior highs. And so all is well in the universe here.]"

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 63% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Occidental Petroleum. Check out our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Occidental Petroleum?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Occidental Petroleum already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Occidental Petroleum's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Occidental Petroleum is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is the largest shareholder with 21% of shares outstanding. With 11% and 8.7% of the shares outstanding respectively, Dodge &amp; Cox and The Vanguard Group, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesTo make our study more interesting, we found that the top 5 shareholders control more than half of the company which implies that this group has considerable sway over the company's decision-making.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Occidental PetroleumThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Occidental Petroleum Corporation. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$132m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 16% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Occidental Petroleum. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Public Company OwnershipIt appears to us that public companies own 21% of Occidental Petroleum. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Like risks, for instance.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Boston Scientific (BSX) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.46 a share five days away from its upcoming earnings release on October 26, 2022.BSX has an Earnings ESP figure of 2.63%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.46 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.44.BSX is one of just a large database of Medical stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Medtronic (MDT).Medtronic, which is readying to report earnings on November 22, 2022, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $1.28 a share, and MDT is 32 days out from its next earnings report.Story continuesFor Medtronic, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.28 is 0.06%.BSX and MDT's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 2.37% gain on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 2.47%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.07%.Coming into today, shares of the beauty products retailer had lost 5% in the past month. In that same time, the Retail-Wholesale sector lost 6.06%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 4.82%.Investors will be hoping for strength from Ulta Beauty as it approaches its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Ulta Beauty to post earnings of $4.06 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 3.05%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $2.18 billion, up 9.47% from the prior-year quarter.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Ulta Beauty. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant. Ulta Beauty currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).Digging into valuation, Ulta Beauty currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 17.86. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 10.76, so we one might conclude that Ulta Beauty is trading at a premium comparatively.Investors should also note that ULTA has a PEG ratio of 1.28 right now. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. Retail - Miscellaneous stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 1.44 based on yesterday's closing prices.Story continuesThe Retail - Miscellaneous industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector.

While that's not great, the returns over five years have been decent. The share price is up 54%, which is better than the market return of 53%. While the long term returns are impressive, we do have some sympathy for those who bought more recently, given the 28% drop, in the last year.Since the long term performance has been good but there's been a recent pullback of 5.0%, let's check if the fundamentals match the share price. Check out our latest analysis for Norfolk Southern While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Norfolk Southern managed to grow its earnings per share at 16% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 9% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Norfolk Southern's TSR for the last 5 years was 69%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveThe total return of 26% received by Norfolk Southern shareholders over the last year isn't far from the market return of -24%. The silver lining is that longer term investors would have made a total return of 11% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data remains strong, and the share price is simply down on sentiment, then this could be an opportunity worth investigating. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Norfolk Southern better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Norfolk Southern  that you should be aware of.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $10.6 billion, suggesting 5.6% growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.For third-quarter earnings, the consensus mark is pegged at 64 cents, suggesting a decline of 1.5% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark has been unchanged in the past 30 days.We expect the company’s third-quarter total revenues to increase 5.7% year over year to $10,557.8 million and the bottom line to decline 2% to 64 cents per share.In the last reported quarter, the leading soft-drink behemoth delivered an earnings surprise of 4.5%. Its bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.9%, on average, over the trailing four quarters.CocaCola Company The Price and EPS Surprise CocaCola Company The Price and EPS SurpriseCocaCola Company The price-eps-surprise | CocaCola Company The QuoteKey Points to NoteCoca-Cola’s performances in recent quarters have been benefiting from strategic transformation and ongoing recovery around the world. The company’s volumes in the third quarter are expected to have benefited from the elasticity in the marketplace despite the ongoing global challenges. Coca-Cola’s third-quarter top line is likely to have gained from strong revenue growth across its operating segments, aided by an improved price/mix and an increase in concentrate sales. Sales gains from underlying share gains in both at-home and away-from-home channels are likely to have aided the third-quarter performance.Continued volume gains in the trademark Coca-Cola; sparkling flavors; the nutrition, juice, dairy and plant-based beverages; and hydration, sports, coffee and tea categories are expected to get reflected in the company’s third-quarter results.Coca-Cola’s third-quarter results are likely to reflect gains from innovations and accelerating digital investments. The company has been witnessing a splurge in e-commerce, with the growth rate of the channel doubling in many countries. KO has been accelerating investments to build strong digital capabilities. The company has been consistently strengthening consumer connections and piloting various digital-enabled initiatives through fulfillment methods to capture the online demand, which are likely to have boosted third-quarter sales.However, Coca-Cola has been witnessing pressures from higher supply-chain costs, including rising commodity input costs and transportation expenses. The pressures from input cost inflation and other costs are likely to have hurt the company’s performance in the third quarter.Coca-Cola has been investing in its markets and brands to support sales growth, with higher spending on consumer-facing activities. This has led to higher marketing investments in the past few quarters. Higher marketing spending, and an increase in short-term incentives and stock-based compensation are expected to have led to increased selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, the company expected adverse currency rates to hurt the top and bottom lines in the third quarter. It expects a currency headwind of 7-8% on revenues and 9-10% on comparable earnings per share for the third quarter.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Coca-Cola this time around.

(NASDAQ:COKE), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 39% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Losing money on investments is something no shareholder enjoys, least of all institutional investors who saw their holdings value drop by 5.7% last week. However, the 9.9% one-year returns may have helped alleviate their overall losses. But they would probably be wary of future losses.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Coca-Cola Consolidated. View our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Consolidated ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Coca-Cola Consolidated?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Coca-Cola Consolidated. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Coca-Cola Consolidated's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthHedge funds don't have many shares in Coca-Cola Consolidated. Our data shows that The Coca-Cola Company is the largest shareholder with 26% of shares outstanding. J. Harrison is the second largest shareholder owning 11% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 7.5% of the company stock. J. Harrison, who is the second-largest shareholder, also happens to hold the title of Chief Executive Officer.Story continuesOur research also brought to light the fact that roughly 51% of the company is controlled by the top 4 shareholders suggesting that these owners wield significant influence on the business.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. As far as we can tell there isn't analyst coverage of the company, so it is probably flying under the radar.Insider Ownership Of Coca-Cola ConsolidatedThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.It seems insiders own a significant proportion of Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc.. It has a market capitalization of just US$4.0b, and insiders have US$995m worth of shares in their own names. That's quite significant. Most would be pleased to see the board is investing alongside them. You may wish to access this free chart showing recent trading by insiders.General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 10% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Public Company OwnershipWe can see that public companies hold 26% of the Coca-Cola Consolidated shares on issue. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Coca-Cola Consolidated better, we need to consider many other factors.

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 0.88%.Q3 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings per share is pegged at $2.26, indicating an increase of 2.7% year over year.The same for revenues stands at $4.48 billion, suggesting growth of 7.6% from the prior-year quarter.Factors to NoteStryker's MedSurg and Neurotechnology segment witnessed substantial sales growth on the back of improvement across all its sub-segments in the second quarter. Improvement in volumes of products contributed to the upside, partially offset by lower prices. This momentum is likely to have continued in the third quarter.With respect to the Orthopaedics &amp; Spine segment, growth across Hips and Knees subsegments, is likely to have favored the segment's third-quarter performance. The acquisition of Wright Medical is likely to have given a boost to the Trauma &amp; Extremities business as in the first half of 2022.Stryker Corporation Price and ConsensusStryker Corporation Price and ConsensusStryker Corporation price-consensus-chart | Stryker Corporation QuoteStryker is committed to the sustained expansion of Mako. This growth reflects the demand for its differentiated Mako robotic technology. The company witnessed both domestic and international growth (in Japan, Korea and emerging markets) in the second quarter of 2022. The launch of the new Insignia Hip Stem, along with the Mako 4.1 software, is likely to have driven the Hips business during the second quarter. The robust demand for Mako is likely to have contributed to the Orthopaedics &amp; Spine segment's performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Stryker completed the acquisition of all the issued and outstanding shares of the common stock of Vocera Communications in February. Per management, the buyout will enable Stryker to enter the fast-growing digital care coordination and communications segment. Investors will likely look for the potential impact of this integration during the third quarter.Story continuesHowever, ongoing supply chain disruptions and hospital staffing shortages are likely to have hurt sales volume growth during the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Procedural volumes in China may have suffered a negative impact due to strict lockdown restrictions across major cities amid rising COVID-19 infection cases. The recent inflationary pressure is likely to have hurt net margin, limiting its growth.What Our Quantitative Model SuggestsPer our proven model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.

DVA is scheduled to release third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 28, before market open.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings of $2.30 per share topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9%. Over the trailing four quarters, its earnings outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and lagged the same in one, delivering an earnings surprise of 3.8%, on average.Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayOn the second-quarter 2022 call in August, DaVita confirmed that it registered an uptick in revenue per treatment, partially driven by the continued shift to Medicare Advantage plans. This trend is likely to have continued into the third quarter, thereby driving up the quarter’s revenues. However, decreased government rate related to the reinstatement of 1% Medicare sequestration beginning Apr 1 is likely to have a negative impact on third-quarter revenues.DaVita acquired MedSleuth in early January. MedSleuth’s software enables closer partnerships and better coordination between transplant centers, nephrologists and kidney care providers, with all three working together to support the company’s patient transplant journey. This is also likely to have aided DaVita in the to-be-reported quarter, thereby pushing up the overall top line.DaVita Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseDaVita Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseDaVita Inc. price-eps-surprise | DaVita Inc. QuoteDaVita has been engaged in a value-based partnership with more than 1,800 nephrologists across the United States, with more than 600 nephrologists using an integrated chronic kidney disease electronic health record. This buoys our optimism about the stock.During the second-quarter earnings call, management confirmed that COVID-19 infections and mortality in DaVita’s patient pool declined after the Omicron surge in the first quarter of 2022 through May but increased again in June and July. The uncertainty of the impact of COVID on mortality, mistreatment and treatment volumes looms large on DaVita’s performance in the third quarter.Story continuesMoreover, labor costs have continued to remain a challenge over the past few months with higher contracted labor utilization and base wage increases. Despite management’s efforts to offset the impact of wage and other inflationary increases, these are likely to have weighed on the company’s third-quarter 2022 top line.The Estimate PictureFor third-quarter 2022, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.98 billion for total revenues calls for an improvement of 1.5% from the prior-year reported figure.We estimate third-quarter total revenues to be $2.97 billion, reflecting an uptick of 1.2% year over year.The consensus estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $1.67, indicating a decline of 29.2% from the prior-year reported number.We estimate third-quarter earnings to be $1.72, reflecting a decline of 27.2% year over year.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), along with a positive Earnings ESP has higher chances of beating estimates. This is not the case here, as you can see below.Earnings ESP: DaVita has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

Whirlpool shares in focus. They're selling off here in the early, going right out of the shoot. That follows a major profit warning last night after the close of trading. Companies slashed revenue and EPS guidance for the remainder of the year. The home appliances maker also missed third quarter earnings estimates on the top and bottom lines. And Brad, this magnitude of this earnings warning from Whirlpool is pretty striking here.They're taking their adjusted earnings outlook to about $19. They were at almost $24 just a couple of months ago. And three months ago, we talked to Jim Peters, the CFO of Whirlpool. To me at the time, I made a note that Jim sounds a little more cautious on the business than what I have heard from him in the past. And look, now we're having the company come out here and warn. Did not like that their inventories seemed to be, I think, running a little bit higher than they would like, compared to their sales declines.BRAD SMITH: Well, we previewed this coming into this earnings season, too when we said-- here on the desk and in some of our own conversations-- about where we might see slashes in guidance as a result of some of the macro trends that companies like Whirlpool are seeing, companies like Snap, as we were talking about, are seeing. And then within that, for Whirlpool especially, when you have so much of your inventory that is reliant on making it into new construction buildouts, and the construction and the homebuilder confidence and even in some of the construction confidence-- if you see that wane, as we had for an extended period of time, especially in homebuilder confidence-- that's going to directly impact the company in Whirlpool as well here.And so that slashing guidance, perhaps to be expected. It's a question of how they continue to weather and structurally improve themselves and position themselves to navigate the current environment and really look through to see some of the long-term demand. And that's just what they discussed in this earnings release as well, here, too.BRIAN SOZZI: And let's tie all this together. What is a Whirlpool appliance? It is a big-ticket purchase you normally put on a credit card. And those rates are now going up, thanks to the efforts of the Federal Reserve.]"

Results were hurt by the ongoing challenging environment and sluggish demand from rising inflation. The headwinds are likely to linger in the first half of fiscal 2023. Consequently, management trimmed the 2022 view.Shares of this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company have lost 21.3% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 20.4% decline. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research However, management is undertaking portfolio transformation efforts. It also noted that it is in the final stages of the strategic review of EMEA with two potential strategic investors. The company announced the buyout of InSinkErator and the divestiture completion of its Russia business.Insight Into Q3The appliance maker delivered adjusted earnings of $4.49 per share, declining 32.8% from $6.68 in the year-ago quarter. Also, the bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.59.Net sales of $4,784 million dropped 12.8% from the year-ago quarter. The top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,235 million. Excluding the unfavorable impacts of foreign exchange, net sales amounted to $4,957 million, down 9.7% year over year. Lower volumes stemming from weak demand hurt sales, partly offset by a favorable product price/mix.Go-to-market actions generated 550 basis points (bps) of price/mix, along with cost-based pricing actions.The gross profit for third-quarter 2022 was $680 million, down 38.6% from $1,108 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Adjusted EBIT of $265 million declined 56.4% from $608 million in the year-ago quarter. The adjusted EBIT margin of 5.5% contracted 560 bps year over year.Regional PerformancesNet sales for the North America segment decreased 7.7% year over year to $2,873 million. Excluding the currency impact, sales in the region dropped 7.4%. The segment’s EBIT plunged 49% year over year to $282 million, while the EBIT margin contracted 790 bps to 9.8% due to aggressive inventory reduction.Net sales for the EMEA segment were down 28.1% year over year to $903 million. Excluding currency impacts, sales in the region dipped 16.7%. The metric was hurt by a drab demand in key countries. The segment’s EBIT was at a loss of $28 million compared with the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $28 million due to lower volume and cost inflation.Net sales from Latin America decreased 10.8% year over year to $750 million, owing to a double-digit decline in demand in Mexico and Brazil, which offset cost-based pricing efforts. Excluding the currency impacts, sales in the region fell 10.4%. The segment’s EBIT of $40 million declined 45.2% from the year-ago period’s $73 million. The EBIT margin contracted 340 bps to 5.3%, mainly affected by inflation, somewhat offset by cost-saving efforts.Net sales in Asia fell 7.2% year over year to $258 million mainly due to the divestiture of Whirlpool China. Excluding the currency impacts, sales for the region were down 1.2%. The segment’s EBIT of $12 million reflected a 50% plunge from the $24 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The segment’s EBIT margin of 4.7% contracted 390 bps from the prior-year quarter, driven by cost inflation and a top-line decline.Story continuesOther Financial DetailsAs of Sep 30, 2022, Whirlpool had cash and cash equivalents of $1,790 million, long-term debt of $4,722 million, and a stockholders’ equity of $4,351 million, excluding non-controlling interests of $173 million.In the first nine months of 2022, Whirlpool used cash of $310 million from operating activities.

Moreover, the company is projected to have incurred lower operating and maintenance expenses, driven by the expectation of a more normalized level of storm activity this year versus the atypical levels experienced in 2021.These factors are likely to have added impetus to CMS Energy’s Q3 bottom line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at 62 cents per share, indicating an improvement of 14.8% from the prior-year reported figure.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for CMS Energy this time.

360,8f08acc9-ef3d-3b38-94d8-a34243cca66f,LYB,2022-10-22,Earnings Preview: LyondellBasell (LYB) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-lyondellbasell-lyb-q3-140002630.html,1666360802,STORY,"['LYB', 'MEOH']","[The market expects LyondellBasell (LYB) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 28, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis oil refiner and chemical company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.11 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -40.8%.Revenues are expected to be $13.46 billion, up 6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 18.77% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for LyondellBasell?For LyondellBasell, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -11.71%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that LyondellBasell will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that LyondellBasell would post earnings of $4.97 per share when it actually produced earnings of $5.19, delivering a surprise of +4.43%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.LyondellBasell doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Chemical - Diversified industry, Methanex (MEOH) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.79 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -38.8%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $1.02 billion, down 5.4% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Methanex has been revised 9.2% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -8.82%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Methanex will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

361,8272db8e-9c82-38d4-9412-095d14b2685b,LYB,2022-10-22,7 Cheap Retirement Stocks to Buy Now,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-cheap-retirement-stocks-buy-000022814.html,1666108822,STORY,"['WMT', 'OCSL', 'LYB', 'LEG', 'GM', 'PRU', 'MCBC']","[Although the wild market gyrations cause much consternation, it also opens doors for cheap retirement stocks to buy now. Ordinarily, these ideas might not attract the attention growth-centric names easily command. However, with the equities sector gradually tilting toward a risk-off profile, retirement-friendly securities should be on your radar.Fundamentally, the Federal Reserve will see to it that growth-driven ideas will suffer significant challenges. To tackle historic highs in inflation, the central bank committed to a hawkish monetary policy. In short, the incentive for risk-on names will fade as interest rates (borrowing costs) rise. However, established ideas such as cheap retirement stocks to buy may flourish.Further, if you drill into these ideas, many of them are tied to exciting sectors. It’s just that they usually provide a background role. Or in other cases, these companies quietly benefit from burgeoning macro trends. To take advantage of this present circumstance, below are cheap retirement stocks to buy now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCheap Retirement Stocks: McCormick &amp; Co. (MKC)McCormick &amp; Company spices lined up on a grocery store shelf.Source: Arne Beruldsen / Shutterstock.comFrankly, McCormick &amp; Co. (NYSE:MKC) offers an ideal play among cheap retirement stocks to buy. Fundamentally, the company probably couldn’t get more boring if it tried. A manufacturer of spices, seasoning mixes and condiments, it’s easy to take McCormick for granted. Nevertheless, with the brand tied to the broader food industry, it enjoys a certain level of inelastic demand.Put another way, irrespective of economic factors, humans need to consume a minimum amount of calories. And usually, they prefer those calories to taste good, which is where McCormick comes into the picture.Though not the most generous source of passive income, McCormick does provide a forward yield of 2%. Also, it features 36 years of consecutive dividend increases. And with a payout ratio of 49.5%, it’s not the greatest figure, nor does the company attract intense unsustainability criticisms.Story continuesFinally, the good stuff. Per Gurufocus, McCormick’s business rates as “modestly undervalued.” The key highlight here centers on strong profitability metrics. As well, the company commands a return on equity of 15.4%, ranking better than 79% of its peers. Thus, it’s a solid all-around great idea for cheap retirement stocks to buy.Vale (VALE)the Vale logo displayed on a mobile phone with the company's webpage in the backgroundSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comAlthough metals and mining firms don’t usually make the list of cheap retirement stocks to buy, people should arguably make an exception for Vale (NYSE:VALE). Based in Brazil, Vale is the largest producer of iron ore and nickel in the world, per its corporate profile. The latter commodity presents significant implications because of its integration in electric vehicle (EV) batteries.While much debate centers on the future of mobility, over time, it’s possible EVs can dominate the transportation sector. Right now, cost structures hurt EV integration, as not everyone can comfortably afford them. However, economies of scale may bring improvements to this problem.Currently, Vale offers a forward yield of 10.5%, which will undoubtedly attract investors of cheap retirement stocks to buy. In addition, the company’s payout ratio is less than 56%. Therefore, all other things being equal, this should indicate sustainable dividend payouts.Finally, Vale features a “modestly undervalued” business. Notably, the company enjoys excellent growth and profitability metrics. In addition, its forward price-earnings ratio is 4.9 times, lower than the industry median of 9.1 times.Cheap Retirement Stocks: Duke Energy (DUK)The logo for Duke Energy (DUK) is seen on a sign at one of the company's offices.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comWhen it comes to cheap retirement stocks to buy, investors should always make room for utilities like Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK). Cynically, bad things happen when people flip the switch and nothing materializes. But on a bigger scale, utilities enjoy inelastic demand. That is, no matter what happens to the underlying product or service’s pricing, users’ consumption behaviors don’t change.Of course, it’s difficult to say absolutely nothing changes. However, with utilities, households need a baseline of resource consumption to stay afloat. Therefore, companies like Duke Energy will be the last in line in terms of any household budget cuts. Specific to DUK, its exposure to the Carolinas is also attractive because of millennial migration trends.Presently, Duke offers a forward yield of 4.4%. Although the payout ratio of 70% is on the high side, the company has 17 years of consecutive dividend increases.Finally, Duke’s business rates as “modestly undervalued.” In particular, investors should consider its profitability scores, such as a net margin of 14.5% (ranked better than 72.5% of the competition.) As well, the company benefits from decent growth trends that should rise higher based on the aforementioned migration trends.Kinder Morgan (KMI)Kinder Morgan logo on a sign outside the company headquarters in Houston.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comA midstream operator, Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) represents an important cog in the hydrocarbon industry. Essentially, it represents the link between the upstream (exploration and production) and downstream (refining and marketing) components. Per its corporate profile, Kinder Morgan owns an interest in or operates approximately 83,000 miles of pipelines and 141 terminals.Because of the company’s midstream business, KMI may enjoy resilience against economic headwinds. No matter what happens regarding pricing, supply and other dynamics, society needs some place to store critical resources. That’s where Kinder takes front and center stage.Currently, the hydrocarbon specialist offers a forward yield of 6.3%. It doesn’t have a long track record of consecutive dividend increase, though five years is not nothing. However, the payout ratio of 90.2% is very high.Still, Gurufocus rates KMI as “modestly undervalued.” Further, the company enjoys solid profitability metrics, including a net margin of 13.8% (ranked better than 68% of the industry.) Finally, Kinder also features a decent growth trek, one that could expand as social normalization trends continue.Cheap Retirement Stocks: International Business Machines (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.Source: shutterstock.com/LCVFor many years, legacy tech giant International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) represented an afterthought in the digital innovation space. While its peers pushed into sectors such as cloud computing, IBM still had exposure to legacy hardware businesses. However, that’s a chapter in the past. Today, Big Blue embraces myriad innovations, not only including hybrid cloud initiatives but also the blockchain.Another reason to consider IBM is that it makes for a great idea among cheap retirement stocks to buy. Presently, the iconic firm offers a forward yield of 5.4%. That’s a stout source of passive income considering the inflationary landscape. As well, IBM enjoys 28 years of consecutive dividend increases. Don’t expect management to give up on this status, even with the high 67% payout ratio.Now, according to Gurufocus, the tech giant rates as “fairly valued.” Nevertheless, I believe it’s one of the cheap retirement stocks to buy now. For one thing, it has a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 12.3 times, well below the industry median of 22.1 times. Also, the company features a return on equity of 27.5%, ranked better than nearly 92% of its peers.CareTrust REIT (CTRE)a magnifying glass enlarges the CareTrust logo on a websiteSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comStructured as a real estate investment trust, CareTrust REIT (NYSE:CTRE) focuses on the broader retirement sector. Per its website, 78% of the company’s operations centers on skilled nursing facilities. 11% focuses on assisted living facilities and independent living facilities. CTRE ranks among the cheap retirement stocks to buy because of its underlying demographic catalyst.In November 2020, the Pew Research Center reported that the pace of Baby Boomer retirements accelerated in the past year. Later, in November 2021, a different Pew article mentioned that since the coronavirus pandemic, a rising share of older U.S. adults retired. Plus, with baby boomers representing the biggest population increase, the narrative for CTRE will be relevant for a long time.Presently, Gurufocus rates CTRE as “modestly undervalued.” One of the most notable metrics is that CareTrust has a forward P/E ratio of 10.5 times, below the industry median of nearly 14. Also, the company enjoys decent growth and profitability trends, with the former likely to expand based on the aforementioned demographic realities.Cheap Retirement Stocks: United Parcel Service (UPS)United Parcel Service (UPS) truck on Interstate in the American West. UPS stock.Source: sladkozaponi / ShutterstockIf you’re looking for cheap retirement stocks to buy and some potentially robust capital gains speculation to boot, then United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) might interest you. To be fair, I understand why some folks might not want to venture into the courier service. With questionable dynamics in the consumer economy – such as soaring inventories of discretionary products – UPS presents significant risks.Nevertheless, it’s also attractive to the right investor. For instance, the company offers a forward yield of 3.7%, above the industrials sector’s average yield of 2.4%. Also, UPS enjoys 12 years of consecutive dividend increases. Its payout ratio of 48.3% isn’t too shabby, either, under the circumstances.Finally, Gurufocus considers UPS to be “modestly undervalued.” One of the biggest highlights is the return on equity of 79.5%, ranking better than 96% of its peers. It also indicates a high-quality business. As well, UPS features strong sales metrics, including a three-year book growth rate of 66.9%.Again, the health of the consumer economy clouds the picture. However, if you can handle the risk, UPS could be an interesting idea among cheap retirement stocks to buy.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The two companies will make available a comprehensive offering that brings together GE Healthcare's precision diagnostic tools and Accuray Incorporated's innovative radiation therapy delivery capabilities to advance the practice of radiation therapy and help deliver personalized care to patients diagnosed with cancer.Accuray Incorporated (PRNewsFoto/Accuray Incorporated) (PRNewsFoto/Accuray Incorporated)The practice of radiation therapy requires high quality imaging to determine the size, shape and characteristics of tumors, and sophisticated delivery technology to help precisely target tumors, while differentiating and minimizing dose to healthy tissue. As advanced imaging continues to enable earlier diagnosis and identification of smaller lesions - the need for precision and accuracy of treatment will be of equal importance to enable clinicians to diagnose and treat earlier stage cancers with confidence. By bringing together GE Healthcare's imaging solutions and Accuray radiation therapy technologies, the collaboration seeks to improve diagnosis and treatment across the spectrum of cancer care. The collaboration will initially focus on addressing challenges in the treatment of lung and brain cancers – with an emphasis on early detection; functional diagnostics to better inform planning decisions; and targeted, precise treatment delivery. Additionally, GE Healthcare and Accuray Incorporated will seek to drive digitalization and interoperability as healthcare systems look to build cancer care pathway solutions and streamline workflows in radiation oncology.Story continues""Personalized medicine demands precision in both diagnosis and delivery,"" said Jan Makela, President &amp; CEO of Imaging for GE Healthcare. ""As we continue to build out our oncology offerings to help enable more precise, connected and compassionate care, we are committed to helping cancer care providers gain the upper hand through our suite of diagnostic technologies that help improve detection, as well as clinical and operational efficiency. In the face of complex diagnoses, we work to make the first image count in order to help shorten the window from diagnosis to treatment.  We're excited about the opportunity to work with Accuray and expand access to our advanced imaging tools as we aim to provide a pathway to earlier diagnosis and better treatment options.""""The radiation therapy community is redefining personalized medicine with advances in technology that improve the cancer care continuum, from diagnosis to survivorship. For Accuray, this involves a continuous focus on innovation of our treatment planning and delivery technologies to help ensure medical care teams can deliver the most precise radiation treatments possible in the shortest amount of time,"" said Suzanne Winter, President &amp; CEO of Accuray. ""In 2022 it is estimated that more than one million U.S. cancer patients will receive treatment with radiation therapy1*. This statistic underscores the importance of our collaboration with GE Healthcare, a global leader in healthcare committed to creating best-in-class oncology solutions, to elevate the visibility of our solutions and ultimately, make potentially life-saving radiation therapy treatments available to more people.""As two U.S. based companies with a broad global reach, GE Healthcare and Accuray are committed to solutions designed with standard interoperability and interfaces that will allow integration with any vendor's systems providing customers with increased flexibility and choice. The agreement allows each party to continue to cooperate with other technologies.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 87% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).And as as result, institutional investors reaped the most rewards after the company's stock price gained 5.7% last week. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 30%.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Progressive. View our latest analysis for Progressive ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Progressive?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Progressive. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Progressive, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Progressive. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.4%. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.2% of common stock, and Wellington Management Group LLP holds about 5.3% of the company stock.A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 19 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Story continuesWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of ProgressiveThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of The Progressive Corporation. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$243m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 13% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Progressive. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Progressive better, we need to consider many other factors.

However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Specifically, we decided to study Estée Lauder Companies'  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Estée Lauder Companies is:37% = US$2.4b ÷ US$6.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.37 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Estée Lauder Companies' Earnings Growth And 37% ROETo begin with, Estée Lauder Companies has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 17% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. This likely paved the way for the modest 19% net income growth seen by Estée Lauder Companies over the past five years. growthStory continuesAs a next step, we compared Estée Lauder Companies' net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 23% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is EL fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Estée Lauder Companies Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Estée Lauder Companies has a three-year median payout ratio of 34%, which implies that it retains the remaining 66% of its profits. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the decent growth seen by the company, it looks like management is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.Moreover, Estée Lauder Companies is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 32%. Regardless, the future ROE for Estée Lauder Companies is predicted to rise to 49% despite there being not much change expected in its payout ratio.SummaryIn total, we are pretty happy with Estée Lauder Companies' performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

Although stocks have been rebounding since the end of last week, following a positive start to the earnings season, market participants remain concerned about Fed’s stance to continue with its aggressive rate hike policy.In fact, the bond yield has lately been rising to hit record highs once again on fears of another steep interest rate hike in November. Moreover, the crisis is nowhere close to being over. The Fed has indicated further rate hikes in the coming months till sky-high commodity prices don’t cool off to the desired levels.Wall Street VolatileAfter a disappointing September, volatility is persisting in October. On Oct 19, the 10-year Treasury yield jumped to 4.136%, its highest level since June 2008, while the 2-year Treasury yield rose to its highest level since 2007 on fears of another 75-basis point interest rate hike in November.The Fed has been aggressively hiking interest rate to get a tight grip on soaring inflation. The consumer price index (CPI) for September came in higher than expected, rising 0.4% compared to the consensus estimate of a rise of 0.2%. On a year-over-year basis, CPI jumped 8.2% in September.Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.6% in September on a month-over-month basis, surpassing analysts’ expectations of a 0.3% rise. Year over year, core CPI jumped 6.6% in September.Investors are concerned that higher inflation will compel the Fed to go ahead with its aggressive rate-hike policy. The Fed has so far hiked interest rates by 300 basis points this year, including a 75-basis-point hike on the past three occasions.In fact, the Fed has also indicated that it will hike interest rates by another 125 basis points by the year-end. Market participants are now bracing for another 75-basis-point hike in November. A further interest rate hike is likely to create more pressure on the economy, which has been worrying both economists and investors.Story continuesHigher interest rates mean a higher cost of borrowing. This increases the possibility of an economic downturn. Both are negative signs for markets, which have been experiencing volatility all through this year.Stocks to WatchGiven this situation, investors should exercise caution and continue holding dividend-paying stocks to protect their portfolios. We think it's a good idea to consider stocks that have recently hiked their dividend payouts. Four such companies are: Prosperity Bancshares, Inc. PB, Brown &amp; Brown, Inc.

ESS is scheduled to report third-quarter 2022 earnings on Oct 26 after the closing bell. The company’s results are likely to reflect year-over-year growth in revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share.In the last reported quarter, this San Mateo, CA-based residential real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a surprise of 3.66% in terms of FFO per share. Results highlighted better-than-expected operating results and lower property taxes in Washington.Over the trailing four quarters, Essex Property surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on each occasion, the average surprise being 1.46%. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company:Essex Property Trust, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseEssex Property Trust, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseEssex Property Trust, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Essex Property Trust, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.Factors to ConsiderFor the U.S. apartment market, demand remained healthy initially in the third quarter, though normal seasonality returned in September.  Essex Property too is likely to have benefited from this trend. It has a sturdy property base and substantial exposure to the West Coast market and banks on its technology, scale and organizational capabilities to drive innovation and margin expansion in the portfolio.Particularly, the demand for rental units is rising as technology companies are returning to the office, and homeownership is becoming costlier due to higher interest rates. A combination of these factors is driving the rental demand for Essex Property.In its September investor presentation, Essex Property noted that its preliminary July-August 2022 same-property revenue growth remained strong at 12.4% compared to a year ago. Preliminary July-August blended lease rates increased 10.3% compared to a year ago.However, ESS noted that due to more difficult comparison periods in 2021, blended lease rates have decelerated compared to the first half of 2022.Moreover, net delinquency in July-August is 0.6% of the scheduled rent, and gross delinquency showed a gradual improvement through August. The residential REIT also noted that although year-over-year rent spreads for the first half of 2022 were robust, these are expected to moderate in the second half of 2022 because of more challenging comparable rents in the year-ago second half.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $406.93 million for third-quarter revenues calls for a 12.14% increase year over year. The consensus estimate for same-property revenues is pegged at $380.3 million, up from $373.3 million in the prior quarter and $325.15 million in the year-ago period.This residential REIT is also likely to have maintained a decent balance sheet and financial flexibility during the quarter under review.For the third quarter of 2022, Essex Property earlier projected core FFO per share in the range of $3.60-$3.70.Before the third-quarter earnings release, the company’s activities were not adequate to gain analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly FFO per share has remained unchanged at $3.68 in the past month. However, it suggests a year-over-year increase of 17.95%.Story continuesHere Is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Essex Property does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Essex Property currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of -0.22%.

UDR is slated to report third-quarter 2022 earnings on Oct 26 after market close. Results are likely to reflect growth in revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share from the respective year-ago reported figures.In the last reported quarter, the FFO as adjusted per share of this Denver, CO-based residential real estate investment trust (REIT) came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. There was an increase in revenues from rental income, fueling the quarter’s top line. Decent operating trends and strong pricing power were major contributing factors.In the last four quarters, UDR’s earnings met the Zacks Consensus Estimate on each occasion. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company:United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseUnited Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseUnited Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. price-eps-surprise | United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.Factors to ConsiderFor the U.S. apartment market, demand remained healthy initially in the third quarter, though normal seasonality returned in September.  With a geographically diverse portfolio and a superior product mix of A/B quality properties in the urban and suburban markets, UDR is likely to have gained from the healthy demand. Moreover, UDR’s portfolio comprises properties throughout the United States, including the coastal and Sunbelt locations.This strategy of maintaining a diversified portfolio across various geographies and price points limits volatility and concentration risks and helps UDR generate steady operating cash flows.With alternative housing options becoming less affordable compared to multifamily, UDR is expected to have experienced healthy demand in the third quarter. Its occupancy level and blended lease rate growth are likely to have remained high in the quarter. However, tougher comps are expected on new lease rate growth in August and September because of strong results a year ago.Earlier, for the second half of 2022, management expected blended lease rate growth in the 10-12% range. Also, management projected occupancy to remain stable at 97% plus or about flat year over year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is currently pegged at $381.6 million, indicating a 15.7% year-over-year rise.UDR enjoys a decent balance sheet position and banks on technological moves and process enhancements to fuel growth. UDR focuses on enhancing cost control through its Next Generation Operating Platform. Such efforts to find efficiencies throughout its operating platform are likely to have boosted workforce productivity and residents’ experiences in the third quarter.Story continuesThe adoption of technology is also anticipated to have bolstered UDR’s margin during the period under review. In its second-quarter earnings release, UDR projected its third-quarter 2022 FFO as adjusted per share in the range of 58-60 cents.Before the third-quarter earnings release, the company’s activities were not adequate to gain analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly FFO per share has remained unchanged at 59 cents in the past month. This suggests year-over-year growth of 15.7%.Here Is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model predicts a surprise in terms of FFO per share for UDR this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an FFO beat, which is the case here.UDR currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2 and has an Earnings ESP of +0.57%.

377,2defeb6e-ecc1-3021-b173-d77dc5918cbd,VNO,2022-10-22,Shareholders in Vornado Realty Trust (NYSE:VNO) are in the red if they invested five years ago,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shareholders-vornado-realty-trust-nyse-165332206.html,1666371212,STORY,"['VNO', 'VNORP']","[We think intelligent long term investing is the way to go. But that doesn't mean long term investors can avoid big losses. To wit, the Vornado Realty Trust (NYSE:VNO) share price managed to fall 70% over five long years. That's not a lot of fun for true believers. And we doubt long term believers are the only worried holders, since the stock price has declined 51% over the last twelve months. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 26% in the last 90 days.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. See our latest analysis for Vornado Realty Trust While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Vornado Realty Trust became profitable within the last five years. Most would consider that to be a good thing, so it's counter-intuitive to see the share price declining. Other metrics might give us a better handle on how its value is changing over time.The most recent dividend was actually lower than it was in the past, so that may have sent the share price lower. The revenue decline of about 6.8% per year might also encourage sellers.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe know that Vornado Realty Trust has improved its bottom line lately, but what does the future have in store? If you are thinking of buying or selling Vornado Realty Trust stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Vornado Realty Trust, it has a TSR of -61% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Vornado Realty Trust shareholders are down 48% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 24%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 10% over the last half decade. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Vornado Realty Trust better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 4 warning signs  with Vornado Realty Trust (at least 2 which can't be ignored)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

The industry is a highly competitive one and undergoing a radical change, with evolving customer expectations and technological innovation acting as game changers.What's Influencing the Industry's Outlook?Economic Challenges Raises Concern: Macro headwinds such as soaring interest rates, stubborn inflation and looming economic uncertainty have muted the prospects of the industry. With inflation at levels not seen in decades, the Fed has been forced to become more aggressive, cranking up borrowing rates. With the Fed set to maintain its hawkish stance, chances of an economic slowdown are on the rise. Amid economic uncertainty, consumers are likely to put off discretionary purchases like cars, in turn, resulting in low demand for vehicles. This is likely to put pressure on the near-term prospects of the auto retail and wholesale parts industry.Story continuesSupply Chain Woes Persist: Supply chain disruptions — a byproduct of the COVID-19 pandemic that only got aggravated by the Russia-Ukraine war — are leading to temporary hiccups for the industry. Logistical challenges are likely to continue in the near term, resulting in lost revenues for auto retail parts companies. Additionally, rising commodity costs are expected to put pressure on the margins of the industry participants.Challenges and Opportunities with Tech Advancement: The introduction of more complex and high-tech vehicles has led consumers to take more professional help, thereby opening up new opportunities for the industry participants. At the same time, capex requirements and R&amp;D costs are on the rise owing to the development of superior technological platforms and sophisticated tools. The auto retail parts industry needs to chalk out a detailed roadmap to make the most out of the opportunities amid the changing market scenario. Omnichannel marketing and digitization ramp up are also escalating operational costs, which may further limit profits.Zacks Industry Rank Depicts Gloomy ScenarioThe Zacks Auto Retail &amp; Wholesale Parts industry is a four-stock group within the broader Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #213, which places it in the bottom 15% of around 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates grim near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential. Since August, the industry’s earnings estimate for 2022 has decreased 3.1%.Despite the bleak prospects of the industry, we will present a few stocks that may hold their ground despite challenges. But it’s worth taking a look at the industry’s shareholder returns and current valuation first.Industry Underperforms Sector and S&amp;P 500The Zacks Auto Retail and Wholesale Parts industry has underperformed the Auto, Tires and Truck sector as well as the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has declined 53.6% over this period compared with the S&amp;P 500 and sector’s decline of 19.7% and 35.5%, respectively.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationSince automotive companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio.Based on trailing 12-month enterprise value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 35.53X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 11.31X and the sector’s 13.26X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 39.24X and as low as 15.87X, with the median being at 23.07X, as the chart below shows.EV/EBITDA Ratio (Past 5 Years) 3 Stocks to WatchO'Reilly: O'Reilly is one of the noted retailers of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment and accessories in the United States. The company has been generating record revenues for 29 consecutive years on the back of growth in the auto parts market.

Strong cash flow generation supports the firm’s robust buyback program, thereby boosting investors’ confidence.O’Reilly, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 12.6%.

385,3fc30168-874b-38ee-a951-30c48519954a,FRT,2022-10-22,How Much Upside is Left in Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT)? Wall Street Analysts Think 38%,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/much-upside-left-federal-realty-135501932.html,1666360501,STORY,"['TGT', 'FRT']","[Shares of Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT) have gained 0.1% over the past four weeks to close the last trading session at $90.55, but there could still be a solid upside left in the stock if short-term price targets of Wall Street analysts are any indication. Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $125.11 indicates a potential upside of 38.2%.The average comprises 14 short-term price targets ranging from a low of $108 to a high of $145, with a standard deviation of $9.81. While the lowest estimate indicates an increase of 19.3% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 60.1% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.But, for FRT, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside.Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseZacks Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart for FRTHere's What You May Not Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.Story continuesWhile Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?They usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Here's Why There Could be Plenty of Upside Left in FRTAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. That's because empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0% over the past month, as two estimates have gone higher compared to no negative revision.Moreover, FRT currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much FRT could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

386,a58ec018-f87c-3bac-a635-e74f9e2083e2,UHS,2022-10-22,Universal Health (UHS) to Post Q3 Earnings: What's in Store?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/universal-health-uhs-post-q3-171705087.html,1666372625,STORY,['UHS'],"[Universal Health Services, Inc. UHS is scheduled to release third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 25, after the closing bell.Q3 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Universal Health’s third-quarter earnings per share is pegged at $2.40, indicating a decline of 10.1% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The consensus mark for revenues stands at $3.3 billion, suggesting 4.9% growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Earnings Surprise HistoryUniversal Health’s bottom line beat estimates in two of the trailing four quarters and missed the mark twice, the average negative surprise being 1.8%. This is depicted in the chart below:Universal Health Services, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseUniversal Health Services, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseUniversal Health Services, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Universal Health Services, Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteIn the third quarter, revenues of Universal Health are likely to have gained on strong contributions from its Acute Care Hospital Services and Behavioral Health Care Services segments. Both segments are likely to have benefited from UHS’ continuous expansion initiatives either by inaugurating acute care hospitals or adding licensed beds to its behavioral health centers in different regions.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Acute Care Hospital Services segment’s net revenues is pegged at $1.9 billion, indicating an improvement of 4.1% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The consensus mark for the Behavioral Health Care Services segment’s net revenues stands at $1.4 billion, suggesting 6.6% growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.However, the Acute Care Hospital Services unit might have persistently grappled with lower patient volumes in the to-be-reported quarter.Patient admissions, the most significant contributor to a hospital’s revenues, might have declined at its acute care facilities in the to-be-reported quarter because the fall in COVID-related patient admissions at the said facilities might not have been partly offset by an equal increase in non-COVID patients. This, in turn, is likely to have strained the segmental revenues and margins in the third quarter. Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for acute care hospitals either owned or leased by Universal Health in the third quarter hints at an increase by one facility from the prior-year quarter’s level.However, the bottom line of Universal Health is expected to have taken a hit from elevated labor costs arising from the scarcity of nurses and other medical personnel. This remains a significant headwind that continues to trouble the entire US nation for quite some.To tide over the challenge, UHS pursues investments in recruitment and retention efforts. This, in turn, is likely to have escalated the operating expenses of Universal Health in the to-be-reported quarter.What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Universal Health this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. However, that’s not the case here as elaborated below.Earnings ESP: Universal Health has an Earnings ESP of -15.83% because the Most Accurate Estimate of $2.02 is pegged lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.40. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Universal Health currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for Universal Health, here are some companies from the Medical space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:Humana Inc. HUM has an Earnings ESP of +1.12% and a Zacks Rank of 1, currently. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HUM’s third-quarter 2022 earnings is pegged at $6.24 per share, indicating an improvement of 29.2% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Humana’s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. BMRN has an Earnings ESP of +10.77% and a Zacks Rank #2 at present. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BMRN’s third-quarter 2022 earnings is pegged at 36 cents per share, which doubled from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.BioMarin Pharmaceutical’s earnings beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.AstraZeneca AZN has an Earnings ESP of +0.22% and a Zacks Rank of 3, currently.

The company’s diabetes franchise faces stiff competition while pricing pressure is hurting sales in the respiratory unit. Sales of some cancer medicines are being hurt due to COVID-19. Sales are slowing down in key market, China, due to pricing pressure.Estimates have gone up slightly ahead of the Q3 earnings release on November 10th. The company has a mixed record of earnings surprises in the recent quarters. However, AstraZeneca’s cancer medicines, Lynparza, Tagrisso and Imfinzi should keep driving revenues.AstraZeneca has been engaged in external acquisitions and strategic collaborations to boost its pipeline while investing in geographic areas of high growth like emerging markets.

The company is facing issues like ongoing supply chain snarls and cost pressures. Nevertheless, its revenues and earnings grew year over year for six straight quarters thanks to its cost-saving actions, strong end-market demand and pricing actions.The Zacks analyst expect the company’s adjusted earnings per share for 2022 to grow 11.6%, while revenues are predicted to rise 11.2%. The Construction Industries segment is expected to benefit from the rising construction activities in the United States and other parts of the world.Backed by demand for commodities fueled by the energy-transition trend, a thriving mining sector will aid the Resource Industries segment. Its dividend yield and payout ratio are higher than its peers.

The consolidation in the wireless industry will likely affect the company’s top line while higher interest rates are expected to add to expenses and make borrowings to fund development costlier. Also, customer concentration is a woe.However, given the increase in mobile data usage, spectrum availability and high network investments by wireless carriers to deploy 5G networks, Crown Castle is poised to gain from this upbeat trend in the upcoming period.Its efforts to double small-cell deployments in 2023 will likely act as a tailwind.

Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study Regeneron Pharmaceuticals'  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is:27% = US$5.7b ÷ US$21b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.27.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' Earnings Growth And 27% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 23% which is quite remarkable. Under the circumstances, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' considerable five year net income growth of 38% was to be expected.Story continuesWe then compared Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 21% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is REGN worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether REGN is currently mispriced by the market.Is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Regeneron Pharmaceuticals doesn't pay any dividend currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the high earnings growth number that we discussed above.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

They requested anonymity because the matter is confidential.Credit Suisse, Blue Owl, Clearlake, Invesco and Janus Henderson declined to comment. AllianceBernstein, Ameriprise, and Centerbridge did not immediately respond to a comment request.Asset management firms have often turned to dealmaking to boost their scale, helping to address pressures from competition and fee depression from the shift towards more passive investing methods.Janus Henderson emerged in 2017 from the combination of Janus Capital Group and Henderson Group, and Blue Owl was formed last year from the three-way merging of Owl Rock Capital Group, Dyal Capital Partners and a blank check firm.Meanwhile, both Ameriprise and Invesco have been active buyers of asset managers in recent years.Minneapolis-based Ameriprise acquired much of Bank of Montreal's business last year for 615 million pounds ($695.1 million), while Invesco has completed deals including for OppenheimerFunds from Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company in 2019.Credit Suisse has been looking to shed a number of underperforming businesses ahead of its closely-watched strategic review update next week.Story continuesEarlier on Friday, the bank agreed to sell its 8.6% stake in fund distribution firm Allfunds Group for 334 million euros ($329.2 million) and its stake in Energy Infrastructure Partners to EIP's managing partners for an undisclosed amount.($1 = 1.0145 euros)($1 = 0.8847 pounds)(Reporting by Pamela Barbaglia in London and David French and Anirban Sen in New York; Editing by David Gregorio)]"
