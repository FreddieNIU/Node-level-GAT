Recently, Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson, who has been one of the strongest bearish voices on the Wall Street, warned that the increased US government spending that injected a lot of optimism in the markets would not bode well for US stocks. The analyst said that US has not seen such a high deficit when unemployment is so low.However, Wilson acknowledged that the recession predictions and bearish notes have hitherto been proven false.

Wisdom Tree rules out any possibility of rate cuts this year but believes that topic could gain more relevance in the first half of 2024.

(NASDAQ:DDOG).RiverPark Large Growth Fund made the following comment about Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG): DDOG was a top detractor in the quarter. The company reported strong 4Q results including 44% revenue growth and 30% earnings growth but gave cautious revenue guidance for 2023. Macroeconomic headwinds have caused clients to slow the transition of workloads to the cloud and instead to optimize current capacity. Despite this temporary slowdown, DDOG still expects revenue to grow nearly 25% in 2023.As businesses have transitioned to cloud software infrastructure, much of which is in isolated data silos, it has become increasingly difficult for data engineers to monitor and analyze system performance. Datadog provides a SaaS software platform to monitor and analyze the system performance of software applications and IT infrastructure by giving users a single page view to observe their company’s technology stack. The company has quickly grown its revenue from $100 million in 2017 to $1.7 billion in 2022 and, we believe, should continue to grow revenue at more than 20% annually as it penetrates its $40 billion and fast-growing market. Less than 10% of software applications are currently monitored. The company’s dollar-based net retention rate has been 130%+ as existing customers continue to use an increasing number of products and the company continues to add new features. As of 4Q22, 81% of customers used 2+ products, while only 18% of customers used 6+ products (up from less than 1% two years ago).

The managed care industry is large, with healthcare spending of $4 trillion annually, and we believe that scale and expertise are important for success in this industry.

Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)’s management said:""When you look overall, there are 236 obesity-related health complications. To name a few, obesity increases the risk of type 2 diabetes by 243%, coronary heart disease by 69%, hypertension by 113%, dyslipidemia by 74%.The overall cost of obesity-rated complications and comorbidities are massive, accounting for $370 billion in direct medical cost, over $1 trillion in indirect annual costs in the U.S. People living with obesity or overweight drive 2.7 greater health care costs than normal-weight individuals. The global health stakeholders really need to be moved beyond the debate and really move to action on the AOM class. With tirzepatide’s potential to provide over 20% weight loss, it should provide great value for payers. We have a comprehensive real-world evidence plan and clinical plan to demonstrate tirzepatide’s value, including our MMO OUTCOMES trial. Based on the SELECT trial results, we can’t wait to see the results of tirzepatide/MMO study. We do believe that additional weight loss will matter.""Read the complete earnings call here.10. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) shares have retreated amid a broader banking crisis earlier this year but analysts believe the stock might be a good buy on the dip. In August The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) said it was planning on layoffs and cost cuts to streamline its operations.ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy made the following comment about The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“We have done so recently with The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), which got caught up in investor concerns over regional banks, due to the perception of an asset/liability mismatch on Schwab’s balance sheet. While there are similarities with regional banks, Schwab has minimal credit risk and far higher organic growth than traditional banks. In addition, Schwab’s mostly retail customers are not pulling money out of its ecosystem. On the contrary, the company continues to grow client assets at a mid-single-digit percentage rate despite the banking selloff. Concerned over interest rate risk, we trimmed our position last year and earlier this year. As the stock pulled back this spring, we added back aggressively. It remains an exceptionally strong franchise in terms of asset gathering and customer loyalty and runs a unique business model that continues to attract client assets; we are pleased to have the opportunity to express our differentiated view.”9. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88With decades of consistent dividend increases and a diversified business model, Johnson &amp; Johnson is one of the low risk stocks to buy in 2023.8.

Revenue in the period came in at $7.16 billion, beating estimates by $40 million.Baron Durable Advantage Fund made the following comment about Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) is a life sciences and diagnostics company. For life sciences, Danaher supplies instruments for lab research, genomics services, and bioproduction tools. For the diagnostics business, Danaher offers instruments to run clinical tests in large core labs, hospitals, and pathology labs and at the point of care. Shares declined 4.7% during the quarter after the company cut its fiscal year 2023 guidance due to headwinds within its bioprocessing segment, as biopharmaceutical customers burned through existing inventory and smaller biotechnology firms faced funding constraints. We remain positive on Danaher’s long-term trajectory. Danaher benefits from a market-leading position and broad portfolio within bioprocessing, which addresses a biologics market that is growing by double digits, and which we expect to benefit in the near and medium term from a wave of biosimilars entering the market after key patents expire. Danaher has a collection of high-quality assets, with targets of high single-digit core revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth.”7. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 103Medical equipment company Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is a low risk stock that has a positive hedge fund sentiment.

This makes the dividend yield 3.8%, which is above the industry average. Check out our latest analysis for State Street State Street's Earnings Will Easily Cover The DistributionsWhile it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable.Having distributed dividends for at least 10 years, State Street has a long history of paying out a part of its earnings to shareholders. Past distributions do not necessarily guarantee future ones, but State Street's payout ratio of 34% is a good sign as this means that earnings decently cover dividends.The next 3 years are set to see EPS grow by 9.7%. The future payout ratio could be 36% over that time period, according to analyst estimates, which is a good look for the future of the dividend.historic-dividendState Street Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.96 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.76. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 11% over that duration. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.We Could See State Street's Dividend GrowingSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. We are encouraged to see that State Street has grown earnings per share at 6.0% per year over the past five years. A low payout ratio and decent growth suggests that the company is reinvesting well, and it also has plenty of room to increase the dividend over time.State Street Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. For instance, we've picked out 1 warning sign for State Street that investors should take into consideration.

An individual investor can now build a fully balanced portfolio using ETFs without paying more than 0.05% in total fees, said Susan Thompson, head of SPDR Americas distribution at State Street, compared with around a 1% average fee 20 years ago. Fees make a huge difference over a long time horizon: A $1 million account invested for 40 years would save about $370,000 in fees at a 0.05% fee versus a 1% fee, according to a State Street analysis.Continue reading]"

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Edwards Lifesciences' current trading price of US$73.20 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Edwards Lifesciences’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Edwards Lifesciences What's The Opportunity In Edwards Lifesciences?According to my valuation model, Edwards Lifesciences seems to be fairly priced at around 2.4% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Edwards Lifesciences today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $75.04, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Edwards Lifesciences’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of Edwards Lifesciences look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 37% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Edwards Lifesciences. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in EW’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on EW, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Since timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Low Risk Investments in 2023.Investors are still in a wait and see mode after the latest inflation and retail sales report which give mixed signals. Some analysts are still of the view that the US economy could face a recession by the end of this year or in the first half of 2024. Recently, Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson, who has been one of the strongest bearish voices on the Wall Street, warned that the increased US government spending that injected a lot of optimism in the markets would not bode well for US stocks. The analyst said that US has not seen such a high deficit when unemployment is so low.However, Wilson acknowledged that the recession predictions and bearish notes have hitherto been proven false. And Wilson does not think we would necessarily face a full-blown recession. He said that the central bank’s fiscal policies have already ushered in a “down cycle” and he is convinced that growth is slowing.Wisdom Tree in its third quarter of 2023 report said that volatility has become a constant in the market. The firm believes inflation will keep cooling and the Federal Reserve might be near the end of its rate hike cycle. The firm said the central bank might go on an extended pause once it concludes its current rate hike cycle. Wisdom Tree rules out any possibility of rate cuts this year but believes that topic could gain more relevance in the first half of 2024. Wisdom Tree also talked about the AI rally that gave a huge boost to many stocks. The firm believes this hype could subside as investors’ excitement around AI abates slowly. Wisdom Tree is concerned that some parts of the market are trading on hype.The Wisdom Tree report said that while the bull market started back in October 2022, stock valuations are still attractive.“The value cycle turns out to be just a value trade—a shorter term run for dividend concepts that ended last autumn. Additionally, continued levitation from zero-yielding Silicon Valley giants would be troublesome. This year has been horrible for value-oriented mandates, along with most everything that was not mega cap growth. Stocks that can demonstrate durable profitability and reasonable valuations were the type that held up during the 2022 sell-off; we suspect they are opportune in 2023’s second half,” the report said.Story continuesTime and again successful investors have emphasized the importance of not losing money while investing in the stock market. When markets are volatile you have to find high conviction, low risk plays that are insulated from market crashes. David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital talked about the importance of finding high conviction plays and going all in in an interview in 2005. He said:“We believe in constructing the portfolio so that we put our biggest amount of money in our highest-conviction idea, and then we view the other ideas relative to that. We find things that we think are exceptional only occasionally. So if we find some- thing that is really set up, where we think it’s mispriced, where we have a good understanding of why it’s mispriced, where we think the mispricing is very large and the overall risk is very small, we take an outsized position to make sure we give ourselves the chance to be well compensated for getting it right.""Best Low Risk Investments in 2023Photo by Marga Santoso on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we first used a stock screener to identify US stocks with beta values less than 1. Beta value of less than 1 shows low risk and low volatility. After applying this check we got a long list of stocks, from which we selected 17 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. We gauged hedge fund sentiment for these stocks using Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds. These are the best low risk investments in the stock market in 2023 according to hedge funds. Almost all of these stocks are safe, and reliable and are not highly affected by market volatility.Best Low Risk Investments in 202317. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74With consistent dividend increases and a defensive and recession-proof business, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is one of the best low risk investments in the stock market in 2023.Last month, Jefferies updated its 'Uber Crowded' portfolio which includes companies that are popular among Long Only &amp; Hedge Fund investors. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) was one of the notable stocks in this portfolio. 74 hedge funds out of the 910 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database had stakes in The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).16. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 78Merck ranks 16th in our list of the best low risk investments in 2023. With over a decade of consistent dividend hikes and a robust pipeline of drugs MRK has upside potential.Last month, the company said the European Commission approved its anti-PD-1 therapy Keytruda as part of a combination regimen to treat gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma as a first-line option.Carillon Eagle Growth &amp; Income Fund made the following comment about Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) presented positive clinical data for a new drug in its oncology pipeline, announced an acquisition that was viewed favorably by investors, and reported strong first-quarter financial results while also increasing its earnings guidance for 2023.15. Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 78Data monitoring and security platform company Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) ranks 15th in our list of the best low risk investments in 2023. As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 78 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG).In August, T.D. Cowen started covering Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) with an Outperform rating. The firm’s analyst Andrew Sherman set a $120 price target on Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG).RiverPark Large Growth Fund made the following comment about Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG): DDOG was a top detractor in the quarter. The company reported strong 4Q results including 44% revenue growth and 30% earnings growth but gave cautious revenue guidance for 2023. Macroeconomic headwinds have caused clients to slow the transition of workloads to the cloud and instead to optimize current capacity. Despite this temporary slowdown, DDOG still expects revenue to grow nearly 25% in 2023.As businesses have transitioned to cloud software infrastructure, much of which is in isolated data silos, it has become increasingly difficult for data engineers to monitor and analyze system performance. Datadog provides a SaaS software platform to monitor and analyze the system performance of software applications and IT infrastructure by giving users a single page view to observe their company’s technology stack. The company has quickly grown its revenue from $100 million in 2017 to $1.7 billion in 2022 and, we believe, should continue to grow revenue at more than 20% annually as it penetrates its $40 billion and fast-growing market. Less than 10% of software applications are currently monitored. The company’s dollar-based net retention rate has been 130%+ as existing customers continue to use an increasing number of products and the company continues to add new features. As of 4Q22, 81% of customers used 2+ products, while only 18% of customers used 6+ products (up from less than 1% two years ago). As an extremely capex light software business, DDOG already has significant free-cash-flow ($350m in 2022) and free-cash-flow margins (21% in 2022).”14. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 81The biggest retailer in the US, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) remains the dominant player in the industry despite consumer headwinds and inflation challenges.

(NYSE:WMT). The biggest stakeholder of Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is DE Shaw with an $862 million stake in the company.13. Elevance Health, Inc.

This summer alone, the United States has experienced catastrophic wildfires and smoke, heat domes, intense flooding, and destructive hurricanes. These extreme events, in combination with other factors climate can exacerbate, such as the spread of disease, demonstrate the toll being taken on our physical and mental health.“In a Mercer survey of more than 2,000 U.S. workers conducted last year, 43% said they were extremely concerned or very concerned about adverse climate events. Business leaders can take action to better support a climate-resilient workforce,” said Tracy Watts, Senior Partner and National Leader of U.S. Health Policy, Mercer. “We look forward to collaborating with employers through the National Commission on Climate and Workforce Health to address the impact of extreme weather on employee health and find innovative solutions to this pressing challenge.”Beyond well-being, employers are quickly coming to terms with the financial and productivity burdens created by these events. Exposure to heat, decreased air quality, extreme weather, infectious diseases, and environmental contaminants continue to threaten employee health, limit productivity, and increase illness or injury-related costs, particularly in certain occupations.Story continues“We’re proud to partner with Mercer and the CDC Foundation to deliver valuable insights and resources to the business community and provide the tools employers need to confront the climate challenges they are facing today,” said Mark SooHoo, Executive Director of the Health Action Alliance. “The private sector has an important role in mitigating climate-related health risks, protecting vulnerable communities, and safeguarding our economic future.”Despite growing consensus throughout the business community around climate action and sustainability for the future, employers are less aware of the health impacts of our changing climate and need the tools to mitigate and address these impacts for their workforce. Recognizing employers' role in creating collaborative solutions to address health challenges, the Commission will begin by recruiting top business leaders nationwide to study the climate-related trends and health risks employees and organizations face. The Commission will leverage data and insights to create actionable tools and strategies for employers to help reduce long-term costs and advance equitable health outcomes for workers and communities.“By convening health and safety leaders, climate experts, business executives, economists, data experts, and more, the Commission will build greater awareness around the intersection of climate and health,” said SooHoo. “We believe this work will be instrumental in enabling employers to see their company’s risk, project the potential workforce costs related to climate and health, and most importantly, develop actionable tools and best practices to mitigate the health risks posed by a changing climate.”Business leaders and others interested in joining this effort can visit ClimateHealthCommission.org to learn more.About Health Action AllianceHealth Action Alliance is the country’s largest private sector network operating at the intersection of business and public health – with over 7,000 employers reaching more than 30 million workers.

But in the weeks since then, he said “all signs are pointing” to a group known as Scattered Spider, the same outfit suspected of hacking MGM and Caesars Entertainment Inc. in recent weeks. Okta has been assisting MGM, a customer, in its response to the attack, he said. Okta also counts Caesars as a client.Read More: Group in Casino Hacks Skilled at Duping Workers for AccessBrian Ahern, spokesperson for MGM resorts, declined to comment about specifics of the attack. Ahern said the company has been working with FBI and the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency since the breach, he said.The FBI said in a statement provided to Bloomberg News that it is investigating both the Caesars and MGM incidents.A former MGM employee who was familiar with the company’s cybersecurity policies pointed to the help desk as vulnerable to attack. The person said that to obtain a password reset, employees would only have to disclose basic information about themselves – their name, employee identification number and date of birth – details that would be trivial to obtain for a criminal hacking gang. The employee, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said details were too easy to obtain and were the root cause of what “caught MGM up here.”Story continuesAhern declined to comment on the former employee’s allegations.Caesars said in a regulatory filing that it identified suspicious activity in its network “resulting from a social engineering attack on an outsourced IT support vendor used by the company.” The attack on Caesars occurred in recent weeks, and the hackers broke into the company’s systems and threatened to release data, according to two people familiar with the matter. Caesars paid the attackers tens of millions of dollars, the people said. “We have taken steps to ensure that the stolen data is deleted by the unauthorized actor, although we cannot guarantee this result,” Caesars said in the filing.Scattered Spider, also known as UNC3944, are known for its social engineering skills. Members of the group are based in the US and UK and some are as young as 19 years old, according to four cybersecurity experts familiar with the group.They also sometimes work with a ransomware gang known as ALPHV, which is believed to be Russia-based, according to cybersecurity experts.Read More: Lina Khan Got Stuck in the Fallout of the MGM Hack in Las VegasIn a statement posted on the group’s dark web page on Thursday, ALPHV claimed credit for the attack and called reporting that teenagers from the US and UK were involved in the breach rumors. The group also said MGM’s attempts to evict them from Okta system didn’t go according to its plans.Bradbury, from Okta, said he wanted to get the word out about the hackers and their techniques so customers can bolster their cyber defenses. He described the hackers as highly skilled in identity technology, “so we can expect that they will make more and more attacks going forward.”(Updates with MGM declining to comment in eighth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWhy Your Starbucks Wait Is So LongWhy Dollar General Might Just Be the Worst Retail Job in AmericaMBAs Are Spurning McKinsey to Buy Small CompaniesAmbani’s Plan to Upend Indian Finance Lands With a ThudThe Higher-for-Longer Interest-Rate Bonanza©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

(NYSE:NCLH) with 62% ownership,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-investors-lot-riding-norwegian-103933211.html,1695033573,STORY,['NCLH'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings' stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsThe top 25 shareholders own 48% of the companyOwnership research along with  analyst forecasts data  help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stockTo get a sense of who is truly in control of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:NCLH), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 62% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Last week’s 3.4% gain means that institutional investors were on the positive end of the spectrum even as the company has shown strong longer-term trends. The one-year return on investment is currently 12% and last week's gain would have been more than welcomed.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 11% of shares outstanding. Capital Research and Management Company is the second largest shareholder owning 8.7% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 5.7% of the company stock.On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Norwegian Cruise Line HoldingsWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. insiders own under 1% of the company. Keep in mind that it's a big company, and the insiders own US$49m worth of shares. The absolute value might be more important than the proportional share. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 37% stake in Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.Many find it useful to take an in depth look at how a company has performed in the past.

According to MetLife’s Legal Access Study, more than two-thirds of today’s employees (67%) have faced a legal situation in the past five years—this is particularly true of those in marginalized and low-income groups.As these challenges go beyond just impacting workers’ personal lives and affect their overall wellbeing and productivity at work, employers are now seeing first-hand how legal issues can impact their employees. Research shows that one in three employees say they lack adequate access to legal resources, contributing to growing levels of stress and burnout.1 Meanwhile, 61% of employees say they are concerned about the impact of a legal issue on their financial health and nearly half (47%) are concerned about impact on mental health.""Our research has shown that workers’ holistic wellbeing has worsened in the last year as their need for access to quality legal advice has grown. Employers should consider the valuable role legal plans can play in their benefits offering. By offering a legal plan as a voluntary benefit, employers can improve the overall wellbeing of their workforce, help to deliver on their DEI commitments and support the ever-evolving composition of today’s workforce,"" said Ingrid Tolentino, CEO, MetLife Legal Plans.Legal Access Improves the Employee ExperienceWhen employees have access to legal plans, their financial and mental health improve. MetLife research found that 67% of employees who have legal benefits through their employer feel financially healthy (vs. 52% who don’t). Similarly, 75% of employees with legal benefits feel mentally healthy, compared to 63% without legal benefits who say the same.Story continuesThe same study found that broadening access to legal services can also drive key business outcomes. In fact, employers who offer legal services are 12% more likely to say they have increased productivity in their workforce, compared to employers who do not offer legal plans.By offering a benefit that covers a wide range of employee needs, employers are also better able to deliver on their commitments to DEI. The research found that employees with a legal plan are 25% more likely to say that they are satisfied with the availability of fair/equitable opportunities across their organization and 40% more likely to be satisfied with the social wellness benefits/programs that they're offered.Addressing the ""Justice Gap""While a majority (67%) of employees have faced a legal situation in the past five years, only 7% of those have sought legal representation. Marginalized groups are even more likely to have faced a legal situation.78% of employees living with a disability,75% of those who identify as LGBTQ+,69% of those who identify as Hispanic,66% of those who identify as Black,And 58% of those who identify as Asian have also encountered a legal issue.Yet while these groups have a higher occurrence of legal situations, they make up a small percentage of the 7% who have sought an attorney.Workers in these groups are often disproportionately affected by a lack of access to legal services—an inequity commonly referred to as the ""justice gap."" For instance, while 24% of employees indicated that cost was a barrier to legal access, that percentage increased among minority demographics (38% with a disability, 34% LGBTQ+, 30% Black, and 29% Hispanic). Perceptions of fairness in the legal system among those affected by the justice gap are also lower, too, with many employees in these groups saying they actively avoid the legal system due to a lack of trust.Supporting and Educating Employees through Legal AccessBeyond the lack of access to legal support, MetLife’s study also uncovered a general lack of understanding of legal plans among employees, which can contribute to the underutilization of these benefits. Many employees hold misconceptions about legal plans, including what they are, what services they cover, how much they cost, and how they can enroll.""It’s not enough for employers to simply offer legal plans,"" said Tolentino. ""It’s essential they make it a priority to educate employees about how they can use legal plans to protect themselves in the face of the unknown, and as they approach life’s major milestones.""In addition to improving employee wellbeing, employers demonstrate an elevated level of care for their workforce by providing increased education around legal services. Employees who use their legal plans are far more likely to feel cared for (73% vs. 54%), MetLife research has found. Benefits communication tactics, including lunch and learns, human resources office hours, and spending time with diverse groups to understand their unique experiences, support employees’ evolving needs and demonstrate workplace equity.Click here to learn more about MetLife’s 2023 Legal Access Study.Research MethodologyMetLife Legal Plans’ Legal Access Study was conducted in three parts from October 2022 to January 2023 and fielded by Big Village—a global research and analytics consultancy. Rainmakers conducted part one, which included a three-day online community. Twenty-eight interviews were conducted with full-time employees from diverse backgrounds on the state of legal access and their understanding of legal plans. Part two entailed interviews with three experts active in the legal industry (an EVP of DEI, a lecturer of business law and ethics for a school of social work, and an attorney/consultant), and one DEI subject matter expert (consultant and adjunct professor in the department of social justice and social change/consultant). Part three was a quantitative study of 5,023 employees.About MetLifeMetLife, Inc.

Here’s why you shouldn’t worry,CNN Business,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/b21b2177-1833-3b40-8f3d-d21b81434a4a/us-gas-prices-are-unusually.html,1695037554,STORY,['CL=F'],"[A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.Falling leaves typically coincide with falling gas prices as the summer driving season comes to a close and demand at the pump wanes. Instead, gasoline prices are getting more expensive and are just pennies away from their highest level so far this year.That’s because aggressive oil supply cuts in Saudi Arabia and Russia and deadly flooding in Libya have sent crude prices on a tear. Oil prices hit a 10-month high on Friday and are on pace to hit their largest quarterly increase since Russia first invaded Ukraine in the beginning of 2022.Increasing oil prices are a bad omen on Wall Street — they mean higher inflation and introduce the possibility of more economy-crushing interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. More pain at the pump also means less consumer spending elsewhere and a heightened possibility of recession.There’s already a lot to fret about this autumn: Auto workers are on strike, the federal government could face another shutdown, China’s economy is still distressingly subdued and geopolitical tensions are on the rise.Are rising oil prices another item to add to the list?David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management and self-declared worrywart, doesn’t think so.Before the Bell spoke with Kelly about why Americans don’t have to fear the pump, at least right now.This interview has been slightly edited for length and clarity.How high do you think oil prices will go?David Kelly: If there’s some other shock, some big storm in the Gulf of Mexico, it could spike higher. But as we look at this, we don’t think the trend over the next year or two is going to be higher oil prices.There are a few reasons for this.One thing we need to remember is that the price of everything has gone up, and all of the input costs of producing oil have increased. Sure we’re at $90 a barrel right now — but if you measure by today’s dollars, we actually peaked at something like $184 per barrel back in 2008. When you adjust for inflation, oil isn’t that high right now.Story continuesAnother thing is that the US has whittled away its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, we’ve reduced that a lot. There was an inventory overhang we could use to try to balance the market, and it’s not as big as it was.Going forward, US production is growing very rapidly — we’re currently producing more crude oil than either Russia or Saudi Arabia. This is going to be a record year for US liquid fuel production, and next year is going to be even stronger.The global economy is growing slowly, and that’s going to limit demand growth for fossil fuel energy. And frankly, the green energy transition is also limiting the growth in demand.So when I look at the supply side I think the US and other non-OPEC members will help, and when I look at the demand side, I don’t see a lot of economic growth or demand for fossil fuels. So I don’t expect economic trends to push prices much higher, although of course some shock could.Why are oil prices so connected to recession? Expensive oil has a very nasty triple effect of pushing up inflation and sometimes forcing a tighter monetary policy at the very time that it’s squeezing the ability of consumers to spend elsewhere.You saw that most obviously in the 1970s … when high gasoline prices meant people had less money to spend on other stuff, and meanwhile, the Federal Reserve pushed rates up too high to fight inflation. That’s why oil caused a recession in 1974-1975 and caused double barreled recessions in 1980 and 1982. The Great Financial Crisis in 2008 was not about oil, but consumers were in a weakened position going into it because of all the money they were spending on gasoline. These are all reasons why Americans have come to fear a spike at the gas pump.What do elevated oil prices mean for inflation and future rate hikes by the Federal Reserve?I certainly hope the Federal Reserve doesn’t react by raising interest rates one more time. We don’t think they’re going to raise in September, and the futures market is saying there’s a 50/50 chance that they raise one more time in November.Economists and the rest of the world talk about inflation differently: Economists talk about inflation as being the rate of change in prices, and consumers think that you’ve got inflation when prices are high. So for inflation to go away you don’t need the price of gasoline to fall, you just need it to stop rising. I think that we are going to see continued high prices for a lot of stuff, including gasoline, but I don’t think we’re gonna see an acceleration in prices.We believe that inflation will be below the Fed’s 2% target by the fourth quarter of next year. The Fed measures inflation year-over-year, so the fact that we’re having a spike in gasoline prices right now makes it more likely that by next year price growth will be below 2%.We’ve been on this roller coaster, but the thing about a roller coaster is that you get off where you got on, no matter how bumpy the ride was.What should investors do in the meantime? People should continue to look for opportunities to invest in the energy transition. The bigger point isn’t the short term price of oil, it’s the fact that the people who are controlling it — the Saudis and Russians — aren’t particularly friendly to the United States right now. Even though we are a net exporter of oil, we’re still affected by their ability to influence the market in ways that don’t help us. I think this recent oil spike only confirms the fact that we need to invest in something other than fossil fuels.If the Federal Reserve does raise rates one more time, I think it does increase the risk of recession. So you want to make sure that you’re positioned a little bit more defensively because of the danger that higher gasoline prices tend to increase the risk of recession.UAW strike puts the four-day workweek back in focusWhen the United Auto Workers called a strike last week against General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, one of their demands focused on an idea circulating on the periphery of labor reform circles.In addition to calling for a 36% pay raise and increased job security, union members want a 32-hour, four-day workweek with no pay cuts, reports my colleague Eva Rothenberg.Proposals to shorten the workweek have gained traction in recent years, with the flexibility of pandemic-era remote work fueling many of these calls. The accelerating use of artificial intelligence in the workplace has also pushed some workers to question the necessity of a 40-hour week.Sen. Bernie Sanders has long been a vocal proponent of a shortened workweek.“We are looking at an explosion in this country of artificial intelligence and robotics. And that means that the average worker is going to be much more productive,” the Vermont Independent told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday. “The question as a nation that we have to ask ourselves is: Who is going to benefit from this productivity? We should begin a serious discussion — and the UAW is doing that — about substantially lowering the workweek.”Get ready for a spike in marriage proposalsThe pandemic dented sales of engagement rings as relationships faltered — or never even blossomed in the first place — as people stayed inside or avoided socializing outside of the immediate family says Signet Jewelers, the largest jewelry company in the United States.This trend then created an “engagement gap” since couples get engaged, on average, about 3.25 years after they begin dating, according to Signet’s proprietary data.But with the return of many pre-pandemic lifestyles, including dating, Signet (owner of Zales, Jared, Kay Jewelers, Blue Nile and Diamonds Direct) said the lull in proposals is expected to bottom out this year. That means engagements will likely rebound starting in early 2024, reports my colleague Parija Kavilanz.About 2.8 million couples, on average, get engaged every year in the United States, said Signet CEO Virginia Drosos during a company presentation at the Goldman Sachs Global Retailing Conference on Wednesday. Last year, the number slipped to 2.5 million. She said it will continue to head lower to level out at 2.1 to 2.2 million in 2023 before climbing back up and fully rebounding over the next three years.In 2024, Signet expects engagements will reach 2.4 to 2.5 million. That rebound is crucial to the company since bridal jewelry accounts for 50% of its overall merchandise sales.For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com]"
24,e31fc1a2-6cf2-35d3-859e-8f603aa4ab68,O,2023-09-18,US natgas prices edge up 1% on rising feedgas to Freeport LNG in Texas,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-natgas-prices-edge-1-113506188.html,1695036906,STORY,['NG=F'],"[(Adds latest prices) Sept 18 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas futures edged up around 1% on Monday as the amount of gas flowing to the country's liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plants increases after Freeport LNG's facility in Texas returned to near full service over the past few days. That price increase came despite forecasts for milder weather and lower gas demand over the next two weeks than previously expected. Front-month gas futures for October delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 1.3 cents, or 0.5%, to $2.657 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) at 7:03 a.m. EDT (1103 GMT). With U.S. gas prices up about 1% last week, speculators boosted their net long futures and options position on the New York Mercantile and Intercontinental Exchanges for a second week in a row to their highest since late August, according to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission's Commitments of Traders report. Financial firm LSEG said average gas output in the lower 48 U.S. states eased to 102.2 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) so far in September, down from a record 102.3 bcfd in August. Meteorologists forecast the weather in the lower 48 states would remain near normal until around Sept. 24 before turning mostly warmer than usual from Sept. 25-Oct. 3. Traders, however, said that above normal temperatures in late September were still mild with averages expected to be around 72 degrees Fahrenheit (22.2 Celsius) versus a normal of 70 F for that time of year. With exports expected to increase in coming weeks, LSEG forecast U.S. gas demand, including exports, will edge up to 96.3 bcfd next week from 96.0 bcfd this week. Those forecasts were lower than LSEG's outlook on Friday. Gas flows to the seven big U.S. LNG export plants averaged 12.8 bcfd so far in September, up from 12.3 bcfd in August. That compares with a monthly record of 14.0 bcfd in April. On a daily basis, LNG feedgas hit a 16-week high of 13.5 bcfd on Sunday with the increase at Freeport. The 2.1-bcfd Freeport plant was on track to pull in about 2.0 bcfd of gas for a third day in a row on Monday, up from an average of 0.3 bcfd from Sept. 10-13, according to LSEG data. Looking ahead, traders noted Berkshire Hathaway Energy's 0.8-bcfd Cove Point LNG export plant in Maryland was on track to shut for about a week of planned maintenance around Sept. 21-29, according to company notices to customers. Cove Point shuts every year in the autumn for maintenance. In 2022, it shut from around Oct. 1-27, according to LSEG data. The U.S. is on track to become the world's biggest LNG supplier in 2023, ahead of recent leaders Australia and Qatar. Much higher global prices have fed demand for U.S. exports due to supply disruptions and sanctions linked to Russia's war in Ukraine.

(NYSE:CRM)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/too-consider-buying-salesforce-inc-120017855.html,1695038417,STORY,['CRM'],"[Let's talk about the popular Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$234 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$204. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Salesforce's current trading price of US$215 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Salesforce’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Salesforce Is Salesforce Still Cheap?Good news, investors! Salesforce is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $351.97, but it is currently trading at US$215 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. However, given that Salesforce’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What kind of growth will Salesforce generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Salesforce's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since CRM is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on CRM for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy CRM.

29,15341180-5b96-36d6-9d8a-72eeea6c62f6,MRO,2023-09-18,The 7 Best Oil Stocks to Buy Now: September 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-oil-stocks-buy-010910407.html,1694480950,STORY,"['CVX', 'MRO', 'RIG', 'CPG', 'OXY']","[Some of the best oil stocks have seen significant price action in the last few years. This has been in sync with the volatility in crude oil since the pandemic.From historic lows during the pandemic, crude oil surged well above $100 per barrel. However, as growth concerns increased on the back of tightening monetary policies, oil declined meaningfully to 2023 lows of $63 per barrel.Now, with fears of recession declining and with production cuts by OPEC and its allies, oil is in recovery mode. The potential end to monetary tightening is also likely to support oil and Brent is back to $87 per barrel.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsI believe that the positive momentum is likely to sustain and it’s a good time to buy some of the best oil stocks. Let’s discuss the reasons to be bullish on these fundamentally strong oil companies.Chevron (CVX)Chevron (CVX) logo on gas station sign with ""diesel"" and ""food mart"" written underneathSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stock has remained sideways in the last 12 months. With volatility in oil prices, I believe that CVX stock has been resilient. Backed by strong fundamentals and quality assets, I expect the stock to break out on the upside. It’s worth noting that CVX stock offers an attractive dividend yield of 3.68%.I believe that the most important reason to be bullish on Chevron is its high-quality assets with an attractive break-even point. To put things into perspective, Chevron reported operating cash flow of $6.3 billion for Q2 2023. This came in a low oil price environment. If oil trades in the range of $80 to $90 per barrel, Chevron is positioned to deliver annual OCF in excess of $30 billion.Given this point, it’s not surprising that the company is targeting an annual capital expenditure of $13 billion to $15 billion through 2027. This will ensure steady production growth. At the same time, Chevron is diversifying its portfolio toward low-carbon business.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comStory continuesOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) stock has been Warren Buffett’s favorite. The legendary investor has boosted his stake in the oil and gas company above 25%. I believe that there are multiple reasons to be positive about this 1.12% dividend yield stock.First, the company has quality assets in the Rockies, Permian Basin, and Gulf of Mexico. For Q2 2023, Occidental reported $1 billion in free cash flows. As oil trends higher, the annual FCF visibility is likely to be in excess of $5 billion.Robust FCF will ensure two things. First, Occidental will continue to deleverage and I expect sustained improvement in credit metrics. Second, Occidental will be positioned to invest aggressively in core assets and its emerging low-carbon business.Recently, the company acquired Carbon Engineering for $1.1 billion. Carbon Engineering is focused on the deployment of large-scale Direct Air Capture technology. Using this, carbon dioxide can be captured and used to produce clean, affordable transportation fuels.Aker (AKRBF)3D rendered two black oil barrels on digital financial chart screen with yellow numbers and rising, green, falling, red arrows on black background. Oil stocksSource: stockwars / Shutterstock.comIn my view, Aker (OTCMKTS:AKRBF) is a hidden gem among oil stocks and will create immense value. The 8.12% dividend yield stock looks undervalued and is poised for a strong reversal rally in the coming quarters.As an overview, Aker BP ASA is an oil and gas exploration company with a focus on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. The company has some prized assets like the Johan Sverdrup. Besides a long asset life, the company’s NCS assets have a low break-even point. To put things into perspective, Aker BP reported a realized oil price of $75 per barrel for Q2 2023. At this price, the company reported revenue and EBITDA of $3.3 billion and $3 billion, respectively.Further, its operating cash flow was $2.9 billion. Assuming a scenario where oil trades around $100 per barrel, Aker BP is likely to be a massive cash flow machine. The correction in AKRBF stock is therefore a good accumulation opportunity for the long term.Marathon Oil (MRO)Marathon Oil gas station carport on sunny day with blue sky backgroundSource: Jonathan Weiss/shutterstock.comDuring the pandemic-driven oil crash, Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) stock traded at lows of $3.1. Considering the highs of 2023, MRO stock has already delivered 10-bagger returns. I believe that as fundamentals improve, MRO stock will remain in an uptrend.Marathon Oil is a U.S.-focused oil and gas exploration company. The company’s assets are in the Permian, Eagle Ford, Bakken, and Oklahoma. As of December 2022, Marathon reported proved reserves of 1,338 million barrels of oil equivalent. A strong asset base provides visibility for sustained production and cash flow upside.An important point to note is that Marathon has an investment-grade balance sheet. This gives the company financial flexibility for robust dividend growth and share repurchases. Over the trailing seven quarters, the company has repurchased shares worth $4.2 billion.At the same time, Marathon has been making significant capital investments. For Q2 2023, the company’s capital expenditure was $632 million. This will ensure healthy reserve replacement and steady production growth.Transocean (RIG)Person holding smartphone with logo of offshore drilling company Transocean Ltd. (RIG) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comTransocean (NYSE:RIG) is another attractive name among the best oil stocks to buy and hold. The company is a provider of offshore contract drilling services with focus on deep and ultra-deepwater floaters. It’s worth noting that RIG stock has surged by almost 150% in the last 12 months. Considering fundamental factors, I expect the stock to remain in an uptrend.As of July, Transocean reported an order backlog of $9.2 billion. Further, in the last three months, the company’s order intake has been $1.2 billion. A robust backlog and healthy intake activity provide clear cash flow visibility.An important point to note is that Transocean expects to reduce debt by $3 billion in the next few years. As credit metrics improve, the stock will be re-rated. Additionally, with improved financial flexibility, there is a strong case for rig acquisitions if market conditions remain positive. With these factors in mind, the outlook for RIG stock is bullish.Borr Drilling (BORR)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comBorr Drilling (NYSE:BORR) is another attractive offshore drilling contractor to oil and gas companies globally. Backed by strong fundamental developments, BORR stock has trended higher by 83% in the last 12 months. There are several reasons to believe that the stock will remain in an uptrend.First and foremost, Borr has a robust order backlog of $1.64 billion. Recently, the company won new orders worth $211 million and the order book has swelled to almost $1.9 billion. This provides clear revenue and cash flow visibility.Further, the company has two jack-up rigs under construction. Once these are deployed, the company’s revenue growth will be supported. It’s also worth noting that the order intake in 2022 and the current year has been at a higher rate. This has translated into sustained growth in adjusted EBITDA. As cash flows swell, Borr will be positioned to deleverage.Crescent Point Energy (CPG)miniature oil barrel and oil well figures on top of stack of moneySource: ShutterstockCrescent Point Energy (NYSE:CPG) stock is a relatively smaller name that looks attractive. CPG stock trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 7.1x and offers a dividend yield of 3.57%. I believe that a big rally is coming considering the valuations and positive business developments.In a recent development, Crescent Point sold North Dakota assets for $500 million. The company is focused on its core assets in Kaybob Duvernay and Alberta Montney. Since 2018, Crescent has acquired assets worth $3 billion in these regions.It’s also worth noting that the company expects to reduce debt to less than $2.2 billion by the end of the year. This would imply total debt that’s 1x adjusted funds flow. As the balance sheet improves, Crescent will be positioned to increase dividends. The company has also repurchased 16.5 million shares in the year to date. With these positives, I expect CPG stock to be a value creator.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.""We believe Hong Kong has that ability to pivot and innovate. Hong Kong is also one of the largest financial centres in the world,"" Mazhari said. ""Hong Kong is now trying to pivot to using technology to become even more relevant in the financial ecosystem.""Microsoft has been making a concerted push to promote its generative AI products and Azure cloud platform in the city. The Redmond, Washington-based company recently partnered with eight Hong Kong universities to offer a series of AI workshops. A number of fintech companies have also announced partnerships.While Microsoft's Bing Chat is accessible in the city without a virtual private network - differentiating it from its biggest rivals - it has largely focused on carving out an edge in enterprise offerings. The software giant has touted its ability to keep corporate information sandboxed, saying its large language models (LLMs) will never be trained on customer data.""[When] you use the enterprise chat, we will not store your questions,"" said Cally Chan, general manager of the company's Hong Kong and Macau operations. ""The data you use to train it will only happen in your own subscription. We will never use your own data to train our model.""Story continuesFintech, especially in the area of regulatory compliance technology, is a significant use case in Hong Kong, Chan added. Out of 3,900 start-ups using Microsoft's AI products in the city, about 800 are fintech companies, she said.""Hong Kong tends to be a financial services centre, and therefore you might see more partners who are focused on financial services,"" Mazhari explained. ""We hope to work and enable customers who want to innovate.""The Hong Kong arm of Forms Syntron, a Shenzhen-based financial services and consultancy firm, is one local company that has already adopted Microsoft's generative AI tech for tasks such as faster searches of regulatory documents. Regulatory technology, or regtech, is a specific area of focus for Microsoft.With many clients already using Microsoft's Azure cloud service, it made sense for Forms to go with the US tech giant for AI, according to Alex Chan, CEO of Forms Hong Kong. The company also sees getting into AI early as a competitive edge.""This is a very, very new technology domain, which is also game-changing, as well. Globally, not to mention Hong Kong locally, there is not much experienced expertise or resources available in the market,"" Chan said. ""I think we have gained very good leeway to build up expertise and experience.""Shanghai-based air ticketing platform Trip.com has also been using Microsoft's AI this year to help customers with travel planning and bookings.Microsoft has been one of the few US tech giants capable of maintaining relatively good relations with China against the backdrop of an escalating tech war between the two countries. In June, the company's founder Bill Gates met with Chinese President Xi Jinping, who called the billionaire ""an old friend"".Yet Microsoft has also been one of the most active companies in uncovering and publicising cybersecurity issues stemming from China. Researchers from the company recently said they uncovered a disinformation campaign on social media using AI that appeared to have origins in China. The company also recently revealed it had been the victim of an attack where hackers of apparent Chinese origin gained access to its cloud services in an incident that compromised the email of US government agencies and officials. China was also blamed for a massive hack of Microsoft Exchange Server in 2021.When asked if any of those incidents could jeopardise the company's position in the Hong Kong market, Microsoft's Chan demurred, pointing to continued growth for AI products in the city.""So far the market momentum is very good,"" she said. ""If you ask me are there any constraints, or is there any reduced demand, indeed no. We are seeing increasing demand.""Still, the US is currently planning to restrict Chinese access to American cloud AI services on national security grounds. It is unclear whether such rules would affect business in Hong Kong. Under the administration of former president Donald Trump, the US ended some distinctions between mainland China and Hong Kong as separate markets.Microsoft has so far had no issues with making Bing Chat freely accessible in the city. Google and OpenAI, which counts Microsoft as its biggest backer, have made no comments to date on why their chatbots remain officially unavailable in Hong Kong.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

Small amounts of money invested over time can add up to a lifetime of riches. Even if you only have $500 to invest you can still find stocks to buy.The stock market’s history proves there are few better paths to building wealth than investing in American businesses. The long-term average return for the S&amp;P 500 is about 11% a year. That’s through depressions and recessions, war, civil unrest and even a global pandemic or two.One truth that shines through is that no matter how bad things get, they always get better. Every bear market is eventually followed by a bull market. And the beauty of stock investing is you don’t need a lot of money to participate in this amazing wealth-building machine. A small grubstake can turn into a comfortable retirement nest egg given time.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsParking that $500 in the stock index for 25 years and not adding another dollar will have it turn into $6,800 at average market returns. But there is a better way. The following trio of no-brainer stocks should help transform your small acorn into a mighty oak of a retirement portfolio.NXP Semiconductors (NXPI)A sign on a brick well for NXP Semiconductor. NXPI stock.Source: Lukassek / Shutterstock.comKnown for its leadership in near-field communication, NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) chips are everywhere today. They allow cars to communicate with one another and the environment around them. They also exist in smart homes, appliances, entertainment systems, smartphones and wearables, banks and the government for identification documents.Especially with the advent of smart electric cars, the need and demand for NXP’s chips in automotive applications has grown exponentially. The segment now accounts for 57% of the chipmaker’s quarterly revenue. Industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) applications are a distant second at less than 18% of revenue.Although revenue in the auto segment fell slightly from last year, the total was up 6% to $3.3 billion. And that’s with the auto industry still in a slump. A senior economist at Cox Automotive said, “rising interest rates, and their impact on affordability, remain strong headwinds against a more robust vehicle market.”Story continuesThe reason for the disconnect between NXP’s results and the broader market is that today’s cars are rolling computers. Car sales are down, but the density of computer chips in vehicles grows nonetheless.And the auto industry is recovering. New car sales surged 15% higher in August compared to last year. That means NXP’s business will only continue to strengthen in time. At 15 times earnings estimates, NXP Semiconductor offers better values than other similarly situated chipmakers.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comThe market is giving investors a chance to get into Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) at an opportune time. The stock got beat up over second-quarter earnings, and shares are down 17% from recent highs.Wall Street, however, forecasts the robotic surgery leader to grow earnings three times faster over the next five years than it did over the previous five. It is far and away the leader in the industry, with an installed base of over 8,200 machines and around an 80% share of the global market for certain procedures. Intuitive Surgical’s da Vinci device is the de facto industry standard.Yet the robotics giant faces several headwinds. Business was disrupted during the pandemic due to elective surgeries being placed on hold. More recently, the rise of weight-loss drugs may cut into the growth of Intuitive Surgical’s bariatric procedures. Still, procedures targeting gynecological issues, hernia, colorectal and others continue to generate high demand.Bariatric surgery for obese patients has slowed down, but Intuitive Surgical thinks it is temporary. As people evaluate using drugs instead of surgery for weight loss, there will be a short-term hit. Long-term, however, the robotics company says the outlook is still positive. Once patients stop taking the drugs, they tend to gain the weight back. Robotic bariatric surgery could ultimately complement the weight-loss drugs.With shares down and earnings growth expected to be strong, Intuitive Surgical should be a no-brainer stock for investors.Sysco (SYY)Sysco (SYY) logo on a sign with company headquarters in Houston in the background.Source: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.comNot as exciting as smart car chips or robotic surgery, food distribution leader Sysco (NYSE:SYY) is also a dead-simple investment to make.Getting food from farm to supermarket or institutional kitchen is one of those behind-the-scenes operations few really think about. It’s a highly fragmented industry, but Sysco is the industry leader with a 17% share. Second place U.S. Foods (NYSE:USFD) has an 11% share.Sysco operates 333 distribution facilities globally and serves approximately 700,000 customer locations. Despite revenue jumping 11% in fiscal 2023 to $76 billion and operating profits surging 30%, Sysco stock is down 20% from its 52-week high.The problem is that inflation and commodity costs are still ravaging the food industry. Consumers are also feeling pinched and have not returned to buying more expensive cuts of meat. It’s affecting dairy and seafood purchases also. The issue prevents Sysco from raising prices.Supermarkets already operate on very thin margins, and persistently high costs for food are hurting business. Kroger (NYSE:KR), for example, is the largest pure-play supermarket chain in the country, and it just issued an earnings warning for just those reasons.Still, Sysco stock is very cheap. It trades at 16 times estimates, less than twice its projected earnings growth rate, and just a fraction of sales. The food distributor is also a Dividend King, meaning SYY raised its dividend for 50 consecutive years or more. Currently, the payout yields 2.9%, making it an easy choice for investors.On the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a long position in SYY stock.

(PMI) (NYSE: PM) announced today that on September 13, 2023, its Board of Directors appointed a new member, Ms. Victoria Harker, to serve on the Board of Directors, effective January 1, 2024.Victoria Harker is an experienced U.S. public-company Chief Financial Officer, having served in the role with three different companies, and she has been involved in significant corporate transformations in the consumer, industrial and utility sectors for over 25 years. She is a high-energy, action-oriented, strategic executive, who has worked at a significant scale, most recently as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of TEGNA Inc., a global media and digital communications company, a position she will step down from effective December 31, 2023. Prior to this, she served as Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and President, Global Business Services, of The AES Corporation, a global power company. She has served as a non-executive member of the boards of directors of two large and complex U.S. public companies, Huntington Ingalls Industries and Xylem Inc., since the time of their respective spin-offs. Ms. Harker also serves as the audit committee chair for Huntington Ingalls Industries and as the compensation committee chair for Xylem Inc. She is Vice Chair of the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, a member of the University of Virginia Health System Board, and was previously a member of the University of Virginia Board of Visitors.André Calantzopoulos, PMI’s Executive Chairman, commended Ms. Harker on the appointment, and said, ""We are delighted to welcome Victora to the PMI Board of Directors. Her broad finance and business experience will further strengthen and diversify the capabilities of our Board in successfully guiding our company through its ambitious and highly promising journey towards a smoke-free future and beyond.""Story continuesPhilip Morris International: Delivering a Smoke-Free FuturePhilip Morris International (PMI) is a leading international tobacco company working to deliver a smoke-free future and evolving its portfolio for the long term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector. The company’s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products, including heat-not-burn, vapor and oral nicotine products, which are sold in markets outside the U.S. Since 2008, PMI has invested more than USD 9 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized the marketing of versions of PMI’s IQOS Platform 1 devices and consumables as Modified Risk Tobacco Products (MRTPs), finding that exposure modification orders for these products are appropriate to promote the public health. As of June 30, 2022, excluding Russia and Ukraine, PMI's smoke-free products were available for sale in 70 markets, and PMI estimates that approximately 13.2 million adults around the world had already switched to IQOS and stopped smoking. With a strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences, in February 2021 PMI announced its ambition to expand into wellness and healthcare areas and deliver innovative products and solutions that aim to address unmet consumer and patient needs.

Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. In the event that risks or uncertainties materialize, or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements. Pursuant to the ""safe harbor"" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, PMI is identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by PMI.PMI's business risks include: excise tax increases and discriminatory tax structures; increasing marketing and regulatory restrictions that could reduce our competitiveness, eliminate our ability to communicate with adult consumers, or ban certain of our products in certain markets or countries; health concerns relating to the use of tobacco and other nicotine-containing products and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke; litigation related to tobacco use and intellectual property; intense competition; the effects of global and individual country economic, regulatory and political developments, natural disasters and conflicts; the impact and consequences of Russia's invasion of Ukraine; changes in adult smoker behavior; the impact of COVID-19 on PMI's business; lost revenues as a result of counterfeiting, contraband and cross-border purchases; governmental investigations; unfavorable currency exchange rates and currency devaluations, and limitations on the ability to repatriate funds; adverse changes in applicable corporate tax laws; adverse changes in the cost, availability, and quality of tobacco and other agricultural products and raw materials, as well as components and materials for our electronic devices; and the integrity of its information systems and effectiveness of its data privacy policies. PMI's future profitability may also be adversely affected should it be unsuccessful in its attempts to produce and commercialize reduced-risk products or if regulation or taxation do not differentiate between such products and cigarettes; if it is unable to successfully introduce new products, promote brand equity, enter new markets or improve its margins through increased prices and productivity gains; if it is unable to expand its brand portfolio internally or through acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships; if it is unable to attract and retain the best global talent, including women or diverse candidates; or if it is unable to successfully integrate and realize the expected benefits from recent transactions and acquisitions.

38,99871dfc-35b2-31c6-a054-f1d29e8eaf51,PM,2023-09-18,7 Dividend Stocks That Can Still Give You Capital Gains,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-dividend-stocks-still-capital-200817573.html,1694462897,STORY,"['NEE', 'TNL', 'QCOM', 'KO', 'PM', 'TM']","[While investors typically acquire dividend stocks because of their passive income, certain enterprises also bring compelling growth opportunities. Put another way, the companies on this list allow you to have your cake and eat it, too.One of the top attributes of dividend stocks for capital gains is that you’re getting a multi-pronged deal. First, the most consistent dividend providers represent established businesses. Heading into uncharted waters regarding the post-pandemic recovery process, you can have confidence in these stalwarts. Second, dividend stocks tend to be less volatile than their growth-only counterparts. That’s because when the stuff hits the fan, passive income payers usually enjoy stable and robust financials. And third, when dividend-paying companies grow, the expansion is likely to be a sustainable one.Of course, all investment ideas carry risks. However, you can do a lot worse than buying established dividend stocks for capital gains.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsToyota (TM)Toyota motor corporation logo on dealership buildingSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.comAt first glance, automotive giant Toyota (NYSE:TM) might seem an unnecessary risk for dividend stocks for capital gains. Since the start of the year, shares have already swung up over 28%. Just how much more can this titan expand? Fundamentally, perhaps a lot more.First, you have to remember that Toyota was a bit late to the game when it came to electric vehicles. Well, that’s changing, which theoretically expands its total addressable market. Also, with its development of a solid-state battery, it could potentially shift the paradigm. So, investors would be smart to wager on Toyota.For passive income, the company carries a forward yield of 2.82%. This ranks favorably compared to the broader consumer discretionary sector’s average yield of 1.89%. Also, the payout ratio sits at only 27.05%, providing confidence in yield sustainability.Finally, analysts peg TM as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $207.79, implying over 17% upside potential.Story continuesCoca-Cola (KO)KO stock PEP stock: a can of Coca-cola and a can of Pepsi on either side of a glass of brown soda and sitting on top of a pile of iceSource: monticello / ShutterstockA soft drink giant and an icon of American capitalism, investors love Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) for various reasons. Usually, though, they focus on KO being one of the top dividend stocks. However, it could turn into a capital gains machine. Yes, it’s down more than 7% since the start of the year. Still, the fundamentals shine bright.Basically, you have two factors working favorably for Coca-Cola. First, inflation remains stubbornly elevated, which means that people will need to start thinking about cheaper forms of caffeine. Second, return-to-office initiatives have become more aggressive, including the use of veiled threats. Cynically, this framework should boost caffeine demand.Currently, Coca-Cola carries a forward yield of 3.15%. That’s noticeably higher than the consumer staples sector’s average yield of 1.89%. Also, the company commands 62 years of annual dividend increases. Lastly, analysts peg KO as a strong buy with a $71.82 price target, implying over 23% upside.Philip Morris (PM)packs of cigarettes in convenience store rackSource: defotoberg / Shutterstock.comA tobacco giant, Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) at first glance might not seem an ideal opportunity for dividend stocks for capital gains. As various reports indicate, smoking prevalence has declined globally for men and women. Folks just don’t find the underlying practice appealing anymore. So, why would PM rise higher, especially after it lost almost 8% since the January opener?While smoking rates have faded, the indulgence hasn’t gone away altogether. Let’s get that out of the way. More importantly, the company enjoys a clear advantage in the vaping, or e-cigarette market. Essentially, Philip Morris knows what smokers want. Therefore, it can craft a digital alternative that mimics the analog experience. Right now, the company carries a forward yield of 5.42%, which is quite generous. To be fair, the payout ratio of 74.58% is elevated. Still, it features 14 years of consecutive dividend increases, a status it won’t want to give up cheaply.In closing, analysts peg PM as a unanimous strong buy with a $116.71 price target, implying almost 25% upside.NextEra Energy (NEE)The NextEra Energy (NEE) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.comA powerhouse name in the renewable energy space, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) offers a compelling idea for dividend stocks for capital gains. To cut through the fluff, NEE, over the long run, sells itself. With the broader political and ideological winds pushing renewables, NextEra enjoys business expansion opportunities. Still, there is a rather large issue to address.Since the beginning of this year, NEE slipped more than 20%. In the trailing one-year period, shares lost almost 26% of equity value. While not exactly a confidence booster for dividend stocks, with time, NextEra should pull itself together. It’s too relevant and commands a moat.Regarding passive income, NextEra carries a forward yield of 2.8%. While it’s lower than the utilities sector’s average yield of 3.75%, the company also commands 30 years of dividend increases. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg NEE as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target for the next 12 months stands at $84.90, implying 27% upside.Qualcomm (QCOM)Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor signSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.comA top-tier semiconductor and technology enterprise, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) has seen better days. Fundamentally, various chipmakers have struggled this year due to fading demand for smartphones and PCs. That’s a kick to the teeth for Qualcomm because it specializes in connectivity solutions. Since the start of the year, QCOM slipped about 1% below parity, hardly an inspiring performance.Nevertheless, connectivity as a concept will never go away. More importantly, Qualcomm should maintain its leadership position in key market subsegments. And if that’s not an enticing proposition, shares trade at only 11.52X forward earnings, lower than 81.7% of its peers. Subsequently, it’s one of the top dividend stocks for capital gains.Currently, the tech giant carries a forward yield of 3.01%. That’s well above the underlying sector’s average yield of 1.37%. Also, the payout ratio sits at only 34.82%. Turning to the Street, analysts peg QCOM as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target comes in at $137.79, implying nearly 30% upside.Viper Energy (VNOM)Panorama of Oil and Gas central processing platform in twilight, offshore hard work occupation twenty four working hours. Best oil stocks to buySource: Oil and Gas Photographer / Shutterstock.comBased in Midland, Texas, Viper Energy (NASDAQ:VNOM) is structured as a limited partnership to own, acquire, and exploit oil and natural gas properties in North America. While hydrocarbon resources don’t exactly align with contemporary political and ideological sensibilities, they could remain relevant for years to come. Carrying an advantage in terms of energy density, hydrocarbon replacement won’t happen anytime soon.Also, the energy market has been rising in recent sessions. Due to a cynical combination of geopolitical flashpoints and diplomatic tensions with the Middle East, the price of crude has been marching higher. Therefore, it’s possible that Viper – which has been deflated compared to sector peers – could make a bounce back.Looking at passive income, Viper commands a forward yield of 3.74%. Its payout ratio, while somewhat elevated at 51.66%, is well within reason for sustainability confidence. Lastly, analysts peg VNOM as a unanimous strong buy. Their average price target clocks in at $37.63, implying over 30% upside potential. Thus, it’s a solid idea for dividend stocks.Travel + Leisure (TNL)Couple signing timeshare agreement with realtor.Source: antoniodiaz / ShutterstockHeadquartered in Orlando, Florida, Travel + Leisure (NYSE:TNL) is a timeshare company. Per its public profile, it develops, sells, and manages timeshare properties under several vacation ownership clubs. Fundamentally, TNL represents one of the riskiest ideas among dividend stocks for capital gains. Essentially, investors must hope that the revenge travel phenomenon continues to undergird shares.So far, TNL has been doing a decent job, gaining 11% since the January opener despite various consumer pressures. To add fuel to the bullish fire, consumers still appear to be prioritizing experiences denied them because of Covid-19. Thus, it’s possible that TNL may continue defying gravity.According to data from TipRanks, TNL carries a dividend yield of 4.32%. This investment resource reports that the underlying consumer cyclical sector’s average yield sits at only 0.992%. Just as well, TNL’s payout ratio comes in at a very reasonable 35.38%. On a final note, analysts peg TNL a strong buy with a $53.80 price target, implying 37% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

PPG recently said that the expansion of its powder coatings facility in Sumare, Brazil, had been completed. The facility's production capacity was boosted by 40% as a result of the $2.7 million project. This month, the unit is expected to achieve its maximum capacity.The facility now features new, cutting-edge, highly automated equipment that improves process control and quality while requiring less setup time for color matching and production. At the location, additional automation investments are planned, including the combination of connecting tools and process synchronization technologies.This investment seeks to address the rising demand for powder coatings from regional producers of electrical equipment, agricultural machinery, transportation and other industries for items like steel furniture, storage structures, gym equipment and electrical panels and transformers.The development is part of PPG's most recent international investment to modernize five powder coatings manufacturing sites in the United States and Latin America, which was first announced earlier this year to address rising customer demand for products with superior sustainability.Shares of PPG have gained 12.2% over the past year compared with a 13.4% rise of its industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company expects third-quarter adjusted EPS in the range of $1.85-$1.95. For the full year, the company raised its adjusted EPS projection to the range of $7.28-$7.48. These projections consider various factors such as current global economic activity, soft global industrial production, continued economic uncertainty associated with geopolitical issues in Europe and higher interest rates in most developed countries.The company expects performance coatings demand in Europe to stabilize at lower levels than the pre-conflict period in Ukraine while raw material and transportation normalize closer to pre-pandemic levels.For Industrial coatings, PPG anticipates a low single-digit percentage decline in organic sales due to lower global industrial production, except for modest growth in China. Other industrial end-use markets are expected to be soft. However, selling price increases are likely to continue.Story continuesPPG Industries, Inc.

It sounds completely counterintuitive. Why would a giant publicly traded corporation be undervalued? All I can say is, strange things can happen.Consider the movie Moneyball, where the protagonists of the film helped drive a flailing Oakland Athletics team into national relevance. Essentially, the heroes of the story found underappreciated players who still had something left in the tank. When talking about undervalued large-cap stocks, we’re dealing with the equities market version of Moneyball.As always, do your research, but do it quickly. These undervalued large-cap stocks might not stay that way for long.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsUndervalued Large-Cap Stocks: Phillips 66 (PSX)Phillips 66 gas station in the daytimeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comAt first glance, downstream hydrocarbon energy specialist Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) doesn’t seem a natural candidate for undervalued large-cap stocks. Sure, it seems a viable opportunity, especially now given the rise in energy prices. But let’s face reality – Phillips 66 (and its competitors) enjoy a captive audience. However, it’s such a well-known entity on Wall Street that being underappreciated seems far-fetched.Also, there’s the point that while the benchmark equity indices posted a loss last week, PSX gained over 5%. Still, it makes a solid case for undervalued large-cap stocks to buy because of its financials. Specifically, PSX trades at a trailing-year earnings multiple of 5.3x and a revenue multiple of 0.37x. Both stats are below their respective sector median values.Nevertheless, Phillips 66 is consistently profitable, with a better-than-average net margin. Also, its revenue growth over the past three years of 14.9% ranks better than 59.4% of its peers. Finally, analysts peg PSX as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $131.09, implying over 7% upside potential.Story continuesKroger (KR)Kroger (KR) Supermarket. The Kroger Co. is One of the World's Largest Grocery Retailers.Source: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.comAnother entity that doesn’t seem to qualify for undervalued large-cap stocks, Kroger (NYSE:KR) blatantly offers a bullish narrative. Right now, U.S. retailers have sounded the alarm about rising stressors on the consumer base. That’s actually a warning that companies issued earlier this year. So, you’d think that grocery giant Kroger would benefit cynically. Logically, consumers will direct money toward the essentials.Well, for whatever reason, KR just happens to be one of the undervalued large-cap stocks. Financially, KR trades at a forward multiple of only 10.36X. In contrast, the sector median comes in at 14.58X.One factor that could be plaguing Kroger is heavy trading among possibly institutional investors with pessimistic transactions. Due to implied volatility spiking in the direction of both deep in-the-money and out-the-money (OTM) options, the pros are incentivized to sell both puts and calls to collect the heightened premium.Once the options expire, though, it’s possible the fundamentals can send KR higher. Analysts believe that’s the case, pegging KR as a moderate buy with a $51.82 price target, implying over 10% upside.Allstate (ALL)Allstate Insurance officeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comOne of the glaring opportunities among undervalued large-cap stocks to buy is insurance giant Allstate (NYSE:ALL). To be sure, the insurance industry isn’t exactly making friends right now. From pulling back in coverage for certain locales to hiking their premiums, households and I’m sure businesses have cried foul. However, what are they going to do? Everybody else is doing the same, from the behemoths to the smaller outfits.Put another way, Allstate benefits from a captive audience. And to a limited degree, it features shades of a natural monopoly. While competition can always arise, it’s difficult to break into this arena. Therefore, investors may want to take advantage of its sales multiple of only 0.51X. In contrast, the sector median clocks in at 0.97x.Even with the undervalued profile, Allstate features a three-year revenue growth rate of 14.2%, beating out 82% of its peers. Yes, institutional investors appear to have bought many puts. But once they expire on Oct. 20, it’s possible that ALL could swing higher. Analysts seem encouraged, pegging ALL a moderate buy with a $126.42 price target, implying 19% upside.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The French sugar beet crop area fell to a 14-year low this year.Story continuesEuropean sugar was trading at 915 euros ($983.17) per ton on July 2023, the most recent EU data showed, up 57% on the previous year and twice the price recorded in July 2021.""We must be careful not to fall into the opposite extreme,"" Franck Sander, chairman of French sugar beet union CGB, told Reuters, warning that a rise in area could make EU prices slump.""A turnaround could happen very quickly, prices could fall 30%, especially since there are large supplies in Ukraine.""Saint Louis Sucre closed two factories in 2019 as part of a wider restructuring plan at Suedzucker, Europe’s largest sugar refiner.

55,25df280e-e960-3a67-8d79-24a8615ceb26,ZTS,2023-09-18,Is Zoetis (NYSE:ZTS) Using Too Much Debt?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zoetis-nyse-zts-using-too-110026919.html,1695034826,STORY,"['ZTS', 'BRK-A']","[The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We note that Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) does have debt on its balance sheet. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.What Risk Does Debt Bring?Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for Zoetis What Is Zoetis's Debt?The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Zoetis had US$6.59b in debt in June 2023; about the same as the year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$1.72b, its net debt is less, at about US$4.87b.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Zoetis' LiabilitiesThe latest balance sheet data shows that Zoetis had liabilities of US$1.77b due within a year, and liabilities of US$7.36b falling due after that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$1.72b and US$1.32b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities total US$6.09b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.Of course, Zoetis has a titanic market capitalization of US$83.0b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse.Story continuesWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.Zoetis's net debt is only 1.4 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 21.8 times over. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. The good news is that Zoetis has increased its EBIT by 4.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Zoetis can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Zoetis recorded free cash flow worth 52% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.Our ViewZoetis's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And we also thought its net debt to EBITDA was a positive. When we consider the range of factors above, it looks like Zoetis is pretty sensible with its use of debt. While that brings some risk, it can also enhance returns for shareholders. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Zoetis   you should know about.If you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet.Have feedback on this article?

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Undervalued Stocks To Buy Now.Much has been said and will be said about value investing and the art of picking stocks that are trading below their true value. But legendary value investor Howard Marks has penned some great words of wisdom on this topic that remain unprecedented. His book entitled “The Most Important Thing” needs more attention, especially during volatile times of today when investors are scrambling to make sense of the stock market movements.A chapter in Marks’ book entitled “The Most Important Thing is … Value” talks in detail about different approaches to investing. Marks shows us the cracks and weaknesses of technical analysis-based investing techniques and why momentum investing and analyzing a stock based on its past trends is not the right approach. While Marks vehemently rejects any kind of conjecture or speculation and touts the usefulness of value investing, he acknowledges that value investing also gives importance to taking into account the future when it comes to stock analysis. He says:“It would be convenient to say that adherence to value investing permits investors to avoid conjecture about the future and that growth investing con sists only of conjecture about the future, but that would be a considerable exaggeration. After all, establishing the current value of a business requires an opinion regarding its future, and that in turn must take into account the likely macro-economic environment, competitive developments and technological advances. Even a promising net-net investment can be doomed if the company’s assets are squandered on money-losing operations or un- wise acquisitions. There’s no bright-line distinction between value and growth; both re- quire us to deal with the future. Value investors think about the company’s potential for growth, and the “growth at a reasonable price” school pays explicit homage to value. It’s all a matter of degree. However, I think it can fairly be said that growth investing is about the future, whereas value investing emphasizes current-day considerations but can’t escape dealing with the future.”Story continuesMarks also emphasizes in the book about appreciating the role of luck and randomness and builds upon the ideas of Nassim Nicholas Taleb who discussed the matters of luck in his famous book Fooled by Randomness. Marks’ intention behind this chapter is to highlight the importance of having long-term outlook while investing. Making $1 million playing Russian roulette is not same as making $1 million through several years of patient investing. Even a terrible financial advisor could get lucky and post huge returns in a month or a year but that would only be by sheer luck and this advisor might feel good for a few months but he would ultimately be exposed. That’s why investors should not be fooled by short-term news cycles if they truly want to invest in companies that have intrinsic value.Best Undervalued Stocks to BuyHoward Marks of Oaktree Capital ManagementOur MethodologyFor this article we surveyed at least 15 credible financial websites and picked 14 stocks that these websites believe are undervalued.

So this also will support the continuous strength of these other parts of the business — other regions, as you mentioned. And then finally, the execution in this region has been stepping up because we explained that as the recovery from the pandemic progress, our ability to execute in the post-pandemic world has been developed and is getting better and better month after month.So in the regions which have been faster in the post-pandemic development, we have been faster in recovering great execution and great results, so this will continue to progress in 2024. So we have good confidence on that. On the U.S. where, on the contrary, we said there is work to be done, the team is very focused on doing this work. We have a very clear plan.

Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) is taking a hit after S&amp;P Global Ratings downgraded it amid large deposit outflows and higher for longer rates.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 46 hedge funds out of the 910 funds in Insider Monkey’s database had stakes in Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA).Third Avenue Value Fund made the following comment about Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“The largest detractors from Fund performance during the quarter included two banks, Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) and Deutsche Bank. As it relates to the Fund specifically, events within U.S. banking applied most directly to our investment in Comerica, a U.S. super-regional that does have a large portion of corporate deposits and is not classified as a globally systemically important bank (“G-SIB”), which means it has not recognized certain mark-to-market securities losses in its regulatory capital. Comerica was a 2.6% position at the beginning of the quarter, prior to a roughly 34% stock price decline during the quarter. After purchasing more shares following the stock price decline, the Fund’s position in Comerica was approximately 2.3% at quarter end. While the general contagion fears and bank depositor behavior remain a fluid situation today, we took some confidence from immediate, forceful and targeted actions by the Fed, FDIC and Treasury. In our view, the Fed’s Bank Term Funding Program (“BTFP”) seems a well-tailored and appropriate near-term liquidity solution that allows banks to obtain immediate liquidity, collateralized by the par value of securities, to meet any near-term deposit outflows. At the time of this writing, early signs are that the deposit flight from regional banks is calming rapidly and depositor psychology is improving, though this could change. To the extent that calming continues, our suspicion is that there may be very attractive bargains to be had among regional banks. More will be known in the coming days and weeks as information regarding deposit flows emanates post-quarter end. That said, there will remain some mystery around the extent of the bargains on offer because increases in FDIC funding, increases in regulatory capital requirements, more stringent liquidity stress testing, and changes to the list of banks subject to G-SIB regulatory regimes are all on the table now. It is also very likely that deposit costs, which had been rising very slowly, will rise much more rapidly as commercial banks work harder to entice depositors to stay put. None of these developments, if they eventuate, are likely to impact banks’ returns and earnings in a positive way.More broadly, the Third Avenue Value Fund owned investments categorized as financials totaling 15.94% by weight, at quarter end. This category includes non-bank financials such as Old Republic, a U.S. property and casualty insurer and title insurance business, Lazard, an advisory business and asset management firm, and Ashmore, a U.K. asset management firm specializing in emerging markets credit. The Fund’s actual bank exposure at quarter end totaled 9.52% and is comprised of Bank of Ireland, Deutsche Bank and Comerica, in order of position size…” (Click here to read the full text)9.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at Patterson Companies (NASDAQ:PDCO) so let's look a bit deeper.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Patterson Companies, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.16 = US$289m ÷ (US$2.9b - US$1.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).Thus, Patterson Companies has an ROCE of 16%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 9.5% generated by the Healthcare industry. Check out our latest analysis for Patterson Companies roceIn the above chart we have measured Patterson Companies' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Patterson Companies.The Trend Of ROCEPatterson Companies has not disappointed in regards to ROCE growth. We found that the returns on capital employed over the last five years have risen by 95%. That's not bad because this tells for every dollar invested (capital employed), the company is increasing the amount earned from that dollar. Interestingly, the business may be becoming more efficient because it's applying 24% less capital than it was five years ago. If this trend continues, the business might be getting more efficient but it's shrinking in terms of total assets.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Patterson Companies' ROCEIn a nutshell, we're pleased to see that Patterson Companies has been able to generate higher returns from less capital. Since the stock has only returned 39% to shareholders over the last five years, the promising fundamentals may not be recognized yet by investors. So exploring more about this stock could uncover a good opportunity, if the valuation and other metrics stack up.If you want to know some of the risks facing Patterson Companies we've found 3 warning signs (2 don't sit too well with us!) that you should be aware of before investing here.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

58,3b8e9737-2097-37c3-b865-7617e632a49a,SPGI,2023-09-18,CARFAX DATA: AUTUMN IS THE MOST DANGEROUS SEASON FOR AUTO ACCIDENT DAMAGE IN U.S.,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/carfax-data-autumn-most-dangerous-120000355.html,1695038400,STORY,['SPGI'],"[Most U.S. States Have More Auto Accidents in Fall Than In Any Other SeasonCENTREVILLE, Va., Sept. 18, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Tens of millions of U.S. drivers are heading this week directly into Danger Season – the time when auto crashes occur most often where they live, CARFAX data shows. Although many might assume that Winter is the most accident-prone season, more than 72% of U.S. drivers – roughly 170 million – live in states where Fall is the peak season for accident damage.This CARFAX map details the season with the most accidents for each state. Note: There is not enough data for Hawaii and OregonWhy does Fall have so many accidents? Experts call out these reasons:Diminishing Daylight: Fall means shorter days, and that means more driving in the dark, when drivers are twice as likely to have an accident as in daylight. Half of U.S. accidents happen in the dark, but those hours account for only 25 percent of travel.Slick Surfaces: Wet leaves brought down by storms can be as slippery as ice. Braking on wet leaves can make a car travel more than twice as far as braking on a dry road.Deer Danger: Mating season for deer runs from October through December, and nearly half of deer crashes nationwide happen in just those three months. In addition, one study notes that deer-car collisions spike 16% in the week after the end of Daylight Saving Time in November because of the jump to an earlier sunset.""CARFAX has the most accident and damage information, and sometimes that data can be surprising,"" said Faisal Hasan, General Manager for Data at CARFAX. ""The change of seasons is a good time for drivers to see if any new recalls have been issued for their car."" Consumers can check on unfixed recalls – for free – at carfax.com/recall.That doesn't mean Winter isn't dangerous: 23% of drivers live in states where Winter is worst for accidents. Those states are California, Florida, New Jersey, Louisiana and Vermont, and they have a combined 54 million drivers. A few states stand out because they don't follow these patterns: For drivers in Nebraska and Oklahoma, Spring is the most dangerous season, and New Mexico drivers have the most accidents in Summer.Story continuesDrivers can prepare themselves by taking these steps:SLOW DOWN: Speed is often a key factor in accidents in any season, and inclement situations make driving even more dangerous. Give other drivers –and yourself – space. That will give you a little extra time to handle sudden developments.Keep a constant eye on your car's maintenance:Check tire pressure: Sudden temp drops make tires lose air quickly. Don't wait for a Tire Pressure Monitoring System alert; check tire pressure monthly.Put on winter tires: Cold weather can harden the rubber in standard tires, hurting traction. If you live in a frigid area, winter tires with special rubber compounds and tread patterns may be wise.Check your car's battery: Cold weather reduces a battery's power, and it could fail. If your mechanic finds that your battery is weak, have a new one installed.Check wiper fluid level: Slush from the road can be kicked up onto your windshield, making it hard to see. Carry an extra gallon in cold-weather months.Check wiper blades: If the rubber has cracked, your wipers may leave streaks. Wipe them down with Windex. If that doesn't work, install new blades.Use Carfax Car Care to track your car's service history: Make sure you get alerts for oil changes, brake pad replacement or tire treadwear. And get it all for free.Pack a winter survival kit: Be ready if you wind up stranded. A kit should have water, a blanket, an ice scraper, durable food items, road flares, a phone charger, a flashlight and first-aid supplies. Keep this kit in the car at all times.Editor's note: Interviews with an expert from CARFAX are available at any time.

Wei warned that a boom in artificial intelligence development was unlikely to offset a broader, cyclical slowdown in the industry.TSMC’s Taiwan-listed shares fell more than 3%, while South Korean memory chip makers SK Hynix Inc (KS:000660) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS:005930) lost more than 2% each.Shares of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (HK:0981), China’s biggest chipmaker, fell 3% in Hong Kong trade, while peer Hua Hong Semiconductor Ltd (HK:1347) lost 1.6%. The two spurred an over 1% loss in the Hang Seng index.Major chipmakers were reeling from a substantial decline in demand over the past year, amid surging interest rates and slowing investment in technology infrastructure.While a boom in AI development has fueled some chip demand this year, particularly for specialised manufacturers such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), most Asian players have warned that broader demand is likely to remain muted. Declining computer and mobile phone sales around the globe have furthered this notion.TSMC had logged profit and revenue declines for the first half of the year, as did Samsung and SK Hynix. The drop in earnings also came from rampant oversupply, as a chip demand boom through 2020 and 2021 saw manufacturers ramp up their production capacity.TSMC is struggling with delays in the development of a $40 billion facility in Arizona, which analysts warn could be a loss-making venture for the chipmaker, even if the facility comes online.The chipmaking giant forecast a 10% decline in sales through 2023, and also expects a weaker operating margin for the third quarter.

Never miss another market-moving alert.Softbank's Arm HoldingsChip design unit Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) saw a heavily oversubscribed IPO in US markets Thursday, with its valuation also racing past initial projections.Shares of Arm, a unit of Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank (TYO:9984) (OTC:SFTBY), surged some 25% to $63.59 on their first day of trade in the US, making for about a $65 billion market cap - far higher than the $54B valuation projected in the offering.Gains spilled over into Softbank's Tokyo shares Friday, which closed the session up 2.1% to 6,718 yen. In New York, Softbank ADRs ticked 0.9% higher on Thursday before retreating 2.4% on Friday. Softbank retains 90% ownership of the company.The Arm debut is the year's biggest, and saw many of the chip designer’s biggest clients participating as cornerstone investors. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) were among the biggest investors in the firm.Arm’s listing marks the close of a long-running attempt by Softbank to cash out on the chip designer. The conglomerate had agreed to sell Arm to Nvidia for $40B in 2021, although the plan was scuttled due to regulatory hurdles.Demand for Arm’s IPO was also largely underpinned by growing optimism over an AI boom this year, which chipmakers such as Nvidia predict will fuel a major bump in chip demand over the coming years.Apple iPhones titaniumApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) launched its iPhone 15 and 15 Plus models last Tuesday, as well as the higher-end iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max.Apple also unveiled new Apple Watch constructed with 95% titanium and boasting 72 hours of battery life.Story continuesThe Pro Max - the most expensive of the new iPhones - went on sale for pre-orders on Friday, and initial delivery times for the model slipped into October, according to Bloomberg, suggesting strong demand.The potentially strong demand is a positive for investors, with concerns emerging in recent weeks regarding overall iPhone demand, particularly regarding the consumer appetite for Apple iPhones in China following the launch of Huawei's new smartphone.Following the event, Morgan Stanley noted that China risk ""continues to dominate investor conversations,"" but added, ""We still believe there is upside to FY24 expectations.”Goldman Sachs, for its part, said:“Although the product announcements and key features were largely as expected, price increases on iPhone were lower-than-expected… We're encouraged by Apple's continued investments into the Apple ecosystem and US carrier promotions for the iPhone continue to be supportive of demand.”Shares of Apple slipped 2.9% for the week to $175.01.Qualcomm signs with AppleA day earlier, and in other Apple-related news, Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) said that it had secured an agreement to provide its high-end chips for Apple iPhones to be launched from 2024 through 2026Shares in the chipmaker jumped nearly 4% on the announcement.After the announcement, Deutsche Bank maintained its a Hold rating and $120.00 price target on Qualcomm, noting that the development is ""clearly a positive for QCOM, with eventual AAPL loss now not expected until 2026 at the earliest (vs. prior expectations of 2024).""The analysts said the estimate the total associated opportunity to come to some $9B a year.""Overall, this announcement highlights the true value QCOM’s superior technology, and we agree the stock should rise in response,"" said Deutsche, while adding that they are reiterating the Hold rating in part due to ""ongoing pressures in the total smartphone market and the potential for only incremental opex improvements now that AAPL biz must be maintained.""Shares ended 1.7% higher for the week.Oracle revenueOracle (NYSE:ORCL) shares plunged more than 13% on Tuesday after management offered a weak outlook for the second quarter on its fiscal first-quarter earnings call.Q1 results beat analysts' forecasts, reporting earnings per share of $1.19 vs. the expected $1.15 and $12.45B in sales, given boosted demand for cloud services amid an ongoing push to develop generative AI apps.But on the call, Oracle said it sees total revenue growing 5% to 7% at today's currency rates and 3% to 5% in constant currency. Cloud revenue is seen growing at 28% in constant currency, below the 29% reported for Q1. Oracle attributed the soft cloud outlook to the accelerated transition of its Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN) unit to the cloud.Adjusted EPS is seen at $1.29 (up or down 2 cents), above the $1.25 consensus.Goldman Sachs said the company's Q2 outlook ""fell short of lofty expectations.""""While the print/guide is unlikely to dissuade bulls, we see the current risk/reward skew as balanced in lieu of upside to near-term expects given an already demanding valuation profile,"" Rangan wrote in a note.For Guggenheim, however, the Oracle bullish thesis remains intact:""We see little risk in achieving F2Q goals, especially given the $1.5B in bookings in the first week of the quarter. Do these results change our thesis on ORCL? No. We continue to believe that the three legs of growth either still have much to go (SaaS), are at a very early stage (OCI), or are only just beginning (On Prem database migration to the Cloud). We reiterate ORCL as Buy rated and our Best Idea.""Shares ended the week at $113.91, down more than 10% for the five sessions.Tesla upgradedTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) soared 10% Monday on word of an upgrade to Overweight from Morgan Stanley, whose analysts said the stock can surge thanks to its Dojo Supercomputer.Tesla stock is also a new Top Pick at Morgan Stanley with a price target of $400 per share, a new Street high.The analysts wrote in a new to clients that the company's ""advanced supercomputing architecture... pushes new boundaries in custom silicon and may put Tesla at an asymmetric advantage in a $10trn TAM.""The analysts liken Tesla to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) after the e-commerce titan’s AWS was able to reach 70% of the company’s total earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), and says Dojo can add up to $500B to Tesla's enterprise value.Tesla created Dojo, a dedicated supercomputer, to enhance and train its Full Self-Driving (FSD) system. Tesla's vehicles are equipped with numerous sensors and must make critical real-time decisions in unpredictable driving conditions.“While it is difficult to explicitly validate the many claims Tesla has made about Dojo's cost and performance, we believe Tesla has a chance of bringing forth a competitive customized solution given the company's innovation track record and capabilities,” Morgan Stanley further noted.Year to date, Tesla shares are up over 150% to $274.39.Sam Boughedda, Yasin Ebrahim, Senad Karaahmetovic, and Ambar Warrick contributed to this report.Related ArticlesArm's grand debut, glee for Tesla's dojo, Oracle's dour news: Weekly tech roundupSingtel sells 20% stake in data center business to KKR for $807 millionZaggle Prepaid Ocean Services IPO concludes with 1.18 times subscription]"

He thinks NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the “poster child” of this “imbalance.”“From the bottom of the market last October to where NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s peaked out over the course of the last month or so, the stock has gone up by a multiple of five times. From a valuation perspective, they're trading at something like 40 times forward revenues and 130 times forward revenues and 130 times forward earnings. That, in our view, is excessive, and it's reminiscent of what the tech stocks did in that fourth quarter of 1999 as we were going into the Y2K calendar changeover.”Orlando said that tech companies like Apple and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) are “phenomenal” but amid the expected correction and pullback he’d rather invest in these companies later at cheaper prices. For now, Orlando thinks the market correction would open up new opportunities in value and small-cap stocks.Story continuesDespite warnings of a market correction, there are some stocks which still have huge upside potential according to experts. In this article we decided to talk about some of these stocks.Best NASDAQ Stocks with Biggest UpsidePhoto by Pascal Bernardon on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we conducted a survey of mainstream financial media and checked over 10 credible financial websites to see which NASDAQ stocks have potential to grow in the coming weeks and months according to these websites.

So, we expect that to be there over the next few years on the gross margin optimization also. And then, the macro trend of sustainability products is something that you add to that as it scales in the future. We’ve talked about our core product quite a bit with you all. The amount of volumes, we’re seeing there and the margins have been continuing to grow. And now we have the possibility with hourly CFE, carbon-free energy matching to look at the next wave of sustainability products to get our customers signed up for longer terms and for decent margins.So, we’re feeling good about the sustainability environment, and it really does start with the balance sheet.

(NASDAQ:ABNB) CEO talked about how AI and generative AI applications could be of use for the company:""First of all, when you call a hotel, they’re usually one property and they’re aware of every room. We’re nearly every country in the world. Often guest host will call us, and they will even potentially speak a different language than the person on the other side, the host, the guest and host. There are nearly 70 different policies that you could be adjudicating. Many of these are 100 pages long. So imagine a customer service agent trying to quickly deal with an issue with somebody from two people from two different countries in a neighborhood that the agent may never even have heard of.What AI can do, and we’re using a pilot to GPT-4, is AI can read all their policies. No human can ever quickly read all those policies. It can read the case history of both guests and hosts. It could summarize the case issue, and it can even recommend what the ruling should be based on our policies, and it can then write a macro that the customer service agent can basically adopt and amend. If we get all this right, it’s going to do things. And in your term, it’s going to actually make customer service a lot more effective, because agents will actually be able to handle a lot more tickets than many tickets. You’ll never even have to talk to an agent, but also the service to be more reliable, which will unlock more growth. Now, this of course leads to the bigger question.What can we do with AI? And I just wanted to offer a minute or two of thoughts, and I’ve shared this ...[Read the detailed transcript of the call here.]7. QUALCOMM, Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73QUALCOMM, Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is under pressure after the company gave weak Q4 guidance.

We meaningfully added to our investment in Booking in the middle of 2022 when the market was overly focused on disruptions to travel in Europe caused by airport understaffing and other COVID-19 induced inefficiencies, as well as concerns that an economic downturn would materially reduce discretionary travel. Since then, the travel environment has continued to normalise, with China being the last major market to open travel borders post COVID-19. People the world over have demonstrated their ongoing desire to travel, an industry that has historically grown significantly faster than GDP growth. Management has continued to execute a well-planned strategy to increase connections with customers booking accommodation, including offering flights, on ground transport, activities and payment options. After increasing over 20% in the December 2022 quarter, Booking’s share price increased a further 30%+ during the March 2023 quarter. Booking is now trading within our assessed view of fair value. We retain confidence that management will continue to deliver returns to shareholders and Booking remains one of the Fund’s largest holdings.” Click to continue reading and see 5 NASDAQ Stocks with Biggest Upside. Suggested articles:10 Best Dividend ETFs10 Worst Performing Commodity ETFs in 202310 Best Performing Asia Pacific ETFs in 2023Disclosure: None. 10 NASDAQ Stocks with Biggest Upside is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. However, after investigating WEC Energy Group (NYSE:WEC), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for WEC Energy Group:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.05 = US$2.0b ÷ (US$43b - US$4.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).So, WEC Energy Group has an ROCE of 5.0%.  Even though it's in line with the industry average of 5.0%, it's still a low return by itself. View our latest analysis for WEC Energy Group roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for WEC Energy Group compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering WEC Energy Group here  for free.So How Is WEC Energy Group's ROCE Trending?In terms of WEC Energy Group's historical ROCE trend, it doesn't exactly demand attention. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 5.0% and the business has deployed 35% more capital into its operations. Given the company has increased the amount of capital employed, it appears the investments that have been made simply don't provide a high return on capital.The Bottom LineIn conclusion, WEC Energy Group has been investing more capital into the business, but returns on that capital haven't increased. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 49% over the last five years. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.Story continuesOn a final note, we found  2 warning signs for WEC Energy Group (1 shouldn't be ignored)  you should be aware of.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Low Risk Investments in 2023.Investors are still in a wait and see mode after the latest inflation and retail sales report which give mixed signals. Some analysts are still of the view that the US economy could face a recession by the end of this year or in the first half of 2024. Recently, Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson, who has been one of the strongest bearish voices on the Wall Street, warned that the increased US government spending that injected a lot of optimism in the markets would not bode well for US stocks. The analyst said that US has not seen such a high deficit when unemployment is so low.However, Wilson acknowledged that the recession predictions and bearish notes have hitherto been proven false. And Wilson does not think we would necessarily face a full-blown recession. He said that the central bank’s fiscal policies have already ushered in a “down cycle” and he is convinced that growth is slowing.Wisdom Tree in its third quarter of 2023 report said that volatility has become a constant in the market. The firm believes inflation will keep cooling and the Federal Reserve might be near the end of its rate hike cycle. The firm said the central bank might go on an extended pause once it concludes its current rate hike cycle. Wisdom Tree rules out any possibility of rate cuts this year but believes that topic could gain more relevance in the first half of 2024. Wisdom Tree also talked about the AI rally that gave a huge boost to many stocks. The firm believes this hype could subside as investors’ excitement around AI abates slowly. Wisdom Tree is concerned that some parts of the market are trading on hype.The Wisdom Tree report said that while the bull market started back in October 2022, stock valuations are still attractive.“The value cycle turns out to be just a value trade—a shorter term run for dividend concepts that ended last autumn. Additionally, continued levitation from zero-yielding Silicon Valley giants would be troublesome. This year has been horrible for value-oriented mandates, along with most everything that was not mega cap growth. Stocks that can demonstrate durable profitability and reasonable valuations were the type that held up during the 2022 sell-off; we suspect they are opportune in 2023’s second half,” the report said.Story continuesTime and again successful investors have emphasized the importance of not losing money while investing in the stock market. When markets are volatile you have to find high conviction, low risk plays that are insulated from market crashes. David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital talked about the importance of finding high conviction plays and going all in in an interview in 2005. He said:“We believe in constructing the portfolio so that we put our biggest amount of money in our highest-conviction idea, and then we view the other ideas relative to that. We find things that we think are exceptional only occasionally. So if we find some- thing that is really set up, where we think it’s mispriced, where we have a good understanding of why it’s mispriced, where we think the mispricing is very large and the overall risk is very small, we take an outsized position to make sure we give ourselves the chance to be well compensated for getting it right.""Best Low Risk Investments in 2023Photo by Marga Santoso on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we first used a stock screener to identify US stocks with beta values less than 1. Beta value of less than 1 shows low risk and low volatility. After applying this check we got a long list of stocks, from which we selected 17 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. We gauged hedge fund sentiment for these stocks using Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds. These are the best low risk investments in the stock market in 2023 according to hedge funds. Almost all of these stocks are safe, and reliable and are not highly affected by market volatility.Best Low Risk Investments in 202317. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74With consistent dividend increases and a defensive and recession-proof business, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is one of the best low risk investments in the stock market in 2023.Last month, Jefferies updated its 'Uber Crowded' portfolio which includes companies that are popular among Long Only &amp; Hedge Fund investors. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) was one of the notable stocks in this portfolio. 74 hedge funds out of the 910 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database had stakes in The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).16. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 78Merck ranks 16th in our list of the best low risk investments in 2023. With over a decade of consistent dividend hikes and a robust pipeline of drugs MRK has upside potential.Last month, the company said the European Commission approved its anti-PD-1 therapy Keytruda as part of a combination regimen to treat gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma as a first-line option.Carillon Eagle Growth &amp; Income Fund made the following comment about Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) presented positive clinical data for a new drug in its oncology pipeline, announced an acquisition that was viewed favorably by investors, and reported strong first-quarter financial results while also increasing its earnings guidance for 2023.15. Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 78Data monitoring and security platform company Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) ranks 15th in our list of the best low risk investments in 2023. As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 78 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG).In August, T.D. Cowen started covering Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) with an Outperform rating. The firm’s analyst Andrew Sherman set a $120 price target on Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG).RiverPark Large Growth Fund made the following comment about Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG): DDOG was a top detractor in the quarter. The company reported strong 4Q results including 44% revenue growth and 30% earnings growth but gave cautious revenue guidance for 2023. Macroeconomic headwinds have caused clients to slow the transition of workloads to the cloud and instead to optimize current capacity. Despite this temporary slowdown, DDOG still expects revenue to grow nearly 25% in 2023.As businesses have transitioned to cloud software infrastructure, much of which is in isolated data silos, it has become increasingly difficult for data engineers to monitor and analyze system performance. Datadog provides a SaaS software platform to monitor and analyze the system performance of software applications and IT infrastructure by giving users a single page view to observe their company’s technology stack. The company has quickly grown its revenue from $100 million in 2017 to $1.7 billion in 2022 and, we believe, should continue to grow revenue at more than 20% annually as it penetrates its $40 billion and fast-growing market. Less than 10% of software applications are currently monitored. The company’s dollar-based net retention rate has been 130%+ as existing customers continue to use an increasing number of products and the company continues to add new features. As of 4Q22, 81% of customers used 2+ products, while only 18% of customers used 6+ products (up from less than 1% two years ago). As an extremely capex light software business, DDOG already has significant free-cash-flow ($350m in 2022) and free-cash-flow margins (21% in 2022).”14. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 81The biggest retailer in the US, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) remains the dominant player in the industry despite consumer headwinds and inflation challenges.

The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) shares have retreated amid a broader banking crisis earlier this year but analysts believe the stock might be a good buy on the dip. In August The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) said it was planning on layoffs and cost cuts to streamline its operations.ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy made the following comment about The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“We have done so recently with The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), which got caught up in investor concerns over regional banks, due to the perception of an asset/liability mismatch on Schwab’s balance sheet. While there are similarities with regional banks, Schwab has minimal credit risk and far higher organic growth than traditional banks. In addition, Schwab’s mostly retail customers are not pulling money out of its ecosystem. On the contrary, the company continues to grow client assets at a mid-single-digit percentage rate despite the banking selloff. Concerned over interest rate risk, we trimmed our position last year and earlier this year. As the stock pulled back this spring, we added back aggressively. It remains an exceptionally strong franchise in terms of asset gathering and customer loyalty and runs a unique business model that continues to attract client assets; we are pleased to have the opportunity to express our differentiated view.”9.

For the diagnostics business, Danaher offers instruments to run clinical tests in large core labs, hospitals, and pathology labs and at the point of care. Shares declined 4.7% during the quarter after the company cut its fiscal year 2023 guidance due to headwinds within its bioprocessing segment, as biopharmaceutical customers burned through existing inventory and smaller biotechnology firms faced funding constraints. We remain positive on Danaher’s long-term trajectory. Danaher benefits from a market-leading position and broad portfolio within bioprocessing, which addresses a biologics market that is growing by double digits, and which we expect to benefit in the near and medium term from a wave of biosimilars entering the market after key patents expire. Danaher has a collection of high-quality assets, with targets of high single-digit core revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth.”7. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

72,1be08df2-8b87-3e7e-8075-fca193ac284c,SO,2023-09-18,7 Oversold Utilities Stocks to Snap Up Before Bond Yields Fall,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-oversold-utilities-stocks-snap-110052154.html,1694516452,STORY,"['NEE', 'D', 'CWEN-A', 'SO', 'IDA']","[It hasn’t been a great year for finding the best utilities stocks to buy.It has been the sector laggard of the S&amp;P 500 which has grown more swiftly than many expected. That’s a consequence of the explosive growth of AI and a story for another time. The point is, that there’s a contrarian opportunity available in utilities. Investors tend to flock toward utilities firms for their income. The best utilities stocks to buy provide dividends that equate to reliable growth, making them attractive despite the staid nature of the sector. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHowever, high bond yields in 2023 have made them much less attractive. Investors have exited the utilities sector in favor of those higher bond yields. Rates are flattening though, making the utilities sector again one to look at. Also, don’t discount the defensive nature of the sector either. A languishing tech sector will push utilities higher, so these are the best utilities stocks to buy now. Dominion (D) The logo for Dominion Energy (D) is seen at the top of an office building.Source: Felix Mizioznikov / Shutterstock.comDominion (NYSE:D) is now more heavily concentrated in electricity, after selling several of its natural gas businesses to Enbridge (NYSE:ENB) on Sept. 5 for $9.4 billion. The sale should make Dominion one of the more attractive utilities stocks to buy for several reasons. Demand for natural gas is falling as regulators continue to curb its use. It was likely a good decision to jettison the business and redirect the proceeds toward businesses with brighter outlooks. Two, Dominion is now more concentrated in an electricity sector that should see higher prices as EVs and data center-driven demand for electricity increases. Dominion shares include a relatively high-yield dividend that was last reduced only a few years ago. There’s a lot of potential for Dominion to move upward following the sale and increasing concerns over tech at the moment. Clearway Energy (CWEN)the clearway energy (CWEN) logo on a web browser under a magnifying glassSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comStory continuesClearway Energy (NYSE:CWEN) is a renewable energy provider with a massive footprint within the space. That footprint includes owning solar, wind and natural gas operations. The firm owns and operates more than 8 gigawatts of assets. 5.7 gigawatts of which is renewables that offset more than 10.5 million metric tons of carbon emissions annually. Clearway Energy is risky. That risk is clear because its revenue generation is volatile. Low wind production in Q2 negatively affected the firm’s performance during the period. However, the firm signaled its belief in the business line with agreements to invest in more wind farm projects. The firm also lowered guidance for the remainder of 2023 in the earnings. Yet, Clearway Energy continues to pay a dividend above 6% with the stated intent to continue to do so through 2026. Thus, the income opportunity makes it attractive and the muted sector prices continue to have rebound potential. IDACORP (IDA) A hydroelectric power plant operates in a river with large waves crashing against the side.Source: Vasiliy Koval / Shutterstock.comIDACORP (NYSE:IDA) is not one of the best-known utilities stocks to buy overall. The Idaho-based utility provides hydroelectricity to its customers and has been doing so for over a century. It also is growing steadily while simultaneously unappreciated and oversold. That’s a nice combination for investors. Income increased by $4.3 million in Q2 and by more than $14 million in H1 as the company added 13 thousand customers in the most recent quarter. That growth allowed the company to reaffirm previous guidance for the rest of 2023. It suggests that IDACORP will be very steady through 2023 and unlikely to produce any negative surprises. There’s $20 of upside beyond its current $94 price and a healthy dividend yielding 3.3%. Outside of unpredictable weather, there’s little that could make IDA shares move downward in the foreseeable future. It’s a very steady investment that only lacks in that it’s simply not particularly well known overall. That should change as bond yields fall and things normalize. NextEra Energy (NEE) Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screenSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) stock looks very attractive as attention swings back toward an oversold utilities sector. The company includes the largest electric utility in Florida Power &amp; Light Company. The other part of the business is the world’s largest wind and solar producer, NextEra Energy Resources. That combination of strengths has made NEE stock one of the more salient firms in the utilities sector, especially regarding its renewables footprint. The opportunity is obvious: There’s 33% upside accounted for in share prices and an additional 2.8% through dividends. The firm’s fundamentals are sound with revenues and earnings growth that are both very respectable. The firm’s renewables business now provides more revenue than does its electricity utilities business. Both are in a strong position. The opportunity in renewables isn’t waning. Electricity demand is expected to increase too as factors like EV demand and data center proliferation raise usage. The combination should mean that investors will receive healthy returns from NEE shares moving forward. DTE Energy (DTE)Front entrance of DTE Energy in Michigan.Source: ehrlif / Shutterstock.comDTE Energy (NYSE:DTE) is a diversified utility based in Michigan. It provides electricity to 2.3 million people and provides natural gas to 1.3 million more customers. The firm’s shares have steadily trended downward in 2023 while Wall Street continues to favor them. The average stock price target for the firm is approximately $124. They currently trade for a price of $102. The dividend yield is approaching 4% so there’s a lot to like. It’s arguable that DTE has trended down because of sector pressure alone. Q2 earnings reached $201 million, up from $171 million a year earlier. The company isn’t doing poorly. However, factors like bond yields make the income opportunity at DTE less attractive than they would otherwise be in a more predictable environment. The company definitely offers a lot to investors and its renewables investment makes it more marketable besides the other strengths listed above. Southern Co. (SO)the southern company logo displayed several times on a screenSource: 360b / Shutterstock.comSouthern Co. (NYSE:SO) stock has swung from the mid $70s to the mid $60s several times this year. It’s now back in the mid $60s again. Wall Street expects shares to rise again to the mid-70s. Include the dividend yielding above 4% and SO shares become pretty sweet without a lot of risk overall. One of the biggest risks for the utilities sector is unpredictable weather. A mild season in the Atlanta market that Southern Co. serves can cost the firm. That’s precisely what happened in Q2. The weather was unseasonably mild and people used their AC less. Southern Co.’s revenues fell from $7.2 billion to $5.7 billion. Net income fell from $1.1 billion to $838 million. Still, SO shares suffered little. Investors should buy those shares. The region is growing and the utilities sector has been oversold. Public Service Energy Group (PEG)telephone poles and power lines with sunset as backdropSource: ShutterstockPublic Service Energy Group (NYSE:PEG) is a highly profitable multi-utilities stock worth snapping up right now. The firm’s margins are all in the top 10-15% relative to its peers. That’s a clear indication that the company is well run and the margins alone arguably make it investment worthy. Public Service Energy Group is also incredibly steady. Earnings are at or slightly above expectations for the last several quarters. However, it’s also likely easy money for investors at present. Shares have 10% upside and the dividend yields nearly 4%. That’s a nice return that’s highly likely to materializeThe company recently reaffirmed its 2023 earnings forecast. That suggests that forecasts from Wall Street regarding share prices are likely to become reality. Investors should pivot back into utilities for all of the reasons explained earlier. It all means PEG shares make sense at the moment. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

They cited some credit deterioration, savings declines, and spending slowdowns.Fifth Third CEO Timothy Spence said checking account data at his Cincinnati-based bank show financial difficulties for lower-income customers are more pronounced for people who don’t own their homes.“Renters with lower incomes are essentially back to or below pre-pandemic levels of liquidity. There is no buffer left there,” Spence said Wednesday at a Barclays banking conference in New York.The strength of the US consumer is a subject of debate across the financial world at a time when economic data has been coming in largely stronger than expected despite the Federal Reserve's interest rate hiking campaign as the central bank seeks to cool inflation.Thus far the consumer has been relatively resilient and there is data even suggesting low-income consumer spending has held up better than spending among those with higher incomes. But headwinds are mounting as job and wage growth slow, student loan payments restart, and borrowing conditions tighten.That could all spell some trouble for banks that have been leaning heavily on consumer lending in recent quarters as companies turn more cautious about the economy. Credit card delinquencies have been steadily rising since 2021, according to Fed data, a steeper climb than any point since 2009 after dropping to multi-decade lows.“As we sit here today, savings are still, in aggregate, slightly above pre-pandemic levels,” Capital One CFO Andrew Young said this past week.Story continuesOverall savings of his bank’s customers are still slightly above pre-pandemic levels but those with lower incomes “are roughly back” to where they were before the pandemic started. Capital One is a major credit card lender.Still, though, these consumers are “in a position of strength,” he explained.Dean Athanasia, Bank of America’s president of regional banking, said consumers still have excess cash in bank accounts that they will continue to spend down through the rest of the year.“It's a slow travel down on the consumer side,” he said.A Bank of America branch. (Getty Images) (Oksana Drobotun via Getty Images)Mike Mayo, a bank analyst for Wells Fargo, said the largest banks have already set aside money for loan losses in a potential scenario where the unemployment rate reaches 5%. It was 3.8% in August, up from 3.6%.Over the next couple of years Mayo still anticipates loan losses at the banks he covers “almost doubling” though historically still remaining “below the long-term average.”Banks are starting to pull away from making as many new consumer loans as they have in the past, especially those deemed riskiest.Another top banker who urged caution about the future strength of the US consumer this past week was Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase (JPM). He cited the possibility of a prolonged period of high interest rates, rising costs of oil, economic uncertainties facing China, and global fiscal debt.“We don’t know the full effect of what all of this is going to be 12 or 18 months from now,” he said.The consumer at the moment is “pretty good” but “to say the consumer is strong today, meaning you’re going to have a booming environment for years, is a huge mistake.”Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

A third vaccine from Novavax is also under review.During the last re-vaccination campaign, when most Americans had either already had the COVID virus or been previously vaccinated, only around 56.5 million people got the updated booster shots, according to federal data.But last week, a Reuters/Ipos poll showed that about half of Americans are interested in getting an updated COVID vaccine.Rival Moderna has also said it expects U.S. demand for the shots to reach 50 million to 100 million doses in the fall season.Demand for COVID vaccines has dropped sharply since 2021, when they first became available.Pfizer had said in August it will launch a cost-cutting program if its COVID vaccine and antiviral treatment keep underperforming expectations in the coming months due to plunging demand.At the J.P.Morgan U.S. All Stars Conference, Denton said Pfizer will provide more details on its cost-cutting measures in the second half of the year.""We want to make sure that we're investing appropriately based on our R&amp;D pipeline and the investments that we're making and bets that we made... are aligned to the revenue performance of the company long term,"" said Denton.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Undervalued Stocks To Buy Now.Much has been said and will be said about value investing and the art of picking stocks that are trading below their true value. But legendary value investor Howard Marks has penned some great words of wisdom on this topic that remain unprecedented. His book entitled “The Most Important Thing” needs more attention, especially during volatile times of today when investors are scrambling to make sense of the stock market movements.A chapter in Marks’ book entitled “The Most Important Thing is … Value” talks in detail about different approaches to investing. Marks shows us the cracks and weaknesses of technical analysis-based investing techniques and why momentum investing and analyzing a stock based on its past trends is not the right approach. While Marks vehemently rejects any kind of conjecture or speculation and touts the usefulness of value investing, he acknowledges that value investing also gives importance to taking into account the future when it comes to stock analysis. He says:“It would be convenient to say that adherence to value investing permits investors to avoid conjecture about the future and that growth investing con sists only of conjecture about the future, but that would be a considerable exaggeration. After all, establishing the current value of a business requires an opinion regarding its future, and that in turn must take into account the likely macro-economic environment, competitive developments and technological advances. Even a promising net-net investment can be doomed if the company’s assets are squandered on money-losing operations or un- wise acquisitions. There’s no bright-line distinction between value and growth; both re- quire us to deal with the future. Value investors think about the company’s potential for growth, and the “growth at a reasonable price” school pays explicit homage to value. It’s all a matter of degree. However, I think it can fairly be said that growth investing is about the future, whereas value investing emphasizes current-day considerations but can’t escape dealing with the future.”Story continuesMarks also emphasizes in the book about appreciating the role of luck and randomness and builds upon the ideas of Nassim Nicholas Taleb who discussed the matters of luck in his famous book Fooled by Randomness. Marks’ intention behind this chapter is to highlight the importance of having long-term outlook while investing. Making $1 million playing Russian roulette is not same as making $1 million through several years of patient investing. Even a terrible financial advisor could get lucky and post huge returns in a month or a year but that would only be by sheer luck and this advisor might feel good for a few months but he would ultimately be exposed. That’s why investors should not be fooled by short-term news cycles if they truly want to invest in companies that have intrinsic value.Best Undervalued Stocks to BuyHoward Marks of Oaktree Capital ManagementOur MethodologyFor this article we surveyed at least 15 credible financial websites and picked 14 stocks that these websites believe are undervalued.

And the innovation pipeline for 2024, 2025 is very, very strong. Particularly in 2025, we have some extra wide spaces innovation, which are very promising. So this also will support the continuous strength of these other parts of the business — other regions, as you mentioned. And then finally, the execution in this region has been stepping up because we explained that as the recovery from the pandemic progress, our ability to execute in the post-pandemic world has been developed and is getting better and better month after month.So in the regions which have been faster in the post-pandemic development, we have been faster in recovering great execution and great results, so this will continue to progress in 2024. So we have good confidence on that. On the U.S. where, on the contrary, we said there is work to be done, the team is very focused on doing this work. We have a very clear plan. Again, I summarized them in the prepared remarks, but to go back to them, our strategy in rebuilding the North America growth is really various [indiscernible] four big building blocks.

Estee reduced fiscal 2023 earnings guidance again and pushed the timing of the recovery toward the end of this calendar year. Outside of travel retail, growth was solid in the Americas, Europe, APAC, Emerging Markets and China.”10. Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) ranks 10th in our list of the best undervalued stocks to buy according to the media. Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) is recommended by several financial websites amid its attractive valuation. Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA)’s PE ratio as of September 8 stands at 4.74. Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) is taking a hit after S&amp;P Global Ratings downgraded it amid large deposit outflows and higher for longer rates.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 46 hedge funds out of the 910 funds in Insider Monkey’s database had stakes in Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA).Third Avenue Value Fund made the following comment about Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“The largest detractors from Fund performance during the quarter included two banks, Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) and Deutsche Bank. As it relates to the Fund specifically, events within U.S. banking applied most directly to our investment in Comerica, a U.S. super-regional that does have a large portion of corporate deposits and is not classified as a globally systemically important bank (“G-SIB”), which means it has not recognized certain mark-to-market securities losses in its regulatory capital. Comerica was a 2.6% position at the beginning of the quarter, prior to a roughly 34% stock price decline during the quarter. After purchasing more shares following the stock price decline, the Fund’s position in Comerica was approximately 2.3% at quarter end. While the general contagion fears and bank depositor behavior remain a fluid situation today, we took some confidence from immediate, forceful and targeted actions by the Fed, FDIC and Treasury. In our view, the Fed’s Bank Term Funding Program (“BTFP”) seems a well-tailored and appropriate near-term liquidity solution that allows banks to obtain immediate liquidity, collateralized by the par value of securities, to meet any near-term deposit outflows. At the time of this writing, early signs are that the deposit flight from regional banks is calming rapidly and depositor psychology is improving, though this could change. To the extent that calming continues, our suspicion is that there may be very attractive bargains to be had among regional banks. More will be known in the coming days and weeks as information regarding deposit flows emanates post-quarter end. That said, there will remain some mystery around the extent of the bargains on offer because increases in FDIC funding, increases in regulatory capital requirements, more stringent liquidity stress testing, and changes to the list of banks subject to G-SIB regulatory regimes are all on the table now. It is also very likely that deposit costs, which had been rising very slowly, will rise much more rapidly as commercial banks work harder to entice depositors to stay put. None of these developments, if they eventuate, are likely to impact banks’ returns and earnings in a positive way.More broadly, the Third Avenue Value Fund owned investments categorized as financials totaling 15.94% by weight, at quarter end. This category includes non-bank financials such as Old Republic, a U.S. property and casualty insurer and title insurance business, Lazard, an advisory business and asset management firm, and Ashmore, a U.K. asset management firm specializing in emerging markets credit. The Fund’s actual bank exposure at quarter end totaled 9.52% and is comprised of Bank of Ireland, Deutsche Bank and Comerica, in order of position size…” (Click here to read the full text)9.

This decision is not only a win for Grayscale but also sets an example that could impact other companies seeking to launch Bitcoin ETFs, including industry giants like BlackRock and Fidelity.The largest thrust for the crypto space has come from institutional investors. BlackRock Inc.’s (BLK) decision to launch a Bitcoin ETF and the decision of The Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW) led consortium to create a new crypto exchange called EDX Markets, have attracted several investors toward cryptocurrencies.The latest addition to this league is PayPal Holdings Inc.

79,0a150969-38ad-33e1-af89-2581ea7f151d,PYPL,2023-09-18,11 Crypto Stocks with Biggest Upside,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-crypto-stocks-biggest-upside-153802427.html,1694965082,STORY,"['CAN', 'COIN', 'NVDA', 'PYPL']","[In this article, we will take a look at the 11 crypto stocks with biggest upside. To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Crypto Stocks with Biggest Upside.Cryptocurrencies soared last month after a three-judge appeals panel in Washington vacated a decision by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that blocked Grayscale’s attempt to convert Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an Bitcoin (BTC-USD) exchange-traded fund. Several cryptocurrencies rallied strongly after this decision, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin and Binance Coin. Analysts see this decision as a critical milestone for the industry. Another win for the crypto industry came last month when a US judge ruled that  Ripple Labs Inc did not violate federal securities law by selling its XRP token on public exchanges.However, many analysts believe the crypto industry is facing the same concentration of value problem that is seen in the stock markets: just a few cryptocurrencies account for most of the gains in the industry and the industry is littered with meme coins and coins that have no solid underlying projects. As a result analysts and experts keep cautioning investors, which creates skepticism and volatility in the industry.But what are the reasons behind the skepticism? Did the industry lose hope on the future of money and how digital currencies promise to change it with decentralization? Has the fundamental thesis that once made cryptocurrencies the darlings of the global markets shifted? Many mainstream analysts now believe cryptocurrencies have now gone in the background when compared to other truly disruptive technologies like AI and Cloud computing. For example, a Refinitiv report said that of the many technologies that changed our lives over the past few years, AI is the most disruptive. Other disruptive technologies include high-speed internet, Cloud computing and blockchain. But surprisingly, according to the report, analysts are not excited about crypto.Story continues“This stands in stark contrast to cryptocurrencies, where institutional traders of all ages remain largely unexcited despite the efforts of many to make these markets more accessible.”So that means the whole crypto chapter was a façade and cryptocurrencies do not promise any good for the world? A report by Oliver Wyman Forum on the crypto outlook for 2023 and beyond answers this question in detail. It says:“The short answer is no – and that’s a good thing. Many parts of the sector show real promise for useful innovations to provide more efficient and effective financial products and services for businesses and consumers. The calamities of the past year revealed major flaws in the business models and practices of many crypto ventures, notably in the exchange and lending spaces, but they did not reflect fundamental weaknesses in the industry’s underlying technology or its ability to transform many areas of financial services. The challenge ahead – for digital asset businesses, investors, developers, policymakers, and consumers – is to focus on that promise, identify and rectify the flaws, and develop rules of the road (both formal and informal) that offer protections for investors and users while fostering truly valuable innovation.”Just because the governments around the world initiated a crackdown against crypto and the industry is littered with scams and meme coins does not make the fundamental thesis behind crypto invalid. There are investors and major companies still betting on the future of digital money and they believe sooner or later the world will move to digital currencies, DeFi and related technologies.Last month, JPMorgan said in a report that it sees “limited downside” to the crypto markets in the near term. The bank said in a report that the reversal of crypto rally seen after the Ripple Vs SEC court decision could be because of a “broader correction in risk assets such as equities and in particular tech, which in turn appears to have been induced by frothy positioning in tech, higher U.S. real yields and growth concerns about China.”The Oliver Wyman report said that despite the problems, innovation continues to take place in the crypto industry. The report cited data according to which last year, during the peak of the crypto winter, the industry saw a rise in crypto developers. It also quoted data from Celent which says that 91% of institutional investors are “interested” in investing in tokenized assets.The report however warned that the speculative element in the industry will remain strong. It however advised investors to focus on crypto projects with solid underlying assets and technologies. The report said that the industry has taken the form of an ecosystem, strongly interconnected, causing regulators and outsiders to see it as a whole. The report said this is not the right approach:“Second, and more important, the world’s tendency to lump everything in digital assets together as crypto creates substantial indirect impacts. Policymakers are likely to accelerate the movement to bring digital assets clearly within the regulatory perimeter, and to do so by applying tougher regulatory standards than they would have prior to the recent debacles. Some of this policy action will fail to adequately distinguish between different parts of the digital assets ecosystem. Similarly, funding for digital assets projects of all kinds is likely to be tougher to find going forward than it was when crypto was spinning gold for investors.”Best Crypto Stocks with Upsidesource: pixabayOur MethodologyFor this article, we conducted a survey of mainstream financial media and consulted at least 12 finance websites to see which cryptocurrency-related stocks have the biggest upside according to these websites.

(NASDAQ:CAN)’s management talked about the challenges the company is facing and the expected obstacles in a latest earnings call and said:“We believe that the broader market lacks sufficient upward momentum.

The recent hash rate growth curve also indicates a notable decline in the overall industry’s incremental hash rate investment and deployment during the first three quarters of this year. This trend aligns with our market assessment. Furthermore, policy changes concerning crypto-currencies and mining in various countries introduced further uncertainty to both the industry and our operations. In some cases, these changes could present unforeseen challenged to our actual operations. Given all the factors I have just outlined, we have a highly cautious outlook for the third quarter of 2023. We expect that revenues from the — for the quarter will be approximately $30 million.This forecast reflects our current views on the market and operational conditions and actually results may be subject to change. Overall, as you might already be aware, we have navigated several Bitcoin cycles since our inception in 2013. Our task is to confront and resolve the challenges we encounter. Much like Bitcoin itself, where every day we create new history with each new day, we become more experienced and stronger than the day before. We remain fully committed to performing ahead of the market curve. Next month, on September 12, we plan to celebrate the company’s 10th anniversary in Singapore. Canaan stands out industry [voting] (ph) and proudly holds the distinction of being the first NASDAQ listed company in our industry.

84,c72e7049-1bcd-33fd-8af6-927ddad45ab3,TAP,2023-09-18,Molson Coors Beverage's (NYSE:TAP) Returns Have Hit A Wall,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/molson-coors-beverages-nyse-tap-101521226.html,1695032121,STORY,['TAP-A'],"[Did you know there are some financial metrics that can provide clues of a potential multi-bagger? Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Having said that, from a first glance at Molson Coors Beverage (NYSE:TAP) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Molson Coors Beverage is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.056 = US$1.3b ÷ (US$27b - US$3.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Therefore, Molson Coors Beverage has an ROCE of 5.6%. In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Beverage industry average of 16%. View our latest analysis for Molson Coors Beverage roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Molson Coors Beverage compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Molson Coors Beverage here  for free.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsOver the past five years, Molson Coors Beverage's ROCE and capital employed have both remained mostly flat. Businesses with these traits tend to be mature and steady operations because they're past the growth phase. So unless we see a substantial change at Molson Coors Beverage in terms of ROCE and additional investments being made, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger. This probably explains why Molson Coors Beverage is paying out 35% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends.

General Motors forward PE multiple clocks in a less-than-meaty 4.9 times.The S&amp;P 500 trades on a forward PE of 19.9 times, for a dose of perspective.Don't be sidetracked by the relative discounts of auto stocks vs. the S&amp;P 500, however. The automaker stocks have ""value trap"" written all over them for one super simple thesis.Large automakers are losing huge money on the EV transition that is essentially being forced down their throats by worldwide governments. Consider this: Before any new contract with the UAW, Ford's EV unit was slated to lose $4.5 billion this year. Profits were highly unlikely in 2024 either, and who knows about 2025 or 2026.General Motors is losing a great deal on EVs too. That comes as the company is losing gazillions of dollars on its tinkering with autonomous vehicles via its Cruise business.What a new UAW contract likely brings, no matter the outcome, is a much higher cost base for automakers and probably bigger losses from EV operations. While that is unfolding, the higher wages being paid to the UAW will bite the profit margins in the gas-powered businesses from which automakers have been funding their EV roadmaps.It's a colossal mess for investors in these stocks. A vicious circle of doom!Not to mention average selling prices on EVs aren't holding firm. Blame Tesla and a fresh rush of lower-end models from GM and overseas automakers.Whatever the case, EV prices are being dialed down at the same time as costs are about to surge.""Our net takeaway is that the wage increase and lower working hours/higher headcount, if accepted as proposed, would negatively impact adjusted EBIT [operating profits] by ~$2 billion to ~$3 billion depending on the OEM, before factoring in any increase in benefits, and potential cost cuts and other offsetting actions by the OEMs,"" JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote.Story continuesAnd what happens when a new contract is reached? The clock on another new one begins, likely bringing higher costs for the auto giants, as the UAW is probably going to win this round.I am no rocket scientist, but that cost impact estimated by Brinkman isn't fertile ground for a profit boom that lights a fire under auto stock valuations.It's Tesla's EV game to lose pros like Wedbush analyst Dan Ives thinks.The long-time Tesla bull believes the legacy players will face years of mounting costs due to pressure from the UAW and as a result, weak profits. That is a red meat backdrop for a voracious player such as Tesla.In the end, it may just be the UAW that funds the next huge acquisition by Tesla's Elon Musk. And should that deal cross the newswires, best believe it would come alongside a lot of red ink at Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Undervalued Stocks To Buy Now.Much has been said and will be said about value investing and the art of picking stocks that are trading below their true value. But legendary value investor Howard Marks has penned some great words of wisdom on this topic that remain unprecedented. His book entitled “The Most Important Thing” needs more attention, especially during volatile times of today when investors are scrambling to make sense of the stock market movements.A chapter in Marks’ book entitled “The Most Important Thing is … Value” talks in detail about different approaches to investing. Marks shows us the cracks and weaknesses of technical analysis-based investing techniques and why momentum investing and analyzing a stock based on its past trends is not the right approach. While Marks vehemently rejects any kind of conjecture or speculation and touts the usefulness of value investing, he acknowledges that value investing also gives importance to taking into account the future when it comes to stock analysis. He says:“It would be convenient to say that adherence to value investing permits investors to avoid conjecture about the future and that growth investing con sists only of conjecture about the future, but that would be a considerable exaggeration. After all, establishing the current value of a business requires an opinion regarding its future, and that in turn must take into account the likely macro-economic environment, competitive developments and technological advances. Even a promising net-net investment can be doomed if the company’s assets are squandered on money-losing operations or un- wise acquisitions. There’s no bright-line distinction between value and growth; both re- quire us to deal with the future. Value investors think about the company’s potential for growth, and the “growth at a reasonable price” school pays explicit homage to value. It’s all a matter of degree. However, I think it can fairly be said that growth investing is about the future, whereas value investing emphasizes current-day considerations but can’t escape dealing with the future.”Story continuesMarks also emphasizes in the book about appreciating the role of luck and randomness and builds upon the ideas of Nassim Nicholas Taleb who discussed the matters of luck in his famous book Fooled by Randomness. Marks’ intention behind this chapter is to highlight the importance of having long-term outlook while investing. Making $1 million playing Russian roulette is not same as making $1 million through several years of patient investing. Even a terrible financial advisor could get lucky and post huge returns in a month or a year but that would only be by sheer luck and this advisor might feel good for a few months but he would ultimately be exposed. That’s why investors should not be fooled by short-term news cycles if they truly want to invest in companies that have intrinsic value.Best Undervalued Stocks to BuyHoward Marks of Oaktree Capital ManagementOur MethodologyFor this article we surveyed at least 15 credible financial websites and picked 14 stocks that these websites believe are undervalued.

So this is behind our strengths. Then I wanted to underline the strengths of our innovation. Our innovation is strong. It’s also in tough challenging year like 2023, remains at 25%. And the innovation pipeline for 2024, 2025 is very, very strong. Particularly in 2025, we have some extra wide spaces innovation, which are very promising. So this also will support the continuous strength of these other parts of the business — other regions, as you mentioned. And then finally, the execution in this region has been stepping up because we explained that as the recovery from the pandemic progress, our ability to execute in the post-pandemic world has been developed and is getting better and better month after month.So in the regions which have been faster in the post-pandemic development, we have been faster in recovering great execution and great results, so this will continue to progress in 2024. So we have good confidence on that. On the U.S. where, on the contrary, we said there is work to be done, the team is very focused on doing this work. We have a very clear plan. Again, I summarized them in the prepared remarks, but to go back to them, our strategy in rebuilding the North America growth is really various [indiscernible] four big building blocks. The first one is a very rich pipeline of newness, which is later in 2024 and further reinforced in 2025, focus on breakthrough innovation on new claims that will help also unlocking the consumers in online, and especially multi more aggressively.”Here is what Aristotle Atlantic Partners has to say about The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Estee Lauder shares were weak during the second quarter, following an inline earnings report where Estee again pushed out the timing of a recovery in their travel retail business due to sluggish travel trends in China and an inventory overhand in that end market. Estee reduced fiscal 2023 earnings guidance again and pushed the timing of the recovery toward the end of this calendar year. Outside of travel retail, growth was solid in the Americas, Europe, APAC, Emerging Markets and China.”10. Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) ranks 10th in our list of the best undervalued stocks to buy according to the media. Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) is recommended by several financial websites amid its attractive valuation. Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA)’s PE ratio as of September 8 stands at 4.74. Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) is taking a hit after S&amp;P Global Ratings downgraded it amid large deposit outflows and higher for longer rates.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 46 hedge funds out of the 910 funds in Insider Monkey’s database had stakes in Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA).Third Avenue Value Fund made the following comment about Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“The largest detractors from Fund performance during the quarter included two banks, Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) and Deutsche Bank. As it relates to the Fund specifically, events within U.S. banking applied most directly to our investment in Comerica, a U.S. super-regional that does have a large portion of corporate deposits and is not classified as a globally systemically important bank (“G-SIB”), which means it has not recognized certain mark-to-market securities losses in its regulatory capital. Comerica was a 2.6% position at the beginning of the quarter, prior to a roughly 34% stock price decline during the quarter. After purchasing more shares following the stock price decline, the Fund’s position in Comerica was approximately 2.3% at quarter end. While the general contagion fears and bank depositor behavior remain a fluid situation today, we took some confidence from immediate, forceful and targeted actions by the Fed, FDIC and Treasury. In our view, the Fed’s Bank Term Funding Program (“BTFP”) seems a well-tailored and appropriate near-term liquidity solution that allows banks to obtain immediate liquidity, collateralized by the par value of securities, to meet any near-term deposit outflows. At the time of this writing, early signs are that the deposit flight from regional banks is calming rapidly and depositor psychology is improving, though this could change. To the extent that calming continues, our suspicion is that there may be very attractive bargains to be had among regional banks. More will be known in the coming days and weeks as information regarding deposit flows emanates post-quarter end. That said, there will remain some mystery around the extent of the bargains on offer because increases in FDIC funding, increases in regulatory capital requirements, more stringent liquidity stress testing, and changes to the list of banks subject to G-SIB regulatory regimes are all on the table now. It is also very likely that deposit costs, which had been rising very slowly, will rise much more rapidly as commercial banks work harder to entice depositors to stay put. None of these developments, if they eventuate, are likely to impact banks’ returns and earnings in a positive way.More broadly, the Third Avenue Value Fund owned investments categorized as financials totaling 15.94% by weight, at quarter end. This category includes non-bank financials such as Old Republic, a U.S. property and casualty insurer and title insurance business, Lazard, an advisory business and asset management firm, and Ashmore, a U.K. asset management firm specializing in emerging markets credit. The Fund’s actual bank exposure at quarter end totaled 9.52% and is comprised of Bank of Ireland, Deutsche Bank and Comerica, in order of position size…” (Click here to read the full text)9.

Never miss another opportunity to secure an edge for your portfolio.BMW's electrifying investmentIn a bid to fully electrify its Mini brand by 2030, BMW (ETR:BMWG) (OTC:BMWYY) announced a substantial investment of £600 million (£1 = $1.24) into its UK manufacturing plants, and BMW's Mini brand will produce two electric models - the Mini Cooper 3-door and the compact crossover Mini Aceman - at its Oxford plant starting in 2026.BMW said the Oxford plant will transition to exclusive EV production by 2030, with many of these vehicles destined for international markets.The company also expressed a commitment to incorporate European-manufactured batteries into these forthcoming models but left the supplier decision open, emphasizing that it hinges on market appeal.This investment underscores BMW's determination to electrify its offerings, as well as the growing importance of EVs in the automotive landscape.BMW shares rose about 1.4% for the week in both Frankfurt and New York, with the former closing Friday at €97.51 and the latter ending at $34.64. Each is up more than 13% year to date.Tesla's manufacturing breakthroughTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is reportedly edging closer to employing die-casting techniques - a groundbreaking approach to EV manufacturing that aims create nearly the entire underbody of an electric vehicle as a single unit - rather than the roughly 400 components required for the conventional method.Terry Woychowski of Caresoft Global told Reuters that this development will be a game changer for the industry, saying, ""It is an enabler on steroids. It has a huge implication for the industry, but it's a very challenging task.""Story continuesUnnamed sources in the reports suggest this technique could potentially allow Tesla to develop a car from the ground up in just 18 to 24 months, significantly outpacing the typical three- to four-year timeline for such projects. If realized, this could put Tesla at the forefront of EV manufacturing, leaving competitors racing to catch up.Shares of TSLA ended the week up 3.9% to $274.39, and have surged more than 150% so far for the year.UAW labor standoff beginsThe United Auto Workers (UAW) union initiated a series of strategic strikes at specific plants, marking an unprecedented move in the labor dispute, after negotiations hit a roadblock between the management teams of three major American automakers.The parties - UAW on one side and Ford (NYSE:F), General Motors (NYSE:GM), and Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) on the other - failed to reach an agreement on new contract proposals by the Thursday night deadline.UAW President Sean Fain dubbed this tactic a ""stand-up strike"" that is aimed at disrupting the operations of all three automakers simultaneously. The initial wave of strikes targets key facilities, including the Ford Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, Mich., the Stellantis Toledo Assembly in Ohio, and the General Motors Wentzville Assembly in Missouri.""This strategy will keep the companies guessing,"" Fain told workers during a Facebook Live event. ""It will give our national negotiators maximum leverage and flexibility in bargaining. And if we need to go all out, we will. Everything is on the table.""A central issue in the dispute is the UAW's demand for salary increases that match the 40% raises recently granted to the CEOs of the Detroit 3 automakers. The companies countered with wage increases ranging from 17.5% to 20% over four and a half years, which the UAW considers inadequate.The situation remains fluid, with both sides seeking a resolution.Ford slipped marginally on Friday but was still some 1.9% higher for the week, while GM and Stellantis were in the green for Friday and respectively advanced 2.2% and 4.5% for the past five sessions.Related ArticlesBMW goes full throttle on EVs; Tesla's game changer: This week in EVsUAW strike against Detroit Three automakers enters third dayEU chief pledges migrant action plan in Italy's Lampedusa]"

(NYSE:EL) is a surprising entry in the list as several top websites we surveyed believe the stock is an undervalued play. The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) shares have lost about 37% over the past one year. JPMorgan last month said a report that it believes The Estee Lauder Companies Inc.

(NYSE:EL).The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL)’s CEO Frabrizio Freda said the following about the company’s long-term plans during a latest earnings call:“So to be clear, we will be a company by the end of 2024 with $6 billion brands, extraordinary scale in the global system and global reach. So this is behind our strengths. Then I wanted to underline the strengths of our innovation. Our innovation is strong. It’s also in tough challenging year like 2023, remains at 25%. And the innovation pipeline for 2024, 2025 is very, very strong. Particularly in 2025, we have some extra wide spaces innovation, which are very promising. So this also will support the continuous strength of these other parts of the business — other regions, as you mentioned. And then finally, the execution in this region has been stepping up because we explained that as the recovery from the pandemic progress, our ability to execute in the post-pandemic world has been developed and is getting better and better month after month.So in the regions which have been faster in the post-pandemic development, we have been faster in recovering great execution and great results, so this will continue to progress in 2024. So we have good confidence on that. On the U.S. where, on the contrary, we said there is work to be done, the team is very focused on doing this work. We have a very clear plan. Again, I summarized them in the prepared remarks, but to go back to them, our strategy in rebuilding the North America growth is really various [indiscernible] four big building blocks. The first one is a very rich pipeline of newness, which is later in 2024 and further reinforced in 2025, focus on breakthrough innovation on new claims that will help also unlocking the consumers in online, and especially multi more aggressively.”Here is what Aristotle Atlantic Partners has to say about The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Estee Lauder shares were weak during the second quarter, following an inline earnings report where Estee again pushed out the timing of a recovery in their travel retail business due to sluggish travel trends in China and an inventory overhand in that end market. Estee reduced fiscal 2023 earnings guidance again and pushed the timing of the recovery toward the end of this calendar year. Outside of travel retail, growth was solid in the Americas, Europe, APAC, Emerging Markets and China.”10. Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) ranks 10th in our list of the best undervalued stocks to buy according to the media. Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) is recommended by several financial websites amid its attractive valuation. Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA)’s PE ratio as of September 8 stands at 4.74. Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) is taking a hit after S&amp;P Global Ratings downgraded it amid large deposit outflows and higher for longer rates.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 46 hedge funds out of the 910 funds in Insider Monkey’s database had stakes in Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA).Third Avenue Value Fund made the following comment about Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“The largest detractors from Fund performance during the quarter included two banks, Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) and Deutsche Bank. As it relates to the Fund specifically, events within U.S. banking applied most directly to our investment in Comerica, a U.S. super-regional that does have a large portion of corporate deposits and is not classified as a globally systemically important bank (“G-SIB”), which means it has not recognized certain mark-to-market securities losses in its regulatory capital. Comerica was a 2.6% position at the beginning of the quarter, prior to a roughly 34% stock price decline during the quarter. After purchasing more shares following the stock price decline, the Fund’s position in Comerica was approximately 2.3% at quarter end. While the general contagion fears and bank depositor behavior remain a fluid situation today, we took some confidence from immediate, forceful and targeted actions by the Fed, FDIC and Treasury. In our view, the Fed’s Bank Term Funding Program (“BTFP”) seems a well-tailored and appropriate near-term liquidity solution that allows banks to obtain immediate liquidity, collateralized by the par value of securities, to meet any near-term deposit outflows. At the time of this writing, early signs are that the deposit flight from regional banks is calming rapidly and depositor psychology is improving, though this could change. To the extent that calming continues, our suspicion is that there may be very attractive bargains to be had among regional banks. More will be known in the coming days and weeks as information regarding deposit flows emanates post-quarter end. That said, there will remain some mystery around the extent of the bargains on offer because increases in FDIC funding, increases in regulatory capital requirements, more stringent liquidity stress testing, and changes to the list of banks subject to G-SIB regulatory regimes are all on the table now. It is also very likely that deposit costs, which had been rising very slowly, will rise much more rapidly as commercial banks work harder to entice depositors to stay put. None of these developments, if they eventuate, are likely to impact banks’ returns and earnings in a positive way.More broadly, the Third Avenue Value Fund owned investments categorized as financials totaling 15.94% by weight, at quarter end. This category includes non-bank financials such as Old Republic, a U.S. property and casualty insurer and title insurance business, Lazard, an advisory business and asset management firm, and Ashmore, a U.K. asset management firm specializing in emerging markets credit. The Fund’s actual bank exposure at quarter end totaled 9.52% and is comprised of Bank of Ireland, Deutsche Bank and Comerica, in order of position size…” (Click here to read the full text)9.

94,e25f119c-376c-37f0-9d31-e659f98ff8fd,PNC,2023-09-18,3 Bank Stocks to Buy Yielding 5% or More,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-bank-stocks-buy-yielding-092947829.html,1694510987,STORY,"['PNC', 'FHN', 'KBWB']","[It’s not been an easy year for bank stocks. The Invesco KBW Bank ETF (NASDAQ:KBWB) tracks the performance of the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index, a collection of large national US money centers, regional banks and thrift institutions. Both the fund and index are rebalanced and reconstituted quarterly. KBWB currently has 25 holdings with an average market capitalization of $103 billion and an average price-to-earnings ratio of less than 9x. Year-to-date, it’s down more than 20%. Worse still, it’s down nearly 26% over the past five years. This has been dead money for at least half a decade, if not for dividends. As Barron’s recently pointed out, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is the only big bank in positive territory in 2023. Barron’s article focused on the possibility that the demise of bank stocks will lead to consolidation in the industry. You’re likely to see a bunch of mergers between mid-level banks that currently can’t compete effectively with the JPM’s of the world. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAs you wait for your bank stock to get bought out, getting paid to wait through dividends makes sense. Here are three high-yield bank stocks to buy that allow you to do that.PNC Financial (PNC)PNC bank logo on buildingSource: Jonathan Weiss/Shutterstock.comWhen I was considering regional bank stocks, I immediately thought of the PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) ads. The bank’s history dates back to 1852, nearly a decade before the Civil War. Today, the Pittsburgh-based bank holding company is the sixth-largest bank by assets, with $554.1 billion. Its deposit base is a nice mix between commercial ($204 billion) and consumer ($222 billion), with $223.2 billion in commercial loans and 101.3 million in consumer loans. Like most regional banks, PNC’s share price was hurt by the Silicon Valley Bank meltdown earlier this year. Its shares are down 26% year-to-date and nearly 16% over the past five years. While flawed, its five-year return is up when compared to KBWB over the past five years. PNC conducted a recent survey of small and mid-sized businesses. Approximately 77% of the respondents are highly optimistic about their prospects over the next six months, up 28% from a year ago. The level of optimism is the highest in the past 21 years. Story continuesThe last major acquisition it made was in 2021, paying $11.6 billion for the U.S. subsidiary of Spanish bank Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (NYSE:BBVA). This is a stock to keep an eye on in the next 12-18 months. It’s a buyer, not a seller.Citizens Financial (CFG)Image of a grey cityscape with a large corporate building that features the word bank on itSource: ShutterstockCitizens Financial (NYSE:CFG) is nearly one-quarter the size of PNC by market cap. The Rhode Island-based bank has over 1,100 branches in 14 states and the District of Columbia. It finished the second quarter with $178 billion in deposits and $151 billion in loans. Its Q2 2023 report said it hired 50 senior bankers in the first half of the year. The significant growth driver is the bank’s push into private banking. In October 2022, it announced plans to launch the Citizens Private Client. The unit focuses on customers with $200,000 in deposits or investments. It plans for the unit to break even by the middle of fiscal 2024, adding to profits by the end of 2024. By the end of 2025, it expects the unit to have $9 billion in loans and $11 billion in deposits while boosting annual earnings per share by approximately 5%.Of the 24 analysts covering its stock, 13 rate it overweight or an outright buy, with a median target price of $34, 18% higher than where it’s currently trading. Additionally, since it is operating in some attractive markets, I could see someone much larger making a play for CFG.First Horizon (FHN)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7First Horizon (NYSE:FHN) almost became a subsidiary of one of Canada’s largest banks. Unfortunately, with the Silicon Valley Bank debacle, First Horizon’s stock price crumbled, making the deal virtually impossible to complete at the $25 a share price Toronto-Dominion Bank (NYSE:TD) first offered to pay in February 2022. It didn’t help that regulatory hurdles accelerated after the regional banking troubles. It just wasn’t meant to be. However, First Horizon remains an intriguing buy for a larger bank willing to go back to the negotiating table. First Horizon is another regional bank with a long history. The bank got its start in 1864 in Memphis. Several mergers later, it has $85 billion in assets and operates in 12 U.S. states in the south, with $65 billion in deposits and $61 billion in loans. First Horizon added 32,000 new clients in the latest quarter, bringing $3.5 billion in additional deposits. During the quarter, deposits increased by $3.0 billion, while deposits rose by $2.3 billion. In Q2 2023, its net interest margin (NIM) was 3.38% during the quarter. JPMorgan’s annualized NIM was 3.37%.In the hands of a bigger bank, First Horizon could be a very valuable acquisition. On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

95,c97f01f8-496f-37bc-a74d-d9fdc2e3af04,ISRG,2023-09-18,7 Large-Cap Stocks With Surprisingly Robust Upside Potential,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-large-cap-stocks-surprisingly-201928019.html,1694463568.0,STORY,"['ISRG', 'MDLZ', 'DAL', 'LNG', 'MCD', 'JD', 'STLAM.MI']","[Generally, onlookers dismiss large-cap stocks to buy as the arena for ultra-conservative investors; you know, the type that mimics Warren Buffett’s every move. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with that. However, if you want a little spice in your portfolio, you can still find it among the industry stalwarts.At first, the concept of high-potential large-cap stocks sounds counterintuitive, perhaps even illogical. After all, well-known large-capitalization companies almost always feature established, mature businesses. And such maturity – while it may lead to predictability – often means a lack of upside. Basically, the low-hanging fruit has already been picked. However, strange things can happen in the market. For various reasons, the below large-cap stocks to buy have more room to run.McDonald’s (MCD)McDonald's golden archesSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / ShutterstockOne of the world’s most famous large-cap stocks to buy, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) just might benefit from the trade-down effect. Essentially, consumers facing financial pressures don’t immediately cut all discretionary purchases. Instead, they trade down until they reach an acceptable equilibrium between quality and price.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAnother factor that could tilt the ball favorably for MCD centers on the competitive angle. Right now, major corporations are getting more aggressive with their return-to-work policies. Between well-heeled companies and individual employees, my bet is that the latter will crack first. Given this assumption, stressed-out worker bees will likely seek out cheap sources of caffeine, which favors McDonald’s.Financially, investors of large-cap stocks can also depend on its solid financials. For instance, it features an above-average three-year revenue growth rate (per-share basis) of 3.8%. It’s also consistently profitable.Finally, analysts peg MCD as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target over the next 12 months lands at $332.32, implying 19% upside potential.Story continuesMondelez (MDLZ)The Mondelez website magnified by a magnifying glassSource: ShutterstockAn American multinational confectionery, food, and beverage company, Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) may also be a beneficiary of the trade-down effect. Basically, as consumers face significant economic pressure – and as personal savings dwindle – many households will do away with going out to eat. Instead, we should see greater demand in the grocery aisles, which should bolster MDLZ.Generally speaking, options traders appear to have a favorable view of MDLZ based on its volatility smile. While implied volatility (IV) – roughly a weather forecast for the underlying option – spikes in the deep in-the-money strike prices, between the $65 and $75 strike prices, IV is consistent. From $75 upward, IV rises, which may indicate longer-term bullish speculation.Financially, Mondelez features a so-so profile if I’m being perfectly honest. However, it does have strong margins and is consistently profitable on an annual basis.Lastly, analysts peg MDLZ as a strong buy with an $83.57 price target, implying nearly 20% upside potential.Cheniere Energy (LNG)LNG stock: the Cheniere logo displayed on a phoneSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Houston, Texas, Cheniere Energy (NYSEAMERICAN:LNG) is a liquefied natural gas company; hence the ticker symbol. Since the start of the year, LNG gained nearly 16% of its equity value. Much of the positive returns have come relatively recently as the underlying industry received a cynical boost from various geopolitics-related upside catalysts.Moving forward, it’s reasonable to anticipate sustained interest in Cheniere due to the importance of LNG for the global economy. Also, traders appear to be cognizant of the upside potential. From the $180 strike price, IV rises from 0.21 to 0.55 at the $240 strike. Shares recently closed at $162.68.To be fair, IV spiked in the deep ITM direction, hitting 0.95 at the $85 strike. This dynamic may indicate traders accounting for possible tail risk (i.e. black swan event). While a sharp correction is always possible, here’s the great news: analysts peg LNG as a unanimous strong buy with a $203.30 average price target, implying 25% growth. Thus, it’s one of the large-cap stocks to buy.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comBased in Sunnyvale, California, Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) develops, manufactures, and markets robotic products designed to improve the clinical outcomes of patients through minimally invasive surgery. Its most popular product is the da Vinci Surgical System. Since the beginning of this year, ISRG gained over 12% of its equity value. In the trailing year, it’s up nearly 35%.Despite already being one of the top large-cap stocks, ISRG may still have some room left in the tank. Looking at the options market, IV rises from a low of 0.23 at the $310 strike price to 0.75 at the $460 strike. Thus, the rise in IV toward the far out-the-money (OTM) direction may indicate optimistic speculation.In fairness, in the deep ITM direction, IV spikes to 1.08 at the $170 strike, reflecting possible mitigation of tail risks. However, Intuitive benefits from a no-debt balance sheet, along with solid sales and excellent margins. Plus, analysts peg ISRG as a strong buy. Their average price target stands at $377.14, implying over 26% upside.Stellantis (STLA)A flag with the logo for Stellantis waves outside a building with the logos for some of its car brands, including Abarth, Lancia, Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Jeep.Source: Antonello Marangi / Shutterstock.comIn prior articles for InvestorPlace, I sang the praise of auto firm Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) for its upcoming 2024 Dodge Charger EV. In a nutshell, while EVs are incredibly popular these days, some of the designs look bland. Frankly, a good many customers want a robust, masculine car that evokes the experience of a true street racing machine. Over time, I believe the electric Charger should perform very well, expanding Dodge’s total addressable market.It’s possible that the institutional traders sense the upside prospect. On Sept. 6, traders bought $19 calls with an expiration date of Sept. 15. Also, many others sold $17 puts – which have a bullish implication – with the same Sept. 15 expiry. In addition, big block trades for bought calls and sold puts which expire in 2024 and 2025 respectively have been placed.Financially, Stellantis flaunts a solid balance sheet, better-than-average revenue growth, and excellent profit margins. It also trades at a low forward earnings multiple of 3.1x. Turning to the Street, analysts peg STLA as a strong buy. Their average price target comes in at $24.14, implying over 32% upside.Delta Air Lines (DAL)The Delta Air Lines (DAL) logo is seen on an airplane in flight.Source: VanderWolf Images/Shutterstock.comHeading into the riskiest side of large-cap stocks to buy, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) naturally appeals to many investors. Relatively speaking, consumer sentiment – though it ebbs and flows of course – has been solidly robust post-pandemic. Even better for DAL, the revenge travel phenomenon has carried experience-related enterprises. So, it’s possible that DAL has more upside remaining.Yes, DAL has already gained over 25% since the beginning of this year. However, consumers continue to prioritize experiences that were denied them during the Covid-19 quarantines. If you’re convinced that this catalyst will sustain, Delta could be intriguing.Further, while a speculative thesis, options flow data reveals that a lot of bought puts will expire soon on Sept. 15. Once that cloud is gone, it’s possible – though hardly guaranteed – that DAL stock could swing higher. Looking at Wall Street, analysts peg DAL as a unanimous strong buy. And that’s from 17 experts, by the way. As well, the average price target clocks in at $59.69, implying over 46% upside potential.JD.com (JD)the JD.com (JD) logo on the outside of a buildingSource: testing / Shutterstock.comAlmost inarguably the riskiest idea among large-cap stocks to buy, JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) is one of the biggest companies in China. Per its public profile, its e-commerce business represents one of the two massive business-to-consumer online retailers in the country. As well, JD invests heavily in advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence.However, since the start of the year, JD slipped nearly 44%. Much of the pain centers on the slow economic recovery in China. With analysts raising concerns about the viability of the Chinese consumer base, folks have simply moved away from JD stock.But could that be a mistake? Notably, JD’s options volatility smile shows IV spiking in the far OTM direction. And while IV also increased in the deep ITM direction, it didn’t do so with the same magnitude. Unsurprisingly, institutional traders appear to have sold put contracts (which again have bullish implications) to take advantage of heightened premiums.Finally, analysts peg JD as a strong buy with a $57.08 average target, implying over 76% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Small amounts of money invested over time can add up to a lifetime of riches. Even if you only have $500 to invest you can still find stocks to buy.The stock market’s history proves there are few better paths to building wealth than investing in American businesses. The long-term average return for the S&amp;P 500 is about 11% a year. That’s through depressions and recessions, war, civil unrest and even a global pandemic or two.One truth that shines through is that no matter how bad things get, they always get better. Every bear market is eventually followed by a bull market. And the beauty of stock investing is you don’t need a lot of money to participate in this amazing wealth-building machine. A small grubstake can turn into a comfortable retirement nest egg given time.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsParking that $500 in the stock index for 25 years and not adding another dollar will have it turn into $6,800 at average market returns. But there is a better way. The following trio of no-brainer stocks should help transform your small acorn into a mighty oak of a retirement portfolio.NXP Semiconductors (NXPI)A sign on a brick well for NXP Semiconductor. NXPI stock.Source: Lukassek / Shutterstock.comKnown for its leadership in near-field communication, NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) chips are everywhere today. They allow cars to communicate with one another and the environment around them. They also exist in smart homes, appliances, entertainment systems, smartphones and wearables, banks and the government for identification documents.Especially with the advent of smart electric cars, the need and demand for NXP’s chips in automotive applications has grown exponentially. The segment now accounts for 57% of the chipmaker’s quarterly revenue. Industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) applications are a distant second at less than 18% of revenue.Although revenue in the auto segment fell slightly from last year, the total was up 6% to $3.3 billion. And that’s with the auto industry still in a slump. A senior economist at Cox Automotive said, “rising interest rates, and their impact on affordability, remain strong headwinds against a more robust vehicle market.”Story continuesThe reason for the disconnect between NXP’s results and the broader market is that today’s cars are rolling computers. Car sales are down, but the density of computer chips in vehicles grows nonetheless.And the auto industry is recovering. New car sales surged 15% higher in August compared to last year. That means NXP’s business will only continue to strengthen in time. At 15 times earnings estimates, NXP Semiconductor offers better values than other similarly situated chipmakers.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comThe market is giving investors a chance to get into Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) at an opportune time. The stock got beat up over second-quarter earnings, and shares are down 17% from recent highs.Wall Street, however, forecasts the robotic surgery leader to grow earnings three times faster over the next five years than it did over the previous five. It is far and away the leader in the industry, with an installed base of over 8,200 machines and around an 80% share of the global market for certain procedures. Intuitive Surgical’s da Vinci device is the de facto industry standard.Yet the robotics giant faces several headwinds. Business was disrupted during the pandemic due to elective surgeries being placed on hold. More recently, the rise of weight-loss drugs may cut into the growth of Intuitive Surgical’s bariatric procedures. Still, procedures targeting gynecological issues, hernia, colorectal and others continue to generate high demand.Bariatric surgery for obese patients has slowed down, but Intuitive Surgical thinks it is temporary. As people evaluate using drugs instead of surgery for weight loss, there will be a short-term hit. Long-term, however, the robotics company says the outlook is still positive. Once patients stop taking the drugs, they tend to gain the weight back. Robotic bariatric surgery could ultimately complement the weight-loss drugs.With shares down and earnings growth expected to be strong, Intuitive Surgical should be a no-brainer stock for investors.Sysco (SYY)Sysco (SYY) logo on a sign with company headquarters in Houston in the background.Source: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.comNot as exciting as smart car chips or robotic surgery, food distribution leader Sysco (NYSE:SYY) is also a dead-simple investment to make.Getting food from farm to supermarket or institutional kitchen is one of those behind-the-scenes operations few really think about. It’s a highly fragmented industry, but Sysco is the industry leader with a 17% share. Second place U.S. Foods (NYSE:USFD) has an 11% share.Sysco operates 333 distribution facilities globally and serves approximately 700,000 customer locations. Despite revenue jumping 11% in fiscal 2023 to $76 billion and operating profits surging 30%, Sysco stock is down 20% from its 52-week high.The problem is that inflation and commodity costs are still ravaging the food industry. Consumers are also feeling pinched and have not returned to buying more expensive cuts of meat. It’s affecting dairy and seafood purchases also. The issue prevents Sysco from raising prices.Supermarkets already operate on very thin margins, and persistently high costs for food are hurting business. Kroger (NYSE:KR), for example, is the largest pure-play supermarket chain in the country, and it just issued an earnings warning for just those reasons.Still, Sysco stock is very cheap. It trades at 16 times estimates, less than twice its projected earnings growth rate, and just a fraction of sales. The food distributor is also a Dividend King, meaning SYY raised its dividend for 50 consecutive years or more. Currently, the payout yields 2.9%, making it an easy choice for investors.On the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a long position in SYY stock.

The annual campaign promotes public safety near railroad tracks and serves as a nationwide platform to educate communities about safe behaviors that help prevent crossing collisions and trespass incidents.""Education is at the heart of rail safety. By engaging with communities and fostering a culture of awareness, we can make substantial progress toward reducing these incidents,” said Sean Douris, chief of police, public safety and infrastructure protection at CSX. “We urge everyone to join us in supporting Rail Safety Week. Everyone can do something to help stop track tragedies and take proactive measures to stay safe around the railroad.""Through safety blitzes, outdoor billboards and social media messages, CSX will bring awareness to the critical issue of crossing collisions and trespass incidents, which pose significant threats to public safety. These incidents not only disrupt rail operations but also have life-altering consequences for individuals and their families.According to Operation Lifesaver, more than 60% of vehicle-train collisions occur at active railroad crossings with either crossing lights or gates. In 2022, more than 2,200 people across the U.S. were injured or killed in railroad crossing collisions or trespassing incidents. In the same year, 1,175 people were killed or injured in trespass-related incidents nationwide, an increase of 6% from 2021. CSX emphasizes that accidents at grade crossings and on railroad tracks can be avoided.“This isn’t just another number or statistic. It represents friends, family, neighbors and community members,” Douris said. “With safe driver and pedestrian behavior, these incidents are preventable. We all have a role to play in stopping track tragedies, and everyone has a responsibility to be safe around railroad tracks.”Story continuesRail Safety Week provides an opportunity to inspire vigilance among drivers and pedestrians, encouraging them to be attentive around tracks and to adopt essential safety practices for their protection. Each day will focus on a different safety theme and CSX police will engage in education and enforcement activities across the rail network.Individuals and public safety agencies can help spread the lifesaving safety messages by visiting www.oli.org and sharing Rail Safety Week information with others.About CSX CSX, based in Jacksonville, Florida, is a premier transportation company.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So while Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST) has a high ROCE right now, lets see what we can decipher from how returns are changing.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Ross Stores is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.20 = US$2.0b ÷ (US$14b - US$4.0b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).Therefore, Ross Stores has an ROCE of 20%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Specialty Retail industry average of 13%. Check out our latest analysis for Ross Stores roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Ross Stores compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Ross Stores.How Are Returns Trending?When we looked at the ROCE trend at Ross Stores, we didn't gain much confidence. While it's comforting that the ROCE is high, five years ago it was 53%. However it looks like Ross Stores might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.Story continuesOur Take On Ross Stores' ROCEIn summary, Ross Stores is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. And with the stock having returned a mere 27% in the last five years to shareholders, you could argue that they're aware of these lackluster trends. As a result, if you're hunting for a multi-bagger, we think you'd have more luck elsewhere.On a final note, we've found   1 warning sign for Ross Stores  that we think you should be aware of.High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Undervalued Stocks To Buy Now.Much has been said and will be said about value investing and the art of picking stocks that are trading below their true value. But legendary value investor Howard Marks has penned some great words of wisdom on this topic that remain unprecedented. His book entitled “The Most Important Thing” needs more attention, especially during volatile times of today when investors are scrambling to make sense of the stock market movements.A chapter in Marks’ book entitled “The Most Important Thing is … Value” talks in detail about different approaches to investing. Marks shows us the cracks and weaknesses of technical analysis-based investing techniques and why momentum investing and analyzing a stock based on its past trends is not the right approach. While Marks vehemently rejects any kind of conjecture or speculation and touts the usefulness of value investing, he acknowledges that value investing also gives importance to taking into account the future when it comes to stock analysis. He says:“It would be convenient to say that adherence to value investing permits investors to avoid conjecture about the future and that growth investing con sists only of conjecture about the future, but that would be a considerable exaggeration. After all, establishing the current value of a business requires an opinion regarding its future, and that in turn must take into account the likely macro-economic environment, competitive developments and technological advances. Even a promising net-net investment can be doomed if the company’s assets are squandered on money-losing operations or un- wise acquisitions. There’s no bright-line distinction between value and growth; both re- quire us to deal with the future. Value investors think about the company’s potential for growth, and the “growth at a reasonable price” school pays explicit homage to value. It’s all a matter of degree. However, I think it can fairly be said that growth investing is about the future, whereas value investing emphasizes current-day considerations but can’t escape dealing with the future.”Story continuesMarks also emphasizes in the book about appreciating the role of luck and randomness and builds upon the ideas of Nassim Nicholas Taleb who discussed the matters of luck in his famous book Fooled by Randomness. Marks’ intention behind this chapter is to highlight the importance of having long-term outlook while investing. Making $1 million playing Russian roulette is not same as making $1 million through several years of patient investing. Even a terrible financial advisor could get lucky and post huge returns in a month or a year but that would only be by sheer luck and this advisor might feel good for a few months but he would ultimately be exposed. That’s why investors should not be fooled by short-term news cycles if they truly want to invest in companies that have intrinsic value.Best Undervalued Stocks to BuyHoward Marks of Oaktree Capital ManagementOur MethodologyFor this article we surveyed at least 15 credible financial websites and picked 14 stocks that these websites believe are undervalued.

(NYSE:EL)’s CEO Frabrizio Freda said the following about the company’s long-term plans during a latest earnings call:“So to be clear, we will be a company by the end of 2024 with $6 billion brands, extraordinary scale in the global system and global reach. So this is behind our strengths. Then I wanted to underline the strengths of our innovation. Our innovation is strong. It’s also in tough challenging year like 2023, remains at 25%. And the innovation pipeline for 2024, 2025 is very, very strong. Particularly in 2025, we have some extra wide spaces innovation, which are very promising. So this also will support the continuous strength of these other parts of the business — other regions, as you mentioned. And then finally, the execution in this region has been stepping up because we explained that as the recovery from the pandemic progress, our ability to execute in the post-pandemic world has been developed and is getting better and better month after month.So in the regions which have been faster in the post-pandemic development, we have been faster in recovering great execution and great results, so this will continue to progress in 2024. So we have good confidence on that. On the U.S. where, on the contrary, we said there is work to be done, the team is very focused on doing this work. We have a very clear plan. Again, I summarized them in the prepared remarks, but to go back to them, our strategy in rebuilding the North America growth is really various [indiscernible] four big building blocks. The first one is a very rich pipeline of newness, which is later in 2024 and further reinforced in 2025, focus on breakthrough innovation on new claims that will help also unlocking the consumers in online, and especially multi more aggressively.”Here is what Aristotle Atlantic Partners has to say about The Estee Lauder Companies Inc.

Estee reduced fiscal 2023 earnings guidance again and pushed the timing of the recovery toward the end of this calendar year. Outside of travel retail, growth was solid in the Americas, Europe, APAC, Emerging Markets and China.”10. Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) ranks 10th in our list of the best undervalued stocks to buy according to the media. Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) is recommended by several financial websites amid its attractive valuation. Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA)’s PE ratio as of September 8 stands at 4.74. Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) is taking a hit after S&amp;P Global Ratings downgraded it amid large deposit outflows and higher for longer rates.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 46 hedge funds out of the 910 funds in Insider Monkey’s database had stakes in Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA).Third Avenue Value Fund made the following comment about Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“The largest detractors from Fund performance during the quarter included two banks, Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) and Deutsche Bank. As it relates to the Fund specifically, events within U.S. banking applied most directly to our investment in Comerica, a U.S. super-regional that does have a large portion of corporate deposits and is not classified as a globally systemically important bank (“G-SIB”), which means it has not recognized certain mark-to-market securities losses in its regulatory capital. Comerica was a 2.6% position at the beginning of the quarter, prior to a roughly 34% stock price decline during the quarter. After purchasing more shares following the stock price decline, the Fund’s position in Comerica was approximately 2.3% at quarter end. While the general contagion fears and bank depositor behavior remain a fluid situation today, we took some confidence from immediate, forceful and targeted actions by the Fed, FDIC and Treasury. In our view, the Fed’s Bank Term Funding Program (“BTFP”) seems a well-tailored and appropriate near-term liquidity solution that allows banks to obtain immediate liquidity, collateralized by the par value of securities, to meet any near-term deposit outflows. At the time of this writing, early signs are that the deposit flight from regional banks is calming rapidly and depositor psychology is improving, though this could change. To the extent that calming continues, our suspicion is that there may be very attractive bargains to be had among regional banks. More will be known in the coming days and weeks as information regarding deposit flows emanates post-quarter end. That said, there will remain some mystery around the extent of the bargains on offer because increases in FDIC funding, increases in regulatory capital requirements, more stringent liquidity stress testing, and changes to the list of banks subject to G-SIB regulatory regimes are all on the table now. It is also very likely that deposit costs, which had been rising very slowly, will rise much more rapidly as commercial banks work harder to entice depositors to stay put. None of these developments, if they eventuate, are likely to impact banks’ returns and earnings in a positive way.More broadly, the Third Avenue Value Fund owned investments categorized as financials totaling 15.94% by weight, at quarter end. This category includes non-bank financials such as Old Republic, a U.S. property and casualty insurer and title insurance business, Lazard, an advisory business and asset management firm, and Ashmore, a U.K. asset management firm specializing in emerging markets credit. The Fund’s actual bank exposure at quarter end totaled 9.52% and is comprised of Bank of Ireland, Deutsche Bank and Comerica, in order of position size…” (Click here to read the full text)9.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 NASDAQ Stocks with Biggest Upside.The NASDAQ has surprised investors this year, thanks to the AI-driven rally in tech stocks that is making some analysts uneasy amid valuation concerns. As the US economy is still not out of the woods and there are warnings about recession, some analysts believe tech stock valuations have gone too far. For example, despite the outperformance of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 results and the company’s dominance in the generative AI-based chips domain, some analysts believe the stock is overvalued. Recently, Federated Hermes Chief Equity Strategist Phil Orlando, while talking to Yahoo Finance, highlighted the concentration of value and stock market gains in 2023 He said that eight major tech stocks are up about 65% in the first seven months of the year.“How are the other 492 companies doing in the S&amp;P 500? There up about 7%,” Orlando said.The analyst said that tech stocks are up for a large correction this year. He thinks NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the “poster child” of this “imbalance.”“From the bottom of the market last October to where NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s peaked out over the course of the last month or so, the stock has gone up by a multiple of five times. From a valuation perspective, they're trading at something like 40 times forward revenues and 130 times forward revenues and 130 times forward earnings. That, in our view, is excessive, and it's reminiscent of what the tech stocks did in that fourth quarter of 1999 as we were going into the Y2K calendar changeover.”Orlando said that tech companies like Apple and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) are “phenomenal” but amid the expected correction and pullback he’d rather invest in these companies later at cheaper prices. For now, Orlando thinks the market correction would open up new opportunities in value and small-cap stocks.Story continuesDespite warnings of a market correction, there are some stocks which still have huge upside potential according to experts. In this article we decided to talk about some of these stocks.Best NASDAQ Stocks with Biggest UpsidePhoto by Pascal Bernardon on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we conducted a survey of mainstream financial media and checked over 10 credible financial websites to see which NASDAQ stocks have potential to grow in the coming weeks and months according to these websites. We picked 10 stocks which frequently appeared in our survey. These stocks have upside potential according to notable financial websites. We have also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors having stakes in each of these companies. Some notable names in the list include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN),  Meta Platforms, Inc.

(NASDAQ:UPST) shares have gained about 137% year to date but the financial media outlets we surveyed believe the stock is expected to retain this momentum. In August, however, Upstart Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UPST) fell after the company gave soft Q3 guidance.In the second quarter Upstart Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UPST)’s adjusted EPS came in at $0.06 beating estimates by $0.13. Revenue in the period fell 40.5% year over year but still beat estimates by $0.45 million.Like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN),  Meta Platforms, Inc.

The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) was William B. Gray’s Orbis Investment Management which owns a $495 million stake in the company.Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG)’s management said the following during its latest earnings call:""We definitely see some of this margin also now going into 2025 as we sign up these customers, and the activity we’re seeing in the market. So, we expect that to be there over the next few years on the gross margin optimization also. And then, the macro trend of sustainability products is something that you add to that as it scales in the future. We’ve talked about our core product quite a bit with you all. The amount of volumes, we’re seeing there and the margins have been continuing to grow. And now we have the possibility with hourly CFE, carbon-free energy matching to look at the next wave of sustainability products to get our customers signed up for longer terms and for decent margins.So, we’re feeling good about the sustainability environment, and it really does start with the balance sheet. Our competitiveness is there. I think others in this interest rate environment with the collateral costs and the borrowing costs hit, quite do what we can do. So, I think it’s – we’re feeling good about it.""To read the full earnings call transcript click here.8. Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) is considered as a top tech stock with upside potential and many analysts also believe the stock is undervalued. Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) is expected to announce AI features integrated with its platform later this year. Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) recently jumped after the stock was added to the S&amp;P 500During the second quarter Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB)’s GAAP EPS came in at $0.98, beating estimates by $0.20. Revenue in the period jumped 18.1% year over year to $2.48 billion, surpassing estimates by $60 million.During Q2 earnings call Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) CEO talked about how AI and generative AI applications could be of use for the company:""First of all, when you call a hotel, they’re usually one property and they’re aware of every room. We’re nearly every country in the world. Often guest host will call us, and they will even potentially speak a different language than the person on the other side, the host, the guest and host. There are nearly 70 different policies that you could be adjudicating. Many of these are 100 pages long. So imagine a customer service agent trying to quickly deal with an issue with somebody from two people from two different countries in a neighborhood that the agent may never even have heard of.What AI can do, and we’re using a pilot to GPT-4, is AI can read all their policies. No human can ever quickly read all those policies. It can read the case history of both guests and hosts. It could summarize the case issue, and it can even recommend what the ruling should be based on our policies, and it can then write a macro that the customer service agent can basically adopt and amend. If we get all this right, it’s going to do things. And in your term, it’s going to actually make customer service a lot more effective, because agents will actually be able to handle a lot more tickets than many tickets. You’ll never even have to talk to an agent, but also the service to be more reliable, which will unlock more growth. Now, this of course leads to the bigger question.What can we do with AI? And I just wanted to offer a minute or two of thoughts, and I’ve shared this ...[Read the detailed transcript of the call here.]7. QUALCOMM, Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73QUALCOMM, Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is under pressure after the company gave weak Q4 guidance. QUALCOMM, Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is also taking a hit amid bad news from China and an overall lackluster consumer demand. During the fiscal third quarter QUALCOMM, Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM)’s adjusted EPS came in at $1.87 beating estimates by $0.06. Revenue in the period fell 22.7% year over year to $8.44 billion, missing estimates by $70 million.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 73 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in QUALCOMM, Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM). The biggest stakeholder of QUALCOMM, Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) was Israel Englander’s Millennium Management which owns a $270.2 million stake in the company.6. Booking Holdings Inc.

(NASDAQ:BKNG) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) was the largest positive contributor to the March 2023 quarterly performance. We meaningfully added to our investment in Booking in the middle of 2022 when the market was overly focused on disruptions to travel in Europe caused by airport understaffing and other COVID-19 induced inefficiencies, as well as concerns that an economic downturn would materially reduce discretionary travel. Since then, the travel environment has continued to normalise, with China being the last major market to open travel borders post COVID-19. People the world over have demonstrated their ongoing desire to travel, an industry that has historically grown significantly faster than GDP growth. Management has continued to execute a well-planned strategy to increase connections with customers booking accommodation, including offering flights, on ground transport, activities and payment options. After increasing over 20% in the December 2022 quarter, Booking’s share price increased a further 30%+ during the March 2023 quarter. Booking is now trading within our assessed view of fair value. We retain confidence that management will continue to deliver returns to shareholders and Booking remains one of the Fund’s largest holdings.” Click to continue reading and see 5 NASDAQ Stocks with Biggest Upside. Suggested articles:10 Best Dividend ETFs10 Worst Performing Commodity ETFs in 202310 Best Performing Asia Pacific ETFs in 2023Disclosure: None. 10 NASDAQ Stocks with Biggest Upside is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

113,a7163bce-98d7-3ccf-ad86-004d7a75a104,APD,2023-09-18,The 3 Best Hydrogen Stocks to Buy Now: September 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-best-hydrogen-stocks-buy-223059739.html,1694471459,STORY,"['PLUG', 'BE', 'APD']","[In the global push for clean energy, it seems increasingly likely that hydrogen will play a big role. Last year, more than 20 countries agreed to “boost output of low-emission hydrogen to at least 90 million tonnes a year by 2030” from current levels of one million tonnes annually. That is an indicator of the growth potential in the industry through the decade.Of course, the growth trajectory is likely to remain beyond the next seven years. Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Association President Morry Markowitz believes the “hydrogen industry can meet 14 percent of U.S. energy demand by 2050.”The International Energy Agency estimated the cost of “producing hydrogen from renewable electricity could fall 30% by 2030.” Declining cost is another catalyst for scaling up hydrogen production.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIt goes without saying that it’s a good time to consider exposure to some of the best hydrogen stocks. Considering the industry growth potential, quality hydrogen stocks are poised for multibagger returns.This column focuses on three of the best hydrogen stocks to buy and hold.Plug Power (PLUG)Person holding cellphone with logo of American hydrogen fuel cell company Plug Power Inc on screen in front of web page Focus on phone displaySource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.comPlug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) stock skyrocketed during the euphoric rally in the first quarter of 2021. However, the stock has been in a sustained correction mode. After a plunge of 73% in the last 12 months, PLUG stock is worth considering for the long term.For Q2 2023, Plug Power reported revenue of $260.2 million, a 72% increase year-over-year (YoY). The company also reaffirmed its 2023 revenue guidance of $1.2 to $1.4 billion. At the same time, Plug continued to report significant operating level losses.But I would look at the larger picture, considering the developments in the hydrogen economy. PLUG has guided revenue of $5 billion in 2026 with a gross margin of 30%. Revenue is expected to top $20 billion by 2030 with a gross margin of 35% and an operating income in excess of 20%.Story continuesTherefore, if the execution is right, PLUG stock will be a multibagger from current levels. The company believes it’s at an inflection point of growth. The deep correction seems like a golden accumulation opportunity.Air Products and Chemicals (APD)Air Products truck on motorway. APD stock.Source: Bjoern Wylezich / ShutterstockAir Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD) is among the blue-chip hydrogen stocks to buy and hold. APD stock looks attractive at a forward price-earnings ratio of 26 and offers a dividend yield of 2.34%.Considering strong fundamentals and high financial flexibility, Air Products should make big investments in the hydrogen economy. As a matter of fact, the company is already pursuing some of the largest hydrogen projects in the world. For example, Air Products teamed with the power utility conglomerate AES (NYSE:AES). The partnership will build a $4 billion green hydrogen production plant in North Texas.Similarly, the company will invest $4.5 billion to build, own and operate the world’s largest blue hydrogen production facility in Louisiana. Outside the United States, the company is investing in Saudi Arabia to supply 650 tons per day of carbon-free hydrogen for the transportation sector. With several other projects in the pipeline, the company has robust long-term growth visibility.Bloom Energy (BE)BE stock Bloom Energy logo on a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / ShutterstockBloom Energy (NYSE:BE) is among the best hydrogen stocks to buy and hold. After a correction of 43% in the last 12 months, the stock looks attractive. It’s worth noting that BE has a short interest that’s about 15% of the free float. I would expect a short-squeeze rally on a few positive business developments.As an overview, Bloom Energy is a producer of solid-oxide hydrogen fuel cells. The company’s fuel cell has already been deployed in hundreds of applications across healthcare, data centers, critical manufacturing and retailers. Therefore, the addressable market is significant.For Q2 2023, Bloom Energy reported healthy revenue growth of 23.8% YoY to $301.1 million. The company’s gross margin expanded by 1,950 basis points for the comparable period. With strong product shipment, the company expects growth to remain robust, and I believe that BE stock is poised for a strong reversal relatively soon.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(NYSE:OKE) stock, indicating that insiders' optimism about the company's prospects has increased.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for ONEOK ONEOK Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe President Pierce Norton made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.5m worth of shares at a price of US$60.96 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, at around the current price, which is US$67.54. That means they have been optimistic about the company in the past, though they may have changed their mind. While we always like to see insider buying, it's less meaningful if the purchases were made at much lower prices, as the opportunity they saw may have passed. In this case we're pleased to report that the insider purchases were made at close to current prices.ONEOK insiders may have bought shares in the last year, but they didn't sell any. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeONEOK is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.Insiders At ONEOK Have Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider buying at ONEOK. Overall, two insiders shelled out US$1.8m for shares in the company -- and none sold. This is a positive in our book as it implies some confidence.Does ONEOK Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. ONEOK insiders own about US$204m worth of shares (which is 0.7% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About ONEOK Insiders?It is good to see recent purchasing. And the longer term insider transactions also give us confidence. When combined with notable insider ownership, these factors suggest ONEOK insiders are well aligned, and quite possibly think the share price is too low. Looks promising! While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. When we did our research, we found 2 warning signs for ONEOK (1 can't be ignored!) that we believe deserve your full attention.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

Integrated with Oracle's electronic health record (EHR) solutions, the new Oracle Clinical Digital Assistant enables providers to leverage the power of generative AI together with voice commands to reduce manual work so they can focus more attention on patient care. It also makes it easy for patients to take self-service actions such as scheduling appointments or checking clinical information at their convenience using simple voice commands.(PRNewsfoto/Oracle)Clinical digital assistant:While EHRs have helped reduce errors and enhance the continuum of care, patients are often left feeling disconnected, unheard, and unsatisfied when a provider spends the majority of the appointment staring at a screen. The generative AI-powered Oracle Clinical Digital Assistant alleviates this issue to enable physicians to give their full attention to patients while dramatically simplifying administrative tasks. The multimodal voice and screen-based assistant participates in the appointment using generative AI to automate note taking and to propose context-aware next actions, such as ordering medication or scheduling labs and follow-up appointments.The Oracle Clinical Digital Assistant also responds to conversational voice commands from providers who can ask questions such as 'show me the patient's latest MRI results,' to look up elements of a patient's EHR record during an appointment. The information and images are then delivered in a relevant order that helps the physician gain insight into the appropriate treatment path without requiring a multi-menu, multi-step interaction with the EHR. The new solution will be available in the next 12 months.Story continues""The EHR should be a provider's best ally in delivering engaging, personalized care to the patients they serve,"" said Suhas Uliyar, senior vice president of product management, Oracle Health. ""By bringing comprehensive generative AI and voice-first capabilities to our EHR platforms, we are not only helping providers reduce mundane work that leads to burnout, but we are also empowering them to create better interactions with patients that establish trust, build loyalty, and deliver better outcomes.""Oracle Clinical Digital Assistant is built on the proven Oracle Digital Assistant platform that is already being used today to perform critical tasks for thousands of organizations across multiple industries.Patient self-service capabilities:New capabilities in the Oracle Digital Assistant Platform also enable patients to take more control over their healthcare. Patients can take self-service actions that range from using voice commands to schedule an appointment or pay a bill to getting generative AI-driven answers to questions such as, 'what happens during a colonoscopy?'Providers can also deliver helpful information to patients via web chat embedded in their secure patient portal, such as a reminder to bring required lab results to an upcoming visit. With these interactions, healthcare providers can advance patient retention with better engagement while significantly reducing revenue loss by avoiding common issues, such as missed appointments. These capabilities are available today.About Oracle Health ConferenceDiscover how Oracle Health is connecting an ecosystem of health innovation in Las Vegas on Sept. 18-20, 2023.

By running its most complex simulations on OCI, the Red Bull Ford Powertrains (RBFPT) engineering team is taking advantage of the latest cloud technologies to help overcome the challenge of building a sophisticated new business from the ground up.(PRNewsfoto/Oracle)OCI supplies massive processing power that allows RBFPT engineers to use digital simulations to evaluate concepts and refine designs before building a physical prototype. Using OCI, including bare metal compute and cluster networking, eliminated the expense and time required to implement a large scale on-premises high performance computing (HPC) solution. This approach allowed the engineering team to get started on designing and delivering the high-performance and sustainable engine quickly and to scale-up resources as needed.""Our powertrains team is operating at an incredibly high speed to debut competitive power units that use 100-percent sustainable fuels by 2026. Oracle gives us the best infrastructure and the expertise to integrate it with our processes, so we can accelerate our powertrain development and meet the substantial challenge ahead,"" said Christian Horner, Oracle Red Bull Racing Team Principal and CEO.Levelling the Track for Red Bull Ford PowertrainsIn 2021, Red Bull announced its intent to become a new independent Power Unit (PU) manufacturer for Formula One, and Red Bull Powertrains was born. Now evolved into two distinct businesses; Red Bull Powertrains which focuses on running the Honda-built PU spec for 2023-2025, and RBFPT, which has set an ambitious goal of developing 2026-specification PUs from the ground-up for the Oracle Red Bull Racing and Scuderia Alpha Tauri teams. The RBFPT team will be one of only six manufacturers supplying engines for the F1 series in 2026. To ensure it had the highest levels of performance, advanced data security, and could adjust the amount of processing power used almost instantly, RBFPT selected OCI to run the complicated calculations required to simulate the inner workings of a competitive race engine.Story continuesOne of the biggest challenges facing the RBFPT team in creating its 2026 PU was that its design work started from scratch. Like most startups, RBFPT's design began with a blank sheet of paper that lacked the benefit of historical product data. Because the team is competing against established PU manufacturers, RBFPT needed to maximize every technical advantage possible as it began the design process. The newly formed team at RBFPT have been solely reliant on digital simulations to find the optimal shapes and configurations for their initial PU designs. Powerful and highly flexible infrastructure from OCI not only gave them the platform to achieve this, but also expanded to meet the needs of the growing team as it on-boarded a large number of engineers in just a few months.Running Faster Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulations with OCIStandard high performance OCI shapes are perfectly suited for demanding tasks like simulations needed to optimize the power unit for maximum output while meeting F1's exacting requirements. OCI's high performance shapes are capable of networking multiple servers together for demanding HPC workloads like Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), which the team uses to model new engine combustion chambers rapidly and efficiently.To support the engineering of its internal combustion engine, RBFPT runs a range of highly specialized, mission-critical simulation tools including Convergent Science's CONVERGE CFD software and Siemens Digital Industry Software Star CCM (CFD) platform on OCI. With its array of highly specialized tools, RBFPT can quickly predict the performance of various engine designs and set up new simulations to help its engineering team more rapidly evaluate and refine options.""Cloud technology has had a monumental impact on the Red Bull team's journey, from the fan experience to the engine design and beyond. OCI has given Red Bull Ford Powertrains massive compute capacity to run and increase the scale of its workloads to deliver its next-generation hybrid engine by 2026,"" said Karan Batta, vice president, Product, OCI. ""Oracle Red Bull Racing's continued success on and off the track is a testament to the versatility and performance of our cloud solutions.""On the racetrack, Oracle continues to power the team's billions of race simulations that help improve race strategy and sharpen driver decision making. In addition, Oracle Red Bull Racing uses OCI to benefit its Sim Racing team and is using Oracle Fusion Cloud CX to power new fan engagement opportunities through 2023.Additional ResourcesLearn more about Oracle Cloud InfrastructureLearn more about CONVERGE on OCILearn more about Oracle's work with Oracle Red Bull RacingLearn more about Oracle Fusion Cloud CXAbout OracleOracle offers integrated suites of applications plus secure, autonomous infrastructure in the Oracle Cloud.

Collectively, zero-emission delivery startups have raised around $1 billion so far, according to Pitchbook and data collected by Reuters.They hope to grab market share during the long lead times while industry leaders are still gearing up. For instance, FedEx targets 2040 for its zero-emission delivery fleet; Deutsche Post DHL Group says 60% of its delivery fleet will be electric by 2030, the same year that Amazon plans to have 100,000 Rivian electric trucks in service. United Parcel Service expects 40% of its delivery vehicles to run on alternative fuel by 2025.Using their own routing technology for urban and suburban deliveries, these small but rapidly growing startups must scale up while also keeping prices low in a competitive market, which could also make them acquisition targets.""Nobody wants to pay more for sustainable delivery,"" said Niklas Tauch, CEO of Berlin-based Liefergrun, which delivers in big cities across Germany and Austria and lists fashion retailers H&amp;M and Inditex, and Hello Fresh among its customers.H&amp;M, the world's second-largest fashion retailer, said it is scaling up a number of zero-emission delivery initiatives ""through a variety of partnerships like the one... with Liefergrun.""Liefergrun builds out package hubs in city centers. It then contracts out deliveries to third parties, providing them with access to electric van deals from Mercedes-Benz or China's Maxus.Story continuesTauch said Leifergrun's revenue will grow sevenfold this year from ""single-digit millions"" of euros in 2022 and should hit ""triple-digit millions"" in 2024.So far Liefergrun has raised 15 million euros ($16 million) and will raise more next year to expand quickly.The clock is ticking as delivery giants invest vast sums to electrify their own fleets.In a pilot project, DHL will switch to 100% zero-emission last-mile e-commerce deliveries in the Netherlands by the end of this year, with other markets to follow through investments of ""double-digit billions"" of euros, said Deutsche Post DHL head of corporate development Yin Zou.UK startup Packfleet's revenue grew tenfold in 2022 and its fleet in London should grow to 400 electric vans in 2024 from around 50 now as it adds new customers.Packfleet will expand to Liverpool, Birmingham and Manchester next year and plans to be in the top 20 UK cities within two years.""The biggest requests from our customers are when can you expand and how soon can you take all of this volume?"" CEO Tristan Thomas said.'UNFORGIVING BUSINESS'Europe has so far proven more fertile ground for zero-emission package deliveries.But in New York, DutchX is launching a new service to bring small loaded containers into Manhattan by ferry, then load them onto Fernhay electric cargo bikes for city deliveries, said DutchX co-founder Marcus Hoed. The company will use the bikes to deliver packages for its customers - which include Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods.""Some customers are pushing very, very hard for as many zero-emission deliveries as possible,"" Hoed said.DutchX's revenue should rise by more than a third to around $40 million this year. The company will launch operations in Philadelphia this year, with three or four more additional U.S cities next year.DHL's Zou said investor pressure is mounting on logistics companies and customers alike to cut emissions.Some retailers have set tough targets. For instance, IKEA wants 100% zero-emission last-mile deliveries by 2025.The challenge for startups is that scaling up is difficult. Many use smaller vehicles than the typical delivery truck, squeezing profit margins because it is hard to deliver enough packages to offset labor and other costs.""Last-mile delivery is a very unforgiving business,"" said Sven Etzelsberger, CEO of California-based URB-E, which makes cargo containers for e-bikes.University of Tennessee logistics expert Thomas Goldsby said while the ""big dog"" carriers FedEx, UPS and DHL enjoy huge advantages of scale, regional companies can succeed.""As to the threat these startups present, certainly the established carriers will be keeping an eye on these developments,"" Goldsby said. ""They are also prone to acquiring any service provider that's doing something really cool.""DHL's Zou said zero-emission delivery startups are not a threat, but added ""we are always keen to look at them either for a commercial partnership or working together.""UK electric cargo-bike delivery startup Zedify operates in 10 UK cities, with seven more coming over the next six months, and already delivers packages for large firms like FedEx alongside its growing retailer base.Adding more cities brings national contracts from retailers, which will double Zedify's deliveries to 2 million packages this year and quadruple to 8 million in 2024, CEO Rob King said.Within four years, Zedify aims to be in the UK's nearly 50 cities with 100,000 or more residents.""We've proven that at volume, we make money and we are really efficient,"" King said. ""But getting to that scale is the challenge that anyone will have."" ($1 = 0.9323 euros) (Reporting By Nick Carey and Lisa Baertlein, editing by Ben Klayman and David Gregorio)]"

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Best Baking Countries in the World.The Baking Industry: An AnalysisAccording to a report by Research and Markets, the global bakery and confectionary industry was valued at $993.64 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow to $1.2 trillion by 2027, at a compound annual growth rate of 5.2% over the forecast period.Region wise, Asia Pacific dominates the market. China, Japan, India, and Australia are among the main markets for baked products. With increased urbanization in developing countries in Asia and an inclination towards convenient and ready-to-eat products, the demand for bakery products is increasing in the region.Western Europe serves to be the second most growing region in the bakery products industry. Germany, Italy, and France hold a major share in this market. Although baked products continue to be a source of indulgence and pleasure in Europe, customers are considering more hygienic, naturally flavored, gluten and additive free products to maintain a healthy lifestyle.A Competitive LandscapeThe global baked products market is saturated with several incumbents. Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ), Nestlé S.A. (OTC:NSRGY) and the Kellogg Company (NYSE:K) continue to have a strong market position in this regard.Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) is one of the largest multinational snack companies in the world known for its cookies, chocolates, and baked snacks. On July 27, the company reported its earnings for the second quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share of $0.76, and beat analyst estimates by $0.07. It also recorded a revenue of $8.51 billion, up 16.95% year over year and ahead of market consensus by $294.78 million. The company is trying to exploit the opportunity in the cakes and pastry market by expanding its offerings such as Oreo airy cake in China, cakesters in the United States, and pre-packaged croissants in Europe, to secure a higher share in this market. Commenting on the opportunity in the cake and pastry category for the brand, the CEO, Dirk Van de Put said:Story continues“The category itself has been growing quite nicely over the past three years. It is a category that exists across all markets. It covers different occasions than our typical biscuits and chocolate, so that makes it very interesting for them. And, so, we think with these new quality products and our brands, we can really make a significant impact. I’m not going to give an exact number, but we would expect that our cakes and pastry business in the coming year should double or triple and lift us up to close to a 10% market share. For us, it’s going to be a significant contribution to the growth of the company.”Another dominant player in the market is Nestlé S.A. (OTC:NSRGY). It has a huge presence in its native Swiss market. Some of its popular baked desserts include Nestle Toll House cookie pucks, edible cookie dough, and the chocolate chip cookie spread.  Since Nestle Toll House is the home to the company’s baked offerings, Nestlé S.A. (OTC:NSRGY) continues to update this category. On July 26, Nestle Toll House took the internet through an Instagram post where it announced that it will be relaunching its two most famous ready-to-bake cookie doughs namely the pumpkin spice cookie dough and M&amp;M’s ghoul mix sugar cookie dough in August. These products were previously available just for a limited time in 2022. Alongside, the company has also announced a new hot cocoa and marshmallow flavored morsel as the perfect fall treat for consumers around the world.The Kellogg Company (NYSE:K) is an American food manufacturing company that is quite established in its convenience foods market. The company is well known for its toaster pastries which replicate the original flavors of deserts distributed in multiple countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. On September 6, the company reported that Pop-Tarts, Kellogg company’s (NYSE:K) most famous brand in the United States, has announced a new frosted chocolate chip pancake flavor in the form of a toaster pastry.Emergence of Healthy IndulgenceThe trend of indulging in traditionally unhealthy things while seeking their health benefits has been on the rise. The purchase decisions of baked snacks enthusiasts have recently been driven by ingredients such as whole grains, natural sweeteners, nuts, seeds, and fruits which are perceived to have a positive impact on health. Understanding this evolving customer trend of healthy baked snacks, brands functioning in the bakery industry continue to incorporate healthy, nutritious, and low-calorie options for their consumers. Major market players such as Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ), Nestlé S.A. (OTC:NSRGY), and the Kellogg Company (NYSE:K) serve customers with traditional indulgent as well as nutritious baked products.In a  product lineup launched by the Canadian subsidiary of the Kellogg company (NYSE:K) for 2023, a vanilla almond protein bar, waffles in natural fruit flavors of strawberry and blueberry as well as a minimally processed waffle cereal with no artificial flavors were introduced. These products were especially meant to satisfy the urge of Canadian consumers to have occasional indulgence paired with nutrition in their baked products.Now that we have taken a look at the global baking industry and its beneficiaries, we can study the top 15 baking countries in the world.15 Best Baking Countries in the WorldMethodologyIn order to create a list of the 15 best baking countries in the world, we sourced data from the International Trade Centre’s export database. As the International Trade Centre reports, the Harmonized System from the World Customs Organization is a standardized numerical method of classifying traded products and is used internationally for the export of goods. Since ITC provides export statistics based on product groups, the product selected on the database was bread, pastry, cakes, biscuits, and other baker's wares. This category was selected based on the World Customs Organization’s classification of trade products according to which the harmonized code for baked products is 1905 and represents all processed baked products including crispbread, gingerbread, sweet biscuits, waffles, wafers, rusks, toasted bread and similar toasted products.The metric used for research was export volumes, expressed in dollars. The rationale behind choosing this metric was that an established baking industry implies that the national baked products are of high quality and hence demanded outside the country, in the form of exports. Thus, the best baking countries ought to have more exports. Finally, we have ranked the 15 best baking countries in the world, in ascending order of their export volumes from 2022, as follows:15 Best Baking Countries in the World:15.

There’s absolutely nothing wrong with that. However, if you want a little spice in your portfolio, you can still find it among the industry stalwarts.At first, the concept of high-potential large-cap stocks sounds counterintuitive, perhaps even illogical. After all, well-known large-capitalization companies almost always feature established, mature businesses. And such maturity – while it may lead to predictability – often means a lack of upside. Basically, the low-hanging fruit has already been picked. However, strange things can happen in the market. For various reasons, the below large-cap stocks to buy have more room to run.McDonald’s (MCD)McDonald's golden archesSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / ShutterstockOne of the world’s most famous large-cap stocks to buy, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) just might benefit from the trade-down effect. Essentially, consumers facing financial pressures don’t immediately cut all discretionary purchases. Instead, they trade down until they reach an acceptable equilibrium between quality and price.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAnother factor that could tilt the ball favorably for MCD centers on the competitive angle. Right now, major corporations are getting more aggressive with their return-to-work policies. Between well-heeled companies and individual employees, my bet is that the latter will crack first. Given this assumption, stressed-out worker bees will likely seek out cheap sources of caffeine, which favors McDonald’s.Financially, investors of large-cap stocks can also depend on its solid financials. For instance, it features an above-average three-year revenue growth rate (per-share basis) of 3.8%. It’s also consistently profitable.Finally, analysts peg MCD as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target over the next 12 months lands at $332.32, implying 19% upside potential.Story continuesMondelez (MDLZ)The Mondelez website magnified by a magnifying glassSource: ShutterstockAn American multinational confectionery, food, and beverage company, Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) may also be a beneficiary of the trade-down effect. Basically, as consumers face significant economic pressure – and as personal savings dwindle – many households will do away with going out to eat. Instead, we should see greater demand in the grocery aisles, which should bolster MDLZ.Generally speaking, options traders appear to have a favorable view of MDLZ based on its volatility smile. While implied volatility (IV) – roughly a weather forecast for the underlying option – spikes in the deep in-the-money strike prices, between the $65 and $75 strike prices, IV is consistent. From $75 upward, IV rises, which may indicate longer-term bullish speculation.Financially, Mondelez features a so-so profile if I’m being perfectly honest. However, it does have strong margins and is consistently profitable on an annual basis.Lastly, analysts peg MDLZ as a strong buy with an $83.57 price target, implying nearly 20% upside potential.Cheniere Energy (LNG)LNG stock: the Cheniere logo displayed on a phoneSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Houston, Texas, Cheniere Energy (NYSEAMERICAN:LNG) is a liquefied natural gas company; hence the ticker symbol. Since the start of the year, LNG gained nearly 16% of its equity value. Much of the positive returns have come relatively recently as the underlying industry received a cynical boost from various geopolitics-related upside catalysts.Moving forward, it’s reasonable to anticipate sustained interest in Cheniere due to the importance of LNG for the global economy. Also, traders appear to be cognizant of the upside potential. From the $180 strike price, IV rises from 0.21 to 0.55 at the $240 strike. Shares recently closed at $162.68.To be fair, IV spiked in the deep ITM direction, hitting 0.95 at the $85 strike. This dynamic may indicate traders accounting for possible tail risk (i.e. black swan event). While a sharp correction is always possible, here’s the great news: analysts peg LNG as a unanimous strong buy with a $203.30 average price target, implying 25% growth. Thus, it’s one of the large-cap stocks to buy.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comBased in Sunnyvale, California, Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) develops, manufactures, and markets robotic products designed to improve the clinical outcomes of patients through minimally invasive surgery. Its most popular product is the da Vinci Surgical System. Since the beginning of this year, ISRG gained over 12% of its equity value. In the trailing year, it’s up nearly 35%.Despite already being one of the top large-cap stocks, ISRG may still have some room left in the tank. Looking at the options market, IV rises from a low of 0.23 at the $310 strike price to 0.75 at the $460 strike. Thus, the rise in IV toward the far out-the-money (OTM) direction may indicate optimistic speculation.In fairness, in the deep ITM direction, IV spikes to 1.08 at the $170 strike, reflecting possible mitigation of tail risks. However, Intuitive benefits from a no-debt balance sheet, along with solid sales and excellent margins. Plus, analysts peg ISRG as a strong buy. Their average price target stands at $377.14, implying over 26% upside.Stellantis (STLA)A flag with the logo for Stellantis waves outside a building with the logos for some of its car brands, including Abarth, Lancia, Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Jeep.Source: Antonello Marangi / Shutterstock.comIn prior articles for InvestorPlace, I sang the praise of auto firm Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) for its upcoming 2024 Dodge Charger EV. In a nutshell, while EVs are incredibly popular these days, some of the designs look bland. Frankly, a good many customers want a robust, masculine car that evokes the experience of a true street racing machine. Over time, I believe the electric Charger should perform very well, expanding Dodge’s total addressable market.It’s possible that the institutional traders sense the upside prospect. On Sept. 6, traders bought $19 calls with an expiration date of Sept. 15. Also, many others sold $17 puts – which have a bullish implication – with the same Sept. 15 expiry. In addition, big block trades for bought calls and sold puts which expire in 2024 and 2025 respectively have been placed.Financially, Stellantis flaunts a solid balance sheet, better-than-average revenue growth, and excellent profit margins. It also trades at a low forward earnings multiple of 3.1x. Turning to the Street, analysts peg STLA as a strong buy. Their average price target comes in at $24.14, implying over 32% upside.Delta Air Lines (DAL)The Delta Air Lines (DAL) logo is seen on an airplane in flight.Source: VanderWolf Images/Shutterstock.comHeading into the riskiest side of large-cap stocks to buy, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) naturally appeals to many investors. Relatively speaking, consumer sentiment – though it ebbs and flows of course – has been solidly robust post-pandemic. Even better for DAL, the revenge travel phenomenon has carried experience-related enterprises. So, it’s possible that DAL has more upside remaining.Yes, DAL has already gained over 25% since the beginning of this year. However, consumers continue to prioritize experiences that were denied them during the Covid-19 quarantines. If you’re convinced that this catalyst will sustain, Delta could be intriguing.Further, while a speculative thesis, options flow data reveals that a lot of bought puts will expire soon on Sept. 15. Once that cloud is gone, it’s possible – though hardly guaranteed – that DAL stock could swing higher. Looking at Wall Street, analysts peg DAL as a unanimous strong buy. And that’s from 17 experts, by the way. As well, the average price target clocks in at $59.69, implying over 46% upside potential.JD.com (JD)the JD.com (JD) logo on the outside of a buildingSource: testing / Shutterstock.comAlmost inarguably the riskiest idea among large-cap stocks to buy, JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) is one of the biggest companies in China. Per its public profile, its e-commerce business represents one of the two massive business-to-consumer online retailers in the country. As well, JD invests heavily in advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence.However, since the start of the year, JD slipped nearly 44%. Much of the pain centers on the slow economic recovery in China. With analysts raising concerns about the viability of the Chinese consumer base, folks have simply moved away from JD stock.But could that be a mistake? Notably, JD’s options volatility smile shows IV spiking in the far OTM direction. And while IV also increased in the deep ITM direction, it didn’t do so with the same magnitude. Unsurprisingly, institutional traders appear to have sold put contracts (which again have bullish implications) to take advantage of heightened premiums.Finally, analysts peg JD as a strong buy with a $57.08 average target, implying over 76% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Boston Scientific Boston Scientific Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, Eric Francis Thepaut, sold US$2.8m worth of shares at a price of US$52.49 per share. That means that even when the share price was slightly below the current price of US$52.90, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was 81% of Eric Francis Thepaut's stake.Insiders in Boston Scientific didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Boston Scientific insiders own about US$166m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Boston Scientific Insiders?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Boston Scientific, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 3 warning signs for Boston Scientific you should know about.Of course Boston Scientific may not be the best stock to buy.

They cited some credit deterioration, savings declines, and spending slowdowns.Fifth Third CEO Timothy Spence said checking account data at his Cincinnati-based bank show financial difficulties for lower-income customers are more pronounced for people who don’t own their homes.“Renters with lower incomes are essentially back to or below pre-pandemic levels of liquidity. There is no buffer left there,” Spence said Wednesday at a Barclays banking conference in New York.The strength of the US consumer is a subject of debate across the financial world at a time when economic data has been coming in largely stronger than expected despite the Federal Reserve's interest rate hiking campaign as the central bank seeks to cool inflation.Thus far the consumer has been relatively resilient and there is data even suggesting low-income consumer spending has held up better than spending among those with higher incomes. But headwinds are mounting as job and wage growth slow, student loan payments restart, and borrowing conditions tighten.That could all spell some trouble for banks that have been leaning heavily on consumer lending in recent quarters as companies turn more cautious about the economy. Credit card delinquencies have been steadily rising since 2021, according to Fed data, a steeper climb than any point since 2009 after dropping to multi-decade lows.“As we sit here today, savings are still, in aggregate, slightly above pre-pandemic levels,” Capital One CFO Andrew Young said this past week.Story continuesOverall savings of his bank’s customers are still slightly above pre-pandemic levels but those with lower incomes “are roughly back” to where they were before the pandemic started. Capital One is a major credit card lender.Still, though, these consumers are “in a position of strength,” he explained.Dean Athanasia, Bank of America’s president of regional banking, said consumers still have excess cash in bank accounts that they will continue to spend down through the rest of the year.“It's a slow travel down on the consumer side,” he said.A Bank of America branch. (Getty Images) (Oksana Drobotun via Getty Images)Mike Mayo, a bank analyst for Wells Fargo, said the largest banks have already set aside money for loan losses in a potential scenario where the unemployment rate reaches 5%. It was 3.8% in August, up from 3.6%.Over the next couple of years Mayo still anticipates loan losses at the banks he covers “almost doubling” though historically still remaining “below the long-term average.”Banks are starting to pull away from making as many new consumer loans as they have in the past, especially those deemed riskiest.Another top banker who urged caution about the future strength of the US consumer this past week was Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase (JPM). He cited the possibility of a prolonged period of high interest rates, rising costs of oil, economic uncertainties facing China, and global fiscal debt.“We don’t know the full effect of what all of this is going to be 12 or 18 months from now,” he said.The consumer at the moment is “pretty good” but “to say the consumer is strong today, meaning you’re going to have a booming environment for years, is a huge mistake.”Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

The annual event aims to raise public awareness about the importance of safety around railroad tracks and rail crossings.Norfolk Southern Corporation Logo (PRNewsfoto/Norfolk Southern Corporation)In recognition of Rail Safety Week, Norfolk Southern offers the following four tips to help the public stay safe:Avoid stopping on railroad tracks. Before crossing, be sure there is space on the other side to completely clear the tracks.When crossing, ensure you can clearly see down the tracks in both directions before proceeding and that your vehicle will completely clear the tracks.Train tracks are meant for trains. Do not walk, jog, or bicycle on or beside them.Only cross train tracks at designated pedestrian or roadway crossings.""Trains play an important role in our economy – carrying the goods that fill our stores and help fuel our factories. Every day, trains move through our communities, and we want the public to be safe as they approach railroad tracks and crossings,"" said John Fleps, Vice President Safety. ""Norfolk Southern is proud to again partner with Operation Lifesaver to raise awareness among drivers and pedestrians about the importance of rail safety – all to prevent injuries and save lives.""More than 60% of vehicle-train collisions occur at active railroad crossings with either crossing lights or gates. The number of train/motor vehicle collisions has declined 82 percent since 1972 from 12,000 annual incidents to approximately 2,190 incidents in 2022.Norfolk Southern makes annual improvements to its infrastructure to help the public stay safe at rail crossings.

You can skip our detailed analysis on countries where these two companies have the least penetration or are not sold at all by heading over to 5 Countries where Pepsi or Coca-Cola is Not Sold.The global soft drinks market had an estimated value of $413 billion in 2021, according to Straits Research, and is projected to cross $620 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of 5.23%. Coca-Cola and Pepsi are the two major powerhouses in the industry. So much so that ‘coke’ and ‘pepsi’ are often used interchangeably when referring to sodas or soft drinks. These drinks are sold across the world and can be found in the drinks menu of almost any restaurant you go to.The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) sells its products in more than 200 countries and territories. The company, which ranks 93 in the Fortune 500 list, has an impressive record of innovation, which has propelled Coca-Cola to become one of the most successful brands in corporate history. According to the company’s website, Coca-Cola is the world’s second most understood word after ‘okay’.Founded in 1892, the company’s first international export was to Cuba in 1899. However, it was not until World War II that Coca-Cola’s global expansion started to take off with the company wanting to ensure that every US soldier, stationed in any base from Europe to the Pacific, could find coke and feel the comfort of home. The secret of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)’s global dominance can also be attributed to its franchise distribution system, through which the company produces syrup concentrate and sells it to bottlers around the world. Under this distribution system, more than two billion servings of Coca-Cola are produced every day across 900 bottling plants globally.The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) holds a 43.7% share of the carbonated soft drinks market in the United States, and had a global market value of over $250 billion by September this year. Sales continue to rise each year. Revenues have grown 6% in the second quarter this year compared to the same time in the previous year, to a total of $12 billion. James Quincy, the Chairman and CEO of Coca-Cola made the following remarks in the company’s Q2 2023 Earnings Call:Story continues""We’ve successfully navigated the first half of the year, which supports our decision to raise guidance for the full year. And instead of trying to predict the many directions things could take, we remain focused on delivering our key objectives that we outlined in February. In other words, number one, pursuing excellence globally and winning locally through relentless consumer centricity to drive top-line momentum. Two, investing for the long-term health of our business and raising the bar across all elements of our strategic flywheel. And three, generating US dollar EPS growth. Our system has never been stronger and our global network model is allowing us to quickly adapt to changing environments. We believe we are well positioned to deliver our updated guidance and objectives, thanks to our incredible system employees around the world.""On the other hand, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is the second most valued soft drink brand after Coca-Cola, with the brand valued at $18.4 billion as of 2021 according to Brand Finance. Like Coke, Pepsi is also sold in more than 200 countries and territories across the world. While Coca-Cola largely outsells PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) at the global level, there are some countries where Pepsi outsells Coke and holds a larger share in those markets. These include India, Pakistan, Guatemala, Oman, and several provinces of Canada.One of the key reasons why PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) has been able to penetrate the global markets and catch up with The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is its competitive pricing strategy, through which it ensures that its products are priced in line with or below those of its competitors. The company’s CEO, Ramon Laguarta, shed light on this in PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) Q2 2023 Earnings Call.""We’re seeing in the majority of the markets where we operate, we’re seeing better elasticities and that has continued to be during the first half of the year, even though we’re seeing lower income consumers strategizing around obviously optimizing their budgets, but we’re seeing the majority of consumers staying within our categories, staying within our brands. And it’s remarkable what our marketing teams are, commercial teams have been doing to minimize elasticities. In some respect, it is what we have been investing for the last few years. Our brands are stronger. The perceived value of our products is better than it was. And obviously, we’ve been able to raise prices and consumers stay within our brands. Now we’re seeing consumers making some adjustments, right?We’re seeing consumers shopping in more stores than before. They’re looking for better deals. They’re starting to look for optimization. They’re going to channels that have better perceived value. They’re buying more in Dollar stores or they buy more in mass or in clubs. So every segment of the consumer is making adjustments. Overall, we’re seeing very positive.""The global market penetration of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) remains huge. However, there are countries where these soft drinks have been perceived to be advancing American values and ideals, and have faced local resistance. There are also nations where people prefer their own local sodas or soft drinks compared to Coke or Pepsi. Lastly, there are countries where these drinks are not sold due to economic sanctions or political instability and conflict.Let's check out countries where Coca Cola and Pepsi are either banned, sell comparitively less or are outsold by local brands.MethodologyWe have ranked the 15 countries where Pepsi or Coca-Cola is not sold by identifying countries where these drinks are not sold at all, have limited availability, whether they are outsold or have conceded a sizable chunk of the market share to another brand. Various news stories and publications from media groups have been used to prepare this list.First, we look at countries where Coca-Cola and Pepsi are facing competition from local brands or are outsold by another drink. Then we identify countries where Pepsi or Coca-Cola have limited availability; these countries are listed in the order of the adverse impact faced by these brands in their host countries, since no data is available on their market penetration levels due to ongoing conflicts and political instability. Lastly, countries where Pepsi or Coca-Cola is not sold are ranked going by the number of years since these brands ceased operations in these countries.15 Countries where Pepsi or Coca-Cola is Not Soldnik-albert-pGQpBcylvOA-unsplashLet's now head over to the list of countries where Pepsi or Coca-Cola is not sold as much as it is elsewhere in the world in terms of market penetration.15 Countries where Pepsi or Coca-Cola is Not Sold15. IranStatus: Facing Local CompetitionRival Beverage: Zamzam ColaRival Beverage's Market Share: 16%Zamzam Cola is a soft drink brand manufactured in Iran by Zamzam Group. It is among the first carbonated soft drinks produced in the country and is popular across Western Asia. The drink is named after the Well of Zamzam in Saudi Arabia, which is one of the stops during the Hajj Pilgrimage for muslims. The soft drink had an estimated share of 50% in the Iranian soft drink industry in 2007. That has now dropped to 16%. Coca Cola holds a 28% share, while Pepsi has penetration levels of only 20%.14. PeruStatus: Outsold by a Local BrandRival Beverage: Inca ColaRival Beverage's Market Share: 26%Peru is one of the few countries where a local soft drink outsells both Coca-Cola and Pepsi. Inca Cola is marketed as ‘the taste of Peru’ and includes Incan designs on the packaging labels, which invokes a passionate following for the drink among Peruvians. The drink held 26% in the soft drink market in 2012, followed by The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) at 25.5%. A report in the Sydney Morning Herald in 2023 stated that Inca Cola still outsells Coke in Peru.13. MyanmarStatus: Limited AvailabilityThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) opened its first plant in over 60 years in Myanmar in 2013, after the military junta’s rule over the country ended in 2011, having led the country since 1962. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), which operated in the country between 1991 and 1997 has also ramped up its operations through local partnerships to catch up with Coca-Cola. Local alternatives mimicking these brands, such as Star Cola and Max Cola, held sway over the carbonated drinks market in Myanmar until Coca-Cola relaunched itself in the market. However, despite that, Myanmar is one of the countries with lowest sales of Coca Cola and Pepsi.12. NamibiaStatus: Limited AvailabilityNamibia has been facing a drought for the last seven years, which has resulted in limited availability of soft drinks in the country. Coca-Cola in 2016 decided to stop production of canned drinks in the country and import it instead from South Africa due to the water crisis in the country. This led to the drink facing shortage in the market and being sold at higher rates wherever these were available.11. ZimbabweStatus: Limited AvailabilityZimbabwe’s economic crisis and political instability have hampered operations of several large corporations operating in the country. Both Coca-Cola and Pepsi face regular shortages of supplies due to Zimbabwe’s depleting foreign exchange reserves. Coke and Pepsi are luxury products in a country facing hyperinflation which often experiences an acute shortage of a basic necessity like bread. In recent years, the production and supplies of Coca-Cola came to a complete halt twice, first in 2006 and then in 2018.10. Democratic Republic of the CongoStatus: Limited AvailabilityIt is hard to find Coca-Cola or Pepsi in Congo if you are not living in the capital Kinshasa or some of the other bigger towns in the country that sit on the river. Everything becomes hard to find as you move away from the city center due to a lack of transport infrastructure in Congo. Most of the roads in the country are not more than dirty narrow paths. Where Coke or Pepsi are available, they are unaffordable for many. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is among the five poorest countries in the world, according to the World Bank.9. SomaliaStatus: Limited AvailabilityThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) entered the Somali market in 2004 by setting up a factory in Mogadishu. Civil unrest in the country forced the company to move its operations to Hargeisa, the capital of the self-declared breakaway Republic of Somaliland in 2012, creating a shortage of the cola soft drink in much of Somalia. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) has been a direct victim of the conflict in Somalia. Gunmen attacked the plant in Mogadishu in 2007, looted cash, computers, and sugar, and fled away. The company has also received threats of violence from militant group Al-Shabaab.8. HaitiStatus: Limited AvailabilityHaiti has been engulfed in total chaos since 2018, starting with protests against rising fuel and energy prices and later the assassination of President Jovenel Moise. The spread of cholera and famine have made matters worse for the country. Instability in the country has empowered gangs, who have created a blockade around the largest fuel depot in the country. This has led to shortage of food, acute hunger, and disruption of supply chains across Haiti. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are among companies that have been affected by the ongoing crisis, with these soft drinks barely available in the markets.7. SudanStatus: Limited AvailabilityArmed conflict and economic sanctions have halted international trade operations of multiple large companies with the country. In fact, the turmoil has threatened global supplies of soft drink companies including The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP). Sudan is the largest producer of gum arabic, a key ingredient used in fizzy drinks, candies, and cosmetics. Coca-Cola and Pepsi have been stockpiling the ingredient for months to avoid shortage.6. TurkmenistanStatus: Limited AvailabilityStrict government regulations have limited the operations of international corporations.

137,f7c8dc3a-a1a0-3b85-89ef-5a1a034ba9b2,GE,2023-09-18,GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 66% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ge-healthcare-technologies-inc-nasdaq-130022161.html,1694955622,STORY,"['GEHC', 'GE']","[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, GE HealthCare Technologies' stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions52% of the business is held by the top 7 shareholders Recent sales by insiders Every investor in GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 66% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about GE HealthCare Technologies. View our latest analysis for GE HealthCare Technologies ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About GE HealthCare Technologies?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that GE HealthCare Technologies does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see GE HealthCare Technologies' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. GE HealthCare Technologies is not owned by hedge funds. General Electric Company is currently the largest shareholder, with 14% of shares outstanding. Capital Research and Management Company is the second largest shareholder owning 11% of common stock, and The Vanguard Group, Inc. holds about 8.5% of the company stock.On further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 7 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of GE HealthCare TechnologiesWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of GE HealthCare Technologies Inc.. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$48m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 20% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Public Company OwnershipPublic companies currently own 14% of GE HealthCare Technologies stock. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for GE HealthCare Technologies  that you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Undervalued Stocks To Buy Now.Much has been said and will be said about value investing and the art of picking stocks that are trading below their true value. But legendary value investor Howard Marks has penned some great words of wisdom on this topic that remain unprecedented. His book entitled “The Most Important Thing” needs more attention, especially during volatile times of today when investors are scrambling to make sense of the stock market movements.A chapter in Marks’ book entitled “The Most Important Thing is … Value” talks in detail about different approaches to investing. Marks shows us the cracks and weaknesses of technical analysis-based investing techniques and why momentum investing and analyzing a stock based on its past trends is not the right approach. While Marks vehemently rejects any kind of conjecture or speculation and touts the usefulness of value investing, he acknowledges that value investing also gives importance to taking into account the future when it comes to stock analysis. He says:“It would be convenient to say that adherence to value investing permits investors to avoid conjecture about the future and that growth investing con sists only of conjecture about the future, but that would be a considerable exaggeration. After all, establishing the current value of a business requires an opinion regarding its future, and that in turn must take into account the likely macro-economic environment, competitive developments and technological advances. Even a promising net-net investment can be doomed if the company’s assets are squandered on money-losing operations or un- wise acquisitions. There’s no bright-line distinction between value and growth; both re- quire us to deal with the future. Value investors think about the company’s potential for growth, and the “growth at a reasonable price” school pays explicit homage to value. It’s all a matter of degree. However, I think it can fairly be said that growth investing is about the future, whereas value investing emphasizes current-day considerations but can’t escape dealing with the future.”Story continuesMarks also emphasizes in the book about appreciating the role of luck and randomness and builds upon the ideas of Nassim Nicholas Taleb who discussed the matters of luck in his famous book Fooled by Randomness. Marks’ intention behind this chapter is to highlight the importance of having long-term outlook while investing. Making $1 million playing Russian roulette is not same as making $1 million through several years of patient investing. Even a terrible financial advisor could get lucky and post huge returns in a month or a year but that would only be by sheer luck and this advisor might feel good for a few months but he would ultimately be exposed. That’s why investors should not be fooled by short-term news cycles if they truly want to invest in companies that have intrinsic value.Best Undervalued Stocks to BuyHoward Marks of Oaktree Capital ManagementOur MethodologyFor this article we surveyed at least 15 credible financial websites and picked 14 stocks that these websites believe are undervalued.

So this is behind our strengths. Then I wanted to underline the strengths of our innovation. Our innovation is strong. It’s also in tough challenging year like 2023, remains at 25%. And the innovation pipeline for 2024, 2025 is very, very strong. Particularly in 2025, we have some extra wide spaces innovation, which are very promising. So this also will support the continuous strength of these other parts of the business — other regions, as you mentioned. And then finally, the execution in this region has been stepping up because we explained that as the recovery from the pandemic progress, our ability to execute in the post-pandemic world has been developed and is getting better and better month after month.So in the regions which have been faster in the post-pandemic development, we have been faster in recovering great execution and great results, so this will continue to progress in 2024. So we have good confidence on that. On the U.S. where, on the contrary, we said there is work to be done, the team is very focused on doing this work. We have a very clear plan. Again, I summarized them in the prepared remarks, but to go back to them, our strategy in rebuilding the North America growth is really various [indiscernible] four big building blocks. The first one is a very rich pipeline of newness, which is later in 2024 and further reinforced in 2025, focus on breakthrough innovation on new claims that will help also unlocking the consumers in online, and especially multi more aggressively.”Here is what Aristotle Atlantic Partners has to say about The Estee Lauder Companies Inc.

Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) ranks 10th in our list of the best undervalued stocks to buy according to the media. Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) is recommended by several financial websites amid its attractive valuation. Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA)’s PE ratio as of September 8 stands at 4.74. Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) is taking a hit after S&amp;P Global Ratings downgraded it amid large deposit outflows and higher for longer rates.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 46 hedge funds out of the 910 funds in Insider Monkey’s database had stakes in Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA).Third Avenue Value Fund made the following comment about Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“The largest detractors from Fund performance during the quarter included two banks, Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) and Deutsche Bank. As it relates to the Fund specifically, events within U.S. banking applied most directly to our investment in Comerica, a U.S. super-regional that does have a large portion of corporate deposits and is not classified as a globally systemically important bank (“G-SIB”), which means it has not recognized certain mark-to-market securities losses in its regulatory capital. Comerica was a 2.6% position at the beginning of the quarter, prior to a roughly 34% stock price decline during the quarter. After purchasing more shares following the stock price decline, the Fund’s position in Comerica was approximately 2.3% at quarter end. While the general contagion fears and bank depositor behavior remain a fluid situation today, we took some confidence from immediate, forceful and targeted actions by the Fed, FDIC and Treasury. In our view, the Fed’s Bank Term Funding Program (“BTFP”) seems a well-tailored and appropriate near-term liquidity solution that allows banks to obtain immediate liquidity, collateralized by the par value of securities, to meet any near-term deposit outflows. At the time of this writing, early signs are that the deposit flight from regional banks is calming rapidly and depositor psychology is improving, though this could change. To the extent that calming continues, our suspicion is that there may be very attractive bargains to be had among regional banks. More will be known in the coming days and weeks as information regarding deposit flows emanates post-quarter end. That said, there will remain some mystery around the extent of the bargains on offer because increases in FDIC funding, increases in regulatory capital requirements, more stringent liquidity stress testing, and changes to the list of banks subject to G-SIB regulatory regimes are all on the table now. It is also very likely that deposit costs, which had been rising very slowly, will rise much more rapidly as commercial banks work harder to entice depositors to stay put. None of these developments, if they eventuate, are likely to impact banks’ returns and earnings in a positive way.More broadly, the Third Avenue Value Fund owned investments categorized as financials totaling 15.94% by weight, at quarter end. This category includes non-bank financials such as Old Republic, a U.S. property and casualty insurer and title insurance business, Lazard, an advisory business and asset management firm, and Ashmore, a U.K. asset management firm specializing in emerging markets credit. The Fund’s actual bank exposure at quarter end totaled 9.52% and is comprised of Bank of Ireland, Deutsche Bank and Comerica, in order of position size…” (Click here to read the full text)9.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Low Risk Investments in 2023.Investors are still in a wait and see mode after the latest inflation and retail sales report which give mixed signals. Some analysts are still of the view that the US economy could face a recession by the end of this year or in the first half of 2024. Recently, Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson, who has been one of the strongest bearish voices on the Wall Street, warned that the increased US government spending that injected a lot of optimism in the markets would not bode well for US stocks. The analyst said that US has not seen such a high deficit when unemployment is so low.However, Wilson acknowledged that the recession predictions and bearish notes have hitherto been proven false. And Wilson does not think we would necessarily face a full-blown recession. He said that the central bank’s fiscal policies have already ushered in a “down cycle” and he is convinced that growth is slowing.Wisdom Tree in its third quarter of 2023 report said that volatility has become a constant in the market. The firm believes inflation will keep cooling and the Federal Reserve might be near the end of its rate hike cycle. The firm said the central bank might go on an extended pause once it concludes its current rate hike cycle. Wisdom Tree rules out any possibility of rate cuts this year but believes that topic could gain more relevance in the first half of 2024. Wisdom Tree also talked about the AI rally that gave a huge boost to many stocks. The firm believes this hype could subside as investors’ excitement around AI abates slowly. Wisdom Tree is concerned that some parts of the market are trading on hype.The Wisdom Tree report said that while the bull market started back in October 2022, stock valuations are still attractive.“The value cycle turns out to be just a value trade—a shorter term run for dividend concepts that ended last autumn. Additionally, continued levitation from zero-yielding Silicon Valley giants would be troublesome. This year has been horrible for value-oriented mandates, along with most everything that was not mega cap growth. Stocks that can demonstrate durable profitability and reasonable valuations were the type that held up during the 2022 sell-off; we suspect they are opportune in 2023’s second half,” the report said.Story continuesTime and again successful investors have emphasized the importance of not losing money while investing in the stock market. When markets are volatile you have to find high conviction, low risk plays that are insulated from market crashes. David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital talked about the importance of finding high conviction plays and going all in in an interview in 2005. He said:“We believe in constructing the portfolio so that we put our biggest amount of money in our highest-conviction idea, and then we view the other ideas relative to that. We find things that we think are exceptional only occasionally. So if we find some- thing that is really set up, where we think it’s mispriced, where we have a good understanding of why it’s mispriced, where we think the mispricing is very large and the overall risk is very small, we take an outsized position to make sure we give ourselves the chance to be well compensated for getting it right.""Best Low Risk Investments in 2023Photo by Marga Santoso on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we first used a stock screener to identify US stocks with beta values less than 1.

Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 78Data monitoring and security platform company Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) ranks 15th in our list of the best low risk investments in 2023. As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 78 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG).In August, T.D. Cowen started covering Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) with an Outperform rating. The firm’s analyst Andrew Sherman set a $120 price target on Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG).RiverPark Large Growth Fund made the following comment about Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG): DDOG was a top detractor in the quarter. The company reported strong 4Q results including 44% revenue growth and 30% earnings growth but gave cautious revenue guidance for 2023. Macroeconomic headwinds have caused clients to slow the transition of workloads to the cloud and instead to optimize current capacity. Despite this temporary slowdown, DDOG still expects revenue to grow nearly 25% in 2023.As businesses have transitioned to cloud software infrastructure, much of which is in isolated data silos, it has become increasingly difficult for data engineers to monitor and analyze system performance. Datadog provides a SaaS software platform to monitor and analyze the system performance of software applications and IT infrastructure by giving users a single page view to observe their company’s technology stack. The company has quickly grown its revenue from $100 million in 2017 to $1.7 billion in 2022 and, we believe, should continue to grow revenue at more than 20% annually as it penetrates its $40 billion and fast-growing market. Less than 10% of software applications are currently monitored. The company’s dollar-based net retention rate has been 130%+ as existing customers continue to use an increasing number of products and the company continues to add new features. As of 4Q22, 81% of customers used 2+ products, while only 18% of customers used 6+ products (up from less than 1% two years ago). As an extremely capex light software business, DDOG already has significant free-cash-flow ($350m in 2022) and free-cash-flow margins (21% in 2022).”14. Walmart Inc.

Two thirds of its customers are covered under commercial and specialty arrangements, and the other third is covered under government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.

To name a few, obesity increases the risk of type 2 diabetes by 243%, coronary heart disease by 69%, hypertension by 113%, dyslipidemia by 74%.The overall cost of obesity-rated complications and comorbidities are massive, accounting for $370 billion in direct medical cost, over $1 trillion in indirect annual costs in the U.S. People living with obesity or overweight drive 2.7 greater health care costs than normal-weight individuals. The global health stakeholders really need to be moved beyond the debate and really move to action on the AOM class. With tirzepatide’s potential to provide over 20% weight loss, it should provide great value for payers. We have a comprehensive real-world evidence plan and clinical plan to demonstrate tirzepatide’s value, including our MMO OUTCOMES trial. Based on the SELECT trial results, we can’t wait to see the results of tirzepatide/MMO study. We do believe that additional weight loss will matter.""Read the complete earnings call here.10. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) shares have retreated amid a broader banking crisis earlier this year but analysts believe the stock might be a good buy on the dip. In August The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) said it was planning on layoffs and cost cuts to streamline its operations.ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy made the following comment about The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“We have done so recently with The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), which got caught up in investor concerns over regional banks, due to the perception of an asset/liability mismatch on Schwab’s balance sheet. While there are similarities with regional banks, Schwab has minimal credit risk and far higher organic growth than traditional banks. In addition, Schwab’s mostly retail customers are not pulling money out of its ecosystem. On the contrary, the company continues to grow client assets at a mid-single-digit percentage rate despite the banking selloff. Concerned over interest rate risk, we trimmed our position last year and earlier this year. As the stock pulled back this spring, we added back aggressively. It remains an exceptionally strong franchise in terms of asset gathering and customer loyalty and runs a unique business model that continues to attract client assets; we are pleased to have the opportunity to express our differentiated view.”9. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88With decades of consistent dividend increases and a diversified business model, Johnson &amp; Johnson is one of the low risk stocks to buy in 2023.8.

For life sciences, Danaher supplies instruments for lab research, genomics services, and bioproduction tools. For the diagnostics business, Danaher offers instruments to run clinical tests in large core labs, hospitals, and pathology labs and at the point of care. Shares declined 4.7% during the quarter after the company cut its fiscal year 2023 guidance due to headwinds within its bioprocessing segment, as biopharmaceutical customers burned through existing inventory and smaller biotechnology firms faced funding constraints. We remain positive on Danaher’s long-term trajectory. Danaher benefits from a market-leading position and broad portfolio within bioprocessing, which addresses a biologics market that is growing by double digits, and which we expect to benefit in the near and medium term from a wave of biosimilars entering the market after key patents expire. Danaher has a collection of high-quality assets, with targets of high single-digit core revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth.”7. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

You can skip our detailed analysis on countries where these two companies have the least penetration or are not sold at all by heading over to 5 Countries where Pepsi or Coca-Cola is Not Sold.The global soft drinks market had an estimated value of $413 billion in 2021, according to Straits Research, and is projected to cross $620 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of 5.23%. Coca-Cola and Pepsi are the two major powerhouses in the industry. So much so that ‘coke’ and ‘pepsi’ are often used interchangeably when referring to sodas or soft drinks. These drinks are sold across the world and can be found in the drinks menu of almost any restaurant you go to.The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) sells its products in more than 200 countries and territories. The company, which ranks 93 in the Fortune 500 list, has an impressive record of innovation, which has propelled Coca-Cola to become one of the most successful brands in corporate history. According to the company’s website, Coca-Cola is the world’s second most understood word after ‘okay’.Founded in 1892, the company’s first international export was to Cuba in 1899. However, it was not until World War II that Coca-Cola’s global expansion started to take off with the company wanting to ensure that every US soldier, stationed in any base from Europe to the Pacific, could find coke and feel the comfort of home. The secret of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)’s global dominance can also be attributed to its franchise distribution system, through which the company produces syrup concentrate and sells it to bottlers around the world. Under this distribution system, more than two billion servings of Coca-Cola are produced every day across 900 bottling plants globally.The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) holds a 43.7% share of the carbonated soft drinks market in the United States, and had a global market value of over $250 billion by September this year. Sales continue to rise each year. Revenues have grown 6% in the second quarter this year compared to the same time in the previous year, to a total of $12 billion. James Quincy, the Chairman and CEO of Coca-Cola made the following remarks in the company’s Q2 2023 Earnings Call:Story continues""We’ve successfully navigated the first half of the year, which supports our decision to raise guidance for the full year. And instead of trying to predict the many directions things could take, we remain focused on delivering our key objectives that we outlined in February. In other words, number one, pursuing excellence globally and winning locally through relentless consumer centricity to drive top-line momentum. Two, investing for the long-term health of our business and raising the bar across all elements of our strategic flywheel. And three, generating US dollar EPS growth. Our system has never been stronger and our global network model is allowing us to quickly adapt to changing environments. We believe we are well positioned to deliver our updated guidance and objectives, thanks to our incredible system employees around the world.""On the other hand, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) is the second most valued soft drink brand after Coca-Cola, with the brand valued at $18.4 billion as of 2021 according to Brand Finance. Like Coke, Pepsi is also sold in more than 200 countries and territories across the world. While Coca-Cola largely outsells PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) at the global level, there are some countries where Pepsi outsells Coke and holds a larger share in those markets. These include India, Pakistan, Guatemala, Oman, and several provinces of Canada.One of the key reasons why PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) has been able to penetrate the global markets and catch up with The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is its competitive pricing strategy, through which it ensures that its products are priced in line with or below those of its competitors. The company’s CEO, Ramon Laguarta, shed light on this in PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) Q2 2023 Earnings Call.""We’re seeing in the majority of the markets where we operate, we’re seeing better elasticities and that has continued to be during the first half of the year, even though we’re seeing lower income consumers strategizing around obviously optimizing their budgets, but we’re seeing the majority of consumers staying within our categories, staying within our brands. And it’s remarkable what our marketing teams are, commercial teams have been doing to minimize elasticities. In some respect, it is what we have been investing for the last few years. Our brands are stronger. The perceived value of our products is better than it was. And obviously, we’ve been able to raise prices and consumers stay within our brands. Now we’re seeing consumers making some adjustments, right?We’re seeing consumers shopping in more stores than before. They’re looking for better deals. They’re starting to look for optimization. They’re going to channels that have better perceived value. They’re buying more in Dollar stores or they buy more in mass or in clubs. So every segment of the consumer is making adjustments. Overall, we’re seeing very positive.""The global market penetration of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) remains huge. However, there are countries where these soft drinks have been perceived to be advancing American values and ideals, and have faced local resistance. There are also nations where people prefer their own local sodas or soft drinks compared to Coke or Pepsi. Lastly, there are countries where these drinks are not sold due to economic sanctions or political instability and conflict.Let's check out countries where Coca Cola and Pepsi are either banned, sell comparitively less or are outsold by local brands.MethodologyWe have ranked the 15 countries where Pepsi or Coca-Cola is not sold by identifying countries where these drinks are not sold at all, have limited availability, whether they are outsold or have conceded a sizable chunk of the market share to another brand. Various news stories and publications from media groups have been used to prepare this list.First, we look at countries where Coca-Cola and Pepsi are facing competition from local brands or are outsold by another drink. Then we identify countries where Pepsi or Coca-Cola have limited availability; these countries are listed in the order of the adverse impact faced by these brands in their host countries, since no data is available on their market penetration levels due to ongoing conflicts and political instability. Lastly, countries where Pepsi or Coca-Cola is not sold are ranked going by the number of years since these brands ceased operations in these countries.15 Countries where Pepsi or Coca-Cola is Not Soldnik-albert-pGQpBcylvOA-unsplashLet's now head over to the list of countries where Pepsi or Coca-Cola is not sold as much as it is elsewhere in the world in terms of market penetration.15 Countries where Pepsi or Coca-Cola is Not Sold15. IranStatus: Facing Local CompetitionRival Beverage: Zamzam ColaRival Beverage's Market Share: 16%Zamzam Cola is a soft drink brand manufactured in Iran by Zamzam Group. It is among the first carbonated soft drinks produced in the country and is popular across Western Asia. The drink is named after the Well of Zamzam in Saudi Arabia, which is one of the stops during the Hajj Pilgrimage for muslims. The soft drink had an estimated share of 50% in the Iranian soft drink industry in 2007. That has now dropped to 16%. Coca Cola holds a 28% share, while Pepsi has penetration levels of only 20%.14. PeruStatus: Outsold by a Local BrandRival Beverage: Inca ColaRival Beverage's Market Share: 26%Peru is one of the few countries where a local soft drink outsells both Coca-Cola and Pepsi. Inca Cola is marketed as ‘the taste of Peru’ and includes Incan designs on the packaging labels, which invokes a passionate following for the drink among Peruvians. The drink held 26% in the soft drink market in 2012, followed by The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) at 25.5%. A report in the Sydney Morning Herald in 2023 stated that Inca Cola still outsells Coke in Peru.13. MyanmarStatus: Limited AvailabilityThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) opened its first plant in over 60 years in Myanmar in 2013, after the military junta’s rule over the country ended in 2011, having led the country since 1962. PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), which operated in the country between 1991 and 1997 has also ramped up its operations through local partnerships to catch up with Coca-Cola. Local alternatives mimicking these brands, such as Star Cola and Max Cola, held sway over the carbonated drinks market in Myanmar until Coca-Cola relaunched itself in the market. However, despite that, Myanmar is one of the countries with lowest sales of Coca Cola and Pepsi.12. NamibiaStatus: Limited AvailabilityNamibia has been facing a drought for the last seven years, which has resulted in limited availability of soft drinks in the country. Coca-Cola in 2016 decided to stop production of canned drinks in the country and import it instead from South Africa due to the water crisis in the country. This led to the drink facing shortage in the market and being sold at higher rates wherever these were available.11. ZimbabweStatus: Limited AvailabilityZimbabwe’s economic crisis and political instability have hampered operations of several large corporations operating in the country. Both Coca-Cola and Pepsi face regular shortages of supplies due to Zimbabwe’s depleting foreign exchange reserves. Coke and Pepsi are luxury products in a country facing hyperinflation which often experiences an acute shortage of a basic necessity like bread. In recent years, the production and supplies of Coca-Cola came to a complete halt twice, first in 2006 and then in 2018.10. Democratic Republic of the CongoStatus: Limited AvailabilityIt is hard to find Coca-Cola or Pepsi in Congo if you are not living in the capital Kinshasa or some of the other bigger towns in the country that sit on the river. Everything becomes hard to find as you move away from the city center due to a lack of transport infrastructure in Congo. Most of the roads in the country are not more than dirty narrow paths. Where Coke or Pepsi are available, they are unaffordable for many. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is among the five poorest countries in the world, according to the World Bank.9. SomaliaStatus: Limited AvailabilityThe Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) entered the Somali market in 2004 by setting up a factory in Mogadishu. Civil unrest in the country forced the company to move its operations to Hargeisa, the capital of the self-declared breakaway Republic of Somaliland in 2012, creating a shortage of the cola soft drink in much of Somalia. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) has been a direct victim of the conflict in Somalia. Gunmen attacked the plant in Mogadishu in 2007, looted cash, computers, and sugar, and fled away. The company has also received threats of violence from militant group Al-Shabaab.8. HaitiStatus: Limited AvailabilityHaiti has been engulfed in total chaos since 2018, starting with protests against rising fuel and energy prices and later the assassination of President Jovenel Moise. The spread of cholera and famine have made matters worse for the country. Instability in the country has empowered gangs, who have created a blockade around the largest fuel depot in the country. This has led to shortage of food, acute hunger, and disruption of supply chains across Haiti. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are among companies that have been affected by the ongoing crisis, with these soft drinks barely available in the markets.7. SudanStatus: Limited AvailabilityArmed conflict and economic sanctions have halted international trade operations of multiple large companies with the country. In fact, the turmoil has threatened global supplies of soft drink companies including The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP). Sudan is the largest producer of gum arabic, a key ingredient used in fizzy drinks, candies, and cosmetics. Coca-Cola and Pepsi have been stockpiling the ingredient for months to avoid shortage.6. TurkmenistanStatus: Limited AvailabilityStrict government regulations have limited the operations of international corporations. Coca-Cola bottlers ceased operations in the country in late 2017 due to import restrictions and a weakening currency. For much of that year, Coca-Cola was either unavailable or unaffordable for the average citizen in the country. The head of the local Coca-Cola bottling company died from suicide due to distress.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Countries where Pepsi or Coca-Cola is Not Sold.Suggested Articles:20 Countries With The Highest Soda ConsumptionTop 15 Beer Drinking Countries in the World15 States That Produce the Most WineDisclosure: None. 15 Countries where Pepsi or Coca-Cola is Not Sold is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. That's why when we briefly looked at PepsiCo's (NASDAQ:PEP) ROCE trend, we were pretty happy with what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on PepsiCo is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.19 = US$13b ÷ (US$96b - US$30b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Therefore, PepsiCo has an ROCE of 19%. On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 16% generated by the Beverage industry. See our latest analysis for PepsiCo roceIn the above chart we have measured PepsiCo's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering PepsiCo here  for free.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsThe trend of ROCE doesn't stand out much, but returns on a whole are decent. The company has consistently earned 19% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 22% in that time. Since 19% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayIn the end, PepsiCo has proven its ability to adequately reinvest capital at good rates of return. And the stock has followed suit returning a meaningful 80% to shareholders over the last five years. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research.If you want to continue researching PepsiCo, you might be interested to know about the 2 warning signs that our analysis has discovered.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

145,a8b12f32-70fd-3300-972a-05893b7f568b,AMP,2023-09-18,5 Passive Income Strategies for Investors to Understand,Kiplinger,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-passive-income-strategies-investors-073052872.html,1695022252,STORY,['AMP'],"[Learn how passive income strategies — like REITs, dividend stocks and high-yield savings accounts — can potentially boost your income.Unlike regular employment or investments that may require your active engagement, passive income strategies typically require minimal work to generate returns.However, while producing passive income may sound effortless, these strategies are not without risk — or work. Many require investing your time and money up front.An Ameriprise financial advisor will help you determine how these strategies could potentially augment your earnings and fit with your risk tolerance, time horizon and financial goals.Here are five passive income strategies to understand. As you consider these options, remember that it’s wise to incorporate multiple strategies to diversify your investment portfolio, as well as consider the possible tax implications:1. Cash equivalents and depositsCash investments are short-term investments that offer a return on invested/deposited principal. These investments require little to no effort, making them an attractive passive income option. However, their returns are typically tied to the current interest rate environment and may fall short of other strategies given their generally lower risk.Certain cash vehicles — like sweep accounts and high-interest checking or savings accounts — allow you to earn a return on your money while also allowing you to readily access it. This feature can make them beneficial accounts for emergency fund savings, transactional purposes such as paying bills, making purchases or ongoing investments.Here are a few examples:Sweep account: Regularly transfers a portion of your funds into a higher-interest account and offers a modest level of interest in return for making balances readily accessible.High-interest checking or savings account: Checking or savings accounts that offer higher rates than the industry average.Certificates of deposit: A high-interest rate deposit that typically offers a higher fixed return for leaving funds deposited for a specified term (for example, six months, one year, or five years).Treasury bills (T-bills): A short-term, government-backed debt obligation that matures in one year or less.Story continues2. BondsInstead of buying stock in a company, you can lend money to a company, municipality, the U.S. government or governmental agency. In return, the issuer agrees to pay you a specified rate of interest over the life of the bond and repay the face value of the bond (the principal) when it reaches maturity. Bonds are typically less volatile than stocks and have a specified maturity and interest payments. However, they also generally receive a lower return than stocks and are exposed to risks such as interest rate risk, credit risk and prepayment risk.U.S. Treasury bonds: Bonds backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government are used to fund a portion of U.S. government spending.Corporate bonds: Companies may borrow from bond investors to fund business operations or expansions.Municipal bonds: State and local government entities issue bonds to raise funds for projects.3. Dividend stocksCertain companies return a portion of their profits to shareholders in the form of dividends. When you purchase stocks from these firms, you may receive quarterly payments from the company based on its net income and dividend policy.Dividend-paying stocks may yield more or less than bonds and come with considerably more market price risk as they lack a defined maturity. Keep in mind that a company can, at any time, cut or eliminate its dividend payout, reducing your passive income stream.4. Real estate investment trusts (REITs)Buying and managing real estate can require a lot of hands-on attention. Real estate investment trusts allow you to invest in large-scale income-producing real estate. They may be a good option if you’d like to benefit from the income that property can generate but reduce the associated stress.REITs allow you to earn a share of the income produced through commercial properties without purchasing the real estate yourself. The potential downside of REITs includes the unpredictable nature of the real estate market and that a portion of distributions may be taxed as ordinary income. REITs come in two varieties: publicly traded REITs that buy and sell on an exchange like stocks and non-traded REITs that have more restrictive liquidity considerations.5. Rental propertyInvesting in short- and long-term rental property can generate potentially significant income. But it often requires more work and expense than other strategies, involving tenants, property taxes and building maintenance and repairs.If you’d rather start small with generating rental income, you may consider renting high-priced items you already own. Peer-to-peer rental websites now allow individuals to rent out their vehicles, equipment and other physical assets (even parking spaces). For example, boats, RVs, camera gear or power tools are just a small sample of goods that people contract out. However, you’ll want to account for your lost time in managing the leasing process, the wear and tear on your property and the possible tax implications if you ever wish to sell your rented property.Man sitting in kitchen table working on his financesPERSONAL FINANCESystemic savings plan: The key to building a cash reserveLearn about your options when it comes to automatic saving.Learn moreDetermine how passive income can work for youPassive income strategies can help you generate extra earnings while working and supplement your retirement income — but you’ll want to consult a professional on what is best for your unique situation.

An Ameriprise financial advisor will help you develop a strategy for loans as part of your education goals while taking into consideration your full financial picture and long-term goals.As you survey your loan options, take special care to understand all the terms and conditions.In this article:Student loans: An overviewHow much should I — or my student — take out in student loans?What are the different types of college loans?What are the advantages and disadvantages of the different kinds of loans?Understanding federal loansWhat types of federal loans are available?Is there a federal loan that allows borrowers to consolidate student debt?What federal loan options are available for parents?Student loan and payment considerations for parentsWill I have to cosign a private loan for my student?Should I loan my child money to pay for college?Should I borrow money to pay for my child’s college education even if I could otherwise pay for it?Questions to ask an Ameriprise financial advisorStudent loans: An overviewHow much should I — or my student — take out in student loans? First, determine how much you choose to take out in student loans. Whether driven by a need to cover a gap, a choice to have a student cover some of the cost of their own education or a strategic financing decision, your financial advisor can help you determine an amount that aligns with your other financial priorities and values.Guidelines for student loan payments Limit the balance of student loans to 1.5 times what a graduate expects their annual starting salary to be in their first year out of school. This translates to debt payments of no more than 12% of a student’s monthly take-home pay. (Use our enhanced loan calculator to understand the numbers.)Story continuesWhat are the different types of college loans? There are three main types of loans to cover higher education expenses:Federal loans are offered by the U.S. government to undergraduate, graduate and professional students — as well as to the parents of students — based on information provided in the Free Application for Student Aid (FAFSA).Private loans are typically offered by banks or other financial institutions.Institutional loans enable a student to borrow from a college directly as part of their financial aid package.Understanding federal loansWhat types of federal loans are available? Students are eligible for two main types of federal loans: direct subsidized loans and direct unsubsidized loans. Each comes with different rules:Is there a federal loan that allows borrowers to consolidate student debt? Yes. Direct consolidation loans allow students to combine at least two eligible federal student loans into a single loan with a fixed interest rate based on the average rate of the loans being consolidated. Borrowers may also be able to lower monthly payments, because repayment terms can be extended up to 30 years. They may also get access to different repayment options.What federal loan options are available for parents? Direct PLUS loans are for parents of undergraduate students or students enrolled in graduate or professional schools. Borrowers do not have to demonstrate financial need to be eligible.PLUS loans allow a parent to borrow the entire amount the student needs for college — including tuition, room and board, books and fees — minus any other financial aid the student receives. However, parents are permanently responsible for repaying the PLUS loan. Even if a child is eventually able to repay the loan, parents cannot transfer it to their child.Student loan and payment considerations for parentsWill I have to cosign a private loan for my student? Because private student loans are based on credit and most college students have a limited credit history, these loans tend to require a cosigner who will repay the loan if the student doesn’t. Only one person can cosign for a private student loan, and that person can be anyone — a grandparent, guardian or even a family friend.However, the cosigner is often the student’s parent. If you choose to cosign a loan, know it doesn’t have to be a lifetime commitment. Many private lenders allow a borrower to release their cosigner after a certain period. The student can also refinance the loan in their own name — and release the cosigner — once they have good credit, sufficient income and a history of on-time payments.Should I loan my child money to pay for college? The desire to help your child with college costs while wanting them to also contribute to their education is understandable. But be cautious about extending a personal loan to pay for school.Aside from the complications of dealing with interest rates, repayment schedules and the consequences of default, such loans don’t build credit and aren’t eligible for the student loan interest deduction. There are also tax consequences if you don’t document the loan properly.Consider this alternative: You can always help your child pay off their student loans if you want them to have some responsibility without being overwhelmed by debt.Should I borrow money to pay for my child’s college education even if I could otherwise pay for it? It depends on your family’s unique situation. Your financial advisor will review your options with you to help determine the best path for your family. When weighing whether to borrow money or to tap certain investments or assets to pay for college, it’s important to consider several factors, including the loan’s interest rates.In some cases, it can make sense to take out a short-term loan while allowing your investments to continue growing at a potentially higher rate, and then pay off the loan later with the appreciated investment. The Ameriprise investment returns calculator and enhanced loan calculator can also help you crunch and compare the numbers.Questions to ask an Ameriprise financial advisorCan you help me determine the amount that makes sense for my student and my family to borrow, considering my other financial goals?Should I consider strategically taking out a student loan to allow my other investments to continue to grow?Can you help me review my family’s student loan options to ensure I get the right fit for my overall financial strategy?Let’s weigh your loan options Whether you’re paying for your child’s tuition yourself or helping them navigate the student loan process, we will offer guidance as you decide what makes the most sense for you and your family.]"

When mapping out your retirement years, it’s critical to have the right information.Here are six common retirement myths dispelled:Myth #1: I don’t need to revisit my withdrawal rateHistorically, a general rule has been that a properly diversified portfolio could last 30 years with withdrawals of 4% or less and annual increases to match the rate of inflation. (1)However, there isn’t a one-size-fits-all number. Figuring out the best retirement plan and withdrawal strategy should take into account your current finances, future income, goals and other considerations unique to you. What's more, your plan and withdrawal rate may change as your circumstances change.Consider these approaches:If you’ve recently retired or are nearing retirement: Regularly review withdrawal rates. This is a smart way to keep an eye on how current stock prices and the rate of inflation may impact returns in your investment portfolio. The ability to adjust your retirement income level based on market conditions and your circumstances can help you address uncertainty or the unexpected.If you’re young or mid-career: Planning for a 3% to 4% withdrawal rate may be reasonable over the long term.How a financial advisor can help: Because an advisor knows the details of your unique situation, they can recommend a personalized withdrawal strategy and then continue to review your rate to determine the right number for you.Myth #2: Medicare will cover all health care costsA common retirement planning myth is that Medicare will be enough for any and all future health care costs. Medicare is a valuable program for many retirees, but it wasn’t designed to cover everything. For example, deductibles and copayments (which can be significant), as well as the cost of care for dental, vision and hearing conditions are not covered. In addition, coverage for nursing homes and other long-term care is limited.Story continuesHow a financial advisor can help: They will factor in anticipated health care expenses and recommend solutions to help you prepare for these costs in retirement.Myth #3: Social Security won’t lastThough the solvency of the Social Security program is an ongoing topic of conversation, if you’re already in retirement and receiving Social Security benefits, it is not likely to materially affect you.If you're near or further away from retirement, know that an Ameriprise financial advisor will continue to track how much of an impact the changes to Social Security could have on your plan. They regularly review and update your retirement income strategy to ensure it accounts for, and addresses, any regulatory changes.Regardless of how far you are from retirement, keep in mind that Social Security alone cannot provide enough income for most individuals.How a financial advisor can help: As you near retirement, an advisor will work with you to estimate your Social Security benefits as part of your overall planning and budget. They can also help you build additional flexibility into your personalized retirement income plan and potentially recommend solutions for reliable income in retirement, if appropriate for your situation.Myth #4: I can work for as long as I need toLonger life-spans may mean more years in retirement and possibly more years working past age 65. However, given the uncertainties of aging, it may not be realistic to expect to work as long as you need or want to. For example, half of all early retirements are due to illness or disability.How a financial advisor can help: They can help you develop a personalized retirement planning and income strategy, including solutions to help shield your assets against the unexpected — like retiring earlier than planned.Myth #5: I’ll spend less (and pay less taxes)Depending on your goals, you may be spending more in retirement than you thought you would, especially if you are traveling, visiting children and grandchildren and pursuing new hobbies and activities. Additionally, inflation can erode your purchasing power over time.Another related misconception is that you'll pay less in taxes once you're retired. But that assumes you'll have less income. If you end up with the same amount of income in retirement as you had when you were working, you may not be in a lower tax bracket. Also, you may qualify for fewer tax breaks, such as mortgage and college savings deductions. Tax rates may also rise in the future.How a financial advisor can help: They can help you develop a budget for retirement and recommend a tax-efficient, retirement-income strategy specific to your situation.Myth #6: I'll live in the same place throughout my retirementYou may think that by the time you retire, your mortgage will be paid off and your housing costs will be set. However, moving is often a reality during the retirement years. For instance, you may decide to move closer to family members or into an urban area for the culture and convenience. You may find you need an assisted living situation or a community with more transportation and maintenance services at hand.How a financial advisor can help: They can help assess your individual situation and recommend ways you can prepare for unexpected moving costs in retirement.We’re here to help with your retirement planning needsYou’ve worked hard to save for retirement — and deserve to enjoy it with confidence. As you plan for these years, know you can lean on an Ameriprise financial advisor for personalized advice based on your goals and needs.Financial advisor meeting with a coupleStart on your path to financial confidence today with help from an Ameriprise financial advisor near you.(1) From an Ameriprise report for retirees, “Planning for a more confident retirement,” published April 2019.]"
