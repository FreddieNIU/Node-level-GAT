""Our survey finds that three quarters of respondents believe tougher economic conditions will create discounted opportunities, but investors are likely to bide their time, as at least half feel valuations have not yet fully adjusted. Dry powder will become invaluable in the next couple of years.""The survey finds that 68 percent of the respondents plan to continue their allocation to private markets in line with current targets, despite acknowledging that rising interest rates reduce the attractiveness of the highly leveraged asset class. Within private markets, private equity (PE) remains the most attractive asset class, with 63 percent of institutional investors anticipating making it their largest allocation in the next two to three years. Private credit is the asset class investors are least likely to make their largest allocations to, (43 percent), with real estate and infrastructure both at 48 percent. Respondents made it clear they were going to be more focused on deal quality in the future with many making changes to their due diligence processes (47 percent) or narrowing the universe of investments they will consider through higher baseline standards (42 percent).Asset managers can unlock huge potential of retail market by increasing transparencyThere is a strong consensus among private market managers (66 percent) that alternative assets can add value for retail investors who are seeking new sources of diversification. Moreover, 72 percent of respondents believe that increased transparency will make private market assets suitable for retail investors. A majority (58 percent) believed digital fractionalization of private markets assets would contribute to this trend.Story continues""Private market managers are quite bullish on tokenization going mainstream in the next three plus years, as they look to widen their investor base,"" continued Fleming. ""However, democratization will place fresh demands on private market managers from a regulatory and transparency perspective. The majority of managers believe regulators will be compelled to introduce more stringent reporting requirements as retail participation rises. It is critical for private managers to enhance their data management, which will help them reach the next stage in their growth.""Private markets data management remains a huge challengeState Street's survey finds that more than half (53 percent) of institutions report spending considerable resources on manual processes and outdated systems. Maximizing the potential of data to make more effective decisions is the greatest focus for institutional investors, although less than 40 percent of them think this area is well developed in their organizations. As institutions prepare for new demands on operations, migrating data storage and analysis to the cloud is their top priority, with 71 percent of respondents investing in it.""There are strong imperatives for private market investors to address operational inefficiency and data management limitations as higher borrowing costs and a rising compliance burden squeeze margins. A volatile economic backdrop also puts added emphasis on risk management,"" said Jesse Cole, global head of Private Markets at State Street. ""On top of creating efficiencies, many investors also believe that data management and analysis capabilities are a source of competitive advantage and managers need highly structured data management processes in order to maximize returns.""1 The study, commissioned by State Street and conducted by CoreData Research, surveyed 480 respondents from traditional asset managers, private market managers, insurance companies and asset owners across four regions, North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia Pacific in September to November 2022.About State Street CorporationState Street Corporation (NYSE: STT) is one of the world's leading providers of financial services to institutional investors including investment servicing, investment management and investment research and trading.

He is the host of CNBC's Mad Money and co-founder of TheStreet.com. Cramer is known for his energetic and often bombastic on-air style and outspoken views on the stock market and investing.""We're in a Bull Market""After a series of aggressive rate hikes in 2022, on February 1, the Federal Reserve issued another rate hike at its first meeting of 2023. However, this time the Fed raised interest rates by 25 basis points, bringing its federal funds rate target range to between 4.5% and 4.75%. On February 2, Jim Cramer talked about the Fed's latest rate hike and why he thinks that ""everything Powell said in his press conference was positive"". Cramer said ""it's crazy that stocks ever sold off in the first place"" because the Fed is now moving towards getting ""disinflation going, not slowing of inflation, but disinflation"". According to Jim Cramer, ""we're in a bull market"".""It (the bull market) started last fall when long-term interest rates peaked, along with the dollar peaking. Now many stocks have clearly bottomed, even tech.""According to Cramer, ""the Fed is just trying to strike a balance between inflation and price stability"".Jim Cramer noted that selling stocks before the peak in long-term interest rates and the dollar was the right thing to do. However, now that ""the Fed says the rate hikes are working and we're pretty far along the tightening cycle"", selling stocks may not be the right thing to do. According to Cramer, this ""mistaken selling creates the opportunity for you (investors) to buy the dips"".Jim Cramer thinks that there are ""some legitimate, sizable bull markets going on"" and one of them is the banks.This piece will explore some of the favorite energy and bank stock picks of Mad Money host, Jim Cramer.

The country has been a leading buyer of the Russian grade for several months, filling the void left by European buyers.At the same time, Russia has become the largest supplier of oil to India, replacing Iraq.Speaking at an energy conference in India, Sechin, a long-standing ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said the Russian oil price would be established outside Europe.""If Russian oil does not enter the European market, then there is no reference price. Reference prices will be formed where oil volumes actually go,"" said Sechin, who is also known as the ""Russian oil tsar"".He also quoted from the Bible to underline his point.""As it's scripted in Ecclesiastes: what is crooked cannot be straightened; what is lacking cannot be counted.""Since Russia invaded Ukraine almost a year ago, the West has progressively tightened sanctions on Russian oil.In December, the Group of Seven, the European Union and Australia enforced a price cap on crude oil at $60 per barrel, aiming to reduce Moscow's ability to finance its military efforts in Ukraine and preserve stability on the global oil market.The European Union has also banned purchases of Russian oil supplied in tankers by sea.According to Russia's Finance Ministry, the average price of Russian Urals oil in January was $49.48 a barrel down 42% on January 2022.The Russian government has debated how to calculate Russia's taxable oil price following the EU's import ban and the lack of a reliable price-making mechanism.Story continuesMoscow relies on income from oil and gas - last year around 11.6 trillion roubles ($165 billion) - to fund its budget spending, and has been forced to start selling international reserves to cover a deficit stretched by the cost of its military operation in Ukraine.When asked if Russia will give an additional stake to ONGC Videsh or other Indian companies in its Sakhalin-1 project, Sechin told Reuters on the sidelines of the Indian Energy Week conference that the decision to do so lay with the Russian government.Russia last year approved the requests of ONGC Videsh, the overseas investment arm of state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp, and Sakhalin Oil and Gas Development Co (SODECO), a consortium of Japanese firms, to retain their 20% and 30% stake respectively in the project.(Reporting by Nidhi Varma, Deep Vakil, Shariq Khan, Arunima Kumar and Florence Tan in Bengaluru; Editing by Kim Coghill, Louise Heavens and Barbara Lewis)]"

A stronger dollar typically reduces demand for dollar-denominated oil from buyers paying with other currencies. [USD/]""You've got a strong dollar, you're in a generally risk-off environment,"" said Robert Yawger, executive director of energy futures at Mizuho.WTI and Brent had slid 3% last Friday after the strong U.S. jobs data.Supply concerns continued to affect markets as operations at Turkey's oil terminal in Ceyhan halted after a major earthquake hit the region.The BTC terminal, which exports Azeri crude oil to international markets, will be closed on Feb. 6-8 while operators assess earthquake damage, a Turkish shipping agent said.However, a preliminary Reuters poll showed that U.S. crude oil stockpiles likely rose by about 2.2 million last week.Also, price caps on Russian products took effect on Sunday, with Group of Seven nations, the European Union and Australia agreeing on limits of $100 a barrel on diesel and other products that trade at a premium to crude and $45 a barrel for products that trade at a discount, such as fuel oil.(Reporting by Noah BrowningAdditional reporting by Sonali Paul in Melbourne and Emily Chow in SingaporeEditing by Marguerita Choy, David Goodman and Kevin Liffey)]"

These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Walmart shares have more than proved their defensive attributes in the market turmoil that got underway a year ago. The stock is essentially flat over the past year (up +0.2%), which compares to the -7.3% decline for the Zacks Retail sector and -8% decline for the S&amp;P 500 index.The company has been benefiting from its robust omnichannel operations due to its efforts to enhance both store and online experience. Walmart has been particularly gaining from its efforts to boost delivery services through acquisitions and partnerships.The company’s U.S. comp sales continued to benefit from an increased market share in grocery in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, wherein the top and bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased year over year in the last quarterly release. A robust third-quarter show encouraged management to raise its overall guidance for fiscal 2023.However, its consolidated operating income and earnings per share view still suggest a decline from the year-ago period figures. The company is encountering cost inflation, and expects it to remain elevated.(You can read the full research report on Walmart here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Alibaba have over the last couple of months, reflecting the company's leverage to expectations of a consumer spending rebound in the wake of China ending its zero-Covid policies and associated restrictions.

Further, strength across the local consumer services, Cainiao logistics services, Alibaba Health and Freshippo is contributing well to the top-line growth.Additionally, solid momentum across financial services, public services and telecommunication industries are driving the cloud computing business. Our estimates suggest cloud revenues to witness a 6.3% rise in fiscal 2023 from the year-ago reported figure.(You can read the full research report on Alibaba here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Salesforce have underperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (-20.3% vs. -12.4%). The company is witnessing stiff competition is a concern. Besides, unfavorable currency fluctuations along with increasing investments in international expansions and data centers are an overhang on near-term profitability.However, Salesforce is benefiting from a robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. The rapid adoption of its cloud-based solutions is driving demand for its products. Its sustained focus on introducing more aligned products as per customer needs is driving its top-line.Continued deal wins in the international market is another growth driver. The acquisition of Slack would position the company to be a leader in enterprise team collaboration solution space and better compete with Microsoft’s Teams product.

As a mid-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Ralph Lauren’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Ralph Lauren What's The Opportunity In Ralph Lauren?According to my valuation model, Ralph Lauren seems to be fairly priced at around 18% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Ralph Lauren today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $153.31, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Ralph Lauren’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What kind of growth will Ralph Lauren generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Ralph Lauren's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 39%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in RL’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on RL, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you'd like to know more about Ralph Lauren as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing. For example, we've found that Ralph Lauren has 2 warning signs (1 is a bit unpleasant!) that deserve your attention before going any further with your analysis.If you are no longer interested in Ralph Lauren, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

PG&amp;E and Sunrun partnered to create an optimal battery dispatch schedule that lowers the overall cost of power during the times of highest need as well as reduces critical strain on the entire energy system and reliance on fossil fuel burning power plants.A virtual power plant works by storing renewable energy produced by rooftop solar panels during the day across a large number of homes, then sharing that energy back to the grid during peak times, such as at night when the sun has set or when energy supply is tight during hot summer months.Enrolled battery systems will be directed to discharge every day from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. during the months of August through October, a critical window when energy needs are highest in California. In exchange, customers will receive an upfront payment of $750 and a free smart thermostat for participating. Batteries enrolled in the program will retain enough energy to meet personal, essential needs in the event of a local power outage in their area.All Sunrun solar and battery customers in single-family homes who have an interconnection agreement with PG&amp;E, and are not enrolled in other demand response programs, are eligible to participate.Story continuesThis program will also provide Sunrun incremental revenue for managing and delivering virtual power plant services to the grid for one year, and an opportunity for Sunrun and PG&amp;E to extend and expand the program in future years.“There’s no denying climate events are becoming more severe and power outages are more frequent and prolonged as a result,” said Mary Powell, CEO of Sunrun. “Consumers want energy security and peace of mind, and by integrating more reliable clean energy resources into the grid through this innovative program, we can deliver that with PG&amp;E. This forward-looking partnership strengthens our emergency preparedness and puts the customer at the center of the energy system.”“Home batteries and virtual power plants are valuable resources for supporting grid reliability and an essential part of California’s clean energy future,” said Patti Poppe, CEO of PG&amp;E Corporation. “PG&amp;E is making great strides ensuring the grid is ready to partner with a diversity of energy providers. In collaboration with Sunrun, our Energy Efficiency Summer Reliability Program will serve as a unique resource that will positively contribute to our state’s electric grid and complement a host of actions PG&amp;E is taking to provide greater energy resilience to our customers and hometowns.”This first-of-its-kind partnership was formed after an issuance by the California Public Utilities Commission for “Energy Efficiency Actions to Enhance Summer 2022 and 2023 Electric Reliability,” a direct response to a State of Emergency proclamation issued by California Governor Gavin Newsom. The proclamation challenges energy providers “to take immediate action to reduce the strain on the energy infrastructure, increase energy capacity, and make energy supply more resilient this year to protect the health and safety of Californians.”The new Sunrun VPP is part of a suite of programs and solutions that PG&amp;E has implemented to decrease energy demand and increase energy supply during critical hours of the day to ensure grid reliability during extreme heat events. This also includes procuring additional energy supply, deploying new incremental battery energy storage capacity, expanding existing Demand Response (DR) programs and incentives, and launching new DR options.The new Sunrun VPP was approved by the CPUC on January 30, 2023. Sunrun will soon begin enrolling customers into the program and start dispatches on August 1, 2023.

Oracle told Reuters the investment will be made over several years.Saudi officials have pressed international companies to invest in the kingdom and move their regional headquarters to Riyadh in order to benefit from government contracts.The kingdom has been pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into an economic plan, known as Vision 2030, led by its de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.But it has struggled to attract foreign direct investment (FDI), one of the pillars of Vision 2030, which aims to diversify the economy away from oil.The minister said China's Huawei will also invest $400 million in cloud infrastructure for its services in Saudi Arabia and another cloud region in partnership with oil giant Aramco.An additional $4.5 billion was invested in global and local assets across multiple sectors at the forum, Alswaha added.Tonomus, a subsidiary of the $500 billion signature NEOM project of the crown prince, said last year it invested $1 billion in 2022 in AI, including a metaverse platform.Increased demand for cloud computing has pushed technology companies such as Oracle, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet's Google to set up data centres across the world to speed up data transfer.

But in recent months so-called generative AI — most notably OpenAI’s ChatGPT and DALL-E products — sparked widespread excitement among investors who believe it could also generate massive financial rewards.MLIV Pulse survey participants were split almost evenly on whether these kinds of technologies were worth investing in. Investors appeared to not use any kind of artificial intelligence, with only 12% saying they used one and just 27% saying they planned to. More than half of all respondents said they aren’t even considering using AI to help them invest.This contrasts starkly with recent rallies seen in the market for companies connected to advanced AI, in part fueled by the widespread publicity of ChatGPT and Microsoft Corp.’s $10 billion investment in OpenAI, its developer. Companies such as BuzzFeed Inc., C3.ai Inc., SoundHound AI Inc., and BigBear.ai Holdings Inc. are among the stocks that have all seen massive jumps in volume, along with dizzying swings in their share prices.Read more: We Asked ChatGPT to Make a Market-Beating ETF. Here’s the ResultBusinesses and investors are in a race to become go-to names for technology that can create media such as text and pictures from simple prompts — or hold human-like conversations on a wide variety of topics, from whether a cat would win a fight with an eagle, to practical considerations about world events or school projects. Microsoft is up against the likes of Alphabet Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. in working to offer the smartest AI tools to the greatest number of people.Story continuesStill, the promise of tools like ChatGPT leaves room for some investors to desire, with only 49% of respondents saying they planned to buy stocks with exposure to such generative AI tools. Overall, about 41% of all respondents said they intended to increase exposure to tech stocks more broadly, while 38% said they’d hold steady over the next six months. This is despite their expectations for the Nasdaq 100, which closed on Friday at 12,573.36, to fall to 12,000 by the year-end, according to the median forecast.It’s likely that investors are waiting on a final selling frenzy to buy.Even before the current wave of interest in AI, the question of whether smart automation will create more opportunities than it displaces has been a topic of great interest to workers and businesses alike (not to mention the Pentagon and the UK government.) Many of the companies now cutting jobs are also the ones investing billions in building their AI capabilities.In January, Alphabet announced 12,000 job cuts globally while Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai singled out AI as a key investment area. Similarly, Microsoft announced its $10 billion investment in OpenAI just days after saying it would lay off 10,000 employees. Neither company is unique in this regard.Dell Technologies Inc., facing plummeting demand for personal computers, said on Monday that it will eliminate about 6,650 jobs.It appears that majority of investors surveyed by MLIV Pulse believe that those layoffs are too small or just right. Very few respondents, or about 11%, think those cuts are too big. Similarly, only 13% see them as premature.“There are very interesting AI wars coming up between the tech companies,” University of Southampton Professor of Computer Science Wendy Hall told Bloomberg TV.This week, the MLIV Pulse survey focuses on real estate.

Nearly 90,000 tech workers were laid off in 2022 alone. This year isn’t off to a great start either. In January alone, Amazon announced 18,000 job cuts, Microsoft confirmed plans to lay off 10,000 workers and Google said it's cutting 12,000 jobs globally.Don't miss'Hold onto your money': Jeff Bezos issued a financial warning, says you might want to rethink buying a 'new automobile, refrigerator, or whatever' — here are 3 better recession-proof buysRich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwindsHere's the average salary each generation says they need to feel 'financially healthy.' Gen Z requires a whopping $171K/year — but how do your own expectations compare?And now, SEC filings show Microsoft is planning to lay off 10,000 employees by the end of the third quarter.Things aren’t much better for those who have (so far) escaped the layoffs. Countless tech firms, private and public, have watched their valuation tumble over the past 12 months.And now, the Financial Times reports that a number of panicked laid-off workers are “flooding secondary markets” with their shares of their former companies. Which means those valuations are likely to plunge even further.Here’s what that might mean for your portfolio — and where you might want to turn.Tech takes a tumbleRecord-low interest rates over the past decade pushed more investors to seek out risky investments. Loss-making tech companies were, perhaps, the riskiest spot for this excess cash. Tech valuations soared since 2020, which allowed startups and tech giants to use their inflated stock as a way to retain talent.Tech workers were paid excessive amounts of stock-based compensation. In fact, some companies like Snap and Pinterest paid up to 46% of their total compensation in the form of stock options. This boosted the total compensation of tech workers during the boom, but is now having the opposite effect as valuations plummet.Story continuesThe Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) — a fund that tracks tech stocks — is down 14% over the past 12 months. Meanwhile, private companies have also seen their valuation plummet as much as 80%. Employees of these firms are rushing to cash out on secondary markets, according to a recent report by the Financial Times.Companies struggling to generate profits have been the biggest losers so far. An index of loss-making firms compiled by Morgan Staney is down 54% over the past year. Many of these money-losing firms have seen their valuations settle at pre-pandemic levels.Looking ahead, some experts believe the valuations won’t recover until the Federal Reserve pivots on its interest rate strategy. Lower or steady interest rates could make risky tech stocks more attractive. However, that’s unlikely to happen until late 2023 at the earliest, according to interest rate swaps.Until then, investors should probably focus on highly-profitable tech companies that have been unfairly punished during this crash.AdobeAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) has lost 21% of its value over the past year. The company underperformed the broader market by a wide margin. However, its underlying business is still thriving.The company reported $17.61 billion in revenue for fiscal year 2022 — 12% higher than the previous year. And in September, the company acquired design platform Figma, which expands Adobe’s suite of essential designer tools.The company is also getting involved in the upcoming Artificial Intelligence boom by tracking the way its users use essential tools and integrating OpenAI’s tools with Figma.The stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 34.Read more: * Chances are good you're overpaying for home insurance.

The company was an early investor in OpenAI and now has access to ChatGPT for its Bing search engine. The integration could be completed by early this year, which means the online search market is on the edge of disruption.But none of this is reflected in the stock price. Microsoft has lost 12% of its value over the past year. It’s now trading at just 28 times net earnings per share.AppleThe world’s most profitable tech company certainly deserves a mention on this list. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) delivered $6.11 in earnings per share in its fiscal Q4 — 9% higher than the year-ago period.

Generative AI aims to make human-like creations through computer code that has processed vast amounts of data.Cohere is planning on introducing a new dialogue model that would resemble ChatGPT to let enterprise users generate text and engage with the model to refine the output. Unlike ChatGPT, Cohere's technology will mainly be accessible to developers and businesses, CEO Aidan Gomez told Reuters in an interview.""Our chat models are focused more on business applicable tasks like answering questions than writing poems. We don’t plan to hand them over to everyone to use for free without limit,"" said Gomez. ""We want to build a healthy and sustainable business.""Gomez declined to comment on the funding status of the company.It was not immediately clear how much Cohere was seeking to raise in the current round. Sources requested anonymity for discussing private funding matters.Cohere has raised $170 million to date from funds including Index Ventures, Tiger Global and AI luminaries Geoffrey Hinton, Fei-Fei Li and Pieter Abbeel.FOCUS ON NLPFocusing on training natural language processing (NLP) models, Cohere competes with a group of foundation model providers such as OpenAI and Anthropic.Story continuesGomez said the company differentiates itself by focusing on serving enterprise users, and Cohere has been talking to companies from marketing, consulting and tech to help them incorporate generative AI.Cohere announced a cloud partnership with Alphabet to access its TPU computing power last year. Its language AI also becomes available on Amazon’s fully managed machine learning service SageMaker in January.Last month, Cohere hired Martin Kon, the former chief finance executive at YouTube, to lead its product and market strategy. Cohere is powering some consumer applications including Hyperwrite, which helps people write faster and generate articles using AI.""We expect this year to be a breakout year for us to bring in enterprise customers,"" said Gomez.Gomez said Cohere will focus on text generation models, unlike its peer OpenAI which has released GPT-3 model for text as well as DALL-E for image generation.Since the launch of ChatGPT in November, the technology that can generate prose, imagery or computer code on command has attracted investors' attention. Other foundation model providers such as Anthropic is also in talks to raise funding at multi-billion valuations, investor sources said.With Microsoft Corp's $10 billion investment in OpenAI, other big tech companies, including Alphabet and Oracle , are also looking at investing in AI startups, sources said.Gomez said Cohere will not take strategic investments that require exclusive rights.""It's important for us to stay independent and work with different cloud providers,"" said Gomez.

You can skip our detailed analysis of uneven economic development in Asia and go directly to the 10 Least Developed Countries in Asia. Asia is one of the fastest developing regions in the world, and is widely regarded as the manufacturing hub of the world, with the most developed countries on the continent being Japan and South Korea. Much of the GDP of Asia is concentrated in China, Japan, South Korea and India. However, there are many countries in Asia that lag behind in financial independence, rule of law, political stability, financial transparency and GDP growth. These are primarily situated in South Asia, Central Asia and West Asia. Asian Development Dynamics: Why Did China Develop Faster Than India?The two countries that are the easiest to compare in terms of socio-economic development in Asia are China and India. China is the second largest economy in the world, behind the US, while India is the fifth largest. China had a head start of 12 years in market reforms compared to India. However, the latter’s market reforms were also slower to implement and lacked comprehensive coverage. Both countries have become outsourcing hubs for different reasons, with China leading in manufacturing and India making progress in services such as information technology. The share of services in India’s GDP as of 2021, is 47.5%, while that of the manufacturing sector is only 14%. On the other hand, for the past decade, India has had a trade surplus in services but it covers only 20% of its deficit in manufacturing.India’s services-oriented trajectory was set by government policies and investments, but the country lagged behind in infrastructure, that is critical for manufacturing, such as power plants, ports and roads.This is where China had an advantage, as the manufacturing sector is crucial for growth acceleration in developing economies, with its importance over services for developing economies grounded in sound empirical data. Capital accumulation is an aggregate source of economic growth and it is much lower in services, while its positive effects are far more pronounced in manufacturing sectors of developing economies. Story continuesManufacturing is also far friendlier to economies of scale relative to services, due to cost advantages in labor and productivity. Further, foreign investment in the manufacturing sector has greater technology-transfer effects, due to the industry being more labor intensive.Therefore, China developed faster than India, owing to a head start in market reforms, low-cost labor and the expansion of its manufacturing sector, despite the potential for economies of scale in both countries due to huge population sizes.Why Are So Many Asian Economies Still Underdeveloped?Several factors keep many Asian economies underdeveloped. These include corruption, poor state of rule of law, political instability, violence and lack of comprehensive market and labor reforms, among others. The least developed countries in Asia are also trailing the more developed Asian economies in formulating policies to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). The above factors lead to self-reinforcing feedback loops. For instance, least developed countries of Asia lag far behind more developed Asian countries in technology-transfer from international companies, perpetuating underdevelopment.By contrast, relatively developed Asian countries like Thailand and Indonesia have been far more active in incentivizing production links via subcontracting arrangements between domestic companies and foreign companies.Many high tech companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) have a presence in developing Asian countries like India.Let’s now move on to the 25 least developed countries in Asia. 25 Least Developed Countries in AsiaCopyright: leungchopan / 123RF Stock PhotoOur MethodologyWe have defined ‘least developed countries in Asia’ as ones that have low human development and GDP per Capita. In this regard, we’ve selected Asian countries from the Human Development Index (HDI) of 2021-22 with the lowest scores. We then took into account their GDPs per Capita and then assigned each country two rankings based on their HDI scores and GDPs per Capita. Finally, we’ve ranked them based on the average of the two rankings and listed them in a descending order of low development. For countries with the same averaged-out values, we’ve used their rankings in GDP per Capita as the tiebreaker.Note: North Korea is a rogue country, with the UN lacking data on their human development but we do have credible estimates of their GDP per Capita. For this purpose, we've ranked it based on its GDP per Capita.25. Mongolia HDI Ranking: 22 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 24 Average Ranking: 23Mongolia is located in Central Asia. The country has a GDP per Capita of $4,566 as of 2021 and an HDI score of 0.739. The country’s economy is mostly reliant on the mining industry, leaving little room for appropriate market diversification. In addition, Mongolia also has a shortage of skilled workers. 24. IranHDI Ranking: 26 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 20 Average Ranking: 23Iran has vast reserves of fossil fuel but the country suffers from resource curse, due to the same oil wealth. Further, the country has been adversely affected by Western sanctions.23. Sri LankaHDI Ranking: 27 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 16 Average Ranking: 21.5Sri Lanka is one of the least developed countries in the world, primarily because of factors like corruption and political instability, combined with an economy that lacks diversification. Sri Lanka has further spiraled down after the country defaulted in May, 2022, leading to economic collapse. 22. JordanHDI Ranking: 20 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 21 Average Ranking: 20.5Jordan is located in West Asia, and has a GDP per Capita of $4,103 as of 2021. The main issues with the Jordanian economy is that it lacks diversification in the economy, with the country’s infrastructure also being outdated. 21. IndonesiaHDI Ranking: 17 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 23 Average Ranking: 20Indonesia is located in Southeast Asia, with a GDP per Capita of $4,333 as of 2021. The country is far better-off than most other countries on the list. The human capital in the country has attracted companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG),  Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). However, it still lags far behind the more developed countries in Asia.20. LebanonHDI Ranking: 18 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 22 Average Ranking: 20Lebanon is a West Asian country with a GDP per Capita of $4,136 as of 2021. The country has one of the highest levels of public debt in the world, averaging 155% of the its GDP in the past two decades. Another huge problem in the country is corruption; Lebanon ranked 154th out of 180 countries on the Corruption Perception Index of 2021.19. IraqHDI Ranking: 13 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 25 Average Ranking: 19There are a number of reasons why Iraq is one of the most underdeveloped countries in Asia. The country has been mired in internal violence since the US invasion in 2003, as well as government corruption and income inequality. Moreover, it has one of the most oil-dependent economies in the world. As the World Bank notes, oil comprised 99% of the country’s exports, making up 42% of Iraq's GDP over the past decade. 18. PalestineHDI Ranking: 19 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 18 Average Ranking: 18.5Palestine is located in West Asia. A number of factors like restriction on trade, poor infrastructure, political instability and occupation by Israel has left Palestine underdeveloped. Palestine has a GDP per Capita of $3,664 as of 2021.17. VietnamHDI Ranking: 16 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 19 Average Ranking: 17.5Vietnam is located in Southeast Asia. The country has been underdeveloped due to income inequality and political instability. However, Vietnam has massively leaped forward in recent years in its manufacturing capacity, adding 1.5 million jobs in the sector between 2014 and 2016. It is also the hot new destination for US supply chains, with 20% of them having shifted to Vietnam, from China’s share in 2019, due to the US-China trade war. In this regard, Vietnam’s development outlook is expected to significantly improve over the course of the next decade.High technology US companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) also operate in Vietnam.16. Philippines HDI Ranking: 15 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 17 Average Ranking: 16The Philippines has a GDP per Capita of $3,460 as of 2021. A 34% of the country’s economy is estimated to be informal, shaving off much of the potential for economic growth. 15. UzbekistanHDI Ranking: 21 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 10 Average Ranking: 15.5Uzbekistan has a GDP per Capita of $1,983 as of 2021. The country has been underdeveloped due to the Soviet legacy, which prevented it from liberalization even after independence. For instance, in 1996, Uzbekistan went on a planned-economy drive, with measures like regulation of commodity prices, high taxes, high government spending and establishment of artificial monopolies through favoritism, among others, that created huge unemployment, misery and low economic growth rate. 14. BhutanHDI Ranking: 11 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 15 Average Ranking: 13It would be unfair to characterize Bhutan as backward as other underdeveloped countries, since Bhutan has willfully foregone much of the economic development for environmental conservation.As part of its Gross National Happiness philosophy, its constitution mandates that 60% of the country’s forest cover is preserved. This has resulted in much of the economic “underdevelopment”, which leaves it far behind many Asian economies. 13. BangladeshHDI Ranking: 10 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 12 Average Ranking: 11Bangladesh is one of the least developed countries in Asia. It has a GDP per Capita of $2,458 as of 2021. The low development is driven, in part, by low urbanization, with only 40% of the country’s population urbanized. Bangladesh also has one of the biggest informal economies, with 89% of its workforce employed in informal sectors, according to the estimates of Asian Development Bank.12. Timor-LesteHDI Ranking: 7 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 14 Average Ranking: 10.5Timor-Leste is located in Southeast Asia, and it is one of the least developed Asian countries in 2023. Its GDP per Capita, as of 2021, is $2,741, with 60% of the workforce in the country employed in informal sectors, stunting much of its economic-growth potential.11. LaosHDI Ranking: 8 GDP Per Capita Ranking: 13 Average Ranking: 10.5Laos is underdeveloped for several reasons, including political instability and economic dependence on neighbors like Thailand and Vietnam for trade and investment. However, things are changing fast for the country. The World Bank identified Laos as an integral link in the regional value chain.From 2010 to 2017, Laos’ export revenue from manufactured goods increased from 12% to 17.3%, with the share of electronics and telecom-products export increasing by 35% during the same period. The country remains behind the more developed Asian countries but its outlook is expected to greatly improve by 2030.  Click to continue reading and see the 10 Least Developed Countries in Asia.   Suggested Articles:12 Most Advanced Countries in Asia12 Best Asian Stocks to Buy Heading Into 202325 Most Developed Countries in the WorldDisclosure: none. 25 Least Developed Countries in Asia is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Meta's quarter was poor quality, too, and earnings badly missed, but the market loved deep cuts to the company's expense guidance for 2023.Besides the raw numbers, the commentary from corporate executives has hardly been rah-rah. Those aforementioned tech companies continue to signal slowing demand to the extent they are searching for fresh expense offsets.Story continuesStarbucks CFO Rachel Ruggeri told me on Yahoo Finance Live on Friday they aren't seeing the disinflation talked up by Fed Chair Jerome Powell last week, but still-rising costs.""If we look at market pricing so far this year, it's not even pricing in a soft landing. It's pricing in takeoff. It's pricing inflation to come down. It's pricing growth to avoid a recession altogether. It's also pricing in central banks cutting rates starting mid this year. So that is really markets are priced for perfection,"" BlackRock global chief investment strategist Wei Li said on Yahoo Finance Live.""And in the near term, beyond FOMO and chasing momentum, it's hard to see a fundamental reason for stocks to keep pushing higher.""Wei Li is spot on.The market is growing more dangerous by the day. I am not trying to scare the hell out of you, but rather present the clear-headed take.

AEP, Xcel Energy XEL, Consolidated Edison ED and PPL Corp. PPL.Industry: Electric Power UtilityLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2049374/4-stocks-to-watch-from-the-prospering-electric-power-industryThe Zacks Utility – Electric Power industry stocks have been transitioning toward clean sources of fuel and focusing on lower carbon emissions. The introduction of Inflation Reduction Act 2022 will support the industry’s transition toward clean energy sources to produce electricity. Utilities are also focused on strengthening the grid as well as transmission and distribution infrastructure. The huge infrastructure of the utilities faces the impact of the hurricane season each year. Infrastructure enhancement around the year increases the resilience of the entire system, reduces outages and allows operators to restore power quickly for customers affected by storms.American Electric Power Co., with a large investment to expand renewable operations, widespread transmission and distribution assets and well-chalked-out capital investments to boost infrastructure, offers an excellent opportunity to stay invested in the utility space. Other utilities worth adding to your portfolio include Xcel Energy, Consolidated Edison and PPL Corp.About the IndustryThe Utility – Electric Power industry involves the process of generation, transmission, distribution, storage and sale of electricity to customers. A substantial portion of utilities’ earnings is generated from regulated operations. Unless there is any major weather variation or unprecedented incidents, such as the coronavirus pandemic, demand for the services provided by utilities remains more or less steady, regardless of economic cycles.A clear transition is evident in this industry, with more companies declaring zero-emission goals on their own. Research and development over the years has resulted in a substantial decline in the cost of setting up utility-scale renewable power projects, aiding in the reduction of emissions. However, the ongoing increase in interest rates is a concern for capital-intensive utilities.Story continues3 Electric Power Industry Trends to Watch Out ForTransition Toward Cleaner Sources to Generate Power:  The operators in the U.S. electric power sector are gradually moving toward cleaner sources of energy to produce electricity. Per EIA, the annual share of U.S. electricity generation from renewable energy sources will rise from 21% in 2022 to 24% in 2023 and 26% in 2024 as a result of the continuing addition of solar and wind-generating capacity. EIA expects total solar, wind generation and battery storage addition of 57 GW and 59 GW to be added in 2023 and 2024, respectively.The expansion of renewable energy continues to eat into the share of coal in electricity generation. EIA expects coal contribution to electricity generation to fall from 20% in 2022 to 18% in 2023 and further to 17% in 2024. The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will support and accelerate the utilities’ transition toward clean energy sources.IRA has removed the uncertainties relating to federal incentives provided for renewable sources usage. The Act entails an opportunity for a wide range of low-cost clean energy solutions in a predictable way for a long time and will create earnings visibility.Demand for Electricity Stable: Per EIA, 2023 electricity consumption in the United States can drop 1% in 2023 and rise more than 1% in 2024, EIA believes that the expected drop in demand for electricity in 2023 is due to a milder summer forecast that would lead to less requirement for cooling. Despite the expected drop in consumption, the utilities will continue to add new renewable energy assets to the total generation portfolio.Ongoing Interest Rate Increase is a Concern: Utilities, to maintain, upgrade and expand operations, approach capital markets for loans. The utilities have been enjoying near-zero interest rates for the past few years. But multiple rate hikes in 2022 pushed up interest rates. In February 2023, the Federal Reserve again raised interest rates by 25 percentage points, taking the benchmark rate to a range of 4.50%-4.75%. This is the eighth increase in interest rates since March 2022, with more expected to come in 2023.The increasing interest rates are a concern for capital-intensive utilities in the United States as these will push up capital servicing costs substantially from the current levels. U.S. utilities are currently spending a substantial amount on developing an advanced electricity network. Utilities might try to pass on the burden of increasing borrowing costs to customers but the necessary increase in rates might not get approved by the commission. In such a scenario, the utilities will need to digest the extra expenses, which can lower their profitability and make them less attractive to investors interested in the utility space.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Positive ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates strong near-term prospects. The 59-stock Utility-Electric Power industry is housed within the broader Zacks Utilities sector and currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #92, which places it in the top 37% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

MSCI.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Watch These 5 Stocks That Recently Hiked Their DividendsWall Street ended the first month of 2023 with a solid rally after a highly disappointing 2022. Favorable data for several measures of inflation, various soft economic data and a resilient labor market raised market participants’ hope for a soft landing of the U.S. economy.On Feb 1, in its February FOMC meeting, the Fed hiked the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to the range of 4.50% to 4.75%, marking its highest rate since late 2007. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said “We can now say I think for the first time that the disinflationary process has started.However, it would be very premature to declare victory or to think we really got this.”Powell categorically denied any possibility of a rate cut in 2023. The Fed Chairman said “While recent developments are encouraging, we will need substantially more evidence to be confident that inflation is on a sustained downward path.” Powell hinted at a few more interest rate hikes in 2023.Stocks in FocusAt this stage, dividend-paying stocks should be in demand as investors will try to safeguard their portfolios.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Having said that, from a first glance at PPG Industries (NYSE:PPG) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on PPG Industries is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.11 = US$1.7b ÷ (US$21b - US$4.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Thus, PPG Industries has an ROCE of 11%.  By itself that's a normal return on capital and it's in line with the industry's average returns of 11%. View our latest analysis for PPG Industries roceIn the above chart we have measured PPG Industries' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.The Trend Of ROCEOn the surface, the trend of ROCE at PPG Industries doesn't inspire confidence. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 15% over the last five years. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.In Conclusion...In summary, PPG Industries is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. And investors may be recognizing these trends since the stock has only returned a total of 27% to shareholders over the last five years. As a result, if you're hunting for a multi-bagger, we think you'd have more luck elsewhere.Story continuesPPG Industries does come with some risks though, we found 3 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 1 of those makes us a bit uncomfortable...While PPG Industries may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

That should mean good things for fintech stocks. Investors should expect the continued integration of fintech into traditional financial institutions, such as banks. This will allow for a more seamless and efficient experience for customers, as they can access financial services through various channels, including mobile apps, online portals, and in-person interactions.Further integration of blockchain technology in fintech could lead to more secure and transparent financial transactions. Overall, fintech will continue to play an essential role in shaping the future of the financial industry, making it more accessible, efficient, and personalized for customers.

Its products are built on various blockchain networks, like Ethereum (ETH-USD) and Hyperledger, to increase efficiency, security, and transparency in financial transactions.Most investors will recognize Block for its Square point-of-sale systems and CashApp, which allows users to send and receive money instantly. CashApp has done particularly well with the transaction and subscription-based revenue growing rapidly in 2022.CashApp has increased fees over the last few years, which has led to increased profits.

GPN stock.Source: JHVEPhoto / ShutterstockGlobal Payments (NYSE:GPN) stock is another fintech expected to grow in 2023. It is a fintech company that provides payment processing services for businesses of all sizes. It offers a range of payment solutions, including credit and debit card processing, electronic check processing, and online payment processing. As its name suggests, the company operates in various countries and provides users with reliable and secure payments. The company also offers fraud prevention and data security services.Global Payments is refocusing on the B2B side of its business after exiting the consumer side of its Netspend business to focus on corporate customers exclusively. That decision led to impairments reflected on its balance sheet and financial statements in Q3.The merchant side of the business grew by 11% during the period. The company expects 2022 net revenue to grow by 10% to 11% in 2022. If that turns out to be correct, expect GPN stock to rise as it is effectively refocused on merchant business and corporate clients. That suggests that the divestiture of its underbaked customer business was a good decision.Payoneer Global (PAYO)Payoneer editorial.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can go to Jim Cramer's 5 Favorite Energy and Bank Stock Picks.Jim Cramer is an American television personality, former hedge fund manager, and best-selling author. He is the host of CNBC's Mad Money and co-founder of TheStreet.com. Cramer is known for his energetic and often bombastic on-air style and outspoken views on the stock market and investing.""We're in a Bull Market""After a series of aggressive rate hikes in 2022, on February 1, the Federal Reserve issued another rate hike at its first meeting of 2023. However, this time the Fed raised interest rates by 25 basis points, bringing its federal funds rate target range to between 4.5% and 4.75%. On February 2, Jim Cramer talked about the Fed's latest rate hike and why he thinks that ""everything Powell said in his press conference was positive"". Cramer said ""it's crazy that stocks ever sold off in the first place"" because the Fed is now moving towards getting ""disinflation going, not slowing of inflation, but disinflation"". According to Jim Cramer, ""we're in a bull market"".""It (the bull market) started last fall when long-term interest rates peaked, along with the dollar peaking. Now many stocks have clearly bottomed, even tech.""According to Cramer, ""the Fed is just trying to strike a balance between inflation and price stability"".Jim Cramer noted that selling stocks before the peak in long-term interest rates and the dollar was the right thing to do. However, now that ""the Fed says the rate hikes are working and we're pretty far along the tightening cycle"", selling stocks may not be the right thing to do. According to Cramer, this ""mistaken selling creates the opportunity for you (investors) to buy the dips"".Jim Cramer thinks that there are ""some legitimate, sizable bull markets going on"" and one of them is the banks.This piece will explore some of the favorite energy and bank stock picks of Mad Money host, Jim Cramer.

It is a profitability ratio that measures earnings generated by a company from its equity. Investors can follow the ROE trend in companies and compare this to historical or industry benchmarks to pick a winning stock.However, stepping beyond the basic ROE and analyzing it at an advanced level could lead to even better returns. Here is where the DuPont analysis comes into play. It is an analytical method, which examines three major elements – operating management, management of assets and the capital structure – related to the financial condition of a company. Below, we show how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components:ROE = Net Income/EquityNet Income / Equity = (Net Income / Sales) * (Sales / Assets) * (Assets / Equity)ROE = Profit Margin * Asset Turnover Ratio * Equity MultiplierThe screener yields winning stocks like W.W. Grainger (GWW), Olympic Steel (ZEUS), AllianceBernstein (AB), Valero Energy (VLO)and Phillips 66 (PSX).Why Use DuPont?Although one can’t play down the importance of normal ROE calculation, the fact remains that it doesn’t always provide a complete picture. The DuPont analysis, on the other hand, allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE. It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover. For example, high-end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods, which rely on higher turnover.In fact, it also sheds light on the company’s leverage status, which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains. A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt. Thus, the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load.So, an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio. This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock.Story continuesInvestors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company’s financials.However, looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task. Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis.Screening Parameters• Profit Margin more than or equal to 3: As the name suggests, it is a measure of how profitably the business is running. Generally, it is the key contributor to ROE.• Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2: It allows an investor to assess management’s efficiency in using assets to drive sales.• Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3: It’s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets.• Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environments.• Current Price more than $5: This screens out the low-priced stocks. However, when looking for lower-priced stocks, this criterion can be removed.Here are five of the nine stocks that made it through the screen:W.W.

47,79e21d60-56fd-3b8e-a848-8731802dc7f5,TJX,2023-02-06,"The TJX Companies, Inc.'s (NYSE:TJX) Stock On An Uptrend: Could Fundamentals Be Driving The Momentum?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tjx-companies-inc-nyse-tjx-110037279.html,1675681237,STORY,['TJX'],"[TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 13% over the last three months. Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely to see if they had a hand to play in the recent price move. In this article, we decided to focus on TJX Companies'  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for TJX Companies How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for TJX Companies is:60% = US$3.4b ÷ US$5.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.60 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.TJX Companies' Earnings Growth And 60% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that TJX Companies has a significantly high ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 29% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. Given the circumstances, we can't help but wonder why TJX Companies saw little to no growth in the past five years. So, there could be some other aspects that could potentially be preventing the company from growing. Such as, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that the industry grew its earnings by 34% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if TJX Companies is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is TJX Companies Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Despite having a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 39% (meaning the company retains61% of profits) in the last three-year period, TJX Companies' earnings growth was more or les flat. Therefore, there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.Additionally, TJX Companies has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 35%. Still, forecasts suggest that TJX Companies' future ROE will rise to 82% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.SummaryOverall, we feel that TJX Companies certainly does have some positive factors to consider. However, given the high ROE and high profit retention, we would expect the company to be delivering strong earnings growth, but that isn't the case here. This suggests that there might be some external threat to the business, that's hampering its growth. That being so, the latest industry analyst forecasts show that the analysts are expecting to see a huge improvement in the company's earnings growth rate.

48,f290a968-b056-32c5-b1c1-f5f03a3631a5,AMGN,2023-02-06,Is Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) Using Too Much Debt?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amgen-nasdaq-amgn-using-too-120017508.html,1675684817,STORY,['AMGN'],"[Warren Buffett famously said, 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. Importantly, Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) does carry debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?When Is Debt Dangerous?Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for Amgen What Is Amgen's Debt?You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of December 2022 Amgen had US$38.9b of debt, an increase on US$33.3b, over one year. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$9.31b, its net debt is less, at about US$29.6b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Strong Is Amgen's Balance Sheet?The latest balance sheet data shows that Amgen had liabilities of US$15.7b due within a year, and liabilities of US$45.8b falling due after that. Offsetting this, it had US$9.31b in cash and US$5.56b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$46.6b.This deficit isn't so bad because Amgen is worth a massive US$130.8b, and thus could probably raise enough capital to shore up its balance sheet, if the need arose. However, it is still worthwhile taking a close look at its ability to pay off debt.We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).Story continuesAmgen's net debt of 1.8 times EBITDA suggests graceful use of debt. And the fact that its trailing twelve months of EBIT was 9.1 times its interest expenses harmonizes with that theme. It is well worth noting that Amgen's EBIT shot up like bamboo after rain, gaining 37% in the last twelve months. That'll make it easier to manage its debt. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Amgen's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. During the last three years, Amgen generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 86% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.Our ViewAmgen's conversion of EBIT to free cash flow suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its EBIT growth rate is also very heartening. Looking at the bigger picture, we think Amgen's use of debt seems quite reasonable and we're not concerned about it. While debt does bring risk, when used wisely it can also bring a higher return on equity. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Case in point: We've spotted   3 warning signs for Amgen  you should be aware of.At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

Granted, this venerable list doesn’t bring much excitement. However, these stalwarts command well-established businesses, meaning they likely won’t steer you wrong.Before we begin, though, we need to establish some ground rules. First, none of the most undervalued Dow stocks to buy would qualify as extremely so. Again, we’re talking about established businesses so you’ve got to extend me some rope.Second, I ranked the names from most to least undervalued based on trailing 12-month (TTM) earnings. Specifically, the rankings align with the discount to earnings based on each company’s underlying industry. And for that, I’m indebted to Gurufocus.com’s all-in-one screener. So, with that out of the way, below are the most undervalued Dow stocks to buy in Feb. 2023.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsVZVerizon$41.54DOWDow Inc.$59.94GSGoldman Sachs$369.86MRKMerck$102.92INTCIntel$30.10AMGNAmgen$243.03CSCOCisco$49.26Verizon (VZ)Verizon store sign. VZ stock.Source: ShutterstockEasily topping the list if you will of the most undervalued Dow stocks to buy, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) finally gave its embattled shareholders something to cheer about. In the trailing year, VZ stock gave up over 22% of its equity value. However, it’s trying to make a comeback effort this year, gaining nearly 4%.Currently, the market prices VZ at 8.24 times trailing earnings. In contrast, the sector median value is 15.85 times. In terms of discount against earnings, Verizon ranks better than 79.42% of the competition. Notably, VZ also trades at a forward multiple of 8.87. This compares very favorably to the sector median of 15.47.Another factor tipping its hat toward Verizon centers on analysts’ assessment. Right now, VZ carries a consensus moderate buy rating. Wall Street experts anticipate shares will hit $46.50, implying an upside potential of 11.54%. Therefore, it’s a very reasonable idea among the most undervalued Dow stocks to buy.Story continuesDow Inc. (DOW)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comA multinational chemicals corporation, Dow Inc. (NYSE:DOW) manufactures plastics, chemicals, and agricultural products. Because of the various macroeconomic pressures and disruptions, DOW struggled throughout 2022. In the trailing year, shares tumbled about 2%. However, DOW is on a comeback trail, gaining 18% of equity value so far this year.Presently, Gurufocus.com rates DOW as modestly undervalued based on its proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV). Objectively, the market prices DOW at a trailing multiple of 9.65. In contrast, the sector median stands at 16.45. In terms of discount to earnings, Dow ranks better than 72.51% of its peers.In addition, DOW trades hands at 0.76 times (trailing) sales. This compares to the industry median value of 1.31 times. Looking at its balance sheet and operational profile, Dow arguably facilitates a solid opportunity. Right now, Wall Street analysts rate DOW as a consensus hold. However, hedge fund sentiment for shares pings as very positive. Therefore, it’s a decent idea for the most undervalued Dow stocks to buy.Goldman Sachs (GS)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockA world-renowned financial institution, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) has regional headquarters throughout the globe. Given the ongoing debate about the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, Goldman didn’t get off to an auspicious start last year. Though higher rates promote higher profitability on paper for financial firms, rising borrowing costs also hurt consumer demand.However, this year, GS looks stronger, gaining almost 6% of equity value. At present, the market prices GS at a trailing multiple of 12.17. For comparison, the sector median stands at 16.39 times. Regarding the discount to earnings, Goldman ranks better than 64.29% of its industry.In addition, GS trades at 10.16 times forward earnings, below the sector median value of 13.76 times. While it could use some work on its balance sheet, Goldman features solid revenue growth and above-average profitability.Moreover, Wall Street analysts rate GS as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target calls for shares to rise to $403.15. This implies an upside potential of over 10%, making GS one of the most undervalued Dow stocks to buy.Merck (MRK)medicine research, pharmaceutical background, LJPC stockSource: Sisacorn / Shutterstock.comA pharmaceutical giant, Merck (NYSE:MRK) develops and produces medicines, vaccines, biologic therapies, and animal health products. Given its extraordinary relevancies, Merck represented one of the best-performing securities of 2022. As evidence, in the trailing year, shares gained over 30% of equity value. Because of its massive performance, this year, MRK operated at a disadvantage, shedding nearly 4%.Be that as it may, MRK still represents one of the most undervalued Dow stocks to buy. Currently, the market prices MRK at a trailing multiple of 17.8. In contrast, the sector median stands at 20.87. In terms of discount to earnings, Merck ranks better than 59.47% of its peers.Overall, Merck presents an enticing fiscal profile.

And it also enjoys a blockbuster net margin of 25.88%. Regarding Wall Street analysts’ assessment, MRK enjoys a consensus strong buy view. Also, their average price target implies an upside potential of over 13%. This makes MRK one of the undervalued Dow stocks to buy.Intel (INTC)BZFD stock. blue graphic of person's face made of binary code and microchip lines.Source: shutterstock.com/PeshkovaRecognized globally as a technology powerhouse, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) commands serious industry cachet. However, in recent years, the company stumbled due to competitive pressures as well as some unforced internal errors. Fortunately, management seeks to put the troubled past behind it.

In contrast, the sector median stands at 17.44 times. Regarding discount to earnings, Intel ranks better than 56.66% of the semiconductor industry. Another notable attribute is the company’s price relative to book value. Right now, INTC trades at 1.19 times its book value. As a comparative discount, Intel ranks better than 78.32% of the competition.In fairness, Wall Street analysts rate Intel as a consensus hold. As well, their average price target actually implies a downside to the tune of nearly 6%. However, INTC gained almost 9% in the year so far. For contrarians, it could still represent one of the most undervalued Dow stocks to buy.Amgen (AMGN)Biochemical/biotech research scientist team working with microscopeSource: Mongkolchon Akesin / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Thousand Oaks, California, Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) is one of the world’s largest independent biotech firms. Similar to Merck, Amgen enjoyed a positive performance in 2022. In the trailing year, AMGN gained nearly 8% of equity value. However, in the new year, it’s on a decidedly negative trend, shedding almost 6%.Still, for those looking for a discount, Amgen technically represents one of the most undervalued Dow stocks to buy. Currently, the market prices AMGN at a trailing multiple of 20.35. For comparison, the sector median value is 20.87 (not much difference). Relative to discount to earnings, Amgen ranks better than 52.72% of its rivals.Objectively speaking, Amgen could use some work on its balance sheet. For instance, its Altman Z-Score slipped into the distressed zone. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 8.3%, which is alright compared to the industry. Primarily, Amgen rates strongly in the bottom line. For instance, its net margin pings at nearly 26%. To be fair, Wall Street analysts rate AMGN as a consensus hold. Still, the underlying price target implies an upside of nearly 6% from here on out.Cisco Systems (CSCO)the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wallSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.comFinally, communications technology conglomerate Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) rounds out this list of the most undervalued Dow stocks to buy. On paper, it appears to be just that. In the trailing year, CSCO shares gave up over 13% of equity value. In the year so far, Cisco only gained a bit over 1%. It’s hardly riveting stuff here, which might appeal to contrarians.However, on a fundamental basis, few would call Cisco a discount relative to its industry. Right now, the market prices CSCO at 17.53 times trailing earnings. For comparison, the sector median is 17.84 times. Regarding discount to earnings, Cisco ranks better than 50.45% of the competition. Again, it’s nothing to brag about. However, the other Dow stocks are actually overvalued.To end this list on a positive note, Wall Street analysts rate CSCO as a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target of $54.70 implies an upside potential of nearly 13%.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The firm said in a statement that Newmont offered 0.380 of its shares for each Newcrest share, amounting to about A$27.16 (A$1 = $0.6893) per share, or a 21% premium to Newcrest’s last close.The offer follows an earlier approach by Newmont for the Australian gold miner, where it had offered 0.363 Newmont shares per Newcrest stock. The offer was rejected on the grounds that it ""would not deliver sufficiently compelling value to Newcrest shareholders.”The Newcrest board said it is now considering Newmont’s new offer. The bid comes at a time when the Australian gold miner is embarking on big changes, including the search for a new chief executive, as well as the expansion of its flagship Cadia project in New South Wales.Newcrest also recently approved expansions at its projects in Western Australia and Papua New Guinea.The Newmont offer helped Newcrest shares duck recent weakness in gold markets. Spot gold logged its worst week in seven months after stronger-than-expected U.S. labor data pushed up fears of more interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.But the gold miner is expected to have benefited from a three-month run-up in gold prices, as the yellow metal bounced back sharply from 2022 lows.A recovery in copper prices, on hopes of resurgent Chinese demand, is also expected to have boosted Newcrest’s bottom line.The firm is set to release its earnings for the six months to December 31 next week. It recently reiterated its 2023 production guidance of 2.1 million to 2.4 million ounces.Goldman Sachs analysts commented:""If closed, we believe the consolidation of NCM.AX would provide NEM (1) a path to immediate and substantial volume uplift (particularly in context of the company's flattish production outlook for the next 2 years on a standalone basis), (2) increasing exposure to copper, and (3) expansion of its footprint in locations (such as Australia and Canada in particular) that NEM is comfortable with.""Story continuesNewmont stock is down almost 6% in premarket Monday on the news.Related ArticlesGoldman reacts positively to Newmont's new $17 billion bid for Newcrest MiningPutin approves sale of Mercedes-Benz Russian finance armTyson Foods misses profit estimates as lower beef prices bite]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read Dividend Challengers List Ranked By Yield: Top 10. Dividend Challengers are companies that have raised their dividends for five years or more. These companies tend to have strong financials and are often viewed as more mature than non-dividend-paying companies. Moreover, they are likely to continue growing their payouts in the future and can be a reliable investment option for risk-averse investors. Examples of popular dividend stocks that have rewarded investors with decades-long dividend growth include The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG),  Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE:AOS).With the growing risks of a global recession, dividend stocks are taking the spotlight as these securities have helped investors through previous periods of economic decline. According to a report by Charles Schwab, high-dividend stocks outperformed the overall market in every recessionary bear market of the past 50 years, except for the financial crisis of 2008-2009, when companies were made to slash their payouts. The same report also highlighted the importance of diversified portfolios, with securities scattered through various sectors.When evaluating dividend stocks, investors should be aware of some potential risks so that they can make more informed investment decisions. Companies with relatively high payout ratios are more vulnerable to a dividend cut. On the other hand, companies that have consistently raised their dividends have solid cash flow generation, which makes them more committed to shareholder obligation. As many companies showed confidence in their sufficient cash flow, dividend spending is likely to increase this year as well. In 2022, companies in the S&amp;P 500 distributed approximately $561 billion in dividends, reaching their highest amount on record. Given the above discussion, we will further elaborate on Dividend Challengers in this article.Story continuesDividend Challengers List Ranked By Yield: Top 25Photo by Marga Santoso on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we selected stocks from the list of Dividend Challengers, the companies that have raised their payouts for consecutive five years or more.

We invested in VICI in 2018 when earnings were declining due to dilutive acquisitions. Our thesis was that, as investors grew more comfortable with casinos as a REIT subsector, the value of their properties would increase. We also liked the defensive characteristics of the company, specifically the triple-net lease structure, which dictates that lessees pay all maintenance and capital expenditures, and the history of casino REITs with zero rent payments missed by casinos during either the global financial crisis or the 2020 pandemic. Furthermore, we were confident that VICI’s growth prospects would increase as more casinos monetized land holdings with VICI’s ability to use its extensive cash and liquidity to make acquisitions. VICI’s stock outperformed in the quarter due to its appeal as a fairly defensive investment and the news that it would be included in the S&amp;P 500 Index. We maintained our position in VICI.”22.

Shares of Tyson, the largest U.S. meat company by sales, were down 4.8% at $60.97 on Monday afternoon.The results show Tyson's struggle to forecast demand for meat in a high-inflation environment and as the availability of beef changes rapidly while drought in the western United States drives ranchers to reduce cattle herds by sending more animals to slaughter.Tyson also grappled with larger-than-expected supplies of chicken as the worst-ever U.S. outbreak of bird flu triggered export restrictions, resulting in more poultry available domestically, the company said.""We got hit in the mouth in Q1 because of all the protein on the market,"" Chief Executive Officer Donnie King told analysts on a call.Tyson began planning in August to meet strong demand for chicken at supermarkets in November and December, King said. Meatpacking executives thought chicken would need to fill an expected gap in overall meat supplies caused by reduced beef and pork production, he said.Their forecasts were wrong, though. Beef production was surprisingly high, leaving Tyson to resell excess chicken at a discount and spend money moving it, King said.In January, Tyson said Wes Morris would replace David Bray as president of its poultry business.The company can do a better job making sure it has the appropriate number of chickens in the right place at the right time, Morris said on the call. Tyson can also improve its understanding of shifting consumer demand, he said.Story continuesThe second quarter will likely be weaker than the first, which ended on Dec. 31, Chief Financial Officer John R. Tyson said. Tyson cut its outlooks for operating margins this year.Consumers are exhibiting ""unusual, erratic"" behavior swapping between proteins, King said.The impact of too much meat is a turnaround after Tyson said it struggled to get meat on store shelves during the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent supply-chain problems.Tyson's sales rose 2.5% to $13.26 billion in the first quarter, missing analysts' average estimate of $13.52 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

The following is a summary of the outlook for each of our segments, as well as an outlook for revenues, capital expenditures, net interest expense, liquidity and tax rate for fiscal 2023. Certain of the outlook numbers include adjusted operating margin (a non-GAAP metric) for each segment. The Company is not able to reconcile its full-year fiscal 2023 projected adjusted results to its fiscal 2023 projected GAAP results because certain information necessary to calculate such measures on a GAAP basis is unavailable or dependent on the timing of future events outside of our control. Therefore, because of the uncertainty and variability of the nature of the amount of future adjustments, which could be significant, the Company is unable to provide a reconciliation for these forward-looking non-GAAP measures without unreasonable effort. Adjusted operating margin should not be considered a substitute for operating margin or any other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. Investors should rely primarily on the Company’s GAAP results and use non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally in making investment decisionsBeginning in fiscal 2022, we launched a new productivity program, which is designed to drive a better, faster and more agile organization that is supported by a culture of continuous improvement and faster decision making. We targeted an aggregate $1 billion in productivity savings by the end of fiscal 2024 relative to a fiscal 2021 cost baseline. We realized more than $700 million of productivity savings in fiscal 2022, which partially offset the impacts of inflationary market conditions, and we believe we will exceed our aggregate $1 billion target in fiscal 2023, a year ahead of our plan.BeefUSDA projects domestic production will decrease approximately 5% in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022. We anticipate an adjusted operating margin of 2% to 4% in fiscal 2023 as margins are expected to decrease from historically high levels.PorkUSDA projects domestic production will be relatively flat in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022.

Capital expenditures include spending for capacity expansion and utilization, automation to alleviate labor challenges and brand and product innovation.Net Interest ExpenseWe expect net interest expense to approximate $330 million for fiscal 2023.LiquidityWe expect total liquidity, which was approximately $2.9 billion at December 31, 2022, to remain above our minimum liquidity target of $1.0 billion.Tax RateWe currently expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be around 24% for fiscal 2023.2 The Company is not able to reconcile its full-year fiscal 2023 projected adjusted results to its fiscal 2023 projected GAAP results because certain information necessary to calculate such measures on a GAAP basis is unavailable or dependent on the timing of future events outside of our control.

Net debt to EBITDA (Adjusted EBITDA) represents the ratio of our debt, net of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, to EBITDA (and to Adjusted EBITDA). EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, net debt to EBITDA and net debt to Adjusted EBITDA are presented as supplemental financial measurements in the evaluation of our business. Adjusted EBITDA is a tool intended to assist our management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision-making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations on an ongoing basis.We believe the presentation of these financial measures helps management and investors to assess our operating performance from period to period, including our ability to generate earnings sufficient to service our debt, enhances understanding of our financial performance and highlights operational trends. These measures are widely used by investors and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies; however, the measurements of EBITDA (and Adjusted EBITDA) and net debt to EBITDA (and to Adjusted EBITDA) may not be comparable to those of other companies, which may limit their usefulness as comparative measures. EBITDA (and Adjusted EBITDA) and net debt to EBITDA (and to Adjusted EBITDA) are not measures required by or calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as substitutes for net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of operating cash flow or liquidity. EBITDA (and Adjusted EBITDA) is a useful tool for assessing, but is not a reliable indicator of, our ability to generate cash to service our debt obligations because certain of the items added to net income to determine EBITDA (and Adjusted EBITDA) involve outlays of cash. As a result, actual cash available to service our debt obligations will be different from EBITDA (and Adjusted EBITDA).

Permitting Russia to maintain export volumes has helped to ensure that the world remains well supplied, which has contributed to Brent crude’s slide to about $80 a barrel. That has further reduced Moscow’s income, while helping to ease global inflationary pressures.Aggregate volumes of Russian crude rose by 125,000 barrels a day to 3.465 million in the four weeks to Feb. 3, even though weekly shipments fell by a similar amount. The increase in seaborne shipments in recent weeks has been offset almost exactly by a drop in pipeline flows to Europe. Volumes piped to Germany and Poland slid to about 120,000 barrels a day in January from 510,000 barrels a day last summer.In contrast, flows into the Kremlin's war chest from its crude-export duty fell by $7 million to $50 million in the seven days to Feb. 3, while the four-week average income dropped by $2 million to $54 million.Averaging flows over several weeks smooths out peaks and troughs in what are noisy weekly data and gives a clearer picture of trends in Russia’s crude exports. The weekly figures are highly volatile, depending on the timings of when individual shipments depart and things like weather conditions and work at ports.Story continuesThe European Union’s import ban on Russia crude has led to much longer voyages for shipments, with journeys now taking an average of 31 days from Baltic ports to India, compared with just seven days from the same terminals to Rotterdam and about half that to Poland. That’s putting more pressure on the dwindling fleet of ships whose owners are willing to haul Russian cargoes. A similar pattern is expected to emerge in Russia’s refined products trade.The country is increasingly reliant on its own tankers and a so-called “ shadow fleet” of usually older ships owned by small, often unknown companies that have sprung up in recent months. European-owned vessels can still carry Russian crude, as long as it is sold at a price below a $60-a-barrel cap, introduced at the same time as the import ban. The level of that cap is due to be reviewed in March.There has also been a resurgence in ship-to-ship transfers of cargoes in the Mediterranean, with loads either being combined onto larger vessels or shifted from ice-class tankers to others in order to free up those ships needed for operations in the Baltic in the winter months.Tankers hauling Russian crude are becoming more cagey about their final destinations. Vessels carrying more than 41 million barrels of Russian crude, the equivalent of 1.45 million barrels a day of exports, left port showing no clear final destination in the four weeks to Feb. 3.Crude Flows by Destination:On a four-week average basis, overall seaborne exports rose by 125,000 barrels a day from the period to Jan. 27. At 3.465 million barrels a day, four-week average flows are the highest since June.All figures exclude cargoes identified as Kazakhstan’s KEBCO grade. These are shipments made by KazTransoil JSC that transit Russia for export through Ust-Luga and Novorossiysk.The Kazakh barrels are blended with crude of Russian origin to create a uniform export grade. Since the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, Kazakhstan has rebranded its cargoes to distinguish them from those shipped by Russian companies. Transit crude is specifically exempted from the EU sanctions.The volume of crude on vessels heading to China, India and Turkey, the three countries that emerged as the only significant buyers of displaced Russian supplies, plus the quantities on ships that are yet to show a final destination, jumped in the four weeks to Feb. 3 to average 3.29 million barrels a day. That’s up by 172,000 barrels a day from the period to Jan. 27, and the highest since Bloomberg began monitoring the flows in detail at the start of 2022.The figure has been rising since the start of the year, when Germany and Poland slashed the volume of crude they were taking through the Druzhba pipeline from Russia. It is likely that these volumes have been redirected to Russia’s Baltic ports and are now being shipped to Asia.Most of the ships yet to show destinations are likely to end up in India or China.AsiaMost Read from BloombergQuakes Kill 2,500 in Turkey and Syria; Millions Lose PowerTurkey’s South Hit by a Second High-Magnitude EarthquakeUS Moves to Recover Chinese Balloon While Weighing RetaliationDell to Cut About 6,650 Jobs, Battered by Plunging PC SalesChina Moves From Contrite to Confrontational Over US BalloonFour-week average shipments to Russia’s Asian customers, plus those on vessels showing no final destination, which typically end up in either India or China, jumped to a new high of 3.15 million barrels a day in the four-week period to Feb. 3.While the volume heading to India appears to have slumped, history shows that most of the cargoes on ships initially showing no final destination end up there.The equivalent of more than 820,000 barrels a day was on vessels showing destinations as either Port Said or Suez, or which have already been or are expected to be transferred from one ship to another off the South Korean port of Yeosu. Those voyages typically end at ports in India and show up in the chart below as “Unknown Asia” until a final destination becomes apparent.The “Unknown” volumes, running at 633,000 barrels a day in the four weeks to Feb. 3, are those on tankers showing a destination of Gibraltar, Ceuta, Kalamata, Malta or no destination at all. Most of those cargoes go on to Asia, but some could end up in Turkey. An increasing number are being transferred from one vessel to another in the Mediterranean for onward journeys through the Suez Canal or on larger vessels around Africa.EuropeMost Read from BloombergQuakes Kill 2,500 in Turkey and Syria; Millions Lose PowerTurkey’s South Hit by a Second High-Magnitude EarthquakeUS Moves to Recover Chinese Balloon While Weighing RetaliationDell to Cut About 6,650 Jobs, Battered by Plunging PC SalesChina Moves From Contrite to Confrontational Over US BalloonRussia’s seaborne crude exports to European countries edged lower to 125,000 barrels a day in the 28 days to Feb. 3, with Bulgaria the sole European destination. These figures do not include shipments to Turkey.A market that consumed more than 1.5 million barrels a day of short-haul crude, coming from export terminals in the Baltic, Black Sea and Arctic has been lost almost completely, to be replaced by long-haul destinations in Asia that are much more costly and time-consuming to serve.No Russian crude was shipped to northern European countries in the four weeks to Feb. 3.Exports to Mediterranean countries rose from the previous week on both a weekly and a four-week average basis.Turkey was the only destination for Russian seaborne crude into the Mediterranean and flows there are creeping back up from the lows seen for most of December and into early January. Four-week average shipments to Turkey were the highest in eight weeks in the period to Feb. 3.Flows to Bulgaria, now Russia’s only Black Sea market for crude, gave up the previous week’s increase, slipping back to 125,000 barrels a day. Bulgaria secured a partial exemption from the EU ban, which should support inflows now that the embargo has come into force.Flows by Export LocationAggregate flows of Russian crude fell by 135,000 barrels a day, or 4%, in the seven days to Feb. 3. A big drop in flows from the Baltic, which were down by 625,000 barrels a day, or 32%, was partly offset by gains in Arctic and Pacific exports. Shipments from the Black Sea were unchanged from the previous week.Figures exclude volumes from Ust-Luga and Novorossiysk identified as Kazakhstan’s KEBCO grade.Export RevenueInflows to the Kremlin's war chest from its crude-export duty fell by $7 million to $50 million in the seven days to Feb. 3, while the four-week average income dropped by $2 million to $54 million.February’s duty rate is set at $1.75 a barrel. That’s down by 23% from January and the lowest per barrel rate since June 2020, during the depths of the Covid 19 pandemic. The drop is the result of a decline in Urals prices over the measurement period, which ran from mid-December to mid-January. Russia’s benchmark grade averaged $46.82 a barrel according to ministry figures, a discount of almost $35 a barrel to Brent over the same period.The formula used to calculate duty rates was altered for 2023, with the country moving away from taxing exports and shifting the burden to production as part of its multi-year tax maneuver. The plan sees export duty phased out entirely by the start of 2024.Origin-to-Location FlowsThe following charts show the number of ships leaving each export terminal and the destinations of crude cargoes from the four export regions.A total of 32 tankers loaded 24 million barrels of Russian crude in the week to Feb. 3, vessel-tracking data and port agent reports show. That’s down by 945,000 barrels, or 4%, from the previous week. Destinations are based on where vessels signal they are heading at the time of writing, and some will almost certainly change as voyages progress. All figures exclude cargoes identified as Kazakhstan’s KEBCO grade.The total volume on ships loading Russian crude from Baltic terminals fell back from the high seen the previous week, dropping to a four-week low.Shipments from Novorossiysk in the Black Sea were stable at about 400,000 barrels a day for a third week in the period to Feb. 3.Arctic shipments rebounded to equal their highest since October, with three Suezmax tankers leaving from Murmansk during the week. With all cargoes now heading to Asia via the Suez Canal, these larger vessels have replaced the Aframaxes that were previously used for deliveries from the floating storage units at the port.Flows from the Pacific rose to equal their highest level since at least the beginning of 2022, with 12 tankers loaded at the region’s three terminals, up from 10 the previous week.Note: This story forms part of a regular weekly series tracking shipments of crude from Russian export terminals and the export duty revenues earned from them by the Russian government.Note: All figures exclude cargoes owned by Kazakhstan’s KazTransOil JSC, which transit Russia and are shipped from Novorossiysk and Ust-Luga as KEBCO grade crude.Note: Data on crude flows can also be found at {DSET CRUDEJ }.

It follows a $4.8-billion takeover of Yamana Gold Inc. by Pan American Silver Corp. and Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd. that’s expected to close by the end of March and comes as gold prices have experienced a sustained period of strength since 2020. Top mining executives have predicted more consolidation in the industry as producers struggle with declining output and higher input costs, and increasingly harder-to-mine deposits.Newmont has been working on its pursuit of Newcrest for a few months before making initial bids and is seeking a friendly deal, said a person with knowledge of the transaction who didn’t want to be named because the details aren’t public.Denver-based Newmont confirmed it made the offer in a statement late Sunday, saying the deal “presents a powerful value proposition” to both businesses. The company didn’t immediately comment on when it started working on the deal.Newcrest shares closed up 9.3% at A$24.53 in Sydney, while Newmont shares fell as much as 5.8 in New York.While the bid for Newcrest could trigger rival producers to consider the merits of a counter move amid consolidation in the precious metal sector, the head of Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s No. 2 bullion producer, said he doesn’t plan to make a rival bid.“There is a difference between value merger acquisitions and getting bigger for the sake of getting bigger,” Chief Executive Officer Mark Bristow said in a Monday interview.Story continuesAlready the world’s biggest gold miners with a market value of nearly $40 billion, Newmont made an earlier lower bid for Newcrest that its board rejected. The US miner is effectively offering to buy back its old spinoff, as Newcrest was originally set up as its Australian subsidiary in the 1960s.In 1990, Newmont Australia Limited acquired Australmin Holdings Ltd, subsequently merged with BHP Gold Limited and changed its name to Newcrest Mining Limited. The takeover, if completed, would also be one of the biggest in Australian history, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“The strong Australian dollar, gold prices and declining global reserves suggest more acquisitions are likely, particularly for businesses like Newcrest, which has significant copper exposure,” Bloomberg Intelligence industry analyst Mohsen Crofts said in a note on Monday.The deal would also increase Newmont’s footprint in copper, which is becoming more sought after due to its use in renewable energy and electric vehicles as economies de-carbonize.Newcrest derives the majority of its revenue from gold, and the rest from silver and copper, with mines in Australia, Canada and Papua New Guinea. The company plans to ramp up the copper component to take advantage of the expected surge in demand, Sherry Duhe, acting chief executive officer, said in an interview in November.Growing Appreciation of CopperUnder the proposed deal, shareholders would receive 0.38 Newmont shares for each Newcrest share held, equivalent to A$27.16 a share or a 21% premium to Friday’s close, the Melbourne-based miner said in a regulatory filing Monday. The board is considering the proposal, which is conditional on Newmont being granted exclusive due diligence, Newcrest said.The approach comes in the middle of Newcrest’s search for a new chief executive officer following the resignation of Sandeep Biswas in December. Duhe, the former chief financial officer of oil and gas producer Woodside Energy Group Ltd., is acting CEO until a permanent replacement is found.The Australian miner will be getting roughly a quarter of its revenue from copper over the next decade, and there’s a growing appreciation for long-term stable supply of the metal, RBC Capital Markets said in a note. Newcrest shareholders may see the offer as either opportunistic or an answer to management uncertainty, it said.The Australian miner has engaged JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. and Gresham Advisory Partners Ltd. as its financial advisers and Herbert Smith Freehills as its legal adviser.Newmont said it was using BofA Securities, Centerview Partners LLC and Lazard Ltd. as financial advisers, and King &amp; Wood Mallesons and White &amp; Case LLP as legal advisers.--With assistance from Harry Brumpton, Jeff Sutherland, Liz Ng, Thomas Biesheuvel and Jacob Lorinc.(Updates with shares in fifth paragraph.

Since the start of the year, the pace of shipments has dropped further to a rate of 44 million tons, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public.The disruptions to a key South African export industry come as the appetite for coal in Europe following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine pushes prices to a record. Some producers — including Glencore Plc, Thungela Resources Ltd. and Exxaro Resources Ltd. — have resorted to sending coal by truck to alternative ports, even though they are also shareholders in RBCT.A Transnet spokeswoman wasn’t immediately able to comment.While RBCT has been expanded to an annual export capacity of 91 million tons, the troubled rail corridor is hobbling its operations. Transnet said Thursday that it will take as long as three years to recover from the corruption that engulfed the state-owned company under President Jacob Zuma’s rule.Alongside security issues, underinvestment in infrastructure and a lack of locomotives are curbing rail capacity. Exports may only grow to about 60 million tons by 2025, depending on the outcome of certain initiatives.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekChatGPT Gets an MBAWhen Financial Bubbles Are Hard to PopA Billionaire’s Son Battles a Turbulent WWE Over the Future of Pro WrestlingWhen Hackers Hobbled Ireland’s Hospitals, They Took Themselves Down, TooA Portuguese Manufacturer Aims to Unseat Asia in $5,000 Bikes©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Rising crude inventories left the market vulnerable to a downshift in broader sentiment, briefly pushing oil prices below the lower Bollinger band. Crossing the bottom band is a technical signal that indicates an oversold threshold has been breached, prompting traders to throttle back selling.Among the factors supporting crude, a major earthquake in Turkey halted oil flows to the Ceyhan export terminal, which ships out more than 1 million barrels a day, and a technical fault at Norway’s giant Johan Sverdrup field lowered production there.Prices endured a bumpy January, rising on China’s end to its Covid Zero policies and falling on the US’s inventory builds. Continued uncertainty of how both countries will fare is fueling much of the consternation among investors. Long term, China is the most important factor as the scale and speed of its reopening will be key for traders, but other factors are altering the short-term outlook.“I can be max bullish based on a bunch of forward-looking items,” but then there are stock builds to consider, said Vikas Dwivedi, global oil and gas strategist at Macquarie. “That’s the tension right now.”--With assistance from Julia Fanzeres.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekChatGPT Gets an MBAThat Zoom Meeting Really Could Have Been a Simple Phone CallWhen Financial Bubbles Are Hard to PopA Billionaire’s Son Battles a Turbulent WWE Over the Future of Pro WrestlingWhen Hackers Hobbled Ireland’s Hospitals, They Took Themselves Down, Too©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

That's down from a peak of over 7% in November.""Interested buyers are out there,"" Odeta Kushi, First American Deputy Chief Economist, wrote in a statement. ""From a financial perspective, the decision to buy a home comes down to a payment-to-paycheck calculation, and lower rates may help to reduce the mortgage payment while higher incomes can increase one’s monthly paycheck.""As Redfin (RDFN) CEO Glenn Kelman said late last month, the housing market in January was ""stronger than anyone could've hoped.""Still, signs of demand are still tepid. Mortgage applications to purchase a home fell 10% for the week ending January 27, which marked a 41% drop from a year ago during the same period, per the Mortgage Bankers Association. And just 16% of prospective buyers said now is a good time to buy, the same as in November, according to a survey by the University of Michigan. Over the last couple of weeks, however, new data has offered some signs the housing market may have begun to turn a corner as the calendar flipped from 2022 to 2023.Home Builder SentimentThe biggest obstacle for homebuilding in 2022 was a pessimistic outlook carrying into the new year, but there are signs that viewpoint has changed.Confidence among single-family home builders in January rose for the first time in over a year, ending a 12-month stretch of declines and signaling a potential turning point in the housing market.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.""Probably past the worst, but a sustained improvement will have to wait,"" Kieran Clancy, senior U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note following the release on Jan. 18.The latest survey showed builders continue to use incentives like price reductions to boost sales, but NAHB Chairman Jerry Konter predicted that the lows for housing permits and starts are likely near and ""a rebound for home building could be underway later in 2023.”Story continuesHousing StartsAmerican builders continued to slow down home construction in December, as housing starts fell 1.4% in the last month of the year to an annualized rate of 1.38 million homes, down 22% from December 2021 levels, the Commerce Department said Jan. 19. Housing starts for single family homes rose 11.3% to an annualized rate of 909,000, while multi-family housing starts came in at a rate of 463,000.Permits to build slipped 1.6% in December to an annualized rate of 1.33 million, down nearly 30% from the same month in 2021. And permits to build single-family units dropped 6.5% to an annualized rate of 730,000, while multi-family permits reached a pace of 555,000 in December.Higher construction and labor costs also plagued new builds.Construction costs rose more than 30% since the beginning of last year due to persistent supply chain disruptions, according to the National Association of Home Builders.Existing Home SalesExisting home sales in December fell to an annualized rate of 4.02 million, an eleventh consecutive monthly decline, but still better than the rate of 3.95 million expected by economists, according to Bloomberg data.The median sales price for an existing home jumped 2.3% to $366,900 compared to a year ago, according to data from the National Association of Realtors released Jan. 20.""December was another difficult month for buyers, who continue to face limited inventory and high mortgage rates,"" NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said in a statement. ""However, expect sales to pick up again soon since mortgage rates have markedly declined after peaking late last year.""Total inventory for housing reached 970,000 units at the end of December, down 13.4% from the prior month.

All four regions experienced a dip in transactions for the year, with the West taking the biggest hit of 37.5%.""This recent low point in home sales activity is likely over,"" Yun said. ""Mortgage rates are the dominant factor driving home sales, and recent declines in rates are clearly helping to stabilize the market.""New Home SalesNew homes sales rose 2.3% last month to an annualized pace of 616,000, up from November’s 602,000, according to a report from the Census Bureau released Jan. 26.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Monthly Dividend Stocks with Over 5% Yield. During a difficult time for the capital markets in 2022, dividend-paying stocks proved to be a strong investment, outperforming both non-dividend stocks and bonds during the year. Even with a sluggish economy, market specialists remain optimistic about the growth of dividends. This is due to the conservative dividend payout ratios, which provide companies with sufficient buffers to keep increasing dividends even in the face of slowing or declining earnings growth. Concerns about inflation persist in 2023. Dividend-growing stocks can perform well during inflationary periods because, unlike bonds with fixed interest payments, the increasing dividends can help counter the impact of inflation and maintain purchasing power.Dividends have made a substantial contribution to the returns earned by investors over the past half-century. From 1960 till present, reinvested dividends and the impact of compounding have accounted for 84% of the total return of the S&amp;P 500 Index. From 1930 to 2021, the average contribution of dividend income to the total return of the S&amp;P 500 Index was 40%.ClearBridge Investments, a leading global equity manager with $151.3 billion in assets under management as of December 31, 2022, announced that it will target companies with the ability to increase prices in response to inflationary pressures, thus preserving their profitability. The firm has a positive outlook on financial sector companies, as they can benefit from rising interest rates and a strong labor market, thus maintaining high credit quality. ClearBridge also anticipates that the energy sector will remain a key contributor to dividend returns, due to its strength and the financial stability of some of the companies within the sector. The firm considers investing in dividends to be a timeless strategy.Story continuesMonthly dividend stocks offer consistent and growing income, improved reinvestment opportunities, and a potential for higher yield. While investors usually pick up dividend names like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), we discuss monthly dividend payers in this article. Our Methodology We referred to the “2023 Monthly Dividend Stocks List” from Sure Dividend, selecting stocks yielding more than 5% as of February 3.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read Dividend Challengers List Ranked By Yield: Top 10. Dividend Challengers are companies that have raised their dividends for five years or more. These companies tend to have strong financials and are often viewed as more mature than non-dividend-paying companies. Moreover, they are likely to continue growing their payouts in the future and can be a reliable investment option for risk-averse investors. Examples of popular dividend stocks that have rewarded investors with decades-long dividend growth include The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG),  Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE:AOS).With the growing risks of a global recession, dividend stocks are taking the spotlight as these securities have helped investors through previous periods of economic decline. According to a report by Charles Schwab, high-dividend stocks outperformed the overall market in every recessionary bear market of the past 50 years, except for the financial crisis of 2008-2009, when companies were made to slash their payouts. The same report also highlighted the importance of diversified portfolios, with securities scattered through various sectors.When evaluating dividend stocks, investors should be aware of some potential risks so that they can make more informed investment decisions. Companies with relatively high payout ratios are more vulnerable to a dividend cut. On the other hand, companies that have consistently raised their dividends have solid cash flow generation, which makes them more committed to shareholder obligation. As many companies showed confidence in their sufficient cash flow, dividend spending is likely to increase this year as well. In 2022, companies in the S&amp;P 500 distributed approximately $561 billion in dividends, reaching their highest amount on record. Given the above discussion, we will further elaborate on Dividend Challengers in this article.Story continuesDividend Challengers List Ranked By Yield: Top 25Photo by Marga Santoso on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we selected stocks from the list of Dividend Challengers, the companies that have raised their payouts for consecutive five years or more.

We invested in VICI in 2018 when earnings were declining due to dilutive acquisitions. Our thesis was that, as investors grew more comfortable with casinos as a REIT subsector, the value of their properties would increase. We also liked the defensive characteristics of the company, specifically the triple-net lease structure, which dictates that lessees pay all maintenance and capital expenditures, and the history of casino REITs with zero rent payments missed by casinos during either the global financial crisis or the 2020 pandemic. Furthermore, we were confident that VICI’s growth prospects would increase as more casinos monetized land holdings with VICI’s ability to use its extensive cash and liquidity to make acquisitions. VICI’s stock outperformed in the quarter due to its appeal as a fairly defensive investment and the news that it would be included in the S&amp;P 500 Index. We maintained our position in VICI.”22.

In reality, it's still a good opportunity to establish positions in safe companies to purchase for the long term while fear, uncertainty, and doubt continue to roil the markets.Although buying risk-free stocks sounds like a great idea, there isn't a stock that is really secure. Even the most stable organizations frequently endure considerable stock price fluctuation, and even the finest companies might encounter unforeseen difficulties. This was evident in the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic when the stock prices of numerous powerful firms fell sharply. One way to deal with individual stock risk is diversification.Over the last 12 months, U.S. stocks declined slightly more than 10%. We had a great start to 2023, but the markets seem to be overly optimistic. Long-term interest rates are around 3.5% and consensus estimates for S&amp;P 500 Index hover around $230. This means the market has a forward PE ratio of 18 assuming that the optimistic consensus earnings estimates are accurate.Long-term investors, however, don't pay attention to the volatile, short-term rise and fall of stock markets. Instead, they invest in shares of dependable businesses with consistent performance over years or even decades. The best long-term investments are equities of expanding companies that offer consistent profits. You must comprehend the measurements that provide reliable proof of trustworthy long-term success to locate them.12 Safe Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundsFactors include routinely outperforming the S&amp;P 500 and avoiding the significant short-term drops (and gains) that high-flying firms typically go through. These companies often have solid, well-established operations, consistent revenues, and a reliable supply of dividends for shareholders. As the pandemic last year showed, safe equities may provide investors with a route out of a financial catastrophe during a recession. Some of the notable names in the list of safe stocks include Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Cisco Systems, Inc.

Given outsized key product risk (patent cliff and generic launches beginning in 2023), AbbVie has broadened its pipeline, highlighted by its Allergan acquisition. Shares fell on results that missed consensus and indications that legacy franchises were outperforming newer product launches, calling into question AbbVie’s long-term strategy.

In turn, they follow your lead, purchase en masse, and the price of your shares rises with demand. Short-term volatility will remain for those who take this approach now. But market cyclicality will do its magic and markets will again rise. That premise makes these undervalued stocks notable.  MELIMercadoLibre$1,211.13UNHUnitedHealth$469.17CTSHCognizant Technology$70.03GLNGGolar LNG$23.00GTGoodyear Tire$11.66REGNRegeneron$749.53FANGDiamondback Energy$137.92MercadoLibre (MELI)A miniature shopping cart is filled with cardboard boxes.Source: William Potter / Shutterstock.comOne of the top most undervalued stocks to buy is MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI). The company operates a leading e-commerce platform in Latin America. It also operates in 18 countries in the region and offers a wide range of products and services, including online retail, and online financial services.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMercadoLibre has experienced strong growth in recent years thanks to the rapid expansion of e-commerce in the region. The stock continues to get more attention these days due to its increasing market share which has brought its price higher. I’d argue that it remains undervalued even though it isn’t far from its target price after jumping from $826 on Jan. 2 to $1,215 on Jan. 27. MELI stock is one of few e-commerce giants providing reliable returns.  UnitedHealth (UNH) Nurse holding a tablet with icons representing different aspects of healthcare and healthcare data representing CANO stock.Source: metamorworks / ShutterstockNext up on this list of undervalued stocks to buy is UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH).  After doing my due diligence, it’s clear UNH is undervalued relative to its sector peers. In addition, UnitedHealth’s ROE is currently the highest it’s been over the last 10 years, at 26.94. In short, if you purchase UNH stock, anticipate that the company will turn your investment into bottom-line net income. Story continuesFurther, the company excels at creating value through the efficient use of capital. The method of measuring this is by comparing the weighted average cost of capital, WACC, against the return on invested capital, or ROIC. A higher ROIC than the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is referred to as value creation as the capital return is greater than the cost. UnitedHealth’s ROIC is about 3% greater than its WACC. Cognizant Technology (CTSH)Cognizant Technology Solutions logo on a corporate buildingSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comCognizant Technology (NASDAQ:CTSH) is another one of the top undervalued stocks to buy. Cognizant Technology Solutions is a global professional services company that provides digital, technology, consulting, and operations services to businesses and organizations with a strong presence in industries such as healthcare, financial services, and manufacturing. Its return on invested capital of 16.56% over the trailing 12 months exceeds its weighted average cost of capital of 9.37% over the same period(1). The same is true of its return on equity which is better than 85% of its industry peers. We can take it a step further and consider the company’s current P/E ratio of 14.42. It’s well below the firm’s 10-year median P/E ratio of 22.04. Golar LNG (GLNG) Aerial drone photo of LNG (Liquified Natural Gas) tanker anchored in small LNG industrial islet of Revithoussa equipped with tanks for storage, Salamina, Greece.Source: Aerial-motion / Shutterstock.comGolar LNG (NYSE:GLNG) operates a fleet of LNG carriers and floating storage regasification units, which are used to transport and regasify LNG for delivery to customers around the world.Golar LNG is headquartered in Bermuda and has operations in various countries including the United Kingdom, Singapore, Brazil, and Norway. That geographically disparate operational footprint allows the company to strategically supply its partners in a geopolitically tense world. The company’s business model is based on long-term, fixed-rate charters, which provide a steady stream of revenue and further serve to help to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in the LNG market.Wall Street currently rates GLNG stock as a unanimous buy with roughly 50% upside. In terms of traditional value metrics, Golar LNG benefits from a very low P/E ratio of 3.48, lower than 83% of the oil &amp; gas industry. GLNG stock is currently cheap and it’s also a reasonable hedge against volatility due to its business model. Goodyear Tire (GT)Sign for Goodyear (GT) tire shop. The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company is an American tire manufacturing company.Source: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.comMy colleague Joel Baglole recently commented on Goodyear Tire’s (NASDAQ:GT) horrific performance over the last five years, pointing out the fact that it has lost 70% of its value in the period. He noted that Goodyear, despite being a household name in the U.S., has struggled with competition and a particularly tough 2022 in which prices fell off a cliff on high commodity prices and a strong dollar that weakened the impact of foreign sales when remunerated to its U.S. headquarters as dollars. Perhaps most importantly, though, is the notion that Goodyear is letting it be known that it is lessening its reliance on rubber. The company unveiled a tire made with 90% sustainable materials at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES). If the company can get media outlets on board with the idea that it is turning a page and becoming greener, investor capital could logically get behind the company again. At such low prices, it’s easy to see why GT stock is currently one to consider. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) The Regeneron (REGN) website is displayed on a smartphone screen over a blue background.Source: madamF / Shutterstock.comRegeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) stock price is highly dependent on the sales level of its current portfolio of drugs. Let’s start with those sales first. A few weeks ago, REGN stock dropped precipitously on the news that sales of its eye disorder treatment, Eylea, could fall short of levels anticipated on Wall Street. Data suggested that patients were switching to a competitor product as cost dynamics temporarily shifted out of favor for Eylea. The result was that preliminary Q4 sales were pegged at $1.5 billion, well below the $1.64 billion anticipated. However, analysts then suggested that dynamics were shifting back in favor of Eylea, and REGN clawed back the losses. Investors should note that Regeneron is among the more profitable firms in the highly profitable pharmaceutical industry. Its ROIC of 33.93% over the last 12 months is 10X greater than its 3.36% WACC. Diamondback Energy (FANG) In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump.

The company has a market capitalization of approximately $24 billion. FANG stock is undervalued based on the simple idea that it currently trades for less than its target stock price.

(NYSE:CCI) insiders sold US$3.7m worth of stock, possibly signalling a downtrend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crown-castle-inc-nyse-cci-120028477.html,1675684828,STORY,['CCI'],"[Over the past year, many Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Crown Castle The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Crown CastleIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP &amp; COO of Fiber, Christopher Levendos, sold US$2.1m worth of shares at a price of US$193 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$146. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 5.91k shares for US$843k. But they sold 19.50k shares for US$3.7m. All up, insiders sold more shares in Crown Castle than they bought, over the last year. The average sell price was around US$190. It is certainly not great to see that insiders have sold shares in the company. However, we do note that the average sale price was significantly higher than the current share price (which is US$146). You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeI will like Crown Castle better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Story continuesInsider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Crown Castle insiders own about US$301m worth of shares (which is 0.5% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Crown Castle Tell Us?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Crown Castle insiders selling. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Crown Castle (of which 1 shouldn't be ignored!) you should know about.Of course Crown Castle may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

97,936ffb44-dbba-3fe3-ac3e-e6738d97099c,MRK,2023-02-06,12 Safe Stocks to Buy For Long-Term,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-safe-stocks-buy-long-134607791.html,1675604767,STORY,"['ABBV', 'LLY', 'PG', 'PFE', 'JNJ', 'PEP', 'MRK', 'ORCL', 'CSCO']","[In this article, we take a look at 12 safe stocks to buy for the long-term according to hedge funds. You can skip our detailed analysis of safe stocks and go directly to read 5 Safe Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.Even if there are many indications that the macro environment will remain challenging in 2023, this is not the time to stay on the sidelines. In reality, it's still a good opportunity to establish positions in safe companies to purchase for the long term while fear, uncertainty, and doubt continue to roil the markets.Although buying risk-free stocks sounds like a great idea, there isn't a stock that is really secure. Even the most stable organizations frequently endure considerable stock price fluctuation, and even the finest companies might encounter unforeseen difficulties. This was evident in the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic when the stock prices of numerous powerful firms fell sharply. One way to deal with individual stock risk is diversification.Over the last 12 months, U.S. stocks declined slightly more than 10%. We had a great start to 2023, but the markets seem to be overly optimistic. Long-term interest rates are around 3.5% and consensus estimates for S&amp;P 500 Index hover around $230. This means the market has a forward PE ratio of 18 assuming that the optimistic consensus earnings estimates are accurate.Long-term investors, however, don't pay attention to the volatile, short-term rise and fall of stock markets.

DE, Rockwell Automation, Inc. ROK, Cboe Global Markets, Inc. CBOE and Alaska Air Group, Inc. ALK.4 Stocks with Sales Growth for Guaranteed Returns in 2023After a highly disappointing 2022, this year has started on a solid note. All three major indexes – the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite – ended the first month of 2023 in green. But to think the macroeconomic concerns have faded is wrong. While the recent economic data point to the effectiveness of the Federal Reserve’s ultra-aggressive monetary tightening, we are still not out of the woods. The central bank is expected to keep interest rates high till inflation comes down reasonably.This has made investors wary about entering the stock market, as higher rates will likely lead to a recession/economic slowdown in 2023. Hence, a conventional stock-picking strategy is the need of the hour. One such way is selecting stocks with steady sales growth. In this regard, stocks like Deere &amp; Co., Rockwell Automation, Inc., Cboe Global Markets, Inc. and Alaska Air Group, Inc. are worth considering.While evaluating any company, revenues are often more scrutinized than earnings. This is because investors want to make sure that a business has the capability of generating more sales over time to cater to an expanding customer base. Steady or declining sales growth reflects obstacles at the company. Stagnant companies may generate profit in the near term but do not ensure enough growth to attract new investors.Without robust revenue growth, bottom-line improvement may not be sustainable. While a company can show earnings strength by lowering costs, continued bottom-line expansion usually requires strong sales growth.Yet, sales growth alone doesn’t show much about a company’s prospects. Hence, taking into account a company’s cash position along with its sales number can be a practical investment strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments.Story continuesHere are five of the 16 stocks that qualified the screening:Illinois-based Deere is the world’s largest producer of agricultural equipment, manufacturing agricultural machinery under the iconic John Deere brand name.

Hence, we have added other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.P/S Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (four weeks) greater than X-Industry: Estimate revisions, better than the industry, are often seen to trigger an increase in stock price.Operating Margin (average last five years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs — an optimal situation.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means that the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform, irrespective of the market environment.

These enterprises undergird some of the most groundbreaking innovations of our time, facilitating potentially permanent relevance.Fundamentally, technology stocks to buy benefit from the natural forward progress of human societies. After all, whether a recession materializes or not, enterprises will continue striving for bigger and better. In some ways, then, specific tech plays may be safer than you might initially believe.On the technical front, several breakthrough technology stocks to buy incurred steep losses last year. While red ink presents near-term challenges, over the long haul, acquiring deflated tech plays now could yield tremendous gains later. If you’re willing to ride out some turbulence, below are some of the best innovative companies available.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsASMLASML$690.85NVDANvidia$214.86MSFTMicrosoft$261.92ISRGIntuitive Surgical$259.72INTUIntuit$449.28ROKRockwell Automation$290.54SMRNuScale Power$10.88ASML (ASML)Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboardSource: Ralf Liebhold / ShutterstockThe backstop of most semiconductor-related breakthrough technology stocks to buy, ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) might not be a household name. However, it plays an invaluable role in the broader innovation sphere. Specifically, the company specializes in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, building machines that print designs on silicon wafers. ASML enjoys a monopoly in this regard, making it irreplaceable.To be fair, prospective investors at this moment won’t get a brilliant deal on ASML shares. Per Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV), the business rates as fairly valued. That said, the company enjoys a stable balance sheet and strong operational attributes.Story continuesFor instance, its three-year revenue growth rate of 23.8% beats out nearly 80% of its peers. On the bottom line, ASML features a net margin of 25.91%. This stat ranks above 87% of industry players. Perhaps best of all, Wall Street analysts assess ASML as a consensus and unanimous strong buy. With sentiment among hedge funds pinging as very positive, ASML easily represents one of the technology stocks to buy.Nvidia (NVDA)Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green treesSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comAlthough perhaps best known for its video gaming and blockchain-centric graphics processing units, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) flexes its muscles across several relevant sectors. One of them centers on autonomous driving. Through its research and development in advanced sensors and artificial intelligence and machine learning protocols, Nvidia is slowly making autonomous mobility a reality.According to Strategic Market Research, the global autonomous vehicle market carried a valuation of $25.14 billion in 2021. By 2030, experts there predict that this segment will hit $196.97 billion, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25.7%. Per Gurufocus.com’s proprietary FMV calculation, it estimates NVDA as a modestly undervalued investment. Objectively, the company’s Altman Z-Score of 17.09 indicates tremendous resilience in the balance sheet. As well, Nvidia benefits from excellent revenue and profitability metrics.Currently, Wall Street analysts rate NVDA as a consensus strong buy. Even better, hedge fund sentiment ranks as very positive, making it one of the top breakthrough technology stocks to buy.Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comA steady hand in the innovation sphere, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks among the breakthrough technology stocks to buy under almost any context. However, the software (and hardware) giant has been flexing its muscles recently. Specifically, Microsoft generated headlines for its deep investments into OpenAI, the company responsible for the chatbot platform ChatGPT.Fears sparked about ChatGPT disrupting search engine-related enterprises, along with anything involving online tutoring services. I’m not mentioning names here but you can follow the aforementioned link for more information. Anyways, it’s possible that Microsoft can finally become relevant in the broader internet search ecosystem, which makes its competitors leery.Another factor boosting MSFT centers on its overall value proposition. Featuring a strong balance sheet, consistent growth, and an extremely profitable enterprise, Microsoft makes for a compelling idea among technology stocks to buy. Presently, Wall Street analysts rate MSFT as a consensus strong buy. As well, sentiment among hedge funds pings as very positive.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)Tech stocks: Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing.Source: Peshkova / ShutterstockEasily one of the most innovative technology stocks to buy in the broader healthcare sector, Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) garnered worldwide fame for its da Vinci robotic surgical system. Offering myriad opportunities for superior patient outcomes, Intuitive facilitates greater accuracy in medical procedures. As well, its minimally invasive approach may yield fewer hospital stays, resulting in cost savings.According to Grand View Research, the global medical robotic systems market size reached a valuation of $16.1 billion in 2021. Experts project that the segment will expand at a double-digit CAGR to reach annual revenue of $76.4 billion. Given that ISRG stock slipped over 14% in the trailing year, the volatility might offer a long-term discounted opportunity.Per Gurufocus.com’s proprietary FMV calculations, ISRG rates as modestly undervalued. Objectively, the company offers a holistic value proposition. First, it features zero debt in its books, affording it incredible flexibility. Second, it enjoys outstanding operational stats, such as double-digit revenue growth and sector-busting profitability metrics.Not surprisingly, ISRG carries a consensus strong buy. And that’s because, for the long haul, you’re not going to find too many superior technology stocks to buy.Intuit (INTU)Stacks of coins hold up wooden blocks that spell out ""TAX."" FairTaxSource: ShutterstockOn the surface level, tax, and accounting software provider, Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) does not sound like one of the innovative technology stocks to buy. However, I’ve been pounding the table on INTU because of its implications for the gig economy.Essentially, people’s expectations for work changed due to the remote work pivot during the coronavirus pandemic. However, major enterprises started to recall their workers, putting an end to the work-from-home experiment. Of course, the worker bees at large won’t like that. Personally, I believe most will fall in line because the gig worker lifestyle is haphazard unless one is truly talented.Still, many will trade in their suits and ties for whatever work they can find. However, gig workers (better known as independent contractors) must file “business” taxes. Long story short, they’re much more complicated than taxes that employees file. Therefore, Intuit can help, making it quite relevant. Also, a big bonus is that Wall Street analysts rate INTU as a consensus strong buy. You already know my opinion. It’s easily one of the best technology stocks to buy.Rockwell Automation (ROK)Graphic of side view of virtual financial charts with tech aesthetic, symbolizing fintechSource: shutterstock.com/whiteMoccaFrom the unintuitive technology stocks to buy to the easily discernible, Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) deserves extra consideration. As its name suggests, Rockwell specializes in industrial automation solutions. While extraordinarily relevant, ROK suffered some pitfalls last year. However, so far this year, ROK gained over 8%.It’s quite possible that it can rise higher in the charts. According to Grand View Research, the global industrial automation and control systems market size reached a valuation of $172.26 billion. Experts there project that the segment will expand at a 10.5% CAGR to hit revenue of $377.25 billion by 2030. Naturally, Rockwell stands to be a major beneficiary, making it one of the technology stocks to buy.To be fair, it’s not the most discounted trade. However, investors should find encouragement from its decent balance sheet and growth metrics. As well, Rockwell features a net margin of 13.6%, ranking better than most of its peers. Finally, hedge fund sentiment for ROK rates as positive, suggesting you should keep it on your radar.NuScale Power (SMR)A hand in silhouette holds up a phone displaying the logo for Nuscale in front of a display showing the company's website.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comConcluding this list of technology stocks to buy stands one of my favorite subjects to discuss, NuScale Power (NYSE:SMR). A nuclear energy solutions provider, NuScale specializes in small modular reactors (SMRs). While not a brand-new innovation per se, NuScale effectively pioneered the platform’s commercial viability in the U.S. Given the energy crisis that we’re struggling with, SMR will likely rise higher over the next several years.Now, SMRs compel because they essentially represent a decentralized network of small-footprint nuclear facilities. This framework enables NuScale to build nuclear power facilities closer to sources of energy demand. Moreover, SMRs incorporate advanced safety protocols, providing operational assurances to nearby residents.As an aspirational firm, NuScale doesn’t enjoy robust financials. That said, the company has no debt on its books, a rarity for newly public enterprises.While analysts generally carried a leaning-optimistic view of SMR, per TipRanks, no Wall Street expert weighed in on shares in the past three months. However, that might be a good thing for those who prefer under-the-radar technology stocks to buy.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, February 22nd, 2022 . I will now turn the call over to Andrew Schaeffer, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets of MAA for opening comments. Please go ahead.Andrew Schaeffer: Thank you, Natty and good morning, everyone. This is Andrew Schaeffer, Treasurer and Director of Capital Markets for MAA. Members of the management team also participating on the call with me this morning are Eric Bolton, Tim Argo, Al Campbell, Rob DelPriore, Joe Fracchia, Tom Grimes, and Brad Hill. Before we begin with our prepared comments this morning, I want to point out that as part of this discussion, company management will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our projections. We encourage you to refer to the forward-looking statements section in yesterday's earnings release and our 34 Act filings with the SEC, which describe risk factors that may impact future results.During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, as well as reconciliations of the difference between non-GAAP and comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release and supplemental financial deck. Our earnings release and supplement are currently available on the For Investors page of our website atwww.maac.com. A copy of our prepared comments and an audio recording of this call will also be available on our website later today.

I will now turn the call over to Eric.Story continuesEric Bolton: Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. MAA wrapped up calendar year 2022 with fourth quarter results for core FFO that were ahead of expectations as higher fee income along with continued growth in average rent per unit and strong occupancy more than offset pressure from higher real estate taxes. Looking ahead to the coming year, there is clearly some uncertainty surrounding the outlook for the employment markets, the pace of inflation and the broader economy. In addition, while we do know that new supply deliveries in 2023 broadly will be higher than in 2022, we continue to believe that MAA is well positioned for the coming year as the leasing market returns to more normalized conditions. Our expectations for the coming year are built on a lease-over-lease pricing environment of 3%.This performance assumption, coupled with the earn-in from 2022's rent growth should drive growth in effective rent per unit of around 7% over the coming year. We will, of course, see conditions vary some by market and submarket location, but we believe that our portfolio is in a uniquely solid position to weather expected moderation from the historically high rate growth of last year. This view is really supported by three key variables: first, we continue to believe that our Sunbelt footprint maintains an advantageous position for capturing demand, given the stronger and more stable employment markets in the Sunbelt states. We continue to see job growth, positive migration trends, affordable rent-to-income ratios and low resident turnover.Secondly, MAA's unique diversification across the Sunbelt region, including both large and high-growth secondary markets, provides exposure to a good range of employment sectors and works to help soften some of the pressures surrounding new supply levels in a number of our larger markets. And thirdly, with a rent price point average for our portfolio that appeals to our broad segment of the rental market and it is around 20% below the price point of the mostly high-end new product being delivered, we believe we will capture more stability and top-line performance as leasing conditions normalize in 2023. In the event that we do find ourselves later in the year headed towards a more severe contraction in the economy or a recession, as MAA has consistently demonstrated over the past 20 years, we expect to perform with a lower level of volatility than what generally is seen with more concentrated portfolios and/or those costs traded in large coastal markets.The transaction market remains very quiet and we are likewise remaining patient with what opportunities we do see. I expect it will be the second half of the year before pricing data becomes more readily available. We do have plans to initiate development on four new projects in 2023 associated with sites that we already own or that are under our control. These projects will, of course, not actually start delivering units for another couple of years. In conclusion, I want to give a big thank you to our MAA associates for their tremendous service and record performance in2022. We have the company well positioned for the next cycle, as a number of new tech initiatives will positively impact performance over the coming years. Our external growth pipeline continues to expand and the balance sheet provides a good, strong foundation for supporting our current portfolio operations, as well as active pursuit of new growth opportunities.That's all I have in the way of prepared comments and I'll turn the call over to Tim.Tim Argo: Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. Same-store performance for the quarter was once again strong and ahead of our expectations. While pricing performance moderated during the fourth quarter from the record growth we had achieved September year-to-date, blended lease-over-lease pricing was up 5.7%. As a result, effective rent growth or the growth on all in-place leases for the fourth quarter was 14.9%, versus the prior year and 2.0% sequentially from the prior quarter. Full year 2022 blended lease-over-lease pricing was 13.9%, helping to drive full year effective rent growth of 14.6%. Alongside the strong pricing performance, average daily occupancy remained steady at 95.6% for the fourth quarter and 95.7% for the full year 2022.In line with normal seasonality, our January new lease rate of negative 0.3% improved from December's new lease rate of negative 0.9% and other than 2022 represents a higher new lease rate than any year since we have been tracking the data. Combined with renewal pricing of 8.6%, January blended lease-over-lease pricing was 4.2% and average daily occupancy was 95.7%. With new lease pricing moderating as expected, renewal pricing, which lagged new lease pricing for much of 2022 is providing a catalyst for the strong January pricing and is expected to be strong for the next few months before moderating to a more typical range. We are achieving growth rates on signed renewals of around 8% to 9% for the first quarter. We do expect new supply in several of our markets remain elevated in 2023, putting some pressure on rent growth, but the various demand indicators remain strong and we expect our portfolio to continue to benefit from population household and job growth.Apartments, Accommodation, VacationPhoto by Sigmund on UnsplashAs Eric mentioned, should we see a more dramatic downturn in the economy from here, we expect our market's diversification and price point will help mitigate some of the impact to performance. During the quarter, we continued our various product upgrade initiatives. This includes our interior unit redevelopment program, our installation of smart home technology and our broader amenity-based property repositioning program. For the full year 2022, we completed more than 6,500 interior unit upgrades and installed over 24,000 smart home packages. As of December 31, 2022, the total number of smart units is over 71,000, and we expect to finish out the remainder of the portfolio in 2023. For our repositioning program, leases have been fully or partially repriced at the first 11 properties in the program and the results have exceeded our expectations with yields on costs averaging approximately 17%.We have another four projects that will begin repricing this quarter and five additional projects currently under construction.Those are all of my prepared comments. I'll now turn the call over to Brad.Brad Hill: Thank you, Tim, and good morning. Despite execution challenges in the transaction market, our team successfully completed our disposition plan for 2022 by closing our last two dispositions in the fourth quarter. Our total disposition proceeds for the year were approximately $325 million, representing a stabilized NOI yield of 4.3% and an investment IRR of 17.7% for assets with an average age of 25 years old. In 2023, we will continue the discipline of steadily recycling capital out of older, higher CapEx properties with the intent to redeploy the capital into newer, lower CapEx, higher rent growth properties to drive higher long-term earnings growth within our portfolio. While transaction volume continues to be muted, we believe it's likely that the transaction market will provide more opportunities towards the back half of the year.Currently, the number of marketed properties is down substantially from 2022, with the majority of sellers waiting until at least the spring leasing season before reevaluating their planned sale timing. In the face of this lower volume, we have seen some upward pressure on cap rates with the degree of the movement varying based on property characteristics, embedded rent growth, as well as market and submarket location. However, until closed transactions materially increase transparency around cap rates will be difficult. When marketed deal volume does increase, we expect buyer financial strength and speed of execution to be attractive key differentiators and our balance sheet strength and capacity will support our ability to transact despite a more difficult credit environment.On our new developments, our team has done a tremendous job working through the challenges of elevated construction costs and permitting delays, leading to steady growth in our development pipeline. During 2022,we started construction on 1,253 units at a cost of $468 million, a record level of starts for MAA. During the fourth quarter, we started construction on two projects that have been in predevelopment for some time. These two projects will begin delivering units in two years and should finish construction in three years, lining up well with what we believe is likely to be a strong leasing environment. While the timing of planned construction starts can change as we work through the local approval and construction bidding processes, we expect to start four new developments during the back half of 2023.This includes two in-house developments, one located in Orlando and one in Denver and two pre-purchased joint venture developments, one located in Charlotte and the other a Phase 2 to our West Midtown development in Atlanta. Our construction management team continues to do a tremendous job actively managing our projects and working with our contractors to keep the inflationary and supply chain pressures from causing a meaningful increase to our overall development costs or our schedules. Despite these headwinds, the team delivered three projects on time in 2022 and under budget by approximately $4.5 million. During the fourth quarter, construction wrapped up on MAA Windmill Hill, and we reached stabilization at MAA Robinson, MAA West Glenn and MAA Park Point with operating results well ahead of our pro forma expectations delivering stabilized NOI yields on average of 6.6%.Leasing demand at our new properties remains high and the competition from other new supply has, to-date, not had a significant impact on our lease-up performance with rents being achieved well ahead of pro formas. That's all I have in the way of prepared comments. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Al.Albert Campbell: Okay. Thank you, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Reported core FFO per share of $2.32 for the quarter was $0.05 above the midpoint of our guidance and contributed to core FFO for the full year of $8.50 per share, representing a 21% increase over the prior year. Same-store rental pricing and occupancy levels were in line with expectations for the quarter, while higher fee and reimbursement revenues, combined with strong lease-up and commercial revenues, to produce about two-thirds of this earnings outperformance for the quarter. This favorability was partially offset by real estate tax expenses, as final millage rates came in higher than expected during the quarter for several markets, primarily in Texas. Our real estate tax estimates were based on strong valuations supported by the very strong revenue trends over the last year, offset by expected millage rate rollbacks as counties managed overall tax needs and rollbacks occurred but were less than expected in Texas, particularly in Dallas and Austin.Our internal guidance for  our initial guidance, excuse me, for '23, which we'll discuss more in a moment anticipate some continued pressure in this area given its backward-looking nature. Our balance sheet remains very strong, as we ended the year with historically low leverage debt-to-EBITDA RE of3.71 times with 95.5% of our debt fixed at an average interest rate of 3.4% and with $1.3 billion available capacity to support growth and manage our debt maturities late in 2023. Also at the end of January, we settled our outstanding forward equity contracts, providing an additional $204 million of capacity at an attractive cost of capital. We currently expect to fund our near-term acquisition, development and refinancing needs with short-term debt capacity allowing the financing markets to continue to stabilize before locking in long-term financing.Finally, we did provide initial earnings guidance for 2023 with our release, which is detailed in the supplemental information package. Core FFO for the year is projected to be $8.88 to $9.28 per share or $9.08 at the midpoint, which represents a 6.8% increase over the prior year. The foundation for the projected 2023 performance is same-store revenue growth produced by historically higher rental pricing earn-in of about 5.5% combined with the more normalized blended rental pricing performance of 3% for the year, as well as a continued strong occupancy remaining between 95.6% and 96%for the year. Based on this, effective rent growth for the year is projected to be a solid 7% at the midpoint of our range, with total same-store revenues expected to grow 6.25%, slightly diluted from the other revenue items, primarily reimbursement in fee income, which grew at a more modest pace.Same-store operating expenses are projected to grow at 6.15% at the midpoint for the year with real estate taxes and insurance producing the most significant growth pressure. Combined these two items alone are expected to grow just over 7% for 2023 with the remaining controllable operating items expected to grow around 5.5%. These expense pressures are offset by the continued strong revenue growth with NOI for the year projected to grow 6.3% at the midpoint. We're also expecting continued external growth, both through the acquisitions and development opportunities during the year with a combined $700 million full year planned investment. This growth will be partially funded by asset sales, providing around $300 million of expected proceeds.We expect to fund the remaining capital needs for the year from internal cash flow and short-term variable rate borrowings, as we anticipate the financing markets to continue stabilizing over the next year, eventually providing better opportunities to lock in long-term debt rates. This does produce some slight pressure on current year FFO performance given high short-term rates, but is expected to be rewarded with lower long-term financing costs when markets stabilize further. So that's all that we have in the way of prepared comments. So Nikki, we'll now turn the call back to you for any questions. See also 12 Top Performing Dividend Stocks in January and 25 Smartest Companies To Invest In .To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"
105,a3c85743-ced9-3ecb-8a64-cb69bb771744,CI,2023-02-06,Cigna (NYSE:CI) Will Pay A Larger Dividend Than Last Year At $1.23,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cigna-nyse-ci-pay-larger-101201211.html,1675678321,STORY,['CI'],"[Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI) will increase its dividend on the 23rd of March to $1.23, which is 9.8% higher than last year's payment from the same period of $1.12. The payment will take the dividend yield to 1.5%, which is in line with the average for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for Cigna Cigna's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsSolid dividend yields are great, but they only really help us if the payment is sustainable. However, prior to this announcement, Cigna's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 16.6% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 30%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendCigna Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $0.04, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $4.48. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 60% a year over that time. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Cigna has impressed us by growing EPS at 18% per year over the past five years. Growth in EPS bodes well for the dividend, as does the low payout ratio that the company is currently reporting.We Really Like Cigna's DividendIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

You can skip our detailed analysis of safe stocks and go directly to read 5 Safe Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.Even if there are many indications that the macro environment will remain challenging in 2023, this is not the time to stay on the sidelines. In reality, it's still a good opportunity to establish positions in safe companies to purchase for the long term while fear, uncertainty, and doubt continue to roil the markets.Although buying risk-free stocks sounds like a great idea, there isn't a stock that is really secure. Even the most stable organizations frequently endure considerable stock price fluctuation, and even the finest companies might encounter unforeseen difficulties. This was evident in the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic when the stock prices of numerous powerful firms fell sharply. One way to deal with individual stock risk is diversification.Over the last 12 months, U.S. stocks declined slightly more than 10%. We had a great start to 2023, but the markets seem to be overly optimistic. Long-term interest rates are around 3.5% and consensus estimates for S&amp;P 500 Index hover around $230. This means the market has a forward PE ratio of 18 assuming that the optimistic consensus earnings estimates are accurate.Long-term investors, however, don't pay attention to the volatile, short-term rise and fall of stock markets. Instead, they invest in shares of dependable businesses with consistent performance over years or even decades. The best long-term investments are equities of expanding companies that offer consistent profits. You must comprehend the measurements that provide reliable proof of trustworthy long-term success to locate them.12 Safe Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundsFactors include routinely outperforming the S&amp;P 500 and avoiding the significant short-term drops (and gains) that high-flying firms typically go through. These companies often have solid, well-established operations, consistent revenues, and a reliable supply of dividends for shareholders. As the pandemic last year showed, safe equities may provide investors with a route out of a financial catastrophe during a recession. Some of the notable names in the list of safe stocks include Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), among others.Story continuesOur MethodologyWe identified the top 50 holdings of iShares MSCI USA Min Vol Factor ETF (USMV) and ranked them using Insider Monkey's proprietary hedge fund sentiment data.

Consider, that the longer a company invests in its brands through advertising and R&amp;D, the stronger and more resonant they may get.

114,6b176e84-8cba-30db-a1da-bd810db5b795,PYPL,2023-02-06,25 Most Viewed YouTube Videos of All Time,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/25-most-viewed-youtube-videos-163701788.html,1675615021,STORY,"['GOOGL', 'PYPL', 'SPOT']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 25 most viewed YouTube videos of all time. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 most viewed YouTube videos of all time.When Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) bought YouTube in 2006 for $1.65 billion, YouTube was already starting to gain in popularity. The investment has paid off many times over since, with YouTube earning $28.8 billion in advertising revenues in 2021 alone, an increase of 31% over the previous. YouTube is now a powerful platform which can be used by businesses to reach their target audience. Many companies are now using YouTube in an effort to drive engagement and build brand awareness, which in turn helps to drive sales.Currently, YouTube has more than 2.6 billion users worldwide, which means that more than 50% of the world's Internet using population use YouTube. 122 million people, more than the population of Ethiopia or the Philippines, use YouTube every single day. This provides an amazing platform for businesses to reach a wider audience. The largest video-sharing platform in the world, YouTube offers businesses cost-effective marketing especially when compared to traditional advertising methods. Businesses can target their demographic by age, gender, location and interests, which allows the right people to see such advertisements, and the advanced analytical tools offered by YouTube allow businesses to even determine the level of success of such campaigns being conducted.25 most viewed YouTube vidoes of all timeOf course, it's not a given that any business strategy on YouTube will work; just like with any other major marketing campaign, the strategy needs to be well-thought-out and should have the requisite level of investment, both in terms of time and money. If a business is unaware of their target audience or is unable to create a strategy to target them properly, then the return on investment will be quite low. As evidenced by the most viewed YouTube videos of all time, videos on YouTube need to be catchy and should have characteristics that would allow it to go viral such as a catchy tune or jingle. Hence, businesses should first research their potential or actual audience while creating a content plan which aligns with the goals and objectives of the company. While one would assume that it's a given that the videos should be of a high quality, with investments in high-quality video production equipment being necessary, many companies try to cut costs here, even though returns on such investment would be quite high.Story continuesOne of the best methods nowadays, fortunately or unfortunately, is to partner with influences and YouTube personalities. For example. MrBeast, who is the most followed person on YouTube with over 130 million subscribers, often has his videos sponsored by different brands including Paypal Honey, which is the subsidiary of PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL). Papyal Honey has sponsored many videos of MrBeast, and his advertising of the product has resulted in Paypal Honey being exposed to hundreds of millions of people. However, businesses need to be careful when hiring influencers or internet personalities, since often times so-called influencers can charge large amounts or ask for goodies for free and fail to provide any traction for the business.In its Q4 2022 earnings announced in February 2023, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has reported that its YouTube advertising revenue fell by 4% in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to the same period the previous year after recording $7.96 billion in Q4 2022. This decline in revenue was a significant miss compared to analysts' expectations and has raised concerns about the company's ability to effectively monetize its platforms, including YouTube Shorts. On a more positive note, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has recently announced that the daily views on YouTube Shorts, its short-video platform, has crossed 50 billion views. YouTube Shorts was launched in 2020 as a TikTok competitor and has since grown rapidly in popularity, particularly in India where it has become one of the most popular short-video platforms. The platform is designed to provide users with a simple and fast way to create and share short videos, and it has been instrumental in Google's efforts to tap into the rapidly growing market for short-form video content. In the previous year, YouTube announced that 1.5 billion users watched Shorts every single month while in 2021, TikTok, one of YouTube's biggest competitors registered over 1 billion monthly users and Instagram, owned by Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has more than 2 billion monthly users. While Instagram's usage of Reels, direct competition to YouTube Shorts, isn't known, it's likely to be a substantial percentage. Which of the three comes out on top will be interesting to see.From a business perspective, this is a significant achievement for Alphabet Inc. as it highlights the growing importance of short-form video content in the digital landscape. The success of YouTube Shorts is a testament to the company's ability to innovate and adapt to changing consumer trends, and it provides Google with a valuable platform for reaching a large and engaged audience. This, in turn, presents numerous opportunities for the company to monetize the platform through advertising and other forms of revenue generation.There was a time when a YouTube vide reaching 100 million views seemed incredible. Later on, a video achieving one billion views was considered to be an incredible feat, with ""Gangnam Style"" becoming the first such video.

These enterprises undergird some of the most groundbreaking innovations of our time, facilitating potentially permanent relevance.Fundamentally, technology stocks to buy benefit from the natural forward progress of human societies. After all, whether a recession materializes or not, enterprises will continue striving for bigger and better. In some ways, then, specific tech plays may be safer than you might initially believe.On the technical front, several breakthrough technology stocks to buy incurred steep losses last year. While red ink presents near-term challenges, over the long haul, acquiring deflated tech plays now could yield tremendous gains later. If you’re willing to ride out some turbulence, below are some of the best innovative companies available.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsASMLASML$690.85NVDANvidia$214.86MSFTMicrosoft$261.92ISRGIntuitive Surgical$259.72INTUIntuit$449.28ROKRockwell Automation$290.54SMRNuScale Power$10.88ASML (ASML)Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboardSource: Ralf Liebhold / ShutterstockThe backstop of most semiconductor-related breakthrough technology stocks to buy, ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) might not be a household name. However, it plays an invaluable role in the broader innovation sphere. Specifically, the company specializes in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, building machines that print designs on silicon wafers. ASML enjoys a monopoly in this regard, making it irreplaceable.To be fair, prospective investors at this moment won’t get a brilliant deal on ASML shares. Per Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV), the business rates as fairly valued. That said, the company enjoys a stable balance sheet and strong operational attributes.Story continuesFor instance, its three-year revenue growth rate of 23.8% beats out nearly 80% of its peers. On the bottom line, ASML features a net margin of 25.91%. This stat ranks above 87% of industry players. Perhaps best of all, Wall Street analysts assess ASML as a consensus and unanimous strong buy. With sentiment among hedge funds pinging as very positive, ASML easily represents one of the technology stocks to buy.Nvidia (NVDA)Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green treesSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comAlthough perhaps best known for its video gaming and blockchain-centric graphics processing units, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) flexes its muscles across several relevant sectors. One of them centers on autonomous driving. Through its research and development in advanced sensors and artificial intelligence and machine learning protocols, Nvidia is slowly making autonomous mobility a reality.According to Strategic Market Research, the global autonomous vehicle market carried a valuation of $25.14 billion in 2021. By 2030, experts there predict that this segment will hit $196.97 billion, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25.7%. Per Gurufocus.com’s proprietary FMV calculation, it estimates NVDA as a modestly undervalued investment. Objectively, the company’s Altman Z-Score of 17.09 indicates tremendous resilience in the balance sheet. As well, Nvidia benefits from excellent revenue and profitability metrics.Currently, Wall Street analysts rate NVDA as a consensus strong buy. Even better, hedge fund sentiment ranks as very positive, making it one of the top breakthrough technology stocks to buy.Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comA steady hand in the innovation sphere, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks among the breakthrough technology stocks to buy under almost any context. However, the software (and hardware) giant has been flexing its muscles recently. Specifically, Microsoft generated headlines for its deep investments into OpenAI, the company responsible for the chatbot platform ChatGPT.Fears sparked about ChatGPT disrupting search engine-related enterprises, along with anything involving online tutoring services. I’m not mentioning names here but you can follow the aforementioned link for more information. Anyways, it’s possible that Microsoft can finally become relevant in the broader internet search ecosystem, which makes its competitors leery.Another factor boosting MSFT centers on its overall value proposition. Featuring a strong balance sheet, consistent growth, and an extremely profitable enterprise, Microsoft makes for a compelling idea among technology stocks to buy. Presently, Wall Street analysts rate MSFT as a consensus strong buy. As well, sentiment among hedge funds pings as very positive.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)Tech stocks: Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing.Source: Peshkova / ShutterstockEasily one of the most innovative technology stocks to buy in the broader healthcare sector, Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) garnered worldwide fame for its da Vinci robotic surgical system. Offering myriad opportunities for superior patient outcomes, Intuitive facilitates greater accuracy in medical procedures. As well, its minimally invasive approach may yield fewer hospital stays, resulting in cost savings.According to Grand View Research, the global medical robotic systems market size reached a valuation of $16.1 billion in 2021. Experts project that the segment will expand at a double-digit CAGR to reach annual revenue of $76.4 billion. Given that ISRG stock slipped over 14% in the trailing year, the volatility might offer a long-term discounted opportunity.Per Gurufocus.com’s proprietary FMV calculations, ISRG rates as modestly undervalued. Objectively, the company offers a holistic value proposition. First, it features zero debt in its books, affording it incredible flexibility. Second, it enjoys outstanding operational stats, such as double-digit revenue growth and sector-busting profitability metrics.Not surprisingly, ISRG carries a consensus strong buy. And that’s because, for the long haul, you’re not going to find too many superior technology stocks to buy.Intuit (INTU)Stacks of coins hold up wooden blocks that spell out ""TAX."" FairTaxSource: ShutterstockOn the surface level, tax, and accounting software provider, Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) does not sound like one of the innovative technology stocks to buy. However, I’ve been pounding the table on INTU because of its implications for the gig economy.Essentially, people’s expectations for work changed due to the remote work pivot during the coronavirus pandemic. However, major enterprises started to recall their workers, putting an end to the work-from-home experiment. Of course, the worker bees at large won’t like that. Personally, I believe most will fall in line because the gig worker lifestyle is haphazard unless one is truly talented.Still, many will trade in their suits and ties for whatever work they can find. However, gig workers (better known as independent contractors) must file “business” taxes. Long story short, they’re much more complicated than taxes that employees file. Therefore, Intuit can help, making it quite relevant. Also, a big bonus is that Wall Street analysts rate INTU as a consensus strong buy. You already know my opinion. It’s easily one of the best technology stocks to buy.Rockwell Automation (ROK)Graphic of side view of virtual financial charts with tech aesthetic, symbolizing fintechSource: shutterstock.com/whiteMoccaFrom the unintuitive technology stocks to buy to the easily discernible, Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) deserves extra consideration. As its name suggests, Rockwell specializes in industrial automation solutions. While extraordinarily relevant, ROK suffered some pitfalls last year. However, so far this year, ROK gained over 8%.It’s quite possible that it can rise higher in the charts. According to Grand View Research, the global industrial automation and control systems market size reached a valuation of $172.26 billion. Experts there project that the segment will expand at a 10.5% CAGR to hit revenue of $377.25 billion by 2030. Naturally, Rockwell stands to be a major beneficiary, making it one of the technology stocks to buy.To be fair, it’s not the most discounted trade. However, investors should find encouragement from its decent balance sheet and growth metrics. As well, Rockwell features a net margin of 13.6%, ranking better than most of its peers. Finally, hedge fund sentiment for ROK rates as positive, suggesting you should keep it on your radar.NuScale Power (SMR)A hand in silhouette holds up a phone displaying the logo for Nuscale in front of a display showing the company's website.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comConcluding this list of technology stocks to buy stands one of my favorite subjects to discuss, NuScale Power (NYSE:SMR). A nuclear energy solutions provider, NuScale specializes in small modular reactors (SMRs). While not a brand-new innovation per se, NuScale effectively pioneered the platform’s commercial viability in the U.S. Given the energy crisis that we’re struggling with, SMR will likely rise higher over the next several years.Now, SMRs compel because they essentially represent a decentralized network of small-footprint nuclear facilities. This framework enables NuScale to build nuclear power facilities closer to sources of energy demand. Moreover, SMRs incorporate advanced safety protocols, providing operational assurances to nearby residents.As an aspirational firm, NuScale doesn’t enjoy robust financials. That said, the company has no debt on its books, a rarity for newly public enterprises.While analysts generally carried a leaning-optimistic view of SMR, per TipRanks, no Wall Street expert weighed in on shares in the past three months. However, that might be a good thing for those who prefer under-the-radar technology stocks to buy.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can go to Jim Cramer's 5 Favorite Energy and Bank Stock Picks.Jim Cramer is an American television personality, former hedge fund manager, and best-selling author. He is the host of CNBC's Mad Money and co-founder of TheStreet.com. Cramer is known for his energetic and often bombastic on-air style and outspoken views on the stock market and investing.""We're in a Bull Market""After a series of aggressive rate hikes in 2022, on February 1, the Federal Reserve issued another rate hike at its first meeting of 2023. However, this time the Fed raised interest rates by 25 basis points, bringing its federal funds rate target range to between 4.5% and 4.75%. On February 2, Jim Cramer talked about the Fed's latest rate hike and why he thinks that ""everything Powell said in his press conference was positive"". Cramer said ""it's crazy that stocks ever sold off in the first place"" because the Fed is now moving towards getting ""disinflation going, not slowing of inflation, but disinflation"". According to Jim Cramer, ""we're in a bull market"".""It (the bull market) started last fall when long-term interest rates peaked, along with the dollar peaking. Now many stocks have clearly bottomed, even tech.""According to Cramer, ""the Fed is just trying to strike a balance between inflation and price stability"".Jim Cramer noted that selling stocks before the peak in long-term interest rates and the dollar was the right thing to do. However, now that ""the Fed says the rate hikes are working and we're pretty far along the tightening cycle"", selling stocks may not be the right thing to do. According to Cramer, this ""mistaken selling creates the opportunity for you (investors) to buy the dips"".Jim Cramer thinks that there are ""some legitimate, sizable bull markets going on"" and one of them is the banks.This piece will explore some of the favorite energy and bank stock picks of Mad Money host, Jim Cramer.

This payment means the dividend yield will be 1.0%, which is below the average for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for Amphenol Amphenol's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageThe dividend yield is a little bit low, but sustainability of the payments is also an important part of evaluating an income stock. However, Amphenol's earnings easily cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 13.5% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 26%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendAmphenol Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.105 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $0.84. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 23% over that duration. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Amphenol has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 25% per annum. Earnings have been growing rapidly, and with a low payout ratio we think that the company could turn out to be a great dividend stock.We Really Like Amphenol's DividendIn summary, it is good to see that the dividend is staying consistent, and we don't think there is any reason to suspect this might change over the medium term. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance.

Granted, this venerable list doesn’t bring much excitement. However, these stalwarts command well-established businesses, meaning they likely won’t steer you wrong.Before we begin, though, we need to establish some ground rules. First, none of the most undervalued Dow stocks to buy would qualify as extremely so. Again, we’re talking about established businesses so you’ve got to extend me some rope.Second, I ranked the names from most to least undervalued based on trailing 12-month (TTM) earnings. Specifically, the rankings align with the discount to earnings based on each company’s underlying industry. And for that, I’m indebted to Gurufocus.com’s all-in-one screener. So, with that out of the way, below are the most undervalued Dow stocks to buy in Feb. 2023.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsVZVerizon$41.54DOWDow Inc.$59.94GSGoldman Sachs$369.86MRKMerck$102.92INTCIntel$30.10AMGNAmgen$243.03CSCOCisco$49.26Verizon (VZ)Verizon store sign. VZ stock.Source: ShutterstockEasily topping the list if you will of the most undervalued Dow stocks to buy, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) finally gave its embattled shareholders something to cheer about. In the trailing year, VZ stock gave up over 22% of its equity value. However, it’s trying to make a comeback effort this year, gaining nearly 4%.Currently, the market prices VZ at 8.24 times trailing earnings. In contrast, the sector median value is 15.85 times. In terms of discount against earnings, Verizon ranks better than 79.42% of the competition. Notably, VZ also trades at a forward multiple of 8.87. This compares very favorably to the sector median of 15.47.Another factor tipping its hat toward Verizon centers on analysts’ assessment. Right now, VZ carries a consensus moderate buy rating. Wall Street experts anticipate shares will hit $46.50, implying an upside potential of 11.54%. Therefore, it’s a very reasonable idea among the most undervalued Dow stocks to buy.Story continuesDow Inc. (DOW)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comA multinational chemicals corporation, Dow Inc. (NYSE:DOW) manufactures plastics, chemicals, and agricultural products. Because of the various macroeconomic pressures and disruptions, DOW struggled throughout 2022. In the trailing year, shares tumbled about 2%. However, DOW is on a comeback trail, gaining 18% of equity value so far this year.Presently, Gurufocus.com rates DOW as modestly undervalued based on its proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV). Objectively, the market prices DOW at a trailing multiple of 9.65. In contrast, the sector median stands at 16.45. In terms of discount to earnings, Dow ranks better than 72.51% of its peers.In addition, DOW trades hands at 0.76 times (trailing) sales. This compares to the industry median value of 1.31 times. Looking at its balance sheet and operational profile, Dow arguably facilitates a solid opportunity. Right now, Wall Street analysts rate DOW as a consensus hold. However, hedge fund sentiment for shares pings as very positive. Therefore, it’s a decent idea for the most undervalued Dow stocks to buy.Goldman Sachs (GS)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockA world-renowned financial institution, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) has regional headquarters throughout the globe. Given the ongoing debate about the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, Goldman didn’t get off to an auspicious start last year. Though higher rates promote higher profitability on paper for financial firms, rising borrowing costs also hurt consumer demand.However, this year, GS looks stronger, gaining almost 6% of equity value. At present, the market prices GS at a trailing multiple of 12.17. For comparison, the sector median stands at 16.39 times. Regarding the discount to earnings, Goldman ranks better than 64.29% of its industry.In addition, GS trades at 10.16 times forward earnings, below the sector median value of 13.76 times. While it could use some work on its balance sheet, Goldman features solid revenue growth and above-average profitability.Moreover, Wall Street analysts rate GS as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target calls for shares to rise to $403.15. This implies an upside potential of over 10%, making GS one of the most undervalued Dow stocks to buy.Merck (MRK)medicine research, pharmaceutical background, LJPC stockSource: Sisacorn / Shutterstock.comA pharmaceutical giant, Merck (NYSE:MRK) develops and produces medicines, vaccines, biologic therapies, and animal health products. Given its extraordinary relevancies, Merck represented one of the best-performing securities of 2022. As evidence, in the trailing year, shares gained over 30% of equity value. Because of its massive performance, this year, MRK operated at a disadvantage, shedding nearly 4%.Be that as it may, MRK still represents one of the most undervalued Dow stocks to buy. Currently, the market prices MRK at a trailing multiple of 17.8. In contrast, the sector median stands at 20.87. In terms of discount to earnings, Merck ranks better than 59.47% of its peers.Overall, Merck presents an enticing fiscal profile. On its balance sheet, the company carries an Altman Z-Score of 4.58, indicating low bankruptcy risk. Operationally, it features double-digit book growth in the past three years. And it also enjoys a blockbuster net margin of 25.88%. Regarding Wall Street analysts’ assessment, MRK enjoys a consensus strong buy view. Also, their average price target implies an upside potential of over 13%. This makes MRK one of the undervalued Dow stocks to buy.Intel (INTC)BZFD stock. blue graphic of person's face made of binary code and microchip lines.Source: shutterstock.com/PeshkovaRecognized globally as a technology powerhouse, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) commands serious industry cachet. However, in recent years, the company stumbled due to competitive pressures as well as some unforced internal errors. Fortunately, management seeks to put the troubled past behind it. Enticingly, Intel offers attractive propositions, such as the world’s fastest mobile processor.Currently, INTC trades at a trailing multiple of 14.83. In contrast, the sector median stands at 17.44 times. Regarding discount to earnings, Intel ranks better than 56.66% of the semiconductor industry. Another notable attribute is the company’s price relative to book value. Right now, INTC trades at 1.19 times its book value. As a comparative discount, Intel ranks better than 78.32% of the competition.In fairness, Wall Street analysts rate Intel as a consensus hold. As well, their average price target actually implies a downside to the tune of nearly 6%. However, INTC gained almost 9% in the year so far. For contrarians, it could still represent one of the most undervalued Dow stocks to buy.Amgen (AMGN)Biochemical/biotech research scientist team working with microscopeSource: Mongkolchon Akesin / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Thousand Oaks, California, Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) is one of the world’s largest independent biotech firms. Similar to Merck, Amgen enjoyed a positive performance in 2022. In the trailing year, AMGN gained nearly 8% of equity value. However, in the new year, it’s on a decidedly negative trend, shedding almost 6%.Still, for those looking for a discount, Amgen technically represents one of the most undervalued Dow stocks to buy. Currently, the market prices AMGN at a trailing multiple of 20.35. For comparison, the sector median value is 20.87 (not much difference). Relative to discount to earnings, Amgen ranks better than 52.72% of its rivals.Objectively speaking, Amgen could use some work on its balance sheet. For instance, its Altman Z-Score slipped into the distressed zone. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 8.3%, which is alright compared to the industry. Primarily, Amgen rates strongly in the bottom line. For instance, its net margin pings at nearly 26%. To be fair, Wall Street analysts rate AMGN as a consensus hold. Still, the underlying price target implies an upside of nearly 6% from here on out.Cisco Systems (CSCO)the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wallSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.comFinally, communications technology conglomerate Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) rounds out this list of the most undervalued Dow stocks to buy. On paper, it appears to be just that. In the trailing year, CSCO shares gave up over 13% of equity value. In the year so far, Cisco only gained a bit over 1%. It’s hardly riveting stuff here, which might appeal to contrarians.However, on a fundamental basis, few would call Cisco a discount relative to its industry. Right now, the market prices CSCO at 17.53 times trailing earnings. For comparison, the sector median is 17.84 times. Regarding discount to earnings, Cisco ranks better than 50.45% of the competition. Again, it’s nothing to brag about. However, the other Dow stocks are actually overvalued.To end this list on a positive note, Wall Street analysts rate CSCO as a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, their average price target of $54.70 implies an upside potential of nearly 13%.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Don Allan.Don Allan: Thank you, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter performance marked another meaningful step forward on our journey to streamline and optimize Stanley Black &amp; Decker. Building on our number one worldwide market position in Tools &amp; Outdoor, as well as our leading Industrial business, we continue to focus on advancing our simplification and transformation strategy. Across the second half of 2022, we improved customer fill rates significantly, reduced inventories by $800 million and realized $200 million in efficiency benefits from our leaner organizational structure as well as enhanced cost control in the back office and the supply chain. These actions generated more than $500 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, which supported a corresponding similar amount of reduction in our debt, a key objective of our capital allocation plan in the second half of 2022.Story continuesOverall, we are making progress, and I am confident that our strategy and priorities are positioning the company for a strong, sustainable, long-term growth, cash flow generation, profitability enhancement and shareholder return. This transformation journey has just started, and significant efforts are still ahead of us. Our success will be dependent on staying agile while maintaining a disciplined approach, which ensures we stay focused on our key set of priorities. Our team has seen significant changes over the second half of 2022, and they will lead us through the next phase of the transformation in 2023. I would like to take a moment to thank all of our leaders and employees across the globe and recognize them for their focus, commitment and hard work, especially over the last 7 months to 8 months.Our 2022 full year revenue reached $16.9 billion, up 11% versus a record of 2021, led by the outdoor power equipment acquisitions as well as 9% organic growth in the Industrial segment, and a 7% improvement in price realization. However, these top line growth drivers were partially muted by significant retractions in consumer and DIY demand, as well as certain supply chain constraints we experienced in early 2022. Our margins were significantly impacted by inflation, and when we chose to prioritize inventory reductions by lowering manufacturing production levels in this last four to five months of 2022, this was to allow us to generate solid free cash flow as we experienced in the fourth quarter. These negative profitability impacts resulted in a full year adjusted diluted earnings per share being down year-over-year to $4.62.For the fourth quarter, revenues were in line with the prior year at $4 billion. Demand from our professional end markets remained healthy. With our differentiated offerings and improved product availability, we successfully executed our promotional plans in support of the holiday season for our retail partners. Adjusted EPS for the period was a loss of $0.10, a result of our planned prioritization efforts around inventory reduction and cash generation. Notably, we lowered inventory by $500 million as compared to the end of the third quarter. We entered 2023 prepared to navigate a challenging macroeconomic backdrop as interest rate hikes begin to yield their intended effects. That said, we are committed to advancing our transformation. While there is more work to be done, we have a clear road map forward.We are watching the demand environment and global economic dynamics very closely. Although, current demand remains consistent with levels experienced in the back half of last year, we are planning for all scenarios, which balance the potential continuation of the current trends with the prospect of a further demand slowdown due to intensifying macro pressures. While changes in demand are difficult to predict, our base case or midpoint of guidance assumes a decline in volume versus 2022 as we believe markets will continue to be challenged during 2023 as new housing starts are projected to decline 15% to 25% and repair and remodel activity will decline modestly year-over-year, we are also prepared to respond if revenue impacts are worse or better than our base case to ensure we appropriately manage the risks and opportunities that could arise.This guidance will have a P&amp;L loss in the front half, which is impacted by our strategic choice to continue to reduce our inventory levels. For the full year, we are guiding an adjusted EPS range of zero up to $2. Our free cash flow guidance is much stronger at $500 million up to $1 billion in 2023, well ahead of net income as we drive another $750 million up to $1 billion of inventory reduction during the year. As you have heard me say many times over the past year, we believe the long-term view for the industries, which our products serve is very positive with powerful generational shifts in the housing, more time at home due to hybrid work, an aging housing stock that needs repair and remodel, the continued improvement in aerospace demand and the acceleration of electrification within the automotive markets.We also have powerful secular drivers in Tools &amp; Outdoor from the shift to cordless power tools and electric powered outdoor equipment as we leverage our brands and innovation to gain market share. Our priorities in 2023 will continue to be aligned with our messaging over the last six months; one, strong focus on cash flow through inventory reduction to assist with ongoing debt deleveraging; two, sequential improvement in our gross margins as we drive further supply chain transformation initiatives; and three, get back to gaining market share in all major categories of our Tools &amp; Outdoor business. Our 2023 guidance base case is planning for an improved profitability performance in the back half of the year as we see more benefits from the transformation program.We believe our annualized EBITDA will achieve a run rate of close to $1.5 billion in the back half. That will be a major step forward in returning our company back to 2019 EBITDA levels, which were just above $2 billion. Given the significant benefits expected to be realized beyond 2023 from our supply chain transformation program, there appears to be a very reasonable glide path to exceed 2019 levels for EBITDA. Our teams around the world remain focused on executing our primary areas of long-term strategic focus, continuing to advance innovation, electrification, and global market penetration to achieve organic growth of two to three times the market growth, streamlining and simplifying the organization as well as shifting resources to prioritize investments that we believe have a positive and more direct impact for our customers and end users; accelerating the operations and supply chain transformation to return gross margins to historical 35% plus levels, while improving fill rates to better match inventory with customer demand; and then prioritizing cash flow generation and inventory optimization.We are making deliberate strategic investments in our businesses to position the company to fully capitalize on these long-term opportunities to gain share within the industries that we serve and to accelerate our organic growth. With that in mind, last year, we invested approximately $350 million in research and development, up over 25% versus 2021 and well ahead of our total sales growth. This increase in R&amp;D will ensure we continue to fund incremental investments beyond our core and breakthrough innovation, electrification across the portfolio, and market leadership, including digital and end user activation. This is an area where we have a long legacy of key investments to maintain our market-leading innovation ecosystem. We clearly took another step forward in 2022 and we will again in 2023.Our business transformation remains on track and we are building momentum towards delivering approximately $1 billion in annualized savings by the end of 2023. That will support both gross and operating margin expansion once our inventory destock is complete. Let's spend some time on the topic of innovation. We are continuing to release new products and bring advancements and innovation to our industries. Today, I will highlight a few exciting launches. As it relates to outdoor electrification, we are introducing new CRAFTSMAN and DEWALT outdoor offerings. For the 2023 season, CRAFTSMAN will carry a new range of lithium-ion electric ride-on mowers and an expansion of our 20-volt CRAFTSMAN Outdoor Essentials, notably new brushless string trimmers and blowers as well as a new cordless pressure washer.For the PRO, we are continuing to expand the DEWALT FLEXVOLT 20-volt MAX system, including the addition of a new pruning chainsaw that is lightweight and compact with an 8-inch bar and a high-efficiency brushless motor. Shifting to professional job site products and solutions, this is another key area for long-term growth. We recently debuted a range of revolutionary tools, accessories, and storage solutions for pros in the commercial concrete and construction industries as we continue to electrify the job site. We are expanding the FLEXVOLT product family with the launch of the world's first cordless in-line SCS MAX Chipping Hammer and Cordless Hexbreaker Hammer. We are also introducing the most powerful cordless DEWALT large angle grinder.All three of these new cordless tools include Perform and Protect safety features as well. Additionally, we have a new DEWALT ToughSystem Solution for storing, charging, and transporting DEWALT 20-volt and FLEXVOLT batteries. And lastly, our DEWALT product team partnered with CONVERGE, a leading concrete material and operations optimization company, to develop and unveil new concrete DNA compatible sensors. This new product allows DEWALT pros to begin work sooner as users can directly measure concrete hardening using advanced artificial intelligence rather than relying on estimations. In addition, this product helps reduce cement consumption by tailoring the exact amount needed. Together with CONVERGE, we are helping to tackle the challenge of reducing carbon emissions through our product innovation.As the worldwide leader in tools and outdoor, these are prime examples of the types of core and breakthrough innovations that we expect to continue to introduce to our customers and deliver for our end users. Now, diving a bit deeper into our business transformation. The team has made great progress. We realized $200 million of savings in the second half of 2022 from efficiency benefits, including our organizational changes, as well as indirect cost savings. We expect to deliver cumulative SG&amp;A savings of $500 million by the end of 2023, covering simplification of the corporate structure, streamlined leadership spans of controls and organizational layers and the reduction of indirect spend. Our new organizational structure is now in place, and the teams are activating our priorities.As you saw in our recent announcements, we have brought on two new business leaders who are critical for our transformation. Patrick Hallinan was named our incoming Chief Financial Officer. Patrick is a seasoned executive who has led global high-performing finance functions across top consumer brands. Patrick joins us in April from Fortune Brands Innovations, where he currently serves as their CFO, and is the ideal candidate for the next leader of our finance function. John Lucas joined us as our new CHRO and brings a highly distinguished track record with world-class experience in organizational and human capital management. John will be instrumental to enabling our culture and values and to the long-term success of our business. I want to thank Corbin Walburger and Deborah Wintner for their leadership and significant contributions during this critical transformation period for the company.I look forward to continuing to work with them as key Stanley Black &amp; Decker leaders. Turning to our supply chain transformation. We have line of sight to deliver cumulative savings of $500 million by the end of 2023 and $1.5 billion by 2025. Building off the momentum from last quarter, we activated our transformation with a sense of urgency to optimize our operations, which better serve our customers while also being efficient and agile with our footprint and cost structure. After approving and initiating action on our SKU reductions, we now have approximately 50,000 SKUs that we are no longer manufacturing and are approved for decommission. Throughout 2023, we will work to transition our customers to the products that deliver the most value for our end users.As we shared last quarter, the strategic sourcing team activated quick wins. We are pleased to share that, this early traction has already generated $40 million in savings. Wave one is now fully activated and addresses approximately $2 billion of spend, which is covered by 20 RFPs that are due back this quarter. We also successfully advanced our facility optimization and distribution network planning. The detailed feasibility analysis nearing completion this quarter, with execution of the plan to follow shortly thereafter. Lastly, we have heightened our focus on manufacturing excellence, reemphasizing SBD Kaizen and Lean manufacturing practices at our factories. Activation at four plants will be complete this quarter. And in March, we will initiate the next wave.We have exited the acute phase of pandemic-driven supply constraints. And as such, refocusing our plans on continuous improvement rigor will enable the acceleration of value across the network. You can expect us to continue to take strides forward, and we will provide you with updates towards achieving our cumulative $1 billion of savings by the end of 2023 on our path to delivering total program savings of $2 billion by 2025. I will now pass it to Corbin, who will take you through more detailed commentary on the fourth quarter and full year performance as well as our 2023 guidance. Corbin?Home tools, Machine, AppliancePhoto by Greyson Joralemon on UnsplashCorbin Walburger: Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Let me walk through the details of our business segment performance. Beginning with Tools &amp; Outdoor, fourth quarter revenues were in line with last year at $3.4 billion, benefiting from a 7% improvement from price actions and an eight-point contribution from the MTD and Excel outdoor acquisitions. Both of these acquisitions are now a part of organic growth beginning in December. These factors were offset by a 12% decline in volume and a negative 3% impact from currency. From a full year perspective, Tools &amp; Outdoor achieved record revenue of $14.4 billion, driven by a 7% improvement from price actions, and 21% growth contributed by our outdoor acquisitions, which was offset by softer consumer demand and currency.Looking at the regions, Latin America achieved 4% organic growth. Although Europe declined 3% organically, performance improved sequentially from the third quarter, and we believe the more significant impacts from UK channel destocking are now behind us. North America was down 7% as a result of lower consumer and DIY market demand, as well as the third quarter carrying heavier holiday promotional shipments compared to last year. US retail point of sale was supported by price increases and professional demand. Compared to a pre-COVID 2019 baseline, the fourth quarter POS growth was consistent with the growth levels experienced in the third quarter of 2022. Aggregate weeks of supply in these channels ended 1.5 weeks below 2019 levels. Adjusted operating margin for the segment was 1% in the quarter as the benefit from price realization was more than offset by commodity inflation, higher supply chain costs, planned production curtailments and lower volume.For the year, operating margin was 8.4%, down versus prior year. Turning to the strategic business units. For the full year, Power Tools declined 5% organically due to weakness in consumer and DIY and front half constraints related to electronic components. These volume impacts were partially offset by the benefits of our price increases and the continued performance of our strong DEWALT cordless innovation across our FLEXVOLT, ATOMIC and XTREME product families as well as our new and differentiated power stack battery packs. Hand tools declined 5% organically in the year. Consumer related headwinds were partially offset by price realization as well as new product innovation, notably the DEWALT Impact Connect, which consists of accessories that attach to an impact driver, allowing up faster cutting than standard hand tools.We also benefited from innovation in storage solutions such as mobile tool storage within the DEWALT Tough system and the CRAFTSMAN Premium S2000 metal storage platform. The Outdoor business declined 7% organically on a pro forma basis for 2022 due to the difficult outdoor season outlined earlier in the year. The fourth quarter marked the one-year anniversary of the MTD and Excel acquisitions, and we're pleased with the progress made to advance the outdoor platform integration. We now have a combined dealer channel sales team and launched one go-to-market approach to grow share. We've activated a brand portfolio strategy, leveraging DEWALT, Cub Cade,t and Hustler in the Pro and high-end resi market segment while targeting CRAFTSMAN, Troy-Bilt, WolfGarden, and Black &amp; Decker for the residential end user.I want to acknowledge and thank the entire team for their dedication to this process and ongoing commitment to delivering the best products for our customers. Now, shifting to Industrial, which had another strong quarter, recording 10% organic growth and double-digit adjusted operating margin. Segment revenue declined 1% versus last year as nine points of price realization and one point of volume were offset by five points from currency and six points from the oil and gas divestiture. The team leveraged the price increases and volume growth to overcome commodity inflation and higher supply chain costs to deliver adjusted operating margin of 11.5%, up sequentially 40 basis points and up 220 basis points versus last year. Looking within the segment, Engineered Fastening organic revenues were up 9% in the quarter, led by aerospace growth of 37% and auto growth of 14%, which were partially offset by industrial markets.Aerospace fasteners delivered its sixth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue improvement as the recovery in commercial OEM production continues. The auto fasteners' strong quarter, demonstrated by the business' ability to gain share in a dynamic environment and outpaced global light vehicle production in the quarter and for the full year. Attachment tools organic revenues were up 18%, driven by strategic pricing actions. While orders particularly from our dealer channel partners have been moderating, our backlog remains above 2019 levels. We continue to make progress with our inventory reduction in the fourth quarter, taking out nearly $500 million and resulting in a total second half inventory reduction of $775 million. Our production curtailment actions have been successful, helping to reduce DSI by approximately 20 days in the quarter and it was good to see the significant inventory reduction in the second half translate into free cash flow generation in the fourth quarter.As we look to the front half of 2023, we are targeting another $500 million reduction with the majority of this progress to be made in the second quarter. Although we typically see a seasonal inventory build as we prepare for the outdoor and spring selling season, we have the ability to work down our input materials and components as well as drive commercial actions to sell through finished goods. Our full year 2023 inventory reduction target is $750 million to $1 billion, which will drive significant cash flow generation that will be used to pay down debt and further strengthen our balance sheet. The timing of this reduction is demand-dependent. In a few moments, I'll cover how these assumptions impact the 2023 guidance range. Turning to gross margins.We expect the impact of planned production curtailments and higher cost inventory liquidations will continue to weigh on margins through the first half of 2023, resulting in margins in the low 20s. Production curtailments in the fourth quarter were down approximately 30% versus the long-term average and impacted gross margins by approximately six to seven points in the quarter. In our base case, we expect to improve from these levels but not fully eased production curtailments until the third quarter of 2023, which should support a gross margin recovery into the mid to high 20s in the back half. The normalized production and better gross margins could potentially shift earlier or later in the year depending on the overall demand environment and the speed of destocking.We have the teams focused on inventory reduction, cash generation, and balance sheet health as we work to drive gross margins to our historical 35% plus target level in 2025. I'll now walk through how the company is planning for three demand scenarios for our 2023 guidance as the macroeconomic outlook remains dynamic. Our base case scenario assumes a modestly unfavorable market demand environment, compared to what we experienced during the second half of last year. In this scenario, we are assuming total organic growth to be down low single digits with the first quarter being the toughest comp. Tools &amp; Outdoor total organic revenue, inclusive of positive price is expected to be down low single digits, while Industrial is planned for low single-digit growth.Specifically, for Tools &amp; Outdoor, this would imply a full year volume decline of approximately 5%, ahead of our forecast for the market. For the second half, volume is expected to be down 3% to 3.5%. In this base case, we would maintain our production curtailments with the goal of returning to normalized levels in the third quarter. As a result, the under absorption of fixed manufacturing costs would continue to constrain first half 2023 operating margins to low single digits. As production returns to normalized levels in the back half of the year, we expect operating margin rate to improve to the mid to high single-digit range. While our teams are aggressively focused on capturing deflation, this scenario does not include moderating commodity prices benefiting the P&amp;L until late 2023 after the destock, and can be a positive driver heading into 2024.As we monitor the demand environment, we will be measured in the timing and magnitude of our investments, reinvesting into our businesses at the point of impact as part of our transformation strategy, and our base case scenario includes approximately $125 million of annualized reinvestment targeted at commercial leadership, driving innovation and complexity reduction. Shifting to our second half acceleration scenario. This contemplates the possibility of a stronger demand environment supporting organic growth in the second half of 2023. Total organic growth would be relatively flat for the year. To support the improved second half demand, production levels would normalize towards the end of the second quarter. This scenario would position us to deliver high single-digit operating margins in the second half as well as an elevated level of reinvestment to accelerate our transformation.Lastly, we are preparing a downside case that reflects a deceleration of demand due to elevated recessionary pressures. In this case, we expect full year organic revenues to decline by mid-single digits with volume declines in both the tools and outdoor and industrial segments. If this were to occur, our production curtailments would likely continue through the end of 2023, extending the time line of our gross margin recovery. Under this scenario, we would opt to conservatively meter the level of reinvestment until we had more clarity on the extent and duration of the macro impacts and economic cycle. Overall, we feel it's prudent to consider this range of potential 2023 demand possibilities production and reinvestment levels as we continue to prioritize inventory reduction and cash generation.As such, we are guiding full year adjusted earnings per share in the range of zero to $2. On a GAAP basis, we expect the earnings per share range to be negative $1.65 to positive $0.85, inclusive of one-time charges from the global supply chain optimization and the remaining outdoor integration-related expenses. The current pre-tax estimate for one-time charges is approximately $225 million to $325 million with $50 million to $100 million in non-cash charges. Now some added quarterly context from our base case. For the first quarter, we're expecting similar levels of operating profit to what we delivered in the fourth quarter. However, we do not expect the discrete tax benefits to repeat, resulting in a first quarter adjusted loss of $0.75 per share at the midpoint.We believe profitability can improve sequentially into the second quarter, resulting in a stronger performance. In total, we expect our actions but will translate to positive first half free cash flow driven by $500 million of inventory reduction, most of which will come in the second quarter. As we get through the first half destock, we expect earnings to inflect positively in the second half of the year, generating an annualized EBITDA run rate of approximately $1.3 billion to $1.7 billion. We view this as a jumping off point to further improve with our transformation. Our guidance calls for $500 million to $1 billion of free cash flow in 2023, primarily from inventory reduction. We're focused on our key priorities; number one, generate strong cash flow through inventory reduction to assist with ongoing debt deleveraging; number two, sequential improvement in our gross margins as we drive further supply chain transformation initiatives; and number three, focus on gaining market share in all major categories.We're planning for the dynamic operating environment to continue and feel we have the strategy in place to successfully navigate our path forward as we remain focused on driving above market long-term organic growth. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Don.Don Allan: Thank you, Corbin. So in summary, we successfully advanced our cost reduction and business transformation strategy over the last quarter and made meaningful progress on a number of key objectives, including inventory reduction, cash generation, debt reduction and streamlining our organizational structure and supply chain. We have given you an indication today of what annualized EBITDA could be on the first step of this journey. We believe we can build from 2023's back half as our supply chain savings continue to accrue and contribute to the restoration of our gross margin to the 35% plus level. As we look ahead, we aim to get our levels of EBITDA back to 2019 levels and beyond as we continue to transform our business.While the macroeconomic environment is uncertain and 2023 will clearly bring us challenges, we are prepared to navigate forward and believe our actions to reshape, focus and streamline our organization, as well as reinvest in our core businesses will enable us to deliver strong shareholder value over the long-term via robust organic growth and enhanced profitability. With that, we are now ready for Q&amp;A. Dennis?Dennis Lange: Great. Thanks, Don. Shannon, we can now start Q&amp;A, please.

The Zacks Medical - Dental Supplies industry bore the brunt of the closure of dental practices and lower patient visits due to the risk of exposure to the virus. However, the dental market has experienced substantial recovery, primarily owing to the easing of prior restrictions and mass vaccinations.Apart from this, rising dependence on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Robotics, teledentistry, and an increase in the number of patient visits are likely to help the industry thrive in the near term. Going by Market Research Future data available on GlobeNewswire, the global dental industry is expected to reach $60.37 billion by 2023, seeing a compound annual growth rate of 6.9% from 2022 to 2030.However, inflationary, labor-shortage and supply-chain headwinds are hurting the margins of the industry players. These headwinds are likely to continue in 2023, subduing earnings growth. Industry participants like McKesson, AmerisourceBergen, Laboratory Corp. of America or LabCorp, Cardinal Health and Merit Medical Systems have shown resiliency despite uncertain conditions and are likely to gain from the existing opportunities.Industry DescriptionThis industry primarily comprises designers, developers, manufacturers and marketers of dental consumables, dental laboratory products and dental specialty items. Some of the industry participants also provide practice management and clinical software, patient education systems, and office forms and stationery. Dental stocks have been gaining significant attention post the weakness witnessed during the pandemic-induced disruptions.Story continuesThis space has continued to show signs of recovery and held its ground. Notably, dental care is being delivered safely, following the guidance and recommendations of the American Dental Association (“ADA”) and CDC. Backed by the rebound witnessed by the companies in this space, patient volume continues to see an encouraging increase despite the COVID-19 uncertainty.Major Trends Shaping the Future of the Medical Dental Supplies IndustryRising Dependence on Teledentistry: Following the COVID-19 outbreak, most dental practices were unable to offer routine services in the office. Teledentistry, which is a provision to offer dental services through interactive video, audio or other electronic media to provide consultation, diagnosis and treatment, helped clinicians and patients amid this crisis. The dependence on teledentistry is expected to continue even as the pandemic subsides, as it enhances patient care. The introduction of digital solutions has helped dental professionals to conduct video consultations with existing patients, thereby enhancing treatment efficiency.Digital Influence: The latest technologies help dentists in carrying out minimally-invasive procedures that ensure precision and efficiency, thereby reducing patients’ trauma. The industry players actively promote digital workflows for general dentistry and dental specialties. Further, dental 3D printers are revolutionizing dentistry. These reduce time and cost through efficient utilization of orthodontics and dental practices. Notably, dental 3D printers became mainstream in 2020.AI &amp; Robotics: AI has been shaping the dental industry for quite some time now. This decade is likely to see the rise of computing power, which has become more accessible and affordable for dental practitioners. It will transform the way dentists work, and patients receive treatment, especially with the introduction of robot dentists.

The move was first reported by the Financial Times.The incident appears to be at least the second time Disney has removed an episode of The Simpsons from Disney Plus in the region because of its content.In 2021, the US media giant removed an episode that referenced China’s efforts to repression knowledge of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.The episode, which first aired in 2005, depicts a sign in the square that reads: “On this site, in 1989, nothing happened.”Disney has made significant investments in both mainland China and Hong Kong despite rising tensions between Washington and Beijing.The company will this month release Marvel blockbusters Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania in China – the first releases for the franchise in that market for almost four years.Disney also operates theme parks in Shanghai and Hong KongHowever, operations in the region are increasingly politically charged as China clashes with the West and Beijing tightens its grip on Hong Kong, suppressing freedom of speech and democracy.Story continuesIn 2021, Hong Kong’s government passed a film censorship law to “safeguard national security”, but officials have said the law does not apply to streaming services.Disney faced an attempted boycott of its 2020 remake of Mulan after it shot some of the film in Xinjiang.The Simpsons, which is now in its 34th series, is one of Disney’s most reliable hits.

147,273b2a6e-357c-323d-86b5-2b68aaebc1e8,OKE,2023-02-06,Here's Why We Think ONEOK (NYSE:OKE) Might Deserve Your Attention Today,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-think-oneok-nyse-132352515.html,1675603432,STORY,['OKE'],"[Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like ONEOK (NYSE:OKE). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. Check out our latest analysis for ONEOK ONEOK's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingGenerally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. ONEOK managed to grow EPS by 6.1% per year, over three years. While that sort of growth rate isn't anything to write home about, it does show the business is growing.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. While ONEOK did well to grow revenue over the last year, EBIT margins were dampened at the same time. So it seems the future may hold further growth, especially if EBIT margins can remain steady.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of ONEOK's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Are ONEOK Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$31b company like ONEOK. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$204m. We note that this amounts to 0.7% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of ONEOK but it's still worth mentioning. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Story continuesIt's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? Our quick analysis into CEO remuneration would seem to indicate they are. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to ONEOK, with market caps over US$8.0b, is around US$12m.ONEOK's CEO took home a total compensation package worth US$7.2m in the year leading up to December 2021. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given it's below the median for similar sized companies. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.Should You Add ONEOK To Your Watchlist?One important encouraging feature of ONEOK is that it is growing profits. The growth of EPS may be the eye-catching headline for ONEOK, but there's more to bring joy for shareholders. Boasting both modest CEO pay and considerable insider ownership, you'd argue this one is worthy of the watchlist, at least. Before you take the next step you should know about the 3 warning signs for ONEOK (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that we have uncovered.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

This takes the annual payment to 2.9% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for Comcast Comcast's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWe aren't too impressed by dividend yields unless they can be sustained over time. The last payment made up 89% of earnings, but cash flows were much higher. Since the dividend is just paying out cash to shareholders, we care more about the cash payout ratio from which we can see plenty is being left over for reinvestment in the business.According to analysts, EPS should be several times higher next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate that the payout ratio could reach 29%, which is in a comfortable range for us.historic-dividendComcast Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.325 total annually to $1.16. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 14% over that duration. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.The Dividend Has Limited Growth PotentialInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Let's not jump to conclusions as things might not be as good as they appear on the surface. Comcast's earnings per share has shrunk at 23% a year over the past five years. Dividend payments are likely to come under some pressure unless EPS can pull out of the nosedive it is in. However, the next year is actually looking up, with earnings set to rise. We would just wait until it becomes a pattern before getting too excited.In SummaryOverall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think Comcast will make a great income stock. The company has been bring in plenty of cash to cover the dividend, but we don't necessarily think that makes it a great dividend stock. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can go to Jim Cramer's 5 Favorite Energy and Bank Stock Picks.Jim Cramer is an American television personality, former hedge fund manager, and best-selling author. He is the host of CNBC's Mad Money and co-founder of TheStreet.com. Cramer is known for his energetic and often bombastic on-air style and outspoken views on the stock market and investing.""We're in a Bull Market""After a series of aggressive rate hikes in 2022, on February 1, the Federal Reserve issued another rate hike at its first meeting of 2023. However, this time the Fed raised interest rates by 25 basis points, bringing its federal funds rate target range to between 4.5% and 4.75%. On February 2, Jim Cramer talked about the Fed's latest rate hike and why he thinks that ""everything Powell said in his press conference was positive"". Cramer said ""it's crazy that stocks ever sold off in the first place"" because the Fed is now moving towards getting ""disinflation going, not slowing of inflation, but disinflation"". According to Jim Cramer, ""we're in a bull market"".""It (the bull market) started last fall when long-term interest rates peaked, along with the dollar peaking. Now many stocks have clearly bottomed, even tech.""According to Cramer, ""the Fed is just trying to strike a balance between inflation and price stability"".Jim Cramer noted that selling stocks before the peak in long-term interest rates and the dollar was the right thing to do. However, now that ""the Fed says the rate hikes are working and we're pretty far along the tightening cycle"", selling stocks may not be the right thing to do. According to Cramer, this ""mistaken selling creates the opportunity for you (investors) to buy the dips"".Jim Cramer thinks that there are ""some legitimate, sizable bull markets going on"" and one of them is the banks.This piece will explore some of the favorite energy and bank stock picks of Mad Money host, Jim Cramer.

No doubt, it’s a successful investment strategy that helped Richard Driehaus make a place in Barron’s All-Century Team.To that end, stocks like Coca Cola Femsa, United Rentals and Ameriprise Financial have been selected as the momentum picks for the day using the Driehaus strategy.A Detailed Look into Driehaus StrategyRegarding the strategy, Driehaus once said: “I would much rather invest in a stock that’s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that’s already in decline and try to guess when it will turn around.” In line with this insight, the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) took into account the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus’ philosophy.It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator — positive relative strength — has also been included in this strategy. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.Moreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.Here are three of the 12 stocks:Story continuesCoca Cola Femsa produces, markets, and distributes soft drinks throughout the metropolitan area of Mexico City, in Southeastern Mexico, and in metropolitan Buenos Aires, Argentina.

The expanded platform will also help the utility better manage increased data from distributed energy resources (DERs) and meet its regulatory requirements.Oracle Logo (PRNewsfoto/Oracle)Dominion Energy Virginia provides electricity to 2.7 million homes and businesses. The utility has used Oracle Utilities Network Management System (NMS) for over a decade to plan and execute key switching activities across its network. By upgrading the solution and adding Oracle's Fault Location Isolation and Service Restoration (FLISR) application for automated, self-healing support, Dominion Energy will be able to automatically sectionalize outage impact, enable reduction in service interruptions and help increase its service reliability.Additionally, the browser-based Oracle Utilities Flex Operations will help Dominion Energy securely extend outage management and dispatch capabilities beyond the control room. As such, they will be able to activate remote users to quickly respond to storms and other major outage events faster and direct restoration efforts from anywhere. Oracle's Power Flow application will provide advanced distribution management by monitoring the real-time status of their networks.""Delivering the highest levels of service reliability to our customers and meeting priority KPIs such as reducing service interruption minutes requires the advanced grid technologies found in Oracle's FLISR, FlexOps, and Power Flow applications,"" said Jason Holland, director of operation centers and emergency preparedness, Dominion Energy. ""Our long experience with Oracle Utilities NMS and workshop assessments of their power applications convinced us that Oracle could uniquely deliver what we need. As we look ahead to the second phase of our project, their proven OMS capabilities and scalable architecture will give us a modern management path to faster restoration on a single platform.""Story continuesOracle Utilities Outage Management System (OMS) will be deployed during the first half of 2024 to replace Dominion Energy's existing system. With it, the utility will be able to integrate IT and business operations and easily add new components, while field crews will benefit significantly from system familiarity and interoperability with other Dominion Energy operating segments. Additionally, Oracle NMS Operations Mobile Application (OMA) will empower crews to receive and execute switching steps and communicate key activities via mobile devices with real-time changes reflected in the command centers, enabling faster responses in emergency situations to quickly assess and mitigate network damages.Evolving to meet complex grid needsOracle's Advanced Distribution Management System (ADMS) is designed to help utilities meet today's needs and prepare for future needs by monitoring, managing, and effectively optimizing the grid from distribution to customer. In addition to implementing the FLISR, FlexOperations, and Power Flow applications, Dominion Energy will benefit from Oracle Utilities Live Energy Connect (LEC), an OT-centric middleware platform that supports all major SCADA protocols (e.g., ICCP, OPC, and DNP3). The solution provides essential, technology-agnostic integration with utilities' existing SCADA systems and can support future scaling options.""Our longtime collaboration with Dominion Energy Virginia is the perfect example of how we constantly evolve our ADMS technologies to help utilities more confidently meet their most pressing DER, customer service, regulatory, and other business challenges,"" said Brad Harkavy, vice president, Oracle Energy and Water. ""With NMS, Dominion Energy can add intelligent advanced applications to meet regulatory requirements today, not in 5-10 years. Additionally, with one efficient, scalable platform for OMS, they will gain efficiencies that transcend business operations. Field crews will benefit from mobile applications that expedite their restoration activities during potentially dangerous emergency response situations and enable critical, real-time command center visibility.""To see these technologies in action, visit us at DISTRIBUTECH (Booth #1437) or schedule a meeting by emailing energyandwater-events_us@oracle.com.To learn more about Oracle Energy and Water solutions visit: https://www.oracle.com/industries/utilities/network-management-system/About OracleOracle offers integrated suites of applications plus secure, autonomous infrastructure in the Oracle Cloud. For more information about Oracle (NYSE: ORCL), please visit us at oracle.com.TrademarksOracle, Java, and MySQL are registered trademarks of Oracle Corporation.

You can skip our detailed analysis of safe stocks and go directly to read 5 Safe Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.Even if there are many indications that the macro environment will remain challenging in 2023, this is not the time to stay on the sidelines. In reality, it's still a good opportunity to establish positions in safe companies to purchase for the long term while fear, uncertainty, and doubt continue to roil the markets.Although buying risk-free stocks sounds like a great idea, there isn't a stock that is really secure. Even the most stable organizations frequently endure considerable stock price fluctuation, and even the finest companies might encounter unforeseen difficulties. This was evident in the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic when the stock prices of numerous powerful firms fell sharply. One way to deal with individual stock risk is diversification.Over the last 12 months, U.S. stocks declined slightly more than 10%. We had a great start to 2023, but the markets seem to be overly optimistic. Long-term interest rates are around 3.5% and consensus estimates for S&amp;P 500 Index hover around $230. This means the market has a forward PE ratio of 18 assuming that the optimistic consensus earnings estimates are accurate.Long-term investors, however, don't pay attention to the volatile, short-term rise and fall of stock markets. Instead, they invest in shares of dependable businesses with consistent performance over years or even decades. The best long-term investments are equities of expanding companies that offer consistent profits. You must comprehend the measurements that provide reliable proof of trustworthy long-term success to locate them.12 Safe Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundsFactors include routinely outperforming the S&amp;P 500 and avoiding the significant short-term drops (and gains) that high-flying firms typically go through. These companies often have solid, well-established operations, consistent revenues, and a reliable supply of dividends for shareholders. As the pandemic last year showed, safe equities may provide investors with a route out of a financial catastrophe during a recession. Some of the notable names in the list of safe stocks include Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), among others.Story continuesOur MethodologyWe identified the top 50 holdings of iShares MSCI USA Min Vol Factor ETF (USMV) and ranked them using Insider Monkey's proprietary hedge fund sentiment data.

Consider, that the longer a company invests in its brands through advertising and R&amp;D, the stronger and more resonant they may get.

Public Storage’s Board of Trustees has unanimously approved the proposal.As detailed in Public Storage’s January 12, 2023 letter, Public Storage believes a combination of the two companies will result in immediate benefits to Life Storage shareholders, and will unlock superior near-, medium- and long-term growth and value creation opportunities, including:Accelerated Growth and Profitability: Stronger organic growth resulting in higher profitability as Life Storage’s portfolio benefits from Public Storage’s industry-leading revenue generation and expense efficiency. Public Storage’s same store direct operating margin is approximately 80%, compared to 73% for Life Storage. Following the transaction, Life Storage shareholders would benefit from the higher income uniquely generated by Public Storage’s platform.Story continuesPlatform Cost Savings: Platform efficiencies within an industry where cost benefits of scale are well-demonstrated.Enhanced Ancillary Operations: Complementary enhancements to ancillary operating platforms, including tenant reinsurance, third-party property management, business customer offerings, and lending.Expanded Portfolio Growth Opportunity: Public Storage’s in-house development, redevelopment, and acquisition expertise and higher net operating income generation unlock greater opportunities externally and within Life Storage’s existing portfolio.Balance Sheet: Combined capacity to fund significant future growth at a more advantageous cost of capital utilizing Public Storage’s industry leading balance sheet and A / A2 credit rating while maintaining prudent leverage.""Our proposal would create a combined company with significant advantages, more robust operational capabilities, and a strong trajectory of profitable growth,"" said Joe Russell, Public Storage’s President and Chief Executive Officer. ""Our compelling offer to Life Storage shareholders includes a substantial immediate equity premium, a turbo-charged share of the combined company, and the opportunity to participate in the upside we intend to create together. We have been disappointed that Life Storage’s board has refused to engage constructively with us. Life Storage explicitly wrote on December 29, 2022 that Life Storage is ‘not for sale,’ reaffirmed that stance in a January 31, 2023 letter without offering any avenue for further dialogue, and has been unresponsive to our outreach.""""Public Storage has a long and proven track record of delivering shareholder value through strategic growth, and we are confident in our ability to deliver significant operating efficiencies and capitalize on expanded ancillary and capital allocation opportunities. We strongly urge the Life Storage board to act in the best interests of its shareholders and enter into good faith discussions with us regarding the proposed transaction’s benefits.""Public Storage also today announced that its Board of Trustees has increased Public Storage’s regular common quarterly dividend by 50%, from $2.00 to $3.00 per share.The full text of Public Storage’s February 5, 2023 and January 12, 2023 letters is included below.AdvisorsGoldman Sachs &amp; Co.

Barberio, Chairman of the BoardJoseph V. Saffire, Chief Executive OfficerLife Storage, Inc.6467 Main StreetBuffalo, NY 14221Dear Mark and Joe,We are writing to reiterate our proposal to acquire Life Storage, Inc. for consideration consisting of Public Storage common stock at an exchange ratio of 0.4192 shares of Public Storage common stock for each outstanding Life Storage share or unit. Our offer represents a 19% premium based on the 20-day trailing VWAPs of Public Storage and Life Storage as of February 3, 2023. This substantial offer provides Life Storage shareholders not only an immediate, highly attractive equity premium, but also a superior opportunity to unlock near-, medium-, and long-term growth, profitability, and value creation.We believe your shareholders deserve to be informed of our proposed transaction and to have the opportunity to make their views known, and we are making this letter public in light of your refusal to engage in any meaningful dialogue, including your declaration in writing on December 29, 2022 that Life Storage ""is not for sale.""As we have stated multiple times, we admire your business and respect the strides your management team and board have made, particularly in recent years. Your success, coupled with Public Storage’s proven ability to deliver industry-leading performance through superior operational capabilities and strategic growth, is the reason we are so confident in the unique opportunity this proposal represents for your shareholders. Following the transaction, your shareholders would own a combined business with a diversified platform that is well-positioned for enhanced organic growth, profitability, and portfolio expansion utilizing the industry’s most recognized brand and strongest balance sheet.We have made numerous attempts to engage in a constructive private dialogue with you and your board over the past two months. On January 12, we proposed to you in writing a transaction at an exchange ratio of 0.4192 shares, which represented a 20% premium on that day. Instead of meaningfully engaging with us, you sent a letter on January 31 bluntly asserting that our offer is not in the best interests of your shareholders without providing any explanation or avenue for discussion. Your letter—and your lack of response to our outreach since—clearly reflect the ""not for sale"" stance communicated in your December 29 letter. We believe your persistent unwillingness to engage in discussions regarding this highly beneficial transaction is contrary to the interests of your shareholders.We would have preferred to work privately with you to reach an agreement for the benefit of our respective shareholders, but given your refusal to engage meaningfully, we believe making our proposal public is now the most constructive approach. Your shareholders deserve the opportunity to consider and communicate directly with you regarding the substantial benefits of our offer.Public Storage and our board consider this transaction to be an important strategic priority. We have engaged Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. LLC and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz to assist us in completing this transaction. We believe that this transaction provides a high degree of closing certainty and can be completed quickly.We stand ready to work with you immediately and to move forward on the basis of our proposal. We strongly prefer to engage in direct and constructive discussions to reach an agreement for the benefit of your company. And we hope you, your board, and your advisors are prepared to engage with us in the best interests of your deserving shareholders.Sincerely,/s/ Joseph D. Russell, Jr./s/ Ronald L. Havner, Jr.Joseph D. Russell, Jr.President and Chief Executive OfficerRonald L. Havner, Jr.Chairman of the BoardPublic Storage’s January 12, 2023 Letter to Life StorageJanuary 12, 2023Mark G. Barberio, Chairman of the BoardJoseph V. Saffire, Chief Executive OfficerLife Storage, Inc.6467 Main StreetBuffalo, NY 14221Dear Mark and Joe,We are writing to follow up on our December 22, 2022 conversation, during which we conveyed to you Public Storage’s very strong interest in acquiring Life Storage, Inc. We appreciated our conversation and the chance to discuss the merits of a combined company. As discussed, we admire your business and respect what you, your management team, and board have accomplished. We strongly believe that our combined company would be one of the leading and most well-regarded real estate companies and very well received by the investor community.We are proposing that Public Storage would acquire all of the outstanding shares and units of Life Storage for consideration consisting of Public Storage common stock at an exchange ratio of 0.4192 shares of Public Storage common stock for each outstanding Life Storage share or unit. The proposed consideration has a current value of $124.12 per Life Storage share/unit based on the closing price of Public Storage common stock on January 12, 2023, which represents a substantial immediate premium for Life Storage equityholders of 20%. We propose to structure the transaction so that it would be taxable for Life Storage equityholders, which we believe would not be of concern to the majority of your shareholders, so that the combined company would benefit from a step-up in tax basis, with a corresponding enhanced ability for the combined company to retain free cash flow to fund future accretive growth.Participating in the combined company on the basis of the exchange ratio we are proposing will provide your equityholders with the opportunity to share in all of the upside of the combined company on a basis reflecting a proportional ownership interest substantially greater than would be implied by our respective underlying fundamentals. Put simply, the immediate equity premium to be paid to your shareholders affords them a turbo-charged share of the combined company and an equity investment far superior to continuing as an investor in your stand-alone company.Our proposed transaction will allow Life Storage shareholders the opportunity to benefit from long-term value creation in a combined company that will have several advantages, including the immediate ability to:Increase significant operational efficiencies and economies of scale, leading to improved margins on Life Storage’s portfolio and enabling your shareholders to benefit from operational improvement quickly;Expand the strongest brand in the industry, which when combined with the leading digital customer experience, will enable more robust customer acquisition and new customer growth;Retain and deploy a strong, low leverage, single-A credit rated balance sheet, which will create significant external growth capacity at a low cost of capital;Unlock additional capital allocation opportunities through acquisitions with the combined company’s higher margins and lower cost of capital, including providing your shareholders exposure to our industry leading in-house development and redevelopment capabilities;Combine our significant 65 million square feet of non-same store portfolios, providing outsized cash flow growth; andAccelerate growth of ancillary operations, including tenant reinsurance and third-party property management, and pair your private owner lending platform with our strong balance sheet.Our industry leading brand, balance sheet, and lower cost of capital, combined with the significant operational efficiencies we expect to achieve through the proposed transaction, will make the combined company more profitable and nimble, driving cash flow and value creation for the shareholders of the combined company.Given the proposed transaction’s immediate and long-term benefits, we feel very strongly that our proposed offer provides Life Storage shareholders a more favorable alternative than its current standalone strategy. We were surprised by your December 29, 2022 letter, which stated that ""the Company is not for sale,"" and your call to request that we not provide you with the specific terms on which we would propose a transaction. Hopefully you agree that this proposal is compelling and merits serious consideration and engagement by your board. We would certainly welcome the opportunity to spend time with you and your Board to discuss our proposal and walk you through why this is such a compelling opportunity for your shareholders.Our proposal provides a high degree of closing certainty and a fast track to completion. We stand ready to enter into a confidentiality agreement, commence our due diligence, and negotiate definitive transaction documentation on a fast track. To that end, we have engaged Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz as our legal advisor on this transaction, and all of our internal and external resources stand ready to move promptly to the next phase of the transaction, including our completion of customary confirmatory due diligence. This transaction is a very high priority for our management team and Board of Trustees, which has unanimously approved this proposal.This proposal is based solely on public information, is non-binding, and does not constitute an offer or a commitment to submit an offer or to negotiate or enter into a definitive agreement; the parties will not be legally bound with respect to this proposal until execution of definitive transaction agreements, if any, and subject to the terms and conditions expressed therein.* * * *We and our advisors stand ready to engage with you and your team as quickly and intensively as possible, and we look forward to doing so, with a view towards delivering superior value to your equityholders.We would welcome the opportunity to meet with you as soon as possible to discuss this compelling proposal further and answer any questions you may have.Sincerely,/s/ Joseph D.

As our teams worked tirelessly to respond to client demand resulting from market and interest rate volatility, particularly in the U.K. and continue to help clients execute on pension risk transfer, strategic pension management and respond to regulatory changes. And finally, commercial risk grew 4% in the quarter and 6% for the year. We delivered double-digit organic revenue growth in Canada and Latin America and strong growth in Europe, the U.K. and Asia Pacific.In the U.S., otherwise strong results continue to reflect the impact of the external M&amp;A and IPO environment on M&amp;A services. This impact reduced quarterly organic growth by 5%, an annual growth by 2.5%. And while this short-term pressure may continue into Q1, over the long term, we are very well positioned in this highly attractive business but has significant opportunity to contribute to long-term top and bottom line growth. For the full year, our organic revenue growth of 6% is a direct result of our Aon United strategy and is a key driver of strong top and bottom line results for the full year. Noting adjusted operating margins expanded 70 basis points to 30.8%. Adjusted earnings per share grew 12% to $13.39, overcoming a 3% or $0.44 FX headwind.Free cash flow exceeded $3 billion with free cash flow margins of 24.2%, both our highest ever and we completed $3.2 billion of share buyback, demonstrating our confidence in the long-term value of the firm. Our team's performance positions us exceptionally well to deliver in 2023 and over the long term. Looking back, since 2010, we've reported 4% average organic revenue growth. Over 1,100 basis points of margin expansion or about 90 basis points per year, while adjusted EPS and free cash flow increased at a compound annual growth rates of 12% and 13%, respectively. More important, we view the go-forward opportunity and momentum higher now than any time in our history. Looking ahead, we continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the firm, margin improvement and double-digit free cash flow growth for the full year 2023 and over the long term.Reflecting on the year, we would offer a few observations on how Aon United continues to deliver for clients. The steps we've taken over the past decade, including our single brand and single P&amp;L, put us in an exceptionally strong position to deliver for clients and have significant impact on some of the greatest opportunities and challenges they face. These ideas are not new. There are a continuation of over a decade of progress on the areas highlighted in our Aon United blueprint, clients, colleagues, innovation at scale and Aon business services that are increasingly interconnected and mutually reinforcing. On delivering innovation at scale, the platform we've built not only enables innovation of new concepts as we've demonstrated in areas like intellectual property solutions and climate but increasingly enables us to bring together our analytics and expertise for new solution development, both from within solution lines and connected across our business.For example, our Health Solutions team has developed an Aon health analytics platform, supported by hundreds of data scientists and credential health actuaries, as well as experts from human capital and ad business services. It's designed to help clients assess and improve their employees' health which in turn helps deliver well-being, productivity and lower cost. Within this offering, driven by proprietary analytics, we can assess data around employee health information, insurance and claims, workplace safety, absence engagement data and external data on health trends and solutions which together form a robust view of employee physical well-being. With this insight, our teams can recommend individualized solutions, including better insurance offerings and targeted program.Bank, Coin, DollarPhoto by Dmitry Demidko on UnsplashAs an example, 1 manufacturing client wanted to improve employee physical well-being and reduce costs. Together, we designed a comprehensive long-term well-being strategy and a customized health program that includes 12 vendors and targeted specific health and well-being programs for employees based on individual factors correlated success. The results were impressive. In our target group as compared to nonparticipants, we saw meaningful improvement in selected health metrics at 24% lower cost per person. Further, the platform allows for rapid scale and distribution of a solution to help our clients drive workforce health, wealth and productivity. Equally important, our colleagues while having this kind of impact which is an important driver of our very high Aon colleague engagement.And we see examples like this across the firm every day as we help our clients manage risk and support their people. And this demonstrates the opportunity to continue delivering innovative solutions at scale to address our clients' biggest challenges across the backdrop of rapid change and ongoing volatility. To summarize, we began 2023 in a position of strength. Our firm is more connected than ever before, enabling us to deliver better solutions for clients and to better support our colleagues. Aon United will continue to deliver results now and over the long term for our clients, colleagues and shareholders and is reflected in our progress to achieve key financial objectives. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our financial progress in Q4 and 2022 and our long-term outlook.Christa?Christa Davies: Thanks so much, Greg and good morning, everyone. As Greg highlighted, we delivered another strong quarter of performance across our key metrics to finish the year. In the quarter, we translated 5% organic revenue growth into 40 basis points of adjusted margin expansion and strong growth in adjusted earnings per share. For the full year 2022, organic revenue growth was 6%. Adjusted operating margins increased 70 basis points to 30.8% and we generated over $3 billion in free cash flow, an all-time high. We look forward to building on this momentum as we head into 2023. As I reflect on results, as Greg noted, organic revenue growth was 5% in the fourth quarter and 6% for the full year. We continue to expect mid-single digital greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2023 and over the long term.I would also note that reported revenue growth of 2% in both Q4 and the full year includes an unfavorable impact from changes in FX of 4% in both periods. Primarily driven by a stronger U.S. dollar versus most currencies. I'd also highlight that fiduciary investment income which is not included in our organic revenue growth, was $41 million in Q4 and $76 million for the full year or 1% in both periods. Moving to operating performance. We delivered strong operational improvement in Q4 with adjusted operating margins of 33.2% an increase of 40 basis points driven by organic revenue growth and efficiencies from Aon Business Services, overcoming expense growth, including investments in colleagues and technology to drive long-term growth and some ongoing resumption of T&amp;E.For the full year, adjusted operating margin of 30.8% reflects margin expansion of 70 basis points year-over-year. And I'll note over the past 12 years, we delivered 90 basis points of margin expansion a year. Looking forward, we expect to deliver margin expansion in 2023 and over the long term as we continue our track record of cost discipline and managing investments in long-term growth on an ROIC basis. As we've previously communicated, we think about margins over the course of the full year, driven by 3 areas: the first is top line revenue growth. The second is this portfolio mix shift to higher margin businesses as we invest disproportionately in areas of increasing client demand, supported by data-driven solutions to deliver the insights and advice that help our clients protect and grow their organizations.And third area is increased operating leverage from ongoing productivity improvement from our Aon Business Services platform. I'd highlight that Aon Business Services continues to be a key contributor to margin expansion and represents a competitive advantage, especially in a high inflationary market. Our Am business services platform continues to drive efficiency gains, improved quality and service and increased innovation at scale. During 2022, we continue to make progress on Aon Business Services and driving efficiencies in enhanced services. Particularly through process improvement, automation and the use of artificial intelligence. For instance, our captives business has clients with hundreds of legal entities who each require multiple policies.Previously, the process of checking policies was manual and inefficient. We've now moved to a digital solution that can identify differences quickly and accurately and deliver these to clients much more quickly. Similarly, the use of AI is increasingly enabling us to deliver better solutions to clients. For example, we delivered a new solution for our human capital clients using an AI-powered search engine that provides them with insights on technology talent globally including geography-based pay differentials. This is essential for finding the best technology talent and optimizing within the client's existing workforce, a key area of growth for many firms. As we've said before, these improvements not only improve accuracy and client service delivery, they also help free up our colleagues time for more valuable client activities and drive better outcomes for our clients.Organic growth and margin expansion translated into adjusted EPS of 5% in Q4 and double-digit growth of 12% for the full year. As noted in our earnings materials, FX translation was an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.09 per share in Q4 and $0.44 per share for the full year 2022. If currencies are remained stable at today's rate, we would expect an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.13 per share in the first quarter of 2023 and $0.12 per share for the full year 2023. Turning to free cash flow and capital allocation. We generated over $3 billion in free cash flow in 2022, contributing to our long-term track record of growing free cash flow at 13% CAGR since 2010. Our outlook for free cash flow in 2023 and beyond remains strong and we continue to expect to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth for the full year and over the long term, driven by operating income growth and working capital improvements.I'd note CapEx returned to a more normalized level in 2022 as we made ongoing investments in ABS enabled platforms and technology to drive long-term growth. As we've said before, we manage CapEx like all of our investments, on a disciplined return on capital basis. Given our strong outlook for free cash flow growth in 2023 and beyond, we expect share repurchases to continue to remain our highest ROIC opportunity for capital allocation. We believe we're significantly undervalued in the market today, highlighted by the approximately $675 million of share repurchases in the quarter and $3.2 billion of share repurchase for the full year. We also expect to continue to invest organically and inorganically in content and capabilities that we can scale to address unmet client needs.We've invested in expertise and content to help meet our clients' needs such as our Q4 acquisition of ERM, a Mexico-based leader in risk assessment modeling which expands our catastrophe modeling and consulting capabilities in reinsurance. Our M&amp;A pipeline continues to be focused on our highest priority areas that will bring scalable solutions to our clients' growing and evolving challenges. We will continue to actively manage the portfolio and assess all capital allocation decisions on an ROIC basis. We ended 2022 with an ROIC of 30.6%, an increase of nearly 1,900 basis points over the last 12 years. Now turning to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile.We expect to add incremental debt as EBITDA growth over the long term while maintaining our current investment-grade credit ratings. With respect to interest rates, I'd note our term debt is all fixed rate, with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 4% and a weighted average maturity of approximately 12 years. I'd note our pension liability improved as interest rates increase. As a continuation of our pension derisking efforts, I'd highlight that we completed an annuity settlement transaction in the fourth quarter, resulting in approximately $300 million reduction in our pension benefit obligation. This continues to be an incredibly attractive environment for our clients to do pension risk transfers and we continue to see very strong demand from clients.We've done substantial numbers of pension risk transfers in the U.S. and the U.K. and are a leader in the space. In summary, 2022 was another year of strong top and bottom line performance, driven by the strength of our Aon United Strategy and Aon Business Services. We returned over $3.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. The success we achieved this year continues to provide momentum as we head into 2023. While we're seeing signs of economic uncertainty, we remain confident in the strength of our firm and our financial guidance for 2023. Overall, our business is resilient and our Aon United strategy gives us confidence in our ability to deliver results in any economic scenario. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we'd be delighted to take your questions.See also 10 Hot Healthcare Stocks To Buy Now and 10 Hot Tech Stocks To Buy Now .To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

This makes the dividend yield 2.3%, which is above the industry average. See our latest analysis for McDonald's McDonald's' Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. Prior to this announcement, McDonald's was quite comfortably covering its dividend with earnings and it was paying more than 75% of its free cash flow to shareholders. By paying out so much of its cash flows, this could indicate that the company has limited opportunities for investment and growth.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 54.4%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 48% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendMcDonald's Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $2.80 total annually to $6.08. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 8.1% over that duration. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained.McDonald's Could Grow Its DividendInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. McDonald's has impressed us by growing EPS at 5.6% per year over the past five years. Earnings are on the uptrend, and it is only paying a small portion of those earnings to shareholders.Our Thoughts On McDonald's' DividendOverall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment. While McDonald's is earning enough to cover the dividend, we are generally unimpressed with its future prospects. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 1 warning sign for McDonald's that investors need to be conscious of moving forward. Is McDonald's not quite the opportunity you were looking for?

170,cb5dd6f8-01bc-3ff9-adbf-972277ede46d,MCD,2023-02-06,3 Defensive Stocks to Buy If You Think the Market Is Headed Lower,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-defensive-stocks-buy-think-174450104.html,1675359890,STORY,"['JNJ', 'MCD', 'QSR']","[As we kick off a new year, investing in defensive stocks certainly appears to be in focus for many investors. Following a brutal 2022, many aggressive investors were taught a lesson by Mr. Market– namely, what happens when a portfolio lacks diversification and low-beta assets.In risk-on momentum-driven bull market rallies, growth stocks outperform to an incredible degree. However, when valuations start to matter and money isn’t free anymore, defensive stocks outperform. Defensive stocks are typically categorized as companies in mature industries with predictable cash flows that are less sensitive to economic cycles. These companies produce goods and services that consumers need, regardless of economic conditions. Generally, such defensive stocks pay steady dividends and provide investors with capital appreciation over time.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThis article will discuss three defensive stocks you should consider if you think the market is headed lower. We’ll look at their current prices and dividend yields, their performance against their peers and any associated risks.TickerCompanyPriceQSRRestaurant Brands$67.15JNJJohnson &amp; Johnson$164.28MCDMcDonald’s$263.68Restaurant Brands (QSR)Source: ShutterstockFor those seeking defensive stocks with the potential for high returns, Restaurant Brands (NYSE:QSR) is a company I’d certainly put in this bucket. The parent company of Burger King, Tim Horton’s, Popeye’s Louisiana Kitchen and recently-acquired Firehouse Subs, Restaurant Brands holds some of the highest-quality brands in the fast food space.Based on current information, QSR stock is in an uptrend. Notably, increased popularity among food services sector companies has improved the company’s outlook among technical types.However, for fundamental investors, there’s a lot to like about QSR stock. This is a company that trades at only 21-times earnings, much lower than its longer-term average. Additionally, it’s a stock with a dividend yield of 3.2%, also much better than its large-cap counterparts (and we’ll get to one in a minute.)Story continuesIndeed, QSR stock’s position as a fast food giant provides a robust business model, which can actually perform better in times of stress. For those looking to take advantage of a trade-down in dining out, this is among the top defensive stocks to consider right now.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)A red Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.comAs far as defensive stocks are concerned, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) may be the first name many investors think of. This leading multinational pharmaceutical and consumer goods company holds a strong market position due to its portfolio of top global brands. This company’s solid market position has resulted in robust company fundamentals. It is not surprising to long-term investors to see JNJ announce a $5 billion stock repurchase program and regular increases in its dividend payout.The S&amp;P 500 started 2023 well after a 19% drop in the previous year. However, the opposite can be said for Johnson &amp; Johnson, whose shares increased by 3% in 2022 but have declined so far in 2023.According to 11 Wall Street analysts covering JNJ stock, this stock has a consensus buy rating. Out of 11 analysts, there are four buys, seven holds and zero sell ratings on this stock. McDonald’s (MCD)A McDonald's (MCD) burger box and fries rest on a flat surface.Source: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.comAnother fast food giant to grace this list, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) is the better-known of these two quick-service restaurant giants. McDonald’s has been a critical part of the worldwide fast-food industry and is considered a long-term investment by many investors. The company boasts impressive growth statistics and has demonstrated its ability to grow as a world-class brand through international expansion and increased sales at established locations.While MCD stock has been increasing over the past year, this stock is also relatively expensive compared to its peers. Trading at 34 times earnings with a dividend yield of only 2.3%, Restaurant Brands and other players look more attractive from a fundamentals standpoint.That said, it’s McDonald’s size, historical growth and market-leading position that entices investors to hold onto this name over other options in the space. Most analysts expect it to continue paying dividends and reward shareholders with a steady income stream.

A business that's potentially in decline often shows two trends, a return on capital employed (ROCE) that's declining, and a base of capital employed that's also declining. Ultimately this means that the company is earning less per dollar invested and on top of that, it's shrinking its base of capital employed. Having said that, after a brief look, Tripadvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) we aren't filled with optimism, but let's investigate further.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Tripadvisor, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.038 = US$75m ÷ (US$2.6b - US$573m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, Tripadvisor has an ROCE of 3.8%.  Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Interactive Media and Services industry average of 6.1%. See our latest analysis for Tripadvisor roceIn the above chart we have measured Tripadvisor's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Tripadvisor here  for free.How Are Returns Trending?In terms of Tripadvisor's historical ROCE movements, the trend doesn't inspire confidence. Unfortunately the returns on capital have diminished from the 6.5% that they were earning five years ago. And on the capital employed front, the business is utilizing roughly the same amount of capital as it was back then. Companies that exhibit these attributes tend to not be shrinking, but they can be mature and facing pressure on their margins from competition. If these trends continue, we wouldn't expect Tripadvisor to turn into a multi-bagger.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Tripadvisor's ROCEAll in all, the lower returns from the same amount of capital employed aren't exactly signs of a compounding machine. Investors haven't taken kindly to these developments, since the stock has declined 29% from where it was five years ago. With underlying trends that aren't great in these areas, we'd consider looking elsewhere.If you're still interested in Tripadvisor it's worth checking out our  FREE intrinsic value approximation  to see if it's trading at an attractive price in other respects.While Tripadvisor may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Bryan. Bryan?Bryan Hanson: All right, great. Thanks Keri, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning for the call. We've really got three sections for the call this morning. First, I'm going to talk briefly about our fourth quarter performance and spend a few minutes on our teams, what I just define as solid execution, as well as our innovation and drivers for continued strong performance. Then for the second section, as usual, Suke will provide more detail on the quarter itself and very importantly our 2023 guidance and expectations. Then of course, we'll close things out by addressing any questions that you might have. Before we get started, I wanted to take a minute to thank really the ZB team, just the full ZB team not only for their work in making Q4 another successful quarter but also for their resilience.Story continuesThe innovative thinking and dedication to getting the job done throughout all of 2022, even in the face of very real adversity, there's no doubt in my mind that this team is the engine that is driving us forward, so again thank you. I can tell you that I'm very proud to be on this journey with you. Now as we turn to Q4 results, know that each and every one of you made the quarter happen, and I can tell you it was a solid quarter. We again saw better than expected growth driven by continued procedure recovery, strong execution, and a solid momentum with our new innovation, and as expected, we also benefited from some favorable comps in the quarter. Inside of this, we saw another positive quarter of year-over-year momentum in large joints with our overall global hip and knee business growing more than 8% and 10% on an ex-FX basis, and our overall set category grew in the high single digits driven by strong performance in our business growth drivers, which as we said before, are supports, CMFT, and upper extremities, as well as the expected tailwind from BBP comps in our trauma business.That said, we are clearly seeing overall market stabilization, but our fourth quarter execution and procedure recovery is still set against a macro backdrop that is challenging and fluid. Foreign currency has improved but remains a challenge and supply, inflation and staffing pressures continue. In fourth quarter, our team was once again able to navigate these challenges, flexing what I would just define as a muscle memory that I think, fortunately or unfortunately, is a bit unique to ZB and has served us well over the past year during 2022. But make no mistake - the challenges are real and they're ongoing, but regardless of this environment with COVID mainly in the rear view mirror, I have confidence that the ZB team will continue to deliver.Our culture, our strategy, innovation and execution are coalescing right now, driving tangible momentum and importantly belief from the team, and as a result confidence in our business continues to grow. Let me just give a few examples from Q4. In the quarter, we announced the approval of our new cementless knee form factor which is adding to our Persona family and strategically rounding out that portfolio. The first procedures have been completed with this new keel design, and the feedback, as expected, has been very positive. We continue to belief that our cementless knee penetration will grow significantly and that this differentiated, premium product can really accelerate that growth. It's early days with full launch planned for the middle of the year, but make no mistake, this is a real growth driver for our knee franchise.This launch builds on other recent product launches, like hip insights and our Identity shoulder system introductions, bringing now our total to more than 50 new product launches from 2018 through 2022, and importantly the largest majority of these launches came in markets we see growing in the mid single digits or better. That's really important, being launched in markets that we see growing in the mid single digits or better. This strategic prioritization and output from our innovation pipeline has helped ZB more than double our vitality index over that time, and very importantly increase our revenue in faster growth markets and sub-markets, which of course drives positive increases in our weighted average market growth. That momentum continues.We expect to launch another 40-plus products between now and the end of 2025, once again with the majority of those launches in 4%-plus growth markets. This will drive further increases in our vitality index and weighted average market growth, and most importantly bring real and meaningful innovation to the patients and customers that we serve. So what I know for sure is that our current momentum, very robust new product pipeline, and our strengthening balance sheet focused on accelerating our portfolio transformation positions ZB well for the future, and as a result, I feel increasingly confident about ZB's ability to transform our business, drive growth, deliver value, and achieve our mission to alleviate pain and improve the quality of life for people around the world.With that, I'll turn the call over to Suke for a closer look at Q4 and again our expectations for 2023. Suke?Surgery, Instruments, DoctorsPhoto by National Cancer Institute on UnsplashSuketu Upadhyay: Thanks and good morning everyone. For today's call, I'm going to focus on three topics: first, our fourth quarter results; second, how that performance and recent macro trends translate into our 2023 guidance; and third, I'll provide a brief update on our long term financial priorities. With that, I'll turn to the fourth quarter results. Unless otherwise noted, my statements will be about the fourth quarter of 2022 and how it compares to the same period in 2021, and my commentary will be on a constant currency and adjusted continuing operations basis. Net sales in the fourth quarter were $1.825 billion, an increase of 2.7% on a reported basis and an increase of 8.3% on a constant currency basis. As previously noted, we had a selling day headwind of 150 to 200 basis points that impacted each category at about the same level.U.S. sales grew 6.2%, driven by strong elective procedure recovery and commercial execution, especially in our knee and hip businesses. In addition, the U.S. business saw strength across our three priority areas within SET. International sales grew 11.1% driven by strong procedure volumes across most markets in EMEA and APAC, in tandem with lighter comps and continued strong commercial execution. EMEA performance was driven by recovery in developed markets and continued strength in emerging markets. APAC was impacted by COVID-19 surges and lockdowns in China that were broadly offset by strength in other markets. Now turning to our business category performance, global knees grew 10.2% with U.S. knees up 10.8% and international knees up 9.3%, with strong performance driven by knee procedure recovery across most regions and an easier comp outside of the U.S. Continued global traction for our Persona knee system, including both Persona primary and revision in the U.S., and continued increase in Rosa procedure penetration and pull through.Global hips grew 8.4% with U.S. hips up 9.5% and international hips up 10.8%, driven by strong international procedure recovery and easier comps outside the U.S., continued traction across hip products including the G7 revision system, and Avenir Complete primary hip, which is focused on the direct anterior surgical approach, and lastly continued solid Rosa pull through in the hip category, especially in the U.S. The sports extremity and trauma category grew 7.6% and was impacted by continued strong performance across our key focus areas of CMFT, sports medicine, and upper extremities. SET was also impacted by a comp tailwind from China VBP that was partially offset by reimbursement changes in restorative therapies. Finally, our other category grew 1.3%.Moving to the P&amp;L, for the quarter we reported GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.62 compared to GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.40 in the fourth quarter of 2021. The change was driven by higher revenues partially offset by a goodwill impairment in EMEA as a result of macro factors. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share of $1.88 represented an increase from $1.79 in the fourth quarter of 2021. Adjusted gross margin was 71.7%, bringing full year gross margin to 71.2% or about in line with full year 2021, despite significant headwinds from inflationary pressure. Our adjusted operating expenses were $791 million, an increase versus the prior year due to inflationary pressures in tandem with higher investments into R&amp;D and commercial infrastructure to support new products.For the year, overall opex was flat to 2021 with an increase in R&amp;D and lower SG&amp;A. We remain disciplined in realizing efficiencies while investing in our priority areas and offsetting headwinds. Adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter was 28.3%, up slightly from the prior year, bringing total year operating margins to 27.3%, ahead of full year 2021 despite macro headwinds. The adjusted tax rate was 16.9% in the quarter, slightly higher than our expectations due to certain one-time discrete tax items. For the full year, the adjusted tax rate was 16.5% and in line with our full year guidance. Turning to cash and liquidity, operating cash flows were $244 million and free cash flow totaled $115 million for the quarter, bringing our total free cash flow for the full year to $910 million.We continued to reduce our net debt by approximately $150 million in the fourth quarter, excluding the effect of foreign currency, and ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $375 million. Moving to our financial outlook for 2023, we've based our projections in the following key assumptions. We expect to experience procedure cancellations and staffing challenges, but the impact will be less acute than what we experienced in 2022. Supply chain headwinds will continue throughout the year but with improvement in the second half of '23. Pricing headwinds are expected to be slightly better than our historic average of 200 to 300 basis points. Inflationary pressure will remain stable to 2022 exit, and an expected adjusted EPS dilution of about $0.05 to $0.10 due to our acquisition of Embody in the first quarter of 2023.Against this backdrop, our expectations for the full year '23 financial outlook are reported revenue growth in the range of 1.5% to 3.5% versus 2022, an expected foreign currency exchange headwind of approximately 150 basis points resulting in revenue growth of 3% to 5% on a constant currency basis, and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $6.95 to $7.15. Inside of that guidance, at our midpoint we expect adjusted operating profit margins to be flat to slightly up compared to 2022 levels. We also expect net interest and other non-operating expenses will be about $190 million primarily due to higher interest rates. Our adjusted tax rate should be broadly in line with 2022 and total shares outstanding are expected to remain in line with full year 2022 average fully diluted shares outstanding.Finally, we expect our free cash flow to be in the range of $925 million to $1.025 billion. In terms of cadence through the year, we expect that the constant currency revenue growth rate for the first half will be slightly higher than the growth rate in the second half, and we do expect choppiness by quarter. Q1 is projected to be our highest growth quarter due to easier comps and will be followed by the fourth quarter, driven by improved supply and innovation building throughout the year. Q2 and Q3 will be lighter quarters given tougher comps. Lastly, we don't expect any material day rate impact of full year results; however, Q1 and Q4 will benefit by about 100 basis points of tailwind that will be offset by headwinds in Q2 and Q3. In summary, we delivered accelerated growth in 2022 with a margin profile that is better than '21 as we overcame headwinds while investing in our priority areas.We navigated a number of macro challenges and delivered on our commitments to all of our stakeholders. As we look forward to 2023, while the environment remains dynamic, we see a path to delivering solid growth and earnings performance with robust free cash flow. To close out, let me make a few comments about our financial priorities moving forward. We've made significant progress over the past few years in strengthening our balance sheet through improved financial performance and ongoing reductions in debt. This ultimately provides ZB with greater strategic flexibility as we look to transform our portfolio with a focus on increasing our WAMGR and driving improved long term growth. We will remain committed to our investment-grade rating and will continue to look at ways to accelerate profitable growth with a focus on achieving our mission.I'm so very proud of the ZB team for their perseverance and dedication throughout 2022 and I'm excited about what we can accomplish in 2023. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Keri.Keri Mattox: Thanks Suke. Before we start the Q&amp;A session, just a quick reminder to please limit yourself to a single question and one follow-up so that we can get through as many questions as possible during the call.

AEP, Xcel Energy XEL, Consolidated Edison ED and PPL Corp. PPL.Industry: Electric Power UtilityLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2049374/4-stocks-to-watch-from-the-prospering-electric-power-industryThe Zacks Utility – Electric Power industry stocks have been transitioning toward clean sources of fuel and focusing on lower carbon emissions. The introduction of Inflation Reduction Act 2022 will support the industry’s transition toward clean energy sources to produce electricity. Utilities are also focused on strengthening the grid as well as transmission and distribution infrastructure. The huge infrastructure of the utilities faces the impact of the hurricane season each year. Infrastructure enhancement around the year increases the resilience of the entire system, reduces outages and allows operators to restore power quickly for customers affected by storms.American Electric Power Co., with a large investment to expand renewable operations, widespread transmission and distribution assets and well-chalked-out capital investments to boost infrastructure, offers an excellent opportunity to stay invested in the utility space. Other utilities worth adding to your portfolio include Xcel Energy, Consolidated Edison and PPL Corp.About the IndustryThe Utility – Electric Power industry involves the process of generation, transmission, distribution, storage and sale of electricity to customers. A substantial portion of utilities’ earnings is generated from regulated operations. Unless there is any major weather variation or unprecedented incidents, such as the coronavirus pandemic, demand for the services provided by utilities remains more or less steady, regardless of economic cycles.A clear transition is evident in this industry, with more companies declaring zero-emission goals on their own. Research and development over the years has resulted in a substantial decline in the cost of setting up utility-scale renewable power projects, aiding in the reduction of emissions. However, the ongoing increase in interest rates is a concern for capital-intensive utilities.Story continues3 Electric Power Industry Trends to Watch Out ForTransition Toward Cleaner Sources to Generate Power:  The operators in the U.S. electric power sector are gradually moving toward cleaner sources of energy to produce electricity. Per EIA, the annual share of U.S. electricity generation from renewable energy sources will rise from 21% in 2022 to 24% in 2023 and 26% in 2024 as a result of the continuing addition of solar and wind-generating capacity. EIA expects total solar, wind generation and battery storage addition of 57 GW and 59 GW to be added in 2023 and 2024, respectively.The expansion of renewable energy continues to eat into the share of coal in electricity generation. EIA expects coal contribution to electricity generation to fall from 20% in 2022 to 18% in 2023 and further to 17% in 2024. The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will support and accelerate the utilities’ transition toward clean energy sources.IRA has removed the uncertainties relating to federal incentives provided for renewable sources usage. The Act entails an opportunity for a wide range of low-cost clean energy solutions in a predictable way for a long time and will create earnings visibility.Demand for Electricity Stable: Per EIA, 2023 electricity consumption in the United States can drop 1% in 2023 and rise more than 1% in 2024, EIA believes that the expected drop in demand for electricity in 2023 is due to a milder summer forecast that would lead to less requirement for cooling. Despite the expected drop in consumption, the utilities will continue to add new renewable energy assets to the total generation portfolio.Ongoing Interest Rate Increase is a Concern: Utilities, to maintain, upgrade and expand operations, approach capital markets for loans. The utilities have been enjoying near-zero interest rates for the past few years. But multiple rate hikes in 2022 pushed up interest rates. In February 2023, the Federal Reserve again raised interest rates by 25 percentage points, taking the benchmark rate to a range of 4.50%-4.75%. This is the eighth increase in interest rates since March 2022, with more expected to come in 2023.The increasing interest rates are a concern for capital-intensive utilities in the United States as these will push up capital servicing costs substantially from the current levels. U.S. utilities are currently spending a substantial amount on developing an advanced electricity network. Utilities might try to pass on the burden of increasing borrowing costs to customers but the necessary increase in rates might not get approved by the commission. In such a scenario, the utilities will need to digest the extra expenses, which can lower their profitability and make them less attractive to investors interested in the utility space.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Positive ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates strong near-term prospects. The 59-stock Utility-Electric Power industry is housed within the broader Zacks Utilities sector and currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #92, which places it in the top 37% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Monthly Dividend Stocks with Over 5% Yield. During a difficult time for the capital markets in 2022, dividend-paying stocks proved to be a strong investment, outperforming both non-dividend stocks and bonds during the year. Even with a sluggish economy, market specialists remain optimistic about the growth of dividends. This is due to the conservative dividend payout ratios, which provide companies with sufficient buffers to keep increasing dividends even in the face of slowing or declining earnings growth. Concerns about inflation persist in 2023. Dividend-growing stocks can perform well during inflationary periods because, unlike bonds with fixed interest payments, the increasing dividends can help counter the impact of inflation and maintain purchasing power.Dividends have made a substantial contribution to the returns earned by investors over the past half-century. From 1960 till present, reinvested dividends and the impact of compounding have accounted for 84% of the total return of the S&amp;P 500 Index. From 1930 to 2021, the average contribution of dividend income to the total return of the S&amp;P 500 Index was 40%.ClearBridge Investments, a leading global equity manager with $151.3 billion in assets under management as of December 31, 2022, announced that it will target companies with the ability to increase prices in response to inflationary pressures, thus preserving their profitability. The firm has a positive outlook on financial sector companies, as they can benefit from rising interest rates and a strong labor market, thus maintaining high credit quality. ClearBridge also anticipates that the energy sector will remain a key contributor to dividend returns, due to its strength and the financial stability of some of the companies within the sector. The firm considers investing in dividends to be a timeless strategy.Story continuesMonthly dividend stocks offer consistent and growing income, improved reinvestment opportunities, and a potential for higher yield. While investors usually pick up dividend names like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), we discuss monthly dividend payers in this article. Our Methodology We referred to the “2023 Monthly Dividend Stocks List” from Sure Dividend, selecting stocks yielding more than 5% as of February 3. From these stocks we selected 10 stocks with the highest hedge fund sentiment. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. 10 Monthly Dividend Stocks with Over 5% YieldPhoto by buian_photos on UnsplashMonthly Dividend Stocks with Over 5% Yield10.

These enterprises undergird some of the most groundbreaking innovations of our time, facilitating potentially permanent relevance.Fundamentally, technology stocks to buy benefit from the natural forward progress of human societies. After all, whether a recession materializes or not, enterprises will continue striving for bigger and better. In some ways, then, specific tech plays may be safer than you might initially believe.On the technical front, several breakthrough technology stocks to buy incurred steep losses last year. While red ink presents near-term challenges, over the long haul, acquiring deflated tech plays now could yield tremendous gains later. If you’re willing to ride out some turbulence, below are some of the best innovative companies available.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsASMLASML$690.85NVDANvidia$214.86MSFTMicrosoft$261.92ISRGIntuitive Surgical$259.72INTUIntuit$449.28ROKRockwell Automation$290.54SMRNuScale Power$10.88ASML (ASML)Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboardSource: Ralf Liebhold / ShutterstockThe backstop of most semiconductor-related breakthrough technology stocks to buy, ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) might not be a household name. However, it plays an invaluable role in the broader innovation sphere. Specifically, the company specializes in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, building machines that print designs on silicon wafers. ASML enjoys a monopoly in this regard, making it irreplaceable.To be fair, prospective investors at this moment won’t get a brilliant deal on ASML shares. Per Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV), the business rates as fairly valued. That said, the company enjoys a stable balance sheet and strong operational attributes.Story continuesFor instance, its three-year revenue growth rate of 23.8% beats out nearly 80% of its peers. On the bottom line, ASML features a net margin of 25.91%. This stat ranks above 87% of industry players. Perhaps best of all, Wall Street analysts assess ASML as a consensus and unanimous strong buy. With sentiment among hedge funds pinging as very positive, ASML easily represents one of the technology stocks to buy.Nvidia (NVDA)Nvidia (NVDA) logo and sign on headquarters. Blurred foreground with green treesSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comAlthough perhaps best known for its video gaming and blockchain-centric graphics processing units, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) flexes its muscles across several relevant sectors. One of them centers on autonomous driving. Through its research and development in advanced sensors and artificial intelligence and machine learning protocols, Nvidia is slowly making autonomous mobility a reality.According to Strategic Market Research, the global autonomous vehicle market carried a valuation of $25.14 billion in 2021. By 2030, experts there predict that this segment will hit $196.97 billion, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25.7%. Per Gurufocus.com’s proprietary FMV calculation, it estimates NVDA as a modestly undervalued investment. Objectively, the company’s Altman Z-Score of 17.09 indicates tremendous resilience in the balance sheet. As well, Nvidia benefits from excellent revenue and profitability metrics.Currently, Wall Street analysts rate NVDA as a consensus strong buy. Even better, hedge fund sentiment ranks as very positive, making it one of the top breakthrough technology stocks to buy.Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comA steady hand in the innovation sphere, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks among the breakthrough technology stocks to buy under almost any context. However, the software (and hardware) giant has been flexing its muscles recently. Specifically, Microsoft generated headlines for its deep investments into OpenAI, the company responsible for the chatbot platform ChatGPT.Fears sparked about ChatGPT disrupting search engine-related enterprises, along with anything involving online tutoring services. I’m not mentioning names here but you can follow the aforementioned link for more information. Anyways, it’s possible that Microsoft can finally become relevant in the broader internet search ecosystem, which makes its competitors leery.Another factor boosting MSFT centers on its overall value proposition. Featuring a strong balance sheet, consistent growth, and an extremely profitable enterprise, Microsoft makes for a compelling idea among technology stocks to buy. Presently, Wall Street analysts rate MSFT as a consensus strong buy. As well, sentiment among hedge funds pings as very positive.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)Tech stocks: Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing.Source: Peshkova / ShutterstockEasily one of the most innovative technology stocks to buy in the broader healthcare sector, Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) garnered worldwide fame for its da Vinci robotic surgical system. Offering myriad opportunities for superior patient outcomes, Intuitive facilitates greater accuracy in medical procedures. As well, its minimally invasive approach may yield fewer hospital stays, resulting in cost savings.According to Grand View Research, the global medical robotic systems market size reached a valuation of $16.1 billion in 2021. Experts project that the segment will expand at a double-digit CAGR to reach annual revenue of $76.4 billion. Given that ISRG stock slipped over 14% in the trailing year, the volatility might offer a long-term discounted opportunity.Per Gurufocus.com’s proprietary FMV calculations, ISRG rates as modestly undervalued. Objectively, the company offers a holistic value proposition. First, it features zero debt in its books, affording it incredible flexibility. Second, it enjoys outstanding operational stats, such as double-digit revenue growth and sector-busting profitability metrics.Not surprisingly, ISRG carries a consensus strong buy. And that’s because, for the long haul, you’re not going to find too many superior technology stocks to buy.Intuit (INTU)Stacks of coins hold up wooden blocks that spell out ""TAX."" FairTaxSource: ShutterstockOn the surface level, tax, and accounting software provider, Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) does not sound like one of the innovative technology stocks to buy. However, I’ve been pounding the table on INTU because of its implications for the gig economy.Essentially, people’s expectations for work changed due to the remote work pivot during the coronavirus pandemic. However, major enterprises started to recall their workers, putting an end to the work-from-home experiment. Of course, the worker bees at large won’t like that. Personally, I believe most will fall in line because the gig worker lifestyle is haphazard unless one is truly talented.Still, many will trade in their suits and ties for whatever work they can find. However, gig workers (better known as independent contractors) must file “business” taxes. Long story short, they’re much more complicated than taxes that employees file. Therefore, Intuit can help, making it quite relevant. Also, a big bonus is that Wall Street analysts rate INTU as a consensus strong buy. You already know my opinion. It’s easily one of the best technology stocks to buy.Rockwell Automation (ROK)Graphic of side view of virtual financial charts with tech aesthetic, symbolizing fintechSource: shutterstock.com/whiteMoccaFrom the unintuitive technology stocks to buy to the easily discernible, Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) deserves extra consideration. As its name suggests, Rockwell specializes in industrial automation solutions. While extraordinarily relevant, ROK suffered some pitfalls last year. However, so far this year, ROK gained over 8%.It’s quite possible that it can rise higher in the charts. According to Grand View Research, the global industrial automation and control systems market size reached a valuation of $172.26 billion. Experts there project that the segment will expand at a 10.5% CAGR to hit revenue of $377.25 billion by 2030. Naturally, Rockwell stands to be a major beneficiary, making it one of the technology stocks to buy.To be fair, it’s not the most discounted trade. However, investors should find encouragement from its decent balance sheet and growth metrics. As well, Rockwell features a net margin of 13.6%, ranking better than most of its peers. Finally, hedge fund sentiment for ROK rates as positive, suggesting you should keep it on your radar.NuScale Power (SMR)A hand in silhouette holds up a phone displaying the logo for Nuscale in front of a display showing the company's website.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comConcluding this list of technology stocks to buy stands one of my favorite subjects to discuss, NuScale Power (NYSE:SMR). A nuclear energy solutions provider, NuScale specializes in small modular reactors (SMRs). While not a brand-new innovation per se, NuScale effectively pioneered the platform’s commercial viability in the U.S. Given the energy crisis that we’re struggling with, SMR will likely rise higher over the next several years.Now, SMRs compel because they essentially represent a decentralized network of small-footprint nuclear facilities. This framework enables NuScale to build nuclear power facilities closer to sources of energy demand. Moreover, SMRs incorporate advanced safety protocols, providing operational assurances to nearby residents.As an aspirational firm, NuScale doesn’t enjoy robust financials. That said, the company has no debt on its books, a rarity for newly public enterprises.While analysts generally carried a leaning-optimistic view of SMR, per TipRanks, no Wall Street expert weighed in on shares in the past three months. However, that might be a good thing for those who prefer under-the-radar technology stocks to buy.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Joining me on today's call are Dave Regnery, Chair and CEO; and Chris Kuehn, Executive Vice President and CFO. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave?David Regnery: Thanks, Zac, and everyone, for joining us on today's call. Let's turn to Slide 3. Before I dive in, I'd like to spend a few minutes on our purpose-driven strategy, which is drives our differentiated financial results and long-term shareholder value. Our strategy is aligned to powerful megatrends, like climate change which has serious and far-reaching effects on the environment, the economy and human health. 2022 was again one of the warmest years on record, and we continue to see extreme weather events. Urgent action is needed to accelerate our transition to a low carbon green economy. That's where Trane Technologies is uniquely positioned to lead. Our innovation is transforming the industry and accelerating decarbonization of commercial buildings, homes and transport.Story continuesWe're helping our customers advance their own sustainability goals. While contributing to our gigaton challenge, a pledge to reduce customers emissions by 1 billion metric tons by 2030. Our purpose driven strategy, relentless innovation and strong customer focus enables us to deliver a superior growth profile, strong margins and powerful free cash flow. The end result is strong value creation across the board, for our team, our customers, our shareholders, and for the planet. Moving to slide 4, our global team delivered strong performance in 2022. As we compare our results to peers and the broader industrials, we're confident organic revenue and adjusted EPS growth will again rank in the top quartile for both the fourth quarter and for the full year.Our global teams have demonstrated resiliency and tenacity navigating persistent inflation, supply chain and a myriad of other macro related challenges globally. They've executed our business operating system which is designed for operational excellence, and delivered record results across virtually all key metrics. Throughout 2022, and building on extraordinary strength in 2021. We are continuing to see our relentless year in year out rain or shine, reinvestment and innovation paid dividends through unprecedented levels of customer demand. While this demand has been broad based, we're seeing particular strengths in our nonresidential businesses led by commercial HVAC, global commercial HVAC, organic bookings were up nearly 40% in 2022 on a two-year stack.Americas commercial HVAC bookings were up more than 40% on a two-year stack. The tremendous growth we've delivered over the past two years has driven absolute bookings to record levels. We continue to encourage investors to look at absolute bookings levels, in addition to growth rates to gain a more complete understanding of the strength of our businesses and our backlog. As an example, our commercial HVAC organic revenues were up more than 20% in the fourth quarter, while organic bookings were higher by about half that level up 11%. Still the book-to-bill was over 105% further adding to already record backlog. Likewise, while enterprise organic revenues were up 16% in the quarter, and organic bookings were flat total book-to-bill was still 100%.Customer demand, absolute bookings and absolute backlog have never been higher. We disclose absolute bookings and revenues each quarter by segment in our earnings release. 2022 bookings of $17.5 billion exceeded 2022 revenues by $1.5 billion for our book-to-bill 109%. Backlog entering 2023 is $7 billion well over 2x historical norms. Further, we expect backlog to remain elevated throughout 2023 and anticipate entering 2024 with backlog in excess of $6 billion. At our guidance midpoint revenue growth rate of 7%, 2023 revenues would be approximately $17.2 billion when compared to bookings of $17.5 billion in 2022, bookings would need to decline by over $1.1 billion in order for backlog to fall to the $6 billion number that I referenced heading into 2024.That would equate to a decline of about $275 million per quarter. For backlog to return to more normal levels of approximately $3 billion, bookings would need to decline by over $4 billion or more than $1 billion per quarter. While we recognize that we have difficult comps in 2023, we have a high degree of confidence that bookings will remain robust, and that we will enter 2024 with backlog of $6 billion or more. Turning to our guidance for 2023. We expect continued strong revenue growth, EPS growth and free cash flow. We have a proven strategy to outperform end markets and our business operating system enables us to deliver consistent strong execution despite challenging macro environments. We have a multiyear track record of delivering differentiated financial performance for shareholders and are well positioned to deliver strong shareholder returns over the long term.Please turn to slide number 5. As I discussed at the outset, I am proud of our global teams for delivering strong performance in 2022 despite persistent macro challenges, we significantly exceeded our revenue and EPS growth targets while delivering solid leverage and free cash flow and returning significant cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. While free cash flow was strong at 91% of adjusted net earnings for the year, we fell short of our target of 100% free cash flow conversion. We drove an exceptional volume of shipments in the month of December in our commercial HVAC and Thermo King businesses to meet customer demand, which shifted the timing of approximately $150 million in receivables into the first quarter 2023.We also invested about $40 million in safety stock inventory in the fourth quarter to ensure continuity of supply in this dynamic environment. Net of these two areas free cash flow would have been 100%. Please turn to slide number 6. One of the most important elements of our long-term strategy is fueling our high-performance Flywheel through relentless investments and innovation to solve our customers most complex problems. Leading customer innovation drives consistent and profitable market our growth, which in turn drives more cash to reinvest back into the business to further accelerate growth. This Flywheel as we refer to it is one of the key differentiators between Trane Technologies and our competition. We are unwavering in our commitment to invest heavily in our business, year after year, in good times and in bad.It's this ongoing focus that has enabled us to drive differentiated financial performance for shareholders over time. Over the past five years, including the pandemic in 2020, we delivered a 7% revenue compound annual growth rate, 250 basis points of margin expansion and free cash flow conversion well in excess of 100% and since 2017, we've deployed more than $13 billion in capital, with $8.3 billion return to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Looking forward, you can expect us to continue to consistently reinvest in our business. And we'll talk later in the presentation about some of the ways in which we are accelerating investments in 2023, leveraging the strong outlook we see entering the year. Overall, we are exceptionally well positioned to continue our strong track record of performance and capital deployment over the long term.Please turn to slide number 7. As I discussed earlier in the presentation, customer demand for innovative products and services is at record levels, with particular strength in our nonresidential businesses, which comprise approximately 80% of our portfolio. Americas commercial HVAC was again a standout with low teens bookings growth and mid-teens revenue growth, including another quarter of high single digit services revenue growth. Bookings were up nearly 40% on a two-year stack, resulting in high absolute dollar bookings. And a book-to-bill ratio of over 110%, backlog continued to grow from an already high base and is now at levels that are 3x historical norms further adding to our visibility and confidence in our guidance for 2023. In residential, bookings continue to normalize, and we're down mid 20s in the quarter.The decline was expected against a very high prior year comp, as two year stock bookings were still up double digits. Residential revenues were up low single digits in the quarter and sell-through is up mid-single digits reflecting healthy end market demand. We continue to have historically high backlog in our residential business. And in the fourth quarter we work closely with our Independent Wholesale Distributors or IWDS to help them manage their inventory positions and mix as they entered 2023. Our goal was to mitigate the risk of stranded inventory across the channel. I'm pleased with the approach we took and the partnership with our channel. We believe our IWDS are in a good inventory position, entering 2023 as a result. Our America Thermo King business had another very strong quarter with 30% revenue growth.This follows growth of more than 60% in Q3. We've included our traditional transport refrigeration market overview slide near the back of the presentation, which shows the strong share gains for our Thermo King businesses globally in 2021 and 2022. Bookings were down modestly as expected, but still up more than 40% on a two-year stack. Backlog in this business remains at historically high levels, providing good visibility into future revenues. Overall, Americas backlog is unprecedented at 3x historical levels. Turning to EMEA, results in the quarter were also very strong. In our commercial HVAC business, we've highlighted acute supply chain challenges that have been impacting revenues and more importantly leveraged throughout 2022. We were able to overcome many of these challenges in the fourth quarter and delivered revenue growth in excess of 40% with strong leverage.Services growth was once again robust up double digits. Bookings were also robust up low teens with two-year stack bookings up more than 20%. We're seeing tremendous demand for Thermal management systems which are three to four times more efficient than conventional heating and cooling. Our transport refrigeration business in EMEA also delivers strong performance with low single digits organic revenue growth in the quarter in a market that was down double digits. We discussed the transport refrigeration business in detail on slide 16 of the presentation. Overall EMEA backlog remains elevated 40% higher than historical norms. Turning to Asia Pacific, the commercial HVAC team delivered another very strong quarter in Q4 with revenues up more than 20%.And services up mid-teens. Asia bookings were down as expected related to tough prior year comps and large bookings in the high-tech sector outside of China. Two-year stack bookings were still up high teens. China was resilient in the quarter with bookings up high single digits and revenue up double digits. Overall, Asia backlog remains elevated approximately 50% above historical norms. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Chris. Chris?Christopher Kuehn: Thanks, Dave. Please turn to slide number 8. This slide does a nice job encompassing our overall performance in the quarter, which was strong across the board. Organic revenues were up 16%, adjusted EBITDA margins were up 100 basis points and adjusted EPS was up 34% versus prior year. We delivered strong organic enterprise growth in both equipment and services of high teens and low teens respectively. Services growth was consistently strong throughout 2022. And our services mix is approximately 32% of enterprise revenues. Strong services mix bolsters the company's resiliency in virtually all market conditions. Please turn to slide number 9 to discuss the key revenue dynamics for the quarter. So I'll focus my comments on margins.Technology, Ventilation, Air conditioning Photo by Immo Wegmann on UnsplashWe delivered strong margin expansion in each of our business segments. The key margin drivers are the same for each of our businesses. So we've consolidated the highlights on the right side of the page, robust volume growth, positive price realization, and modestly positive productivity more than offset persistent material and other inflation in the quarter. We also leverage strong margin expansion across the businesses to accelerate investments in innovation across a number of key initiatives. As mentioned previously, we are pleased with the significant progress we've made over the past two quarters, mitigating acute supply chain challenges in our EMEA businesses, which led to strong volume growth coupled with significant margin expansion in the quarter.Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave?David Regnery: Thanks, Chris. Please turn to slide number 10. As we discussed throughout the call, underlying demand for innovative products and services has never been higher, with historically high levels of bookings and backlog across our businesses. Relentless innovation, leading brands with strong market positions, customer focus and operational excellence are hallmarks of our market out growth over time. In the Americas, our commercial HVAC business is driving strong demand and share gains as demonstrated by our full year 2022 order growth that is more than 40% on a two-year stack. And we've exited the fourth quarter with elevated backlog that is 3x historical norms, providing us significant visibility into future revenues.The nonresidential markets remain strong and we are bullish on the outlook for commercial HVAC. Demand continues to be robust in datacenters, education, healthcare, and the high-tech industrial verticals, where we have strong customer relationships and market positions. Our commercial HVAC business is underpinned by long term secular tailwinds of energy efficiency, decarbonization and indoor environmental quality which are only growing stronger. We also see tailwinds from new and ongoing regulatory and policy related drivers such as the Inflation Reduction Act, Education, Stimulus, and the CHIPS and Science Act. Our commercial HVAC business is well positioned as the premier franchise to capitalize on the significant market opportunities that lie ahead.The residential market outlook remains dynamic. Near term we see the market continuing to normalize across bookings and revenue and the process is well underway. As we saw in the third and fourth quarters. For 2023, we believe this normalization process results in market units likely down in the mid-single digit range. With tailwinds from elevated backlog, pricing, supportive regulatory and policy initiatives and share gains, we believe our revenues will be relatively flat. Our guidance encompasses scenarios for residential in the plus or minus low single digits range. We don't see a cliff scenario and residential is about 20% of our business. So a 10% decline would present a 2% headwind to the enterprise. Longer term, we continue to see residential as a GDP plus business for us.Turning to Americas transport refrigeration, our diversified portfolio of products and aftermarket significantly outperform the end markets in 2021 and 2022. Act is calling for low single digit growth in trailer in 2023. And for weighted average transport refrigeration growth to be flattish. Consistent with our strong track record, we expect to outperform the end markets in 2023. Longer term, we continue to see transport refrigeration as a GDP plus, plus business. We'll talk more about the transport refrigeration outlook in our topics of interest section. Turning to EMEA, commercial HVAC, the market growth picture remains muted with macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges weighing. Given our innovative and leading sustainability solutions, we've been able to significantly outgrow the EMEA HVAC markets over a long period of time.We see continued opportunities for market out growth going forward, aided by thermal management systems, which are three to four times more efficient than traditional heating and cooling solutions and are gaining momentum in the market. Turning to EMEA transport refrigeration, the removal of the Russian market was a key driver of the market decline in 2022. Thermo King EMEA outgrew the end markets up high single digits for the year. As return to 2023, we expect the market to be down low single digits to mid-single digits, mainly related to economic uncertainty in the region. Our innovative products and solutions continue to provide us with strong platform to outgrow our end markets, which we expect to do again in 2023. Turning to Asia, the environment remains dynamic and COVID continues to add complexity and unpredictability to the market forecasts.We see continued strength in datacenter, electronics, pharmaceutical, and healthcare verticals. And if these markets continue to perform well, we could continue to see relatively stable growth in 2023. Asia continues to be one of the more dynamic markets. So we're cautiously optimistic on this segment, which represents about 10% of our portfolio. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Chris. Chris?Christopher Kuehn: Thanks, Dave. Please turn to slide number 11. Dave provided a good framework for how we're looking at our key end markets for 2023 and our guidance reflects these views. Embedded in our guidance is our philosophy around our value creation Flywheel, which builds in high levels of business reinvestment in innovation out growth across our end markets, and strong leverage. Regarding 2023, to 6% to 8%, organic revenue growth, and $8.20 to $8.50 in adjusted earnings per share, or approximately 11% to 15% EPS growth. Through the back half of last year, we talked about ending 2022 with $6 billion or more in backlog. And we're sitting at a record level of $7 billion as of the beginning of 2023. This gives us good visibility into 2023 revenues.We have approximately 1% of growth from M&amp;A in 2023 from bolt-on acquisitions completed in 2022. And we expect FX to be neutral on a full year basis. We're targeting organic leverage of 25% plus for the year. There are a few key factors that play into our organic leverage target. So I'll spend a couple of minutes covering these factors to help frame the guidance. First, we're expecting modest incremental price and solid volumes to offset material and other inflation and drive strong incremental margins. Second, while we're expecting slow and steady improvement in a supply chain, as we've seen throughout 2022, we're not expecting it to be fully normalized until well into 2023 at the earliest. This will continue to put pressure on the realization of strong productivity, which is where our business operating system really thrives.Third, the environment around prices for Tier 1 metals remains dynamic. In the third quarter and early part of the fourth quarter last year, we saw a deflationary trend for base metal prices. However, pricing has increased over the last two months on copper, aluminum and steel, negating much of the potential deflationary benefit in 2023. To update you in a question from our earnings call last quarter, our Tier 1 spend on these metals is approximately $750 million split roughly a third each for copper, aluminum and steel. We are seeing modest deflation in freight and logistics costs. We're also seeing inflation from Tier 2 suppliers, as they incur higher than normal wage increases and energy costs. Net we're not baking in significant inflation or deflation into our guidance at this early stage in the year.Fourth, we're using the favorable environment we see in 2023 as an opportunity to double down on key investments across the business in advanced manufacturing and automation, digital and electrification platforms, among other key programs. We are targeting 20 to 30 basis points of incremental spend across these areas, which will be embedded in a segment P&amp;L. This is above and beyond our average incremental spend of approximately 40 basis points per year. So we're targeting 60 to 70 basis points of incremental spend in total. We've highlighted that business reinvestment is how we win over the long term. And we're confident we can make these investments in 2023 while hitting our guidance range. We have additional investments earmarked in our corporate and CapEx guidance as well.Lastly, while our M&amp;A transactions I referenced earlier will have a strong payout over the next several years, they will add about 1% to our revenue at approximately 3% leverage in the first year, inclusive of integration costs. The net effect cuts about two percentage points off of our enterprise reported leverage versus our organic leverage that excludes M&amp;A. It's not a huge amount, but it's something we wanted to highlight as a factor to consider in our guidance, as organic leverage will be stronger than reported leverage simply on the math related to M&amp;A. We'll highlight organic leverage each quarter to provide transparency. Turning to cash, we expect 2023 to be a strong cash collection year, we have about $150 million in receivables that shifted from December into early Q1.And barring persistent supply chain issues all year, which we do not anticipate, we expect to bring working capital levels down specifically around inventory. Net free cash flow conversion should be 100% or better. Please go to slide number 12. We remain on track to deliver $300 million of run rate savings from business transformation, including an incremental $60 million in 2023. We continue to invest these cost savings into high ROI projects to further fuel innovation and other investments across the portfolio. And I discussed a number of targeted investments for 2023. To be clear, our continuous improvement mindset is an integral part of our business operating system and continues well beyond the transformation program that we started in 2020 when we launched Trane technologies, our business operating system is designed to drive gross productivity each year to offset other inflation.While it's been impossible to realize that level of gross productivity over the past three years, given the tumultuous macroeconomic backdrop, productivity has been improving as supply chain slowly recover and is contributing to our 25% plus organic leverage target in 2023. Please go to slide number 13. We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy focused on consistently deploying excess cash opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. First, we continue to strengthen our core business through relentless business reinvestment. Second, we're committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve. Third, we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time.Our balanced approach includes strategic M&amp;A that further improves long term shareholder returns, and share repurchases as the stock trades below our calculated intrinsic value. Please turn to slide number 14. And I'll provide an update on our capital deployment in 2022 and our outlook for 2023. In 2022, we executed strong and balanced capital allocation of $2.1 billion, including approximately $1.2 billion to share repurchases, $620 million to dividends, and approximately $250 million to M&amp;A. We are targeting $2.5 billion in capital deployment in 2023, and expect to deploy 100% of excess cash over time. Our M&amp;A pipeline remains active and we continue to exercise discipline in our approach. Our shares remain attractive trading below our calculated intrinsic value, and we have approximately $3.2 billion remaining under current share repurchase authorizations.Our strong free cash, flow liquidity and balance sheet, continue to give us excellent capital allocation optionality and dry powder moving forward. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave?David Regnery: Thanks, Chris. Please turn to slide number 16, our Thermo King businesses have significantly outperform their end markets in both 2021 and 2022 as illustrated on the table on the right-hand side of the page. In 2022, the North America transport refrigeration markets were up 12% while Thermo King Americas was up more than 20% The EMEA transport refrigeration markets were down 9% in 2022 while Thermo King EMEA was up high single digits. We are very pleased with the share gains we've achieved over the past two years. In 2023, we expect the markets to be flat to modestly down and for Thermo King to once again outperform consistent with our strong track record. We also added additional information to the slide this quarter to help investors and analysts gain a better understanding of the size of the businesses.We've included a footnote that global Thermo King has approximately 50% of our enterprise revenue and the split between the Thermo King segments is roughly 60%, Americas 35%, EMEA and 5% Asia. Please turn to slide number 17, Act has updated their long term forecast for refrigerated trailers through 2027. The data supports the view we've been highlighting for some time. Now that this is a mid-40,000-unit market plus or minus about 10%. The chart plots the actual and forecast but the key takeaways is that the market is expected to be flat at 45,000 units in 2023. Dip to 40,000 units in 2024 rebound back to 45,000 units in 2025. And to continue growing low single digits from that point forward to 2027. Additionally, our transport refrigeration businesses are a diversified portfolio with a healthy aftermarket business.We have strong positions in large and small trucks, APUS, bus, air, and rail and a proven track record to outperform the transport refrigeration markets. We believe this is a GDP plus, plus business for us over the long term. Please go to slide number 18. In summary, we are positioned to outperform consistently, energy efficiency, decarbonization and sustainability mega trends continue to intensify, driving increased demand for innovative products and services. We are delivering leading technologies and innovation to address these trends and accelerate the world's progress underpinned by our engaging uplifting culture. The strength of our business operating system, the power of our global team, unprecedented backlog and continued high levels of customer demand, give us confidence in our full year revenue and EPS guidance.We believe we have the right strategy, the best team and a solid foundation in place to deliver strong performance in 2023 and differentiated shareholder returns over the long term. And now, we'd be happy to take your questions.

With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Peter.Peter Vanacker: Thank you, David, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results. Let's begin with our safety results on Slide number 3. LyondellBasell's employees and contractors delivered an outstanding safety performance during 2022. Injury rates at our company have consistently been among the lowest for our industry. But last year, we reduced the rate of injuries across our global workforce by roughly to 0.12 injuries per 200,000 hours worked. At our Bayport complex outside of Houston, our team finished 2022 with over 6 million consecutive safe work hours, a new company record. Simply put, a consistent focus on safe work is embedded in our company's DNA and provides a solid foundation for extending that shared focus across other dimensions of the company's culture.Let's now turn to Slide number 4 to discuss our financial results. 2022 was a very challenging year characterized by a war in Ukraine, evolving responses to the COVID pandemic, energy volatility, inflation and rapidly changing monetary policies. At LyondellBasell, our portfolio of businesses continued to provide value for our global customers with products and solutions that are essential for modern society. In '22, LyondellBasell delivered earnings of $12.46 per share with EBITDA of $6.5 billion. Cash generation was exceptional and resulted in $6.1 billion of cash from operations; second only to our 2021 results. We ended the year with $6 billion of liquidity supported by a strong investment rate balance sheet. Interim invested capital was 16%, far exceeding our cost of capital.In addition to our focus on safety, we are sharpening our strategic focus to maximize value for our customers, shareholders and society under a range of scenarios. On Slide number 5, we outlined our progress on delivering value from this strategy over the past year. Our leadership in cost management and operational excellence enabled LyondellBasell to hold fixed costs well below inflation, and quickly adjust operating rates in response to evolving market conditions. Our diverse global business portfolio provided outstanding cash generation during a challenging year. And at the same time, we positioned the portfolio for changing times with decisions to exit refining and sell our Australian polypropylene business. We established a new business unit, focused on establishing leadership in providing circular and low-carbon solutions for our customers.And we are advancing our supply chains, production capacity and sustainable assets to serve rapidly growing markets for these circular and low-carbon products. Last quarter, we announced our increased focus on capturing value as we continue to manage costs. We expect our value enhancement program will generate at least $750 million in recurring annual EBITDA by the end of 2025. Our increased focus helped drive a improvement in cash conversion in 2022. That further bolstered our capital structure and supported generous shareholder returns. On Slide number 6, I would like to highlight our recent decisions to accelerate progress on our climate targets and create more value by doing so. In order to meet the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, climate scientists believe that global warming should be limited to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.In December, we announced our decision to increase LyondellBasell's 2030 targets for reducing scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions to 42% and established a new Scope 3 emission reduction target of 30% relative to 2020 levels. Targets are now aligned with the science-based guidance and the 1.5 degree Celsius scenario. In addition, as we continue to make progress in sourcing, favorably priced renewable electricity, we have increased our 2030 goal to procure at least 75% of our global power generation needs from renewable and low-carbon sources. Earlier this week, we announced our first 2 renewable power purchase agreements in Europe and 2 additional agreements in the United States. Altogether, we now have 8 agreements in place for 930 megawatts of renewable power capacity, which represents roughly 1/3 of our global needs.These agreements will prevent nearly 1 million tons of annual greenhouse gas emissions. All of this work supports our goal to become net zero in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2050. At the same time, we continued to build global businesses that will sell at least 2 million tons of recycled and renewable base polymers by 2030. On Slide number 7, let's take a look at how we are building our Circle brands of recycled and renewable base polymers. During the fourth quarter, we announced progress in developing 4 new plastic waste sorting and recycling facilities in Houston, Germany, India and China. These facilities provide a strong foundation for a robust global supply chain for plastic grade feedstocks. And with our 3 product platforms, CirculenRecover for mechanical recycling, CirculenRevive for advanced recycling, and CirculenRenew for renewable-based feedstocks, LyondellBasell will be able to match feedstocks and products with the highest value solutions for our customers.The combination of our focus, detail, technologies and global platforms provides LyondellBasell with powerful advantages to build the world's leading circular and low-carbon Solutions business. Now with that, I will turn the call over to Michael first, and then to each of our business leaders who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail.Michael McMurray: Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8, and let me begin by highlighting our excellent cash generation from our business portfolio during 2022. LyondellBasell generated a total of $6.1 billion of cash from operating activities over the past year. Our cash on hand increased to $2.2 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. During 2022, we achieved cash conversion of 96%, 13 percentage points higher than our 2021 cash conversion. In the fourth quarter, cash conversion reached an outstanding rate of 203%. This efficient and robust cash generation allowed the company to return a total of $3.7 billion to LyondellBasell shareholders in 2022. Let's continue with Slide 9 and review the details of our capital allocation over the past year.Our approach remains focused on disciplined capital allocation and strong returns for our shareholders. During 2022, cash from operating activities fully funded dividends, share repurchases and capital expenditures. We returned approximately 60% of the cash from operating activities to shareholders. This included $3.2 billion in quarterly and special dividends and $420 million in share repurchases. In May, we increased our quarterly dividend by 5%. This represents our 12th consecutive year of annual dividend growth. We continue to invest in maintenance and growth projects with $1.9 billion in capital expenditures. A significant portion of this capital funded the final stages of construction of our world-scale PO/TBA plant. Startup activities remain on track for the end of this quarter.Our transformation of is working across our company to rigorously manage and track the progress of our value enhancement program. We look forward to sharing the progress of this program at our Capital Markets Day in March. Now I'd like to provide an overview of the quarterly results for each of our segments on Slide 10. LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered $865 million of EBITDA during the fourth quarter. Our results reflected margins stabilizing at the low levels seen towards the end of the third quarter. Moderating energy and feedstock costs provided modest offsets for compressed margins in our olefins and polyolefins businesses. Overall, OMP demand remained low, particularly in Europe and China. Intermediates and Derivatives results sequentially declined on lower volumes due to the quarterly timing of oxyfuel vessel shipments.Margins at our oxyfuels and refining businesses remained above historical averages as demand for fuels remained strong due to increasing global mobility. High cost for utilities and raw materials coupled with low seasonal demand negatively impacted our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. Across the portfolio, a noncash LIFO inventory valuation charge impacts pretax fourth quarter results by approximately $90 million. Fourth quarter LIFO charges were approximately $15 million for O&amp;P Americas segment, $50 million for the O&amp;P segment each for the intermediates and derivatives in APS segments, $15 million for the Technology segment and a $40 million benefit for the refining segment. As a reminder, volatility in natural gas prices impacts our cost for not only gas, but also steam and electricity.We estimate that a $1 per million BTU change in the price of natural gas impacts the energy cost of our directly operated assets by approximately $175 million per year across the company with 80% of this impact in North America and 20% in Europe. These estimates do not include the impact of gas price on feedstock cost. Before I turn the call over to Ken and then to each of our business leaders, who will describe our segment results in more detail, let me address some of your annual modeling questions for 2023 on Slide 11. As our new world-scale PO/TBA plant ramps up, we expect to produce and sell about half of the asset's nameplate capacity in 2023. We remain confident that our value enhancement program can achieve recurring annual EBITDA of $150 million by the end of 2023 through the execution of about 1,000 projects.Chemistry, Industry, LaboratoryPhoto by Trnava University on UnsplashIn order to achieve this benefit, we expect to incur a similar amount of onetime capital and operational cost of about $150 million, with the majority of these costs allocated to capital. Major planned maintenance for 2023 included a turnaround at one of our Midwest ethylene crackers in the O&amp;P Americas segment, turnarounds at our acetyls assets and 3 propylene oxide plant turnarounds within our I&amp;D segment. Based on expected volumes and margins, we estimate that lost production associated with all of this maintenance downtime will impact 2023 EBITDA and by approximately $290 million. While routine maintenance costs are expensed, maintenance costs arising from turnarounds of major production units are capitalized and included in our capital expenditure forecast.During the fourth quarter, we recognized costs related to the exit from our refining business, which impacted EBITDA by $73 million. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect the business will incur similar EBITDA impacts during each quarter of 2023. We will also recognize about $55 million each quarter for depreciation charges to reflect cost accrued for asset decommissioning that will be incurred after the asset shuts down. We expect that our capital expenditures will decline by about $300 million to approximately $1.6 billion this year with the completion of the PO/TBA plant and disciplined spend resulting from the current business environment. Approximately $500 million of CapEx is targeted towards profit-generating growth projects with the remaining balance supporting sustaining maintenance.We expect that this year's capital requirements for the value enhancement program will be funded within our $1.6 billion CapEx budget. Other financial metrics worth noting include net interest expense, depreciation and amortization, pension related estimates and tax rates. We expect 2023 net interest expense will be approximately $405 million. Depreciation and amortization charges for 2023 are expected to be $1.4 billion, which includes the of additional refinery depreciation charges related to asset decommissioning. We plan to make regular pension contributions in 2023, totaling about $65 million with approximately $105 million of pension expense for the year. We expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 20% and our cash tax rate will be lower than our ETR.With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Ken?Kenneth Lane: Thank you, Michael. Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 12 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment. Fourth quarter O&amp;P Americas EBITDA was $359 million. Prices and margins stabilized at the low levels we saw at the end of the third quarter. Market demand declined, and we also saw customer destocking during the quarter. That, combined with new polymer capacity resulted in well-supplied markets. We operated our assets at approximately 75% of nameplate capacity to match the reduced market demand and manage working capital. During January, we have seen modest improvements in domestic and export demand. Normalization of logistics constraints have facilitated increased export volumes.Also, moderating feedstock and energy costs are providing some margin tailwinds. As a result, we expect to operate our O&amp;P Americas asset at an average of approximately 80% during the first quarter. Looking back at 2022, I want to highlight our progress on developing our Circulen business. We have established projects for classic waste sorting facilities that will be used to provide feedstock for our circular recover and certain the Revive product lines. We are also moving phoned our usage of olefins feedstocks produced from renewable sources such as used cooking oil. During 2022, we processed 15,000 tons of renewable feedstocks at our Channelview, Texas cracker, to produce ethylene, propylene and ultimately, polyethylene and polypropylene that we sold to customers at premium prices under our Circular brand.Last year, 4 of our U.S. manufacturing sites attained the ISCC Plus certification for certain grades of polyethylene and polypropylene. This enables LyondellBasell to offer customers mass balance certificates for these products and serve the market's rapidly growing demand. We are delivering these new circular new products to our customers and proving that polymers can be more sustainable and used in any application where virgin polymer is used. Now please turn to Slide 13 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins, Europe, Asia and International segment. In Europe, macroeconomic pressures were exacerbated by high inflation and energy costs that curtailed operations at our customers and pressured consumer demand. LyondellBasell operated our O&amp;P assets at rates of approximately 60% during the fourth quarter.LIFO inventory charges were $50 million during the quarter. All of this combined to result in a fourth quarter EBITDA loss of $152 million. European energy costs have considerably moderated in January, and demand is showing some signs of improvement over the extremely low level seen in December. We have completed repairs and we started our integrated cracker in France at the end of 2022 and expect to operate our European assets at a rate of 80% during the first quarter. As in the Americas, we continue to focus on long-term strategies to support our Circulen and Low Carbon Solutions business in Europe and Asia. During October, we announced new partnerships for plastic waste sorting facilities in Germany and China, and a fully automated mechanical recycling facility in India.These partnerships will allow us to swiftly develop fit-for-purpose plants in each region to supply feedstocks for our circular products has served a rapidly growing market for circular solutions. In November, we announced our decision to move forward with engineering to build our first commercial scale advanced recycling plant in Germany. This plant will utilize LyondellBasell's proprietary MoReTec technology to convert plastic waste from our waste sorting facility into pyrolysis oil that can be used as a feedstock to produce new plastic resins in a circular process. We are moving rapidly to build circular and low-carbon solutions for our industry at an unmatched scale. With that, I will turn the call over to Kim.Kimberly Foley: Thank you, Ken. Please turn to Slide 14 as we take a look at our intermediates and Derivatives segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $291 million. Styrene margins improved due to lower feedstock costs. Oxyfuel margins remained well above historical fourth quarter averages. Oxyfuel volumes declined as the timing of the vessel sailings resulted in unusually high third quarter volumes. We operated our assets at rates of approximately 75%. Our propylene oxide and styrene joint venture in the Netherlands is expected to restart this month after 3 months of downtime in response to volatile European energy costs and lower demand. We look forward to initial volumes from the new PO/TBA asset in Houston by the end of the quarter.We plan to operate our assets across the IND segment at approximately 80% in the first quarter. In January, we are encouraged by unseasonably strong oxyfuel margins with low butane feedstock costs and strong oxyfuel blend premiums. We expect relatively stable margins for the segment for the first quarter. We developed multiyear maintenance schedules to ensure that our plants can safely and reliably serve our customers. As it works out, 2023 will be a heavy year for maintenance across several of our PO/TBA assets. Maintenance is scheduled for 2 of our 3 PO/TBA plants at our Bayport, Texas facility in the second and fourth quarters. Our PO/TBA facility in the Netherlands will also undergo maintenance from September through November. We expect the ramp-up in volumes of our new plant will be partially offset by loss production from this planned maintenance.Nonetheless, the incremental 2023 PO and TBA volumes should be sufficient to capture typical market growth. In 2024, we expect less scheduled maintenance and the full year of production from our new assets will provide additional volumes to serve market growth. Now let's turn to Slide 15 and discuss the results of the Refining segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA included a LIFO inventory valuation benefit of approximately $40 million. Results increased on higher margins and slightly higher volumes following the third of the planned maintenances, offset by the disruptions of the December freeze. In the fourth quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread modestly increased to $48 per barrel, remaining well above historical averages. Despite unplanned downtime, we operated the refinery at 85% of capacity with an average crude rate of 229,000 barrels per day.In January, the Maya 2-1-1 spreads have also been unseasonally strong at more than $50 per barrel, driven by strong discounts for heavy crudes. We expect to operate the refinery at approximately 85% of capacity in the first quarter. Finally, I would like to recognize our team at the refinery for finishing the year with 0 recordable injuries in 2022. This is the first time such a record has been achieved in the 104-year history of this facility. Our team is dedicated to safely and reliably operating these assets until we exit the business. With that, I will turn it over to Torkel.Torkel Rhenman: Thank you, Kim. Now let's review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 16. Fourth quarter EBITDA declined to $3 million. Margins remain pressured by feedstock and energy costs as well as the $25 million noncash LIFO inventory valuation charge. Volumes fell on lower seasonal demand exacerbated by high power prices that impacted our European customers' businesses. In the fourth quarter, we embarked on a journey to transform the APS segment. Our goal is to sharpen our focus on customer service and product development to maximize value for our customers and for LyondellBasell. With increased autonomy and accountability, we are developing a more agile operating model with meaningful media and segment growth strategies.As part of this transformation, the Catalloy and polybutene businesses will be moved from APS and reintegrated into the O&amp;P segment beginning January 1, 2023. This move will allow the APS team to sharpen their focus on the compounding business, distinct from the Polymer business of Cattaloy and polybutene, which serves our O&amp;P value chain. From a portfolio point of view, we estimate APS will shift approximately $200 million of annual EBITDA between O&amp;P Americas and O&amp;P EAI segments very equally. We plan to provide additional information regarding the impact of this change in March. I strongly believe that our APS platform has a lot of potential and I look forward to reporting on our team's progress in delivering on this transformation during our Capital Markets Day in March.With that, I will return the call back to Peter.Peter Vanacker: Thank you, Torkel. And to the entire LyondellBasell team, thank you again for all the hard work in delivering strong results during a challenging year. To close out on the segments, let's turn to Slide 17 and discuss the results for our technology business on behalf of Jim Seward. During the fourth quarter, reduced global polyolefin industry operating rates resulted in lower catalyst volumes, licensing revenue moderated due to the timing of milestones for revenue recognition. We estimate that the first quarter results for the Technology segment will be similar to fourth quarter 2022 as catalyst volumes improve, offset by moderating licensing revenue. Our technology team is hard at work advancing engineering on LyondellBasell's first commercial advanced recycling plant.This plant will leverage on proprietary MoReTec technology to extract sale from most consumer mixed plastic waste by closing the loop and producing feedstocks for our Italian crackers. Our technology provides distinct advantages by reducing energy consumption, improving yields through innovative process designs and catalysis. Let me now summarize our results and first quarter outlook with Slide 18. Despite highly targets, our team is capturing value and moving forward on our strategic priorities. Most importantly, we are sharpening our focus on leveraging the scale of our clear portfolio to deliver resilient results. We remain focused on LyondellBasell's core values. Last year's outstanding safety performance speaks to the depth with which safety is ingrained in our corporate culture.Our goal is to expand our core petro foundations to encompass a more comprehensive passion for value creation. This week, we welcomed Trisha Conley to our Executive Committee as Executive Vice President, People and Culture. Trisha will play a pivotal role in leading LyondellBasell's vision and strategy to enhance the employee experience, elevate our organizational performance and create the best and most inspiring culture in our industry. In 2022, our businesses were pressured by the effects of the war, volatile energy costs emergence from the pandemic and monetary policy. We responded by matching our reduction with changing demand, leveraging our global business portfolio and maximizing cash generation. Over the past year, our businesses generated over $6 billion of cash from operations and returned $3.7 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases.Lander focus and commitment to shareholder returns remains strong. The more annuity formed circular and carbon solutions business, we are laser-focused on meeting the needs of our customers, brand owners and society. Our decarbonization goals are now aligned with science-based guidance, and we have made substantial progress towards our 2030 goal to procure 75% of our electricity from renewable and low-carbon sources. The Circular and Low Carbon Solutions business is well positioned to address the challenges of sustainability and plastic waste. By building an end-to-end business with robust supply chains, proprietary technology for transforming materials and our global manufacturing and marketing network, we're confident that we can build a large-scale and valuable leadership position in this exciting and expanding market.And our focus on sustainability is gaining recognition. In December, we were honored to be awarded the EcoVadis Gold Medal for sustainability performance with a 91st percentile ranking. The EcoVadis platform is valued by procurement professionals for assisting in the identification and evaluation of sustainable supply solutions. We expect modest improvements in the first quarter from moderating energy and feedstock costs, stable demand and the absence of fourth quarter life for charges. Normalizing supply chains or enabling improved trade flows from our advantaged feedstock positions in North America and the Middle East. Nonetheless, we will continue to maintain focus and discipline to ensure that operating rates across our global portfolio are matched to market conditions.As the year progresses, we anticipate seasonal demand improvements during the second and third quarter. And we're keeping a close eye on China's emergence from Covet and potential benefits from increased economic activity during the second half of 2023. The most exciting challenge during my first 8 months as the CEO of LyondellBasell has been the process of identifying and building a compelling strategy that generates substantial value for our customers, suppliers, employees, communities and shareholders over the next decade. We've shared some initial decisions with you already, but much more is ahead. As you will have recognized, we have waited until the Capital Markets Day, but started moving ahead with great focus and speed in the right direction.On Slide 19, we ask that you save the date for March 14, when we will share more details on our forward strategy at our Capital Markets Day in New York, and we hope that you can all join us virtually or in person. We are now pleased to take your questions.See also 10 Hot Healthcare Stocks To Buy Now and Michael Burry Stock Portfolio: 10 Stocks He Sold .To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

In turn, they follow your lead, purchase en masse, and the price of your shares rises with demand. Short-term volatility will remain for those who take this approach now. But market cyclicality will do its magic and markets will again rise. That premise makes these undervalued stocks notable.  MELIMercadoLibre$1,211.13UNHUnitedHealth$469.17CTSHCognizant Technology$70.03GLNGGolar LNG$23.00GTGoodyear Tire$11.66REGNRegeneron$749.53FANGDiamondback Energy$137.92MercadoLibre (MELI)A miniature shopping cart is filled with cardboard boxes.Source: William Potter / Shutterstock.comOne of the top most undervalued stocks to buy is MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI). The company operates a leading e-commerce platform in Latin America. It also operates in 18 countries in the region and offers a wide range of products and services, including online retail, and online financial services.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMercadoLibre has experienced strong growth in recent years thanks to the rapid expansion of e-commerce in the region. The stock continues to get more attention these days due to its increasing market share which has brought its price higher. I’d argue that it remains undervalued even though it isn’t far from its target price after jumping from $826 on Jan. 2 to $1,215 on Jan. 27. MELI stock is one of few e-commerce giants providing reliable returns.  UnitedHealth (UNH) Nurse holding a tablet with icons representing different aspects of healthcare and healthcare data representing CANO stock.Source: metamorworks / ShutterstockNext up on this list of undervalued stocks to buy is UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH).  After doing my due diligence, it’s clear UNH is undervalued relative to its sector peers. In addition, UnitedHealth’s ROE is currently the highest it’s been over the last 10 years, at 26.94. In short, if you purchase UNH stock, anticipate that the company will turn your investment into bottom-line net income. Story continuesFurther, the company excels at creating value through the efficient use of capital. The method of measuring this is by comparing the weighted average cost of capital, WACC, against the return on invested capital, or ROIC. A higher ROIC than the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is referred to as value creation as the capital return is greater than the cost. UnitedHealth’s ROIC is about 3% greater than its WACC. Cognizant Technology (CTSH)Cognizant Technology Solutions logo on a corporate buildingSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comCognizant Technology (NASDAQ:CTSH) is another one of the top undervalued stocks to buy. Cognizant Technology Solutions is a global professional services company that provides digital, technology, consulting, and operations services to businesses and organizations with a strong presence in industries such as healthcare, financial services, and manufacturing. Its return on invested capital of 16.56% over the trailing 12 months exceeds its weighted average cost of capital of 9.37% over the same period(1). The same is true of its return on equity which is better than 85% of its industry peers. We can take it a step further and consider the company’s current P/E ratio of 14.42. It’s well below the firm’s 10-year median P/E ratio of 22.04. Golar LNG (GLNG) Aerial drone photo of LNG (Liquified Natural Gas) tanker anchored in small LNG industrial islet of Revithoussa equipped with tanks for storage, Salamina, Greece.Source: Aerial-motion / Shutterstock.comGolar LNG (NYSE:GLNG) operates a fleet of LNG carriers and floating storage regasification units, which are used to transport and regasify LNG for delivery to customers around the world.Golar LNG is headquartered in Bermuda and has operations in various countries including the United Kingdom, Singapore, Brazil, and Norway. That geographically disparate operational footprint allows the company to strategically supply its partners in a geopolitically tense world. The company’s business model is based on long-term, fixed-rate charters, which provide a steady stream of revenue and further serve to help to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in the LNG market.Wall Street currently rates GLNG stock as a unanimous buy with roughly 50% upside. In terms of traditional value metrics, Golar LNG benefits from a very low P/E ratio of 3.48, lower than 83% of the oil &amp; gas industry. GLNG stock is currently cheap and it’s also a reasonable hedge against volatility due to its business model. Goodyear Tire (GT)Sign for Goodyear (GT) tire shop. The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company is an American tire manufacturing company.Source: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.comMy colleague Joel Baglole recently commented on Goodyear Tire’s (NASDAQ:GT) horrific performance over the last five years, pointing out the fact that it has lost 70% of its value in the period. He noted that Goodyear, despite being a household name in the U.S., has struggled with competition and a particularly tough 2022 in which prices fell off a cliff on high commodity prices and a strong dollar that weakened the impact of foreign sales when remunerated to its U.S. headquarters as dollars. Perhaps most importantly, though, is the notion that Goodyear is letting it be known that it is lessening its reliance on rubber. The company unveiled a tire made with 90% sustainable materials at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES). If the company can get media outlets on board with the idea that it is turning a page and becoming greener, investor capital could logically get behind the company again. At such low prices, it’s easy to see why GT stock is currently one to consider. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) The Regeneron (REGN) website is displayed on a smartphone screen over a blue background.Source: madamF / Shutterstock.comRegeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) stock price is highly dependent on the sales level of its current portfolio of drugs. Let’s start with those sales first. A few weeks ago, REGN stock dropped precipitously on the news that sales of its eye disorder treatment, Eylea, could fall short of levels anticipated on Wall Street. Data suggested that patients were switching to a competitor product as cost dynamics temporarily shifted out of favor for Eylea. The result was that preliminary Q4 sales were pegged at $1.5 billion, well below the $1.64 billion anticipated. However, analysts then suggested that dynamics were shifting back in favor of Eylea, and REGN clawed back the losses. Investors should note that Regeneron is among the more profitable firms in the highly profitable pharmaceutical industry. Its ROIC of 33.93% over the last 12 months is 10X greater than its 3.36% WACC. Diamondback Energy (FANG) In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Monthly Dividend Stocks with Over 5% Yield. During a difficult time for the capital markets in 2022, dividend-paying stocks proved to be a strong investment, outperforming both non-dividend stocks and bonds during the year. Even with a sluggish economy, market specialists remain optimistic about the growth of dividends. This is due to the conservative dividend payout ratios, which provide companies with sufficient buffers to keep increasing dividends even in the face of slowing or declining earnings growth. Concerns about inflation persist in 2023. Dividend-growing stocks can perform well during inflationary periods because, unlike bonds with fixed interest payments, the increasing dividends can help counter the impact of inflation and maintain purchasing power.Dividends have made a substantial contribution to the returns earned by investors over the past half-century. From 1960 till present, reinvested dividends and the impact of compounding have accounted for 84% of the total return of the S&amp;P 500 Index. From 1930 to 2021, the average contribution of dividend income to the total return of the S&amp;P 500 Index was 40%.ClearBridge Investments, a leading global equity manager with $151.3 billion in assets under management as of December 31, 2022, announced that it will target companies with the ability to increase prices in response to inflationary pressures, thus preserving their profitability. The firm has a positive outlook on financial sector companies, as they can benefit from rising interest rates and a strong labor market, thus maintaining high credit quality. ClearBridge also anticipates that the energy sector will remain a key contributor to dividend returns, due to its strength and the financial stability of some of the companies within the sector. The firm considers investing in dividends to be a timeless strategy.Story continuesMonthly dividend stocks offer consistent and growing income, improved reinvestment opportunities, and a potential for higher yield. While investors usually pick up dividend names like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), we discuss monthly dividend payers in this article. Our Methodology We referred to the “2023 Monthly Dividend Stocks List” from Sure Dividend, selecting stocks yielding more than 5% as of February 3.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read Dividend Challengers List Ranked By Yield: Top 10. Dividend Challengers are companies that have raised their dividends for five years or more. These companies tend to have strong financials and are often viewed as more mature than non-dividend-paying companies. Moreover, they are likely to continue growing their payouts in the future and can be a reliable investment option for risk-averse investors. Examples of popular dividend stocks that have rewarded investors with decades-long dividend growth include The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG),  Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE:AOS).With the growing risks of a global recession, dividend stocks are taking the spotlight as these securities have helped investors through previous periods of economic decline. According to a report by Charles Schwab, high-dividend stocks outperformed the overall market in every recessionary bear market of the past 50 years, except for the financial crisis of 2008-2009, when companies were made to slash their payouts. The same report also highlighted the importance of diversified portfolios, with securities scattered through various sectors.When evaluating dividend stocks, investors should be aware of some potential risks so that they can make more informed investment decisions. Companies with relatively high payout ratios are more vulnerable to a dividend cut. On the other hand, companies that have consistently raised their dividends have solid cash flow generation, which makes them more committed to shareholder obligation. As many companies showed confidence in their sufficient cash flow, dividend spending is likely to increase this year as well. In 2022, companies in the S&amp;P 500 distributed approximately $561 billion in dividends, reaching their highest amount on record. Given the above discussion, we will further elaborate on Dividend Challengers in this article.Story continuesDividend Challengers List Ranked By Yield: Top 25Photo by Marga Santoso on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we selected stocks from the list of Dividend Challengers, the companies that have raised their payouts for consecutive five years or more.

We invested in VICI in 2018 when earnings were declining due to dilutive acquisitions. Our thesis was that, as investors grew more comfortable with casinos as a REIT subsector, the value of their properties would increase. We also liked the defensive characteristics of the company, specifically the triple-net lease structure, which dictates that lessees pay all maintenance and capital expenditures, and the history of casino REITs with zero rent payments missed by casinos during either the global financial crisis or the 2020 pandemic. Furthermore, we were confident that VICI’s growth prospects would increase as more casinos monetized land holdings with VICI’s ability to use its extensive cash and liquidity to make acquisitions. VICI’s stock outperformed in the quarter due to its appeal as a fairly defensive investment and the news that it would be included in the S&amp;P 500 Index. We maintained our position in VICI.”22.

In reality, it's still a good opportunity to establish positions in safe companies to purchase for the long term while fear, uncertainty, and doubt continue to roil the markets.Although buying risk-free stocks sounds like a great idea, there isn't a stock that is really secure. Even the most stable organizations frequently endure considerable stock price fluctuation, and even the finest companies might encounter unforeseen difficulties. This was evident in the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic when the stock prices of numerous powerful firms fell sharply. One way to deal with individual stock risk is diversification.Over the last 12 months, U.S. stocks declined slightly more than 10%. We had a great start to 2023, but the markets seem to be overly optimistic. Long-term interest rates are around 3.5% and consensus estimates for S&amp;P 500 Index hover around $230. This means the market has a forward PE ratio of 18 assuming that the optimistic consensus earnings estimates are accurate.Long-term investors, however, don't pay attention to the volatile, short-term rise and fall of stock markets. Instead, they invest in shares of dependable businesses with consistent performance over years or even decades. The best long-term investments are equities of expanding companies that offer consistent profits. You must comprehend the measurements that provide reliable proof of trustworthy long-term success to locate them.12 Safe Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundsFactors include routinely outperforming the S&amp;P 500 and avoiding the significant short-term drops (and gains) that high-flying firms typically go through. These companies often have solid, well-established operations, consistent revenues, and a reliable supply of dividends for shareholders. As the pandemic last year showed, safe equities may provide investors with a route out of a financial catastrophe during a recession. Some of the notable names in the list of safe stocks include Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Cisco Systems, Inc.

You can skip our detailed analysis of safe stocks and go directly to read 5 Safe Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.Even if there are many indications that the macro environment will remain challenging in 2023, this is not the time to stay on the sidelines. In reality, it's still a good opportunity to establish positions in safe companies to purchase for the long term while fear, uncertainty, and doubt continue to roil the markets.Although buying risk-free stocks sounds like a great idea, there isn't a stock that is really secure. Even the most stable organizations frequently endure considerable stock price fluctuation, and even the finest companies might encounter unforeseen difficulties. This was evident in the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic when the stock prices of numerous powerful firms fell sharply. One way to deal with individual stock risk is diversification.Over the last 12 months, U.S. stocks declined slightly more than 10%. We had a great start to 2023, but the markets seem to be overly optimistic. Long-term interest rates are around 3.5% and consensus estimates for S&amp;P 500 Index hover around $230. This means the market has a forward PE ratio of 18 assuming that the optimistic consensus earnings estimates are accurate.Long-term investors, however, don't pay attention to the volatile, short-term rise and fall of stock markets. Instead, they invest in shares of dependable businesses with consistent performance over years or even decades. The best long-term investments are equities of expanding companies that offer consistent profits. You must comprehend the measurements that provide reliable proof of trustworthy long-term success to locate them.12 Safe Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundsFactors include routinely outperforming the S&amp;P 500 and avoiding the significant short-term drops (and gains) that high-flying firms typically go through. These companies often have solid, well-established operations, consistent revenues, and a reliable supply of dividends for shareholders. As the pandemic last year showed, safe equities may provide investors with a route out of a financial catastrophe during a recession. Some of the notable names in the list of safe stocks include Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Cisco Systems, Inc.

With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Len Schleifer. Len?Leonard Schleifer: Good morning to everybody and for those of you experiencing the optic freeze, I hope you are staying warm. Our strong fourth quarter performance kept remarkable year of Regeneron, highlighted by significant achievements that better position the company to deliver sustainable growth and shareholder value. Fourth quarter 2022 revenue increased 14% compared to the prior year when excluding the impact of contributions from REGEN-COV and Ronapreve underscoring the commercial strength and increasing diversity of our business. We also made several important advances across our pipeline during the quarter, notably the submission of a Biologic License Application for aflibercept 8 milligrams in neovascular age-related macular degeneration or wet AMD as well as diabetic macular edema, or DME, positioning us for a potential U.S. launch in late August of this year.Additionally, we received FDA approval for Libtayo in combination with chemotherapy as a first line treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer, making Libtayo only the second PD-1 or PD-L1 antibody approved in this setting, regardless of the patient's histology or PD-L1 expressions level. We also presented data from our rapidly advancing oncology pipeline, including fianlimab, our LAG-3 antibody in combination with Libtayo in advanced non-small cell lung cancer, odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific in B-cell lymphomas and linvoseltamab, our BCMA x CD3 bispecific in multiple myeloma. Finally, Dupixent was approved for prurigo nodularis in Europe. Briefly reflecting on 2022, we ended the year with three strategic imperatives that we felt we had to accomplish in order to position the company for long-term growth.First, we had to fortify the medium and long-term outlook for our retinal franchise. Based on the positive results that we reported in September 2022, we believe aflibercept 8 milligrams has the potential to change the treatment paradigm for patients with wet AMD and DME by becoming the new standard of care for these patients, positioning Regeneron for prolonged leadership in this category. Second, we needed to maintain and grow DUPIXENT leadership across a variety of Type 2 allergic diseases. 2022 turned out to be a phenomenal year with Dupixent global net product sales approaching $8.7 billion and growing 44% at constant currency. Despite new competition, Dupixent maintained a leading market position in atopic dermatitis, asthma and nasal polyps and was also approved in new indications, geographies and younger populations, which George will detail shortly.Collectively, these 2022 approvals meaningfully expanded the Dupixent commercial opportunity, allowing the addressable population to increase by approximately 225,000 patients, bringing the total addressable population to over 7 million patients globally. And third, we wanted to make significant progress towards becoming a leader in immunooncology and 2022 turned out to be a crucial year. Key to this long-term goal was requiring Sanofi's share of global rights to Libtayo, an antibody discovered by Regeneron, which was a necessary step towards realizing the full clinical and commercial potential of this foundational therapy. It also enables us to unlock combination opportunities from promising candidates in our oncology pipeline, including with our LAG-3 antibody, our costimulatory bispecifics and our CD3 bispecifics.Looking ahead, we expect 2023 to be another notable year with significant incremental progress across these imperatives as well as in other areas of our business. We are preparing for a potential U.S. launch for aflibercept 8 milligrams in late August given prescribers decade plus experience with EYLEA. And now with the 48-week data for aflibercept 8 milligrams, which demonstrated comparable efficacy and safety to EYLEA, but with longer treatment intervals, we believe that over time there is an opportunity for aflibercept 8 milligrams to become the new standard of care for wet AMD and DME. We expect Dupixent to continue to strengthen its leadership position across approved Type 2 allergic diseases based on its differentiated mechanism of blocking both interleukin-4 and interleukin-13.In 2023, we have an opportunity to reach even more patients with potential regulatory approvals in new diseases, geographies and younger populations that could add another approximately 500,000 patients globally to the biologic eligible population. Additionally, we look forward to the upcoming readout of our first Phase 3 study of Dupixent in COPD in the first half of this year. In oncology, we expect to continue rapidly advancing our pipeline. For our LAG-3 combination with Libtayo, we are moving forward with expansion beyond melanoma to include lung cancer and potentially other solid tumors. For our costimulatory bispecifics, in combination with Libtayo, we are continuing dose expansion in our Phase 1/2 PSMAxCD28 program in advanced prostate cancer.We also expect to report additional Phase 1 data from our EGFRxCD28 program in solid tumors and to present initial clinical data for our MUC16xCD28 program in recurrent ovarian cancer. And within Heme-Onc, we anticipate second half regulatory submissions for odronextamab in follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma as well as limvolseltumab in refractory multiple myeloma. In 2023, we also plan to rapidly move forward with clinical development of our next-generation COVID-19 antibody, which we believe could help protect the millions of vulnerable patients who were unable to map a sufficient immune response from vaccination and treat those who require other alternatives. Activities enabling clinical manufacturing have commenced and we expect to enter clinical development later this year.In closing, 2022 was a pivotal year at Regeneron and we expect to continue making significant progress in 2023. Our strategy remains focused on investing in our internal R&amp;D capabilities which has historically generated a high rate of return. We remain confident in our near and long-term growth prospects with approximately 35 pipeline candidates currently progressing through clinical trials. We will also continue looking for opportunities to complement these internal efforts by exploring potential collaborations. With our commercial capabilities continue to drive revenue growth and our strong financial position, Regeneron is extremely well positioned to continue delivering breakthroughs for patients and value to shareholders. Now, I will turn the call over to George.George Yancopoulos: Thanks, Len. I would like to briefly walk you through our pipeline's progress in 2022 and touch upon what lies ahead in 2023. In ophthalmology, we presented pivotal  positive pivotal results for aflibercept 8 milligram in wet AMD and DME. These trials showed that aflibercept 8 milligram extended dosing intervals to every 12 or even 16 weeks for the vast majority of patients through 48 weeks without compromising the visual improvement or safety seen with EYLEA. These are truly unprecedented and potentially game-changing results who have not  which have not been achieved using any other anti-VEGF agents. Moving to Dupixent, in 2022, Dupixent became the only biologic approved in atopic dermatitis, for infants as young as 6 months of age, the first treatment for prurigo nodularis and the first treatment in the United States for eosinophilic esophagitis.And just this week, we obtained the European Commission approval for eosinophilic esophagitis as well. In addition, we submitted a supplemental BLA for chronic spontaneous urticaria and shared positive Phase 3 data in children with the eosinophilic esophagitis. Dupixent is now approved in 5 related Type 2 allergic conditions. And our data shows that these diseases are mediated by IL-4 and IL-13 driven Type 2 inflammation. Because many patients suffer from systemic Type 2 inflammation, they often suffer from several of these diseases concurrently. And thus, Dupixent has the potential to holistically address these patients multiple Type 2 conditions for which Dupixent is approved. While many other immunomodulators are associated with worrisome immunosuppression and carry boxed warnings, Dupixent's safety profile supports its approval in infants.In 2023, we are looking forward to the initial results of BOREAS, the first Dupixent Phase 3 study in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD. Our Dupixent COPD Phase 3 studies have enrolled patients with elevated blood eosinophils aiming to select for patients with COPD driven by Type 2 inflammation. The BOREAS study passed an interim futility analysis in 2020, an encouraging event, which triggered the start of the replicate Phase 3 NOTUS study. We are looking forward to the readout of BOREAS with the primary endpoint of annualized rate of acute, moderate and severe COPD exacerbations expected in the first half of 23. Moving on to oncology, 2022 was an important year for our oncology programs. Libtayo was approved by the FDA in combination with chemotherapy in first-line non-small cell lung cancer, irrespective of histology or PD-L1 expression levels, an achievement met by only one other PD-1 or PD-L1 targeting agent.Libtayo is also emerging as an essential backbone of our oncology pipeline as several programs in combination with Libtayo are starting to yield encouraging data. First, I will discuss our LAG-3 antibody, fianlimab in combination with Libtayo, where we have recently shown positive data from a second confirmatory cohort of PD-1 naive metastatic melanoma patients and reported encouraging results from a smaller dataset in non-small-cell lung cancer patients. These initial results suggest that the fianlimab Libtayo combination has a potentially best-in-class profile in melanoma. And we are advancing broad pivotal programs in both melanoma and lung cancer. Phase 3 studies in metastatic melanoma and adjuvant melanoma are already enrolling and we have plans to soon initiate another Phase 3 study in perioperative melanoma as well as Phase 2/3 studies in first-line advanced as well as perioperative non-small cell lung cancer.Other notable Libtayo combination used from this year was the early but very encouraging data with our PSMA by CD28 costimulatory bispecific in advanced metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, a tumor type considered immunologically cold with multiple recent Phase 3 failures demonstrating that prostate cancer is largely unresponsive to anti-PD-1 therapy in other end as well as in other types of chemo combination. In our proof-of-concept study of our PSMA by CD28 costimulatory bispecific, we observed first evidence that combining this new class of bispecifics with anti-PD-1 can confer profound responsiveness to tumors previously thought to be cold and unresponsive to anti-PD-1 therapy with 3 out of the 4 patients treated at the highest dose levels showing greater than 90% reductions within 6 weeks of initiating combination therapy in the prostate cancer biomarker PSA.Following up on these early but exciting results, we are continuing to enroll patients in this study and we are planning to present additional data at medical meetings in 2023. We also presented our first clinical data for a CD3 bispecific in a solid tumor for ubamatamab, our MUC16xCD3 bispecific in development for advanced ovarian cancer. As a single agent in a Phase 1 dose escalation study in heavily pretreated recurrent ovarian cancer patients, we observed a 14% overall response rate [George Yancopoulos misread his script, the company sent a correction request to change ""4%"" to ""14%""] with a 31% response rates in a small subset of patients with high MUC16 expressing tumors. We expect initial dose escalation data later this year for ubamatamab with Libtayo as well as for our MUC16xCD28 costimulatory bispecific with Libtayo in advanced ovarian cancer.We also expect updated clinical data for our EGFRxCD28 costimulatory bispecific in combination with Libtayo in various solid tumors later this year. Moving on to our hematology oncology pipeline, at the American Society of Hematology, or ASH Annual Meeting, we presented new data from odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific as well as linvoseltamab our BCMAxCD3 bispecific. For odronextamab, we presented pivotal Phase 2 ELM-2 data. Odronextamab in third or later line relapsed or recurrent follicular lymphoma has a potential best-in-class efficacy profile with 82% of patients responding and 92% of these responders achieving a complete response with encouraging durability. Our optimized step-up dosing regimen has improved odronextamab's safety profile while retaining efficacy similar to the prior dosing regimen.In third or later  in relapse or recurrent diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, odronextamab demonstrated efficacy regardless of prior CAR-T experience and a safety profile generally similar to that seen in follicular lymphoma. We are planning regulatory submissions in the second half of 2023 for both indications, which we hope will support potential accelerated approvals. In 2023, we anticipate initiating several Phase 3 studies in follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, including in earlier lines of therapy. These trials will serve as confirmatory studies which could potentially support conversion to full approval. We also expect to initiate a proof-of-concept study of our CD22xCD28 costimulatory bispecific in combination with odronextamab in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, which we hope could further add to the anticancer benefit for these patients.For linvoseltamab, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibody we presented efficacy and safety data from our pivotal Phase 2 study in third or later line multiple myeloma at ASH. Early, deep and durable responses were observed in patients with high disease burden and these responses may improve with longer follow-up. In 2023, we plan to initiate a confirmatory Phase 3 study of linvoseltamab in second line multiple myeloma and are on track for a BLA submission in the second half of the year. As with odronextamab, we plan to initiate combination studies for linvoseltamab with costimulatory bispecifics in the near future. I'd also like to update some additional clinical programs. Our antibody blocking Factor XI for anticoagulation and our antibody that activates the NPR1 receptor for heart failure are both completing proof of mechanism trials.Moving on to Regeneron Genetics Medicine, regarding our collaboration with Alnylam and siRNA Therapeutics, we are planning a broad and multi-pronged approach to develop treatments for NASH, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. We are initiating a Phase 2 study of ALN-HSD and NASH patients with genetic risk factors. We also dosed first subjects in the first-in-human study of another siRNA medicine in development for NASH, ALN-PNP, which targets a different gene and can be potentially combined with ALN-HSD in appropriate patients. We have discovered additional NASH targets, which we have validated using our Regeneron Genetics Center, including side B, which will potentially be the next NASH therapeutic candidate to enter the clinic. With regard to our collaboration with Alnylam for central nervous system targets, our initial dose escalation study is ongoing.Medicines, Pharmacy, HealthPhoto by James Yarema on UnsplashOur collaboration with Intellia and CRISPR-based therapeutics, this is expected to progress further in 2023, building on continuing data readouts from the Phase 1 study of NTLA-2001 in transthyretin amyloidosis in both cardiomyopathy and neuropathy patients, which provided the first demonstration in humans that CRISPR-based technologies can deliver up to 90% reduction of the pathological gene product for over a year. Regarding our gene therapy efforts, our collaborators at Decibel Therapeutics recently announced that a clinical trial has been authorized by both the U.S. FDA and the UK MHRA for DB-OTO, a virally delivered gene therapy designed to restore hearing to individuals with otoferlin-related hearing loss. A Phase 1/2 study in patients 2 years of age and younger is expected to initiate in the first half of 2023 with initial data from the first cohort of patients anticipated in the first quarter of 2024.I'd like to conclude with our next-generation COVID-19 efforts. As we recently announced, we have identified a potent broadly neutralizing COVID-19 antibody, which, unlike other neutralizing antibodies find outside of the so-called receptor binding domain, or RBD, of the spike protein. This antibody retains activity against all the viral variants seen throughout the pandemic because it binds to an atop that has remained highly conserved, greater than 99.9% across all known variants. The vast majority of antiviral antibodies generated as a result of vaccination or due to natural infection target the RBD domain, which results in overwhelming selective pressure driving the emergence of these resistant variants. We hope that by targeting this unique and conservative to outside of the RBD this antibody will also retain its activity in the face of future variance.We plan to initiate clinical trials to test this antibody this year, and we are looking to develop it in both treatment and prophylactic setting. In conclusion, Regeneron's R&amp;D engine continues its productivity, including the early-stage pipeline. Just in the first weeks of this year, we have initiated clinical studies for two new drug candidates and we anticipate clinical trials starting or IND submission for up to 10 new therapeutic candidates this year as well as for additional indications for candidates that are already in the clinic. So with that, I will turn it over to Marion.Marion McCourt: Thanks, George. The fourth quarter capped off a strong year of execution and growth, delivering results across our commercial portfolio. We expanded into new indications, which, coupled with our existing business, is expected to drive meaningful growth in 2023 and beyond. We look forward to several important potential approvals and subsequent launches this year, providing additional opportunities for growth. Starting with EYLEA, where we announced in January, fourth quarter U.S. net sales of $1.5 billion, full year 2022 net sales were $6.3 billion, representing 8% year-over-year growth and outpacing total growth of the anti-VEGF category for the year. At the end of the fourth quarter, EYLEA category share was approaching previous levels of approximately 50% of injections.This followed the short-term shift earlier in the quarter where EYLEA was negatively impacted by a temporary increase in use of off-label compounded Avastin. During this time, there was a short-term closure of a not-for-profit patient co-pay assistance fund, which reopened later in the quarter. We believe we have substantially recovered from the issue encountered in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect competitive pressures but remain confident in Regeneron's overall retinal franchise as we look forward to our potential upcoming aflibercept 8-milligram launch. In summary, our retinal franchise leads the anti-VEGF category with EYLEA as the current standard of care and aflibercept 8-milligram, if approved, offering a differentiated clinical profile that can potentially shift the treatment paradigm.Turning to Libtayo. Total fourth quarter global net sales were $169 million, growing 44% on a constant currency basis. In the U.S., net sales grew 36% to $110 million with contributions across all indications. In advanced non-melanoma skin cancers, we continue to build our leadership position in the PD-1 class. In lung cancer, Libtayo continues to see steady growth in utilization in prescribers. Customer ordering has accelerated following the chemotherapy combination approval last November. We are working to maximize launch uptake by increasing depth and breath of prescribers. Early launch indicators are positive community and academic centers have welcomed Libtayo's expanded role as an important treatment option in advanced non-small cell lung cancer.There are more than 200,000 new cases of lung cancer per year in the U.S. alone for which Libtayo is an important treatment option. Outside the U.S., Libtayo net sales grew 60% on a constant currency basis to $59 million driven by steady demand growth and additional launches as we secure access and reimbursement globally. We continue a targeted approach to extend our global commercial footprint in priority international markets. designed to maximize opportunities for Libtayo and potential future medicines. Finally, turning to DUPIXENT, where in the fourth quarter, global net sales grew 42% on a constant currency basis to $2.45 billion. In the U.S., net sales grew 44% to $1.94 billion, with strong growth continuing across atopic dermatitis, asthma, nasal polyps with additional contributions from recent launches in the eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis.DUPIXENT is well positioned to expand market penetration and drive revenue growth across established new and potential future indications in 2023 and beyond. Atopic dermatitis DUPIXENT's largest indication continues to rapidly grow across all age groups, firmly establishing DUPIXENT as the preferred systemic therapy for patients with moderate to severe disease. There continues to be rapid uptake in younger populations, further confirming DUPIXENT's differentiated efficacy and safety profile. We've also seen meaningful early adoption in prurigo nodularis where DUPIXENT is the only FDA-approved medicine for this debilitating disease. We expect ongoing uptake of DUPIXENT as the launch progresses and physicians identify patients need. DUPIXENT continues to perform well in the highly competitive biologic asthma space with steady market share gains and strong growth in total prescriptions and new patient starts.In nasal polyps, DUPIXENT's differentiated clinical profile continues to drive uptake as the leading first-line treatment option in patients requiring systemic therapy. In the eosinophilic esophagitis, the launch is going exceptionally well finally offering physicians and their patients a treatment to effectively manage the underlying mechanism of the disease. Patients treated with DUPIXEN have experienced dramatic improvements in their symptoms and quality of life we've seen rapid uptake across both gastroenterologists and allergists. We also continue to advance our clinical efforts in younger patients where there is also substantial unmet need. Outside the U.S., DUPIXENT net sales worth $513 million, growing 37% on a constant currency basis, driven by rapid uptake across approved indications and launches in new geographies.In Europe, DUPIXENT was approved for prurigo nodularis in December. And earlier this week, DUPIXENT was also approved for eosinophilic esophagitis. We expect these new indications to contribute to DUPIXENT's ongoing international growth. In summary, during 2022, we executed on our core focus to deliver life-changing medicines to patients. Our commercial initiatives and strategies are driving increases in market penetration for our in-line brands and optimizing the potential of new and upcoming launches. Taken together, we are confident in Regeneron's future and are well positioned to deliver long-term and sustainable growth. Now I'll turn the call to Bob.Bob Landry: Thank you, Marion. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise noted. Regeneron ended 2022 with a strong fourth quarter with continued execution driving positive results across the business. Excluding contributions from REGEN-COV and Ronapreve, fourth quarter total revenues increased 14% year-over-year to $3 billion, driven by growth across our core brands. Fourth quarter diluted net income per share was $12.56 on net income of $1.4 billion. Beginning with collaboration revenue and starting with Bayer. Fourth quarter 2022 ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales were $839 million, up 7% on a constant currency basis versus fourth quarter 2021. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $355 million, of which $324 million related to our share of EYLEA net profits outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $836 million in the fourth quarter and grew 61%, driven by DUPIXENT.Our share of profits from the commercialization of DUPIXENT and KEVZARA was $619 million, an increase of 60% versus the prior year. We also recognized a $50 million sales-based milestone in the fourth quarter of 2022 due to achievement of $2.5 billion of ex-U.S. sales of antibody collaboration products on a rolling 12-month basis. Finally, we recorded Roche collaboration revenue of $396 million in the fourth quarter for our share of gross profits from ex-U.S. sales of Ronapreve related to a previously signed contract. Moving now to our operating expenses. Fourth quarter 2022 R&amp;D expense increased 43% year-over-year to $911 million, driven by the impact of the Libtayo transaction with Regeneron now recording all R&amp;D expense for Libtayo and our full 50% share of antibody collaboration R&amp;D spend for DUPIXENT and odronextamab, as well as additional costs incurred in connection with the company's late-stage pipeline and increasing clinical manufacturing activities and higher headcount-related costs.SG&amp;A expense increased 17% year-over-year to $579 million due to higher headcount and related costs, incremental costs to fully support the global commercialization of Libtayo and higher contributions to an independent not-for-profit patient systems organization. Product gross margin in the quarter increased to 93% as compared to 86% in the prior year. The improved gross margin was driven by a favorable change in product mix and no longer having to pay Sanofi for their share of U.S. Libtayo gross profits. Finally, fourth quarter 2022 effective tax rate was 11.3% compared to 12.6% in the prior year. Shifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet. For full year 2022, Regeneron generated $4.4 billion in free cash flow, favorably impacted by our first quarter 2022 payment from the U.S. government for sales REGEN-COV that were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021.We ended 2022 with cash and marketable securities less debt of $11.6 billion. We continue to deliver on our capital allocation priorities in 2022 by deploying approximately $3.4 billion towards business development and share repurchases while continuing to fund our internal R&amp;D efforts. In 2022, we executed approximately $1.3 billion in business development initiatives, including the acquisitions of Checkmate Pharmaceuticals in the exclusive worldwide rights to Libtayo. We also purchased approximately $2.1 billion of our shares in 2022, including $431 million in the fourth quarter. This morning, we announced a new $3 billion share repurchase authorization reflecting our continued confidence in our business and our pipeline. We remain buyers of our shares at current levels, and this new authorization enables us to continue returning capital directly to shareholders.I'd like to conclude with our initial financial guidance and outlook for 2023. We expect 2023 SG&amp;A spend to be in the range of $2.13 billion to $2.2 billion. This primarily reflects the full year impact of global Life tile commercialization expenses, the build-out of our international commercial infrastructure in select markets and higher headcount to support our growing organization. We expect our 2023 R&amp;D expense to be in the range of $3.725 billion to $3.925 billion. As George mentioned, we have numerous strategically important development programs advancing in 2023, including late-stage studies for our fianlimab, Libtayo combination in melanoma and lung cancer in confirmatory Phase 3 studies for odronextamab, both in FL and DLBCL and linvoseltamab in myeloma.In addition, we continue to advance programs in our early pipeline across multiple therapeutic areas including with collaborators such as Alnylam and Intellia positioning us for long-term growth. This range also includes the full year impact of the Libtayo transaction, we are now recording all development expenses for Libtayo recognizing our full 50% share of development expenses for DUPIXENT in itepekimab. COCM is expected to be in the range of $720 million to $800 million, similar to 2022 reflecting the gradual phase-in of a new Regeneron developed manufacturing process for DUPIXENT that is designed to improve drug substance yields. We expect our capital expenditures in 2023 to be in the range of $825 million to $950 million. These expenditures will support the continued expansion of our manufacturing facilities, including ongoing construction of a fill/finish facility as well as the previously announced expansion of R&amp;D facilities at our Tarrytown, New York headquarters.Finally, we anticipate 2023 gross margin to be between 90% to 92% and our effective tax rate to be in the range of 11% to 13%. In addition to our full year financial guidance, we expect higher interest income in 2023, given our greater cash balance plus higher interest rates as compared to last year, which will favorably impact other income and expense. We also expect 2023 other revenue to be slightly lower than 2022. Finally, as I said in November, we no longer expect to record any material other operating income or expense in 2023 are beyond absent a new transaction. In conclusion, Regeneron continued to deliver robust financial results in 2022, and we are well positioned to drive continued growth in 2023 and beyond. With that, I will now pass the call back to Ryan.Ryan Crowe: Thank you, Bob. Shannon, that concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call for Q&amp;A.

The company's shares saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$218 and falling to the lows of US$193. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Union Pacific's current trading price of US$210 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Union Pacific’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Union Pacific What's The Opportunity In Union Pacific?According to my valuation model, Union Pacific seems to be fairly priced at around 19.29% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Union Pacific today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $176.28, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Union Pacific’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What kind of growth will Union Pacific generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Union Pacific's earnings growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years, indicating a solid future ahead. This should lead to robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? UNP’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on UNP, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

No doubt, it’s a successful investment strategy that helped Richard Driehaus make a place in Barron’s All-Century Team.To that end, stocks like Coca Cola Femsa, United Rentals and Ameriprise Financial have been selected as the momentum picks for the day using the Driehaus strategy.A Detailed Look into Driehaus StrategyRegarding the strategy, Driehaus once said: “I would much rather invest in a stock that’s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that’s already in decline and try to guess when it will turn around.” In line with this insight, the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) took into account the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus’ philosophy.It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator — positive relative strength — has also been included in this strategy. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.Moreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.Here are three of the 12 stocks:Story continuesCoca Cola Femsa produces, markets, and distributes soft drinks throughout the metropolitan area of Mexico City, in Southeastern Mexico, and in metropolitan Buenos Aires, Argentina. Coca Cola Femsa has a Momentum Score of A. The trailing four-quarter earnings surprise for KOF is 33.6%, on average.United Rentals is the largest equipment rental company in the world.

You can skip our detailed analysis of safe stocks and go directly to read 5 Safe Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.Even if there are many indications that the macro environment will remain challenging in 2023, this is not the time to stay on the sidelines. In reality, it's still a good opportunity to establish positions in safe companies to purchase for the long term while fear, uncertainty, and doubt continue to roil the markets.Although buying risk-free stocks sounds like a great idea, there isn't a stock that is really secure. Even the most stable organizations frequently endure considerable stock price fluctuation, and even the finest companies might encounter unforeseen difficulties. This was evident in the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic when the stock prices of numerous powerful firms fell sharply. One way to deal with individual stock risk is diversification.Over the last 12 months, U.S. stocks declined slightly more than 10%. We had a great start to 2023, but the markets seem to be overly optimistic. Long-term interest rates are around 3.5% and consensus estimates for S&amp;P 500 Index hover around $230. This means the market has a forward PE ratio of 18 assuming that the optimistic consensus earnings estimates are accurate.Long-term investors, however, don't pay attention to the volatile, short-term rise and fall of stock markets. Instead, they invest in shares of dependable businesses with consistent performance over years or even decades. The best long-term investments are equities of expanding companies that offer consistent profits. You must comprehend the measurements that provide reliable proof of trustworthy long-term success to locate them.12 Safe Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundsFactors include routinely outperforming the S&amp;P 500 and avoiding the significant short-term drops (and gains) that high-flying firms typically go through. These companies often have solid, well-established operations, consistent revenues, and a reliable supply of dividends for shareholders. As the pandemic last year showed, safe equities may provide investors with a route out of a financial catastrophe during a recession. Some of the notable names in the list of safe stocks include Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), among others.Story continuesOur MethodologyWe identified the top 50 holdings of iShares MSCI USA Min Vol Factor ETF (USMV) and ranked them using Insider Monkey's proprietary hedge fund sentiment data.
