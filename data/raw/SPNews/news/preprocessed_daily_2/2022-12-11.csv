We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Texas Instruments Step By Step Through The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$5.07bUS$5.89bUS$6.98bUS$8.87bUS$10.1bUS$11.1bUS$11.9bUS$12.7bUS$13.3bUS$13.8bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x7Analyst x3Analyst x2Est @ 13.62%Est @ 10.13%Est @ 7.68%Est @ 5.97%Est @ 4.78%Est @ 3.94% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.8% US$4.7kUS$5.0kUS$5.4kUS$6.3kUS$6.6kUS$6.7kUS$6.6kUS$6.4kUS$6.2kUS$5.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$60bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$14b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.8%– 2.0%) = US$205bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$205b÷ ( 1 + 8.8%)10= US$88bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$148b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$174, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Texas Instruments as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.232. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Texas Instruments, there are three relevant aspects you should look at:Risks: Every company has them, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for Texas Instruments   (of which 2 are significant!) you should know about.Future Earnings: How does TXN's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

(NASDAQ:QRVO) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future.

The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$97.6, the company appears quite good value at a 43% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Qorvo as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.342. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?""

(NYSE:MMC) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 90% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.8% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.3% and 8.2% of the stock.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 14 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Marsh &amp; McLennan CompaniesThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$205m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 10% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

8,c77cd3d8-9e6b-3093-b75e-451f161675c7,O,2022-12-11,Energy & precious metals - weekly review and outlook,Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-precious-metals-weekly-review-051306274.html,1670735586,STORY,"['GLD', 'CL=F', 'GC=F']","[By Barani KrishnanInvesting.com -- Crude prices just had their worst week in nine months, driven by headlines about recession and a price cap on Russian oil, while barely paying heed to the comments of two men who typically dictate the market’s direction: Presidents Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping.Putin, the Russian president, threatened to cut production if the West’s “stupid” - yes, that’s what he called it - price cap on his country’s oil isn’t removed.Xi, the leader of China, spoke about buying more oil from Saudi Arabia and revived talk of using his country’s currency, the yuan, for trade with Gulf countries.“Meh”, said the market - or the equivalent of whatever - and continued going lower.It’s not that oil traders no longer find Putin or Xi interesting enough to follow. Under ordinary circumstances, both men can move crude prices in a heartbeat, with either words or policies.But these aren’t ordinary times in oil. If you haven’t noticed, the narrative in oil has drastically changed in the past two to three quarters.“Global doom and gloom outlooks have killed the crude demand outlook,” Ed Moya, analyst at online trading platform OANDA, wrote in a commentary published Friday.“The short-term crude demand outlook has deteriorated significantly as no one has a strong handle on how bad a recession will hit the US economy,” Moya said. “China’s COVID situation also remains a big concern as the end of their COVID-zero strategy could cripple their health system.”From a supply-dictated environment that sent a barrel of Brent to a 14-year high of almost $140 in March, the market is now dominated by demand concerns as traders worry about how the global economy will perform in 2023 if the Federal Reserve to the European Central Bank do not stop hiking rates to subdue inflation.Thus, the price cap of $60-per-barrel imposed on Russia’s crude isn’t meant to only limit the earnings from oil that go into funding Moscow’s war in Ukraine.Story continuesThe proponents of the price cap - comprising the Group of Seven major powers, the European Union and Australia - believe energy prices need to be curbed as well in order to offset the impact of a deep recession.Of course, to oil producers like Russia, that logic is just horse manure.""This will lead to the collapse of the industry itself, because the consumer will always insist that the price be lower,” said Putin. “The industry is already under-invested, under-funded, and if we listen only to consumers, then this investment will be reduced to zero.”""All this will lead at some stage to a catastrophic surge in prices and to the collapse of the global energy sector. This is a stupid proposal, ill-conceived and poorly thought-out.""His remarks showed how annoyed he was at the idea of the United States and its allies using Russia’s own oil as a weapon to try and stop its advance in Ukraine - never mind that he himself held the West hostage to Russian energy just months ago by threatening to cut off gas supplies to Europe.Putin said the West’s attempts to squeeze Russia’s oil earnings via the price cap won’t work as Russia was already selling its crude at around $60 per barrel.What he failed to realize perhaps was that traders were betting on the same thing - that the cap won’t really matter to Moscow for it to retaliate unless West Texas Intermediate and Brent prices go a lot higher (for a deeper dive on the price cap and what will really make it tick, read our analysis).Thus, when Putin hinted that Russia might retaliate with production cuts, the market was already aware there was no urgency for Moscow to do that. For good measure, Putin added that “concrete steps” will be outlined in a presidential decree “to be released in the next few days”. We patiently await that.In Xi’s case, he said China wants to buy more oil from Saudi Arabia and told Gulf leaders on Friday that his country aspired to use its yuan currency to trade oil and gas with them.The talks with China over yuan-priced oil contracts have been off and on for six years but have accelerated this year as the Saudis have grown increasingly unhappy with decades-old U.S. security commitments to defend the kingdom.The Saudis have also defied U.S. pressure to isolate fellow OPEC+ oil producer Russia over the Ukraine invasion.China buys more than 25% of the oil that Saudi Arabia exports. If its wish to get the Saudis to accept the yuan succeeds even remotely, it would go a long way in supporting Beijing's goal of establishing its currency internationally and weakening the dollar's grip on world trade.The last time Saudi Arabia was in active talks with Beijing over the use of the yuan for trade was in mid-March, when oil markets peaked during the early days of the Ukraine invasion.This time, Xi was touting the yen partnership at a highly-publicized state visit to Riyadh, where Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was hosting him to showcase the young royal’s ambition of expanding relations with Asia’s biggest power to give the diplomatic finger to the Arab world’s traditional partner: the United States.Xi said China will ""expand the scale of crude oil trade"" with Saudi Arabia.He then encouraged Gulf nations to make full use of the Shanghai Petroleum and National Gas Exchange as a platform to carry out yuan settlement of oil and gas trades.China and states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) are natural partners for cooperation, Xi added in his Riyadh speech.Oil traders listened and barely reacted - proving their minds were somewhere else.Oil: Market Settlements and Activity WTI, or New York-traded U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude, did a final trade of $71.59 on its January delivery crude after settling Friday’s official session down 44 cents, 0.6%, at $71.02 per barrel.The U.S. crude benchmark ended the week down $9.28, or 11.6%, making it its worst week since March 25. WTI’s session low was $70.11 - a bottom not seen since Dec 21, 2021 and was practically a dime above the key $70 support.As of Friday, WTI was down 4.8% for all of 2022. In comparison, the U.S. crude benchmark was up 73% in March when it traded just above $130 a barrel.London-traded Brent crude for February delivery did a final trade of $76.82 per barrel on its February delivery crude after settling Friday’s official session down 5 cents, or 0.07%, at $76.10.For the week, the global crude benchmark was down more than $9.47, or 11%. Brent’s intraday low was $75.14 - a trough not seen since Dec 23, 2021 and less than 15 cents above the key $75 support.Brent was off 1.4% on the year, after being up 80% in March when it rose to just shy of $140 a barrel.The oil trade, meanwhile, was bracing for more volatility in 2023 as the West’s price cap on Russian oil and headwinds to global growth offset potential demand surges and supply crunches.“Choppy is the word to describe how oil markets are likely to be in the coming days and weeks,” said John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital.“There are worries about Europe in recession and of central banks over tightening to get a handle on inflation. Then, you have the occasional headline of a pipeline in trouble, like Keystone. Anything could yank the market two bucks either way on any day. The market is nervous as a tick.”Oil Price Technical Outlook: WTIWTI attempted to test the psychological handle of $70, before settling the week at $71.50 - a tad above the 50-Month Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of $71.09, though below the 200-Month Simple Moving Average (SMA) of $72.50, Sunil Kumar Dixit, chief technical strategist at SKCharting.com, said.“Though traditionally, these two major moving averages on longer time frame bear significant impact and have enormous potential for a trend reversal, it is equally important to remember that the prevalent bearish trend can dig in deeper,” said Dixit.“This could have immediate and reliable support at $65, which coincides with the 200-week SMA of $65 and the 38.2% Fibonacci level of retracement measured from the major upwave”.In the event buying starts with the $70 active support, then $73.60 and $76.30 could be the immediate and first line of resistance, Dixit said.The latter can also be an acceleration point for further rebound toward the 100-week SMA of $82.Gold: Market Settlements and Activity Gold futures’ benchmark February contract did a final trade of $1,809.40 an ounce after officially settling Friday’s session at $1,810.70 on New York’s COMEX, up 9.20, or 0.5%. For the week though, the contract was virtually flat, rising just $1.10.The spot price of gold, which is more closely followed than futures by some traders, however, settled slightly under the $1,800 mark - at $1,797.26, up $8.19 or 0.5% for Friday. For the week, it was almost flat, just like gold futures, sliding 56 cents.Gold longs seem bent on finishing the year at $1,800 an ounce or above. Tuesday’s Consumer Price Index, or CPI, report for November will probably determine if that’s possible.A CPI reading measurably lower than the 7.7% reported for the year to October would likely help the Fed be less hawkish with its Dec. 14 rate hike decision, due a day after the inflation data. That could extend gold’s rally into the $1,850 region.But a new CPI reading of 8% or around there for the year will most likely indicate to the Fed that it needs to continue being tough with rate hikes in 2023 as inflation is barely yielding its way. That could spell trouble for gold longs’ hopes of keeping the yellow metal to their $1,800-and-above target.The CPI grew by 9.1% in the year to June, hitting a 40-year high. The Fed's target inflation is, meanwhile, just 2% per annum.In its bid to control surging prices, the central bank has added 375 basis points to interest rates since March via six rate hikes. Prior to that, interest rates peaked at just 25 basis points, as the Fed slashed them to nearly zero after the global COVID-19 outbreak in 2020.The Fed, which executed four back-to-back jumbo rate hikes of 75 basis points from June through November, is contemplating a more modest 50-basis point increase in December.Gold Technical Outlook: Spot Price Gold seems firm on its resolve to hold to $1,800 pricing despite some sideways movement, Dixit of SKCharting said.“This is clear from the second attack it has made on the 100-week SMA of $1,800 during the just-ended week,” said Dixit, who tracks the spot price of gold.The latest rebound was fueled by strategic support lent by the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement that came from the $2,070-$1,614 correction.“Apart from this, buyers are not missing any opportunity for corrections,” Dixit said. “This is obvious from the way value shoppers have bought the dips when prices dropped to the $1,765 level.”Additionally, the 5-week EMA of $1,767 was trying to cross into the 50-Week EMA of $1,772 from below, indicating technical and strategic support for a further leg up.“The next major resistance and target sits at $1,742 while major support is indicated at $1,765, failing which the short-term momentum turns bearish, pushing gold towards $1,750 and later $1,730.”“A break below $1,722, or the 23.6% Fibonacci level, will invalidate the current rebound.”Disclaimer: Barani Krishnan does not hold positions in the commodities and securities he writes about.Related ArticlesKansas residents hold their nose as crews mop up massive U.S. oil spillU.S. energy envoy Hochstein calls investor hostility to shale drilling ""un-American"" -FT]"

11,c77cd3d8-9e6b-3093-b75e-451f161675c7,FE,2022-12-11,Energy & precious metals - weekly review and outlook,Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-precious-metals-weekly-review-051306274.html,1670735586,STORY,"['GLD', 'CL=F', 'GC=F']","[By Barani KrishnanInvesting.com -- Crude prices just had their worst week in nine months, driven by headlines about recession and a price cap on Russian oil, while barely paying heed to the comments of two men who typically dictate the market’s direction: Presidents Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping.Putin, the Russian president, threatened to cut production if the West’s “stupid” - yes, that’s what he called it - price cap on his country’s oil isn’t removed.Xi, the leader of China, spoke about buying more oil from Saudi Arabia and revived talk of using his country’s currency, the yuan, for trade with Gulf countries.“Meh”, said the market - or the equivalent of whatever - and continued going lower.It’s not that oil traders no longer find Putin or Xi interesting enough to follow. Under ordinary circumstances, both men can move crude prices in a heartbeat, with either words or policies.But these aren’t ordinary times in oil. If you haven’t noticed, the narrative in oil has drastically changed in the past two to three quarters.“Global doom and gloom outlooks have killed the crude demand outlook,” Ed Moya, analyst at online trading platform OANDA, wrote in a commentary published Friday.“The short-term crude demand outlook has deteriorated significantly as no one has a strong handle on how bad a recession will hit the US economy,” Moya said. “China’s COVID situation also remains a big concern as the end of their COVID-zero strategy could cripple their health system.”From a supply-dictated environment that sent a barrel of Brent to a 14-year high of almost $140 in March, the market is now dominated by demand concerns as traders worry about how the global economy will perform in 2023 if the Federal Reserve to the European Central Bank do not stop hiking rates to subdue inflation.Thus, the price cap of $60-per-barrel imposed on Russia’s crude isn’t meant to only limit the earnings from oil that go into funding Moscow’s war in Ukraine.Story continuesThe proponents of the price cap - comprising the Group of Seven major powers, the European Union and Australia - believe energy prices need to be curbed as well in order to offset the impact of a deep recession.Of course, to oil producers like Russia, that logic is just horse manure.""This will lead to the collapse of the industry itself, because the consumer will always insist that the price be lower,” said Putin. “The industry is already under-invested, under-funded, and if we listen only to consumers, then this investment will be reduced to zero.”""All this will lead at some stage to a catastrophic surge in prices and to the collapse of the global energy sector. This is a stupid proposal, ill-conceived and poorly thought-out.""His remarks showed how annoyed he was at the idea of the United States and its allies using Russia’s own oil as a weapon to try and stop its advance in Ukraine - never mind that he himself held the West hostage to Russian energy just months ago by threatening to cut off gas supplies to Europe.Putin said the West’s attempts to squeeze Russia’s oil earnings via the price cap won’t work as Russia was already selling its crude at around $60 per barrel.What he failed to realize perhaps was that traders were betting on the same thing - that the cap won’t really matter to Moscow for it to retaliate unless West Texas Intermediate and Brent prices go a lot higher (for a deeper dive on the price cap and what will really make it tick, read our analysis).Thus, when Putin hinted that Russia might retaliate with production cuts, the market was already aware there was no urgency for Moscow to do that. For good measure, Putin added that “concrete steps” will be outlined in a presidential decree “to be released in the next few days”. We patiently await that.In Xi’s case, he said China wants to buy more oil from Saudi Arabia and told Gulf leaders on Friday that his country aspired to use its yuan currency to trade oil and gas with them.The talks with China over yuan-priced oil contracts have been off and on for six years but have accelerated this year as the Saudis have grown increasingly unhappy with decades-old U.S. security commitments to defend the kingdom.The Saudis have also defied U.S. pressure to isolate fellow OPEC+ oil producer Russia over the Ukraine invasion.China buys more than 25% of the oil that Saudi Arabia exports. If its wish to get the Saudis to accept the yuan succeeds even remotely, it would go a long way in supporting Beijing's goal of establishing its currency internationally and weakening the dollar's grip on world trade.The last time Saudi Arabia was in active talks with Beijing over the use of the yuan for trade was in mid-March, when oil markets peaked during the early days of the Ukraine invasion.This time, Xi was touting the yen partnership at a highly-publicized state visit to Riyadh, where Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was hosting him to showcase the young royal’s ambition of expanding relations with Asia’s biggest power to give the diplomatic finger to the Arab world’s traditional partner: the United States.Xi said China will ""expand the scale of crude oil trade"" with Saudi Arabia.He then encouraged Gulf nations to make full use of the Shanghai Petroleum and National Gas Exchange as a platform to carry out yuan settlement of oil and gas trades.China and states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) are natural partners for cooperation, Xi added in his Riyadh speech.Oil traders listened and barely reacted - proving their minds were somewhere else.Oil: Market Settlements and Activity WTI, or New York-traded U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude, did a final trade of $71.59 on its January delivery crude after settling Friday’s official session down 44 cents, 0.6%, at $71.02 per barrel.The U.S. crude benchmark ended the week down $9.28, or 11.6%, making it its worst week since March 25.

Brent’s intraday low was $75.14 - a trough not seen since Dec 23, 2021 and less than 15 cents above the key $75 support.Brent was off 1.4% on the year, after being up 80% in March when it rose to just shy of $140 a barrel.The oil trade, meanwhile, was bracing for more volatility in 2023 as the West’s price cap on Russian oil and headwinds to global growth offset potential demand surges and supply crunches.“Choppy is the word to describe how oil markets are likely to be in the coming days and weeks,” said John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital.“There are worries about Europe in recession and of central banks over tightening to get a handle on inflation.

(NYSE:PM) may be sending bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 14x and even P/E's lower than 8x are not unusual. However, the P/E might be high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.While the market has experienced earnings growth lately, Philip Morris International's earnings have gone into reverse gear, which is not great. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn the corner. If not, then existing shareholders may be extremely nervous about the viability of the share price. View our latest analysis for Philip Morris International peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Philip Morris International will help you uncover what's on the horizon.Does Growth Match The High P/E?There's an inherent assumption that a company should outperform the market for P/E ratios like Philip Morris International's to be considered reasonable.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 2.4% decrease to the company's bottom line. This has soured the latest three-year period, which nevertheless managed to deliver a decent 17% overall rise in EPS. Accordingly, while they would have preferred to keep the run going, shareholders would be roughly satisfied with the medium-term rates of earnings growth.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 2.6% per year over the next three years. With the market predicted to deliver 9.0% growth per annum, the company is positioned for a weaker earnings result.In light of this, it's alarming that Philip Morris International's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are hoping for a turnaround in the company's business prospects, but the analyst cohort is not so confident this will happen. There's a good chance these shareholders are setting themselves up for future disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.Story continuesThe Final WordUsing the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.Our examination of Philip Morris International's analyst forecasts revealed that its inferior earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E anywhere near as much as we would have predicted. Right now we are increasingly uncomfortable with the high P/E as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. This places shareholders' investments at significant risk and potential investors in danger of paying an excessive premium.Plus, you should also learn about this   1 warning sign we've spotted with Philip Morris International.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates.

(NYSE:GS) sold US$19m worth of stock at an average price of US$362 a share over the past year, making the most of their investment. After the stock price dropped 5.6% last week, the company's market value declined by US$7.6b, but insiders were able to mitigate their losses.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Goldman Sachs GroupThe President &amp; COO, John Waldron, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$5.2m worth of shares at a price of US$387 each. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$359. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.Insiders in Goldman Sachs Group didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Goldman Sachs Group Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Goldman Sachs Group shares. In total, insiders dumped US$12m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Does Goldman Sachs Group Boast High Insider Ownership?I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Goldman Sachs Group insiders own 0.4% of the company, currently worth about US$533m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Goldman Sachs Group Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders haven't bought Goldman Sachs Group stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Goldman Sachs Group. While conducting our analysis, we found that Goldman Sachs Group has 2 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore them.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, TJX Companies has been doing relatively well. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. Check out our latest analysis for TJX Companies peKeen to find out how analysts think TJX Companies' future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Does Growth Match The High P/E?TJX Companies' P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.Taking a look back first, we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 31% last year. As a result, it also grew EPS by 14% in total over the last three years. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been respectable for the company.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 14% each year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 9.0% each year, which is noticeably less attractive.In light of this, it's understandable that TJX Companies' P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.The Final WordWe'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.Story continuesWe've established that TJX Companies maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.Before you take the next step, you should know about the 2 warning signs for TJX Companies (1 can't be ignored!) that we have uncovered.If P/E ratios interest you, you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have grown earnings strongly and trade on P/E's below 20x.Have feedback on this article?

32,01210454-bc90-36c4-8193-83f064063f66,AMGN,2022-12-11,Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 82% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amgen-inc-nasdaq-amgn-largely-110058965.html,1670756458,STORY,['AMGN'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 82% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Amgen. View our latest analysis for Amgen ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Amgen?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Amgen. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Amgen's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Amgen. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.2% of shares outstanding. With 8.9% and 5.4% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 21 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of AmgenThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Amgen Inc. in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$237m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 18% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Amgen. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for Amgen  you should be aware of.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

33,8cbcac9b-43ba-3c81-abba-1764163285a3,ZTS,2022-12-11,Zoetis (NYSE:ZTS) shareholders have earned a 17% CAGR over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zoetis-nyse-zts-shareholders-earned-120109236.html,1670760069,STORY,['ZTS'],"[The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For instance, the price of Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) stock is up an impressive 113% over the last five years. In the last week shares have slid back 2.6%.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. Check out our latest analysis for Zoetis While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Zoetis managed to grow its earnings per share at 18% a year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 16% average annual increase in the share price. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Zoetis' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Zoetis, it has a TSR of 120% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 19% in the twelve months, Zoetis shareholders did even worse, losing 33% (even including dividends). However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 17% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Even so, be aware that  Zoetis is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...Of course Zoetis may not be the best stock to buy.

(NYSE:NEE) insiders filled their treasuries with US$6.5m worth of stock over last year",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bullish-nextera-energy-inc-nyse-130048942.html,1670763648,STORY,"['NEE', 'NEE-PR']","[Quite a few insiders have dramatically grown their holdings in NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) over the past 12 months. An insider's optimism about the company's prospects is a positive sign.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for NextEra Energy NextEra Energy Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when insider James Robo bought US$5.0m worth of shares at a price of US$77.26 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, at around the current price, which is US$84.51. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. We do always like to see insider buying, but it is worth noting if those purchases were made at well below today's share price, as the discount to value may have narrowed with the rising price. In this case we're pleased to report that the insider purchases were made at close to current prices.While NextEra Energy insiders bought shares during the last year, they didn't sell. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeNextEra Energy is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.Insider Ownership Of NextEra EnergyFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. NextEra Energy insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$280m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The NextEra Energy Insider Transactions Indicate?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded NextEra Energy shares in the last quarter. But insiders have shown more of an appetite for the stock, over the last year. Judging from their transactions, and high insider ownership, NextEra Energy insiders feel good about the company's future. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Be aware that NextEra Energy is showing 2 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 1 of those makes us a bit uncomfortable...Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

The Covid-19 pandemic actually slowed its progress. But innovation delayed is not the same as innovation denied. Indeed, 5G is going to impact many aspects of our life. And that means it’s time for investors to look at the best 5G stock picks for 2023.5G is most frequently thought of in terms of wireless technology (e.g. a 5G smartphone). And there’s no denying that an increasing number of devices from automobile to industrial devices will benefit from the shift to 5G. One of the most anticipated product launches was the 5G version of the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone.That said, the uses for 5G continue to expand as businesses move more of their infrastructure to the cloud. Accordingly, that gives investors many different ways to invest in 5G stocks. In this article, we identify seven of the top 5G stock picks for 2023.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTMUST-Mobile$149.19DISHDish Network$14.49QCOMQualcomm$118.14AVGOBroadcom$518.80GLWCorning$33.09CCICrown Castle$138.06AMZNAmazon$88.48T-Mobile (TMUS)tmobile (TMUS) logo on an office building facadeSource: ShutterstockThe race is on among wireless device providers to capture market share. So far, T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) remains the leader. And since its acquisition of Sprint, T-Mobile stands to capture a larger share of that pie. In the company’s most recent quarter, T-Mobile added over 850,000 postpaid phone subscribers which was significantly higher than analysts’ estimates for 739,000.T-Mobile also stands to benefit from more than $100 billion that the U.S. government is designating for the U.S. broadband buildout. As the nation’s second-largest wireless carrier, T-Mobile is working with Citigroup (NYSE:C) to find partners for the creation of a fiber-optic network that targets the home broadband market.TMUS stock is up over 30% in 2022. The stock is not cheap by conventional price-earnings metrics. However, even though T-Mobile is trading near the top of its 52-week range, analysts give the stock a consensus price target that suggests 15% upside for the stock is reasonable.Story continuesDish Network (DISH)A van for DISH Network (DISH) is parked.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comDish Network (NASDAQ:DISH) makes this list of 5G stock picks for 2023 because it is preparing to launch 5G Infinite in the first quarter of 2023. This will give Dish Network a first mover advantage as the “first virtualized, standalone 5G broadband network” in the United States. Early reports say the company will be offering customers a $25 per month for life plan.There is a risk that the company will be delayed in its execution. In November, Dish raised $2 billion in a secured debt offering to fund the expansion. The goal will be 70% coverage by June 2023. This could be the last remaining piece of the puzzle for DISH stock, which is undervalued by several metrics, but shows understandably slowing growth in its legacy satellite business.This is attracting the attention of analysts who give DISH stock a moderate buy rating with a price target that has an upside of more than 145%.Qualcomm (QCOM)Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on a large sign with another sign that says 5GSource: Xixi Fu / Shutterstock.comAs I mentioned in the introduction, the Apple 5G iPhone has been one of the most anticipated launches in 2022. As Larry Ramer recently wrote, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) told investors it expects to provide “the vast majority” of the components that Apple will use in its 5G iPhones in 2023.The relationship between Qualcomm and Apple will remain something to watch. However, even Apple becomes less reliant on Qualcomm, the company is well-positioned for the 5G build-out. To elaborate on this, I’ll refer to Louis Navallier who reminded InvestorPlace readers that the company “owns several patents that are critical to the manufacturing of semiconductors” that will be needed to make 5G technology possible.QCOM stock dropped sharply after its November earnings report. But the stock has recaptured those losses, and offers attractive profitability and valuation metrics. Plus, analysts give the stock a moderate buy rating with a consensus price target that shows potential upside of over 30%.Broadcom (AVGO)broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office buildingSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.comQualcomm provides many of the components needed to manufacture semiconductors. Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) supplies the semiconductors themselves as well as some of the related technology. While this article is focusing on 5G stock picks for 2023, Broadcom will also benefit from the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT).Additionally, looking at the company’s revenue and earnings results for the first three quarters of 2022, you can see that demand remains strong. That demand is combined with strong fundamentals. As Brett Kenwell recently noted, Broadcom is a free cash flow generating machine, and that cash flow is being returned to shareholders in many ways, including a dividend that has been growing for 12 years and has a yield of over 3%.Broadcom is also an example of the difference between price and value. While AVGO stock still trades for over $525 a share at the time of this writing, analysts continue to rate the stock as a moderate buy with a price target of over $670.Corning (GLW)Image of a 5G telephone poleSource: ShutterstockCorning (NYSE:GLW) is a different kind of picks-and-shovels investment in 5G technology. The company makes fiber optic cable. This will be essential to ensuring that 5G networks can handle increased transmission speeds and capacity 5G networks bring.Earlier this year, Corning’s TXF fiber achieved 800G across 800km, offering proof that this product is a key solution to the long-haul transmission problem. TXF fiber will be significant for areas such as data centers, robotics and medical devices.Corning is also an essential supplier to semiconductor companies. The company provides a range of solutions that are helping to make chips smaller and more complex. And when the company does make sales they do so with a profit margin that, at over 12%, is better than 99% of companies in its sector.Corning met expectations for revenue and earnings in its most recent earnings report. However, for the first three quarters of 2022, the company has been beating its year-over-year comparables on both the top and bottom lines. Additionally, Corning pays a reliable dividend that has a yield over 3% and has been increasing for the last 11 years.Crown Castle (CCI)Real estate investment trust REIT on an office desk.Source: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / ShutterstockIf 2023 goes the way that many economists believe it will, than real estate investment trusts (REITs) will continue to attract the attention of investors. That’s one reason that Crown Castle (NYSE:CCI) makes this list of 5G stock picks for 2023.However, to be more specific, Crown Castle is the market leader in providing the small cells that are required for the build-out of 5G. The company says it has approximately 115,000 small cells that are either “on air” or under contract. And Crown Castle believes that the nation will need over 800,000 small cells by 2026. This makes the decision to buy CCI stock pretty simple.REITs aren’t known for a lot of capital growth. However, CCI stock is forecasted to grow approximately 20% over the next 12 months. That being said, investors own REITs for their reliable dividends. And with a yield of over 4%, CCI stock doesn’t disappoint. Plus, the company has increased their dividend in each of the last eight years.Amazon (AMZN)Amazon LOGO ON THE SIDE OF A BUILDING.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comLast, but certainly not least on this list of best 5G stocks for 2023, is Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The reason for that has to do with its Amazon Web Services (AWS) division. That’s the division that houses the company’s Private 5G platform.As 5G expands, so is the desire for private 5G networks that live on the edge of a network. That’s what Amazon is providing with what it refers to as its “5G in a box” service. The company acknowledges that this is far from a finished product and there are obstacles to be overcome. Nevertheless, Amazon sees a long runway ahead for the private 5G sector. And it’s hard to bet against the company if it decides it wants to make a meaningful splash.AWS continues to generate significant profits for Amazon. In fact, it was one of the few bright spots in the company’s most recent earnings report. 5G is an emerging story, but one that that gives investors an additional reason to buy AMZN stock.On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines. Chris Markoch is a freelance financial copywriter who has been covering the market for over five years.

39,ed9bffe9-ce82-3d2f-92b1-48cba18d4830,LMT,2022-12-11,Is Lockheed Martin Corporation's (NYSE:LMT) Latest Stock Performance A Reflection Of Its Financial Health?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lockheed-martin-corporations-nyse-lmt-120120598.html,1670760080,STORY,['LMT'],"[Lockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) stock is up by a considerable 15% over the past three months. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Lockheed Martin's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Lockheed Martin is:49% = US$5.9b ÷ US$12b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.49.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Lockheed Martin's Earnings Growth And 49% ROETo begin with, Lockheed Martin has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 10% the company's ROE is quite impressive. This likely paved the way for the modest 14% net income growth seen by Lockheed Martin over the past five years. growthWe then compared Lockheed Martin's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 5.8% in the same period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is LMT fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Lockheed Martin Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Lockheed Martin has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 42% (or a retention ratio of 58%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.Additionally, Lockheed Martin has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 47% of its profits over the next three years. However, Lockheed Martin's ROE is predicted to rise to 63% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio.SummaryIn total, we are pretty happy with Lockheed Martin's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

Even after significant expected discounts, the deal would be worth tens of billions of dollars and cap a volatile year for plane giants whose jets are again in demand after the pandemic, but who face mounting industrial and environmental pressures.It would also allow Airbus to secure a home for some A350 production slots initially earmarked for Russia's Aeroflot and now left open because of war-related sanctions against Moscow.Airbus and Boeing declined to comment. Tata Group-owned Air India did not respond to a request for comment.China last week delivered its first C919 jetliner but is at least a decade away from competing on such a scale, experts say.The potential blockbuster order comes days after Tata announced the merger of Air India with Vistara, a joint-venture with Singapore Airlines, to create a bigger full-service carrier and strengthen its presence in domestic and international skies. That deal gives Tata a fleet of 218 aircraft, cementing Air India as the country's largest international carrier and second largest in the domestic market after leader IndiGoBuying debt-ridden Air India has also given Tata access to valuable flying rights and landing slots, especially to destinations in the United States and Europe.Story continuesHURDLES TO GROWTHAir India's maharajah mascot was once synonymous with lavishly decorated planes and stellar service but its reputation declined in the mid-2000s as financial troubles mounted. Founded by JRD Tata in 1932, Air India was nationalised in 1953. Tata regained control in January and has since been working to revive its reputation as a world-class airline.The order reflects a strategy to re-capture a solid share of trips between India's large overseas diaspora and cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, dominated by foreign rivals such as Emirates.Air India also wants to win a bigger share of regional international traffic and the domestic market, setting up a battle on both fronts with IndiGo.Delivered over the next decade, the 500 jets would replace and expand fleets in the world's fastest-growing air travel market, while contributing to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's goal of expanding the economy to $5 trillion.But experts warn many hurdles stand in the way of Air India's ambition to recover a strong global position, including frail domestic infrastructure, pilot shortages and the threat of tough competition with established Gulf and other carriers.It may also struggle to get the medium-haul Airbus A321neos being ordered for the Air India-Vistara tie-up as quickly as it would like, with the European planemaker sold out until 2028 or beyond.One industry source said new Boeing 737 MAXs will most likely go to Air India Express, the company's budget operator which could be renamed.Insiders say plane and engine makers have been clamouring at Air India's door for months, with new Chief Executive Campbell Wilson refusing to rush the make-or-break fleet decision.Reuters reported in July that Air India was taking more time to study Airbus A350s and Boeing wide-body 787 and 777 models, on top of a probable mixed order for smaller single-aisle jets.Last month, Campbell confirmed talks to ""greatly expand"" Air India's fleet over the next five years and said, ""At the risk of gross understatement, the investment will be substantial.""(Reporting by Tim Hepher, Aditi Shah; Editing by Jane Merriman and Crispian Balmer)]"

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Cigna Crunching The NumbersWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$8.18bUS$10.0bUS$8.60bUS$9.01bUS$9.14bUS$9.28bUS$9.44bUS$9.61bUS$9.79bUS$9.97bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 1.44%Est @ 1.6%Est @ 1.71%Est @ 1.79%Est @ 1.85%Est @ 1.89% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$7.6kUS$8.8kUS$7.0kUS$6.9kUS$6.5kUS$6.2kUS$5.9kUS$5.6kUS$5.4kUS$5.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$65bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$10.0b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.0%) = US$205bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$205b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$105bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$170b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$332, the company appears quite good value at a 40% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Cigna as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.889. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

(NYSE:TEL) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 3rd of March to $0.56. This takes the annual payment to 1.8% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for TE Connectivity TE Connectivity's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWe like a dividend to be consistent over the long term, so checking whether it is sustainable is important. However, prior to this announcement, TE Connectivity's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 15.6%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 27% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendTE Connectivity Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.72 in 2012 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.24. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 12% per annum over that time. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. TE Connectivity has impressed us by growing EPS at 12% per year over the past five years. TE Connectivity definitely has the potential to grow its dividend in the future with earnings on an uptrend and a low payout ratio.We Really Like TE Connectivity's DividendIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For example, we've picked out 1 warning sign for TE Connectivity that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock.

44,b7aff5c7-51a4-3780-aa16-de03ab34ac2c,NKE,2022-12-11,7 Dow Stocks to Sell Before They Dive in 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-dow-stocks-sell-dive-220024967.html,1670450424,STORY,"['NKE', 'UNH', 'IBM', 'CRM', 'DIS', 'BA', '^DJI']","[While the 30 companies listed under the venerable Dow Jones Industrial Average, not all securities can succeed at the same time, necessitating an uncomfortable discussion about which Dow stocks to sell. Given the rough year we’ve had along with a questionable macroeconomic backdrop for next year, investors may want to jettison some problematic market ideas.To be clear, picking out Dow stocks to sell natively generates controversy because each enterprise had to work hard to receive the honor. It’s like the World Cup: if you’re in, you’re among the elites of the planet. That said, some teams will perform better than others.For this list, I’ve recruited the services of Gurufocus.com, presenting ideas that the investment resource considers relatively overvalued. As well, some inquiries may be had about the targeted companies’ fiscal resilience and/or fundamental relevance. If you’re not put off by the concept entirely, here are Dow stocks to sell.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBABoeing$176.50CRMSalesforce$130.48DISDisney$92.15IBMInternational Business Machines$147.27UNHUnitedHealth$542.91NKENike$108.33VVisa$207.81Boeing (BA)An image of a money bomb with a spark on the end of its string.Source: ShutterstockIf you’ve been following the news for the last few years, the inclusion of aerospace giant Boeing (NYSE:BA) among the Dow stocks to sell probably comes as no surprise. Fundamentally, the enterprise brings arguably the most questions to the table. Without beating an expired horse, Boeing continues to suffer headwinds from safety issues related to its 737 Max jetliner.Naturally, the obstacles translated to some of the worst financial profiles among Dow stocks to sell. At the time of writing, the market prices BA stock at 56 times forward earnings. In contrast, the sector median value is only 19.5 times. Stated differently, BA shares overvaluation is worse than 96% of the aerospace and defense industry.On average, its gross margin sits 1.4% below parity, presenting challenges regarding economies of scale. Not only that, but its operating and net margins also dropped into negative territory. Combined with a distressed balance sheet, Boeing is best left for hardened speculators.Story continuesSalesforce (CRM)stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockOnce a blisteringly strong inclusion in the Dow 30, the market paradigm shift this year might make Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) one of the Dow stocks to sell. On a year-to-date basis, CRM slipped nearly 48%, drawing concerns even among gamblers. With the broader technology space disproportionately suffering from the Federal Reserve’s commitment to rising interest rates, Salesforce cuts a worrying profile.Moreover, macroeconomic headwinds forced management to make headcount cuts to its sales team. In particular, it wasn’t a great look because earlier, Salesforce nearly tripled its workforce in the past five years. As well, the specter of wider cuts exists should an aggressively hawkish Fed cause the economy to fall into recession.Financially, CRM appears overpriced relative to traditional valuation metrics. Currently, its price-earnings ratio stands at 476 times. On a less-glaring note, its forward PE is 23.7 times, which sits almost right on the nose with the sector median value.Disney (DIS)A white clock indicates it's time to sell.Source: ShutterstockJust for full transparency, I made a speculative bullish case before about Disney (NYSE:DIS). Earlier in the new normal, the extended months of lockdowns and mitigation measures sparked the revenge travel phenomenon. However, as consumers scratched the underlying social experience itch, they started to run low on discretionary funds.While I don’t want to overstate the narrative, it’s possible that entertainment consumption is finally returning home. With a global recession perhaps on the horizon, now’s not a great time to go on exotic vacations. Still, people want escapism, especially during hard times. Therefore, Disney’s cheap entertainment offerings such as its Disney+ streaming service could see increased demand.Here’s the rub, though: it’s a risky proposition against traditional valuation metrics. Currently, the market prices DIS at 53.7-times trailing earnings and 22.3-times forward earnings. Both represent terrible stats, ranking worse than at least 74% of the competition. Thus, conservative investors might consider Disney to be one of the Dow stocks to sell.IBM (IBM)a frustrated man with a white board behind him that features a black downward arrowSource: ShutterstockRunning through Gurufocus.com’s screener for Dow stocks to sell, IBM (NYSE:IBM) is the one that hurts. In my view, I believe Big Blue offers much for investors willing to ride some choppy waters. Conspicuously, IBM returned over 8% of equity value since the beginning of the year. That’s a far better performance than most other tech firms. For instance, the Nasdaq Composite index slipped 30.4% YTD.In addition, IBM provides a generous source of passive income with a forward yield of 4.47%. As well, the company enjoys 28 years of consecutive dividend increases. It’s a status that management will not want to give up. So, why consider it one of the Dow stocks to sell?Again, I don’t. Still, looking at the matter objectively, IBM may be overvalued. For instance, the market prices shares at 6.6-times book value, ranking worse than 83% of its peers. Also, the company’s balance sheet leaves much to be desired. For example, its cash-to-debt ratio is only 0.18 times, worse than almost 90% of the underlying industry.UnitedHealth (UNH)a keyboard with a greet enter key marked sell, representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockFor book smart investors, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) may come off as an ideal play under present circumstances. That’s because in general, the relationship between insurance stocks and interest rates is linear: as one metric moves up, so too does the other. Sure enough, UNH gained over 7% for the year so far. In contrast, the Dow Jones index slipped more than 8% during the same period.Nevertheless, an argument exists that UNH may be carrying too rich a premium. While Gurufocus.com labels UNH as fairly valued based on its proprietary calculations, the market prices shares at 26.4-times trailing earnings and 21.6-times forward earnings. Both stats are awful, each ranking worse than at least 92% of the competition.Another factor to consider is that UNH is priced at 6.8-times book value, far exceeding the sector median’s 1.9 times. As well, UNH’s price-to-free-cash-flow ratio is 16.4 times, worse than nearly 87% of the industry. Therefore, if your priority centers on discounted opportunities, then UNH ranks among the Dow stocks to sell.Nike (NKE)sell written on a chalkboard representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockTechnically speaking, Nike (NYSE:NKE) presents an intriguing case that doesn’t quite comprehensively fit the narrative of Dow stocks to sell. True, since the January opener, NKE gave up more than 34% of its equity value. At the same time, in the trailing month, shares gained over 15%, possibly indicating a recovery move.Nevertheless, fundamental concerns abound for the sports apparel and footwear icon. For one thing, consumer sentiment trends near all-time recorded lows. Frankly, macro pressures will do nothing to mitigate this concern. Also, the personal saving rate cratered since skyrocketing to blistering heights during the early days of the pandemic. Put another way, people may have less discretionary funds lying around, making NKE a potential candidate for Dow stocks to sell.Against financial metrics, NKE appears overpriced. While Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value disagree, investors should realize that Wall Street prices Nike shares at 36.7 times forward earnings. This stat ranks worse than 97% of the company’s peers. At the very least, one should be careful with NKE.Visa (V)a businessman with his thumb facing downSource: ShutterstockPerhaps the most perplexing market idea on this list of possible Dow stocks to sell, Visa (NYSE:V) presents both a bullish and bearish argument. On the positive front, the financial services firm may enjoy upside relevance as a credit card company. Basically, Visa allows households to stretch their budgets, which might come in handy during these rough economic waters.Still, I’m not entirely sure how sustainable this argument stands. Throughout this year, we’ve seen companies – particularly tech firms – announce significant layoffs. The more high-paying white-collar jobs get the axe, the less likely debtholders will pay back their obligations. Therefore, the broader narrative for Visa may depend on some semblance of economic viability.Even in the financial department, Visa presents a tricky framework. While the company enjoys a solid balance sheet, decent sales growth, and excellent profit margins, it’s also hampered by valuation concerns. Particularly, the market prices Visa at 25.3 times forward earnings, worse than nearly 93% of the underlying industry.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 74% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).And so it follows that institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$162b last week after a 7.5% drop in the share price. This set of investors may especially be concerned about the current loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 13% for shareholders. Often called “market makers”, institutions wield significant power in influencing the price dynamics of any stock. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell Wells Fargo, which might have negative implications on individual investors.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Wells Fargo. See our latest analysis for Wells Fargo ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Wells Fargo?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Wells Fargo. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Wells Fargo, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Wells Fargo. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.6% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 6.9% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.2% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Wells FargoThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Wells Fargo &amp; Company insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$95m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 26% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Wells Fargo. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Wells Fargo better, we need to consider many other factors.

""These longer-term results show early and deep responses with elranatamab in a heavily pretreated patient population, adding to the growing body of evidence showing elranatamab has the potential to be a transformative option in an area of high need.""Elranatamab is an investigational humanized BsAb that targets both BCMA-expressing multiple myeloma cells and CD3-expressing T-cells, bridging them together and activating the T-cells to kill the myeloma cells. The binding affinities of elranatamab for BCMA and CD3 have been engineered to elicit potent T-cell-mediated anti-myeloma activity. Given factors currently limiting the availability of novel therapies in the triple-class exposed setting, elranatamab has the potential to reach a broader and greater number of patients as an off-the-shelf option that is administered subcutaneously (SC), which offers more convenience over intravenous administration.Story continuesIn this analysis, safety and efficacy were analyzed in 123 patients who had received at least one dose of elranatamab (cohort A – BCMA-naïve) as of the data cut-off on October 14, 2022. Patients received SC elranatamab 76 mg weekly (QW) on a 28-day cycle with a step-up priming dose regimen, 12 mg and 32 mg administered on Day 1 and Day 4, respectively, during Cycle 1. With a median follow up of 10.4 months, patients who received elranatamab achieved a high objective response rate of 61%, with 84% probability of maintaining response at nine months. Probability of progression-free survival and overall survival were 63% and 70%, respectively, at nine months. The results also suggest elranatamab has a manageable safety profile and that the two-step-up priming dose regimen (12/32 mg) mitigated the rate and severity of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) (58%, all Grade 1/2) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS, 3%, all Grade 1/2) in cohort A of MagnetisMM-3 (n=119). The most common hematologic treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of any grade were – anemia (48%), neutropenia (48%), thrombocytopenia (30%) and lymphopenia (26%).""Discovered and developed at Pfizer, elranatamab is just one example of our focus on investing in breakthrough science. We're applying our expertise in hematology developed over a decade to advance elranatamab as an innovative treatment for multiple myeloma,"" said Chris Boshoff, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Development Officer, Oncology and Rare Disease, Pfizer Global Product Development. ""We are excited to be sharing our latest research at ASH, which further supports the efficacy and safety of elranatamab, and will continue to evaluate its potential benefits through the MagnetisMM clinical trial program across earlier and broader populations, including newly diagnosed patients. We are excited by the potential for elranatamab, if approved, to reach a greater number of patients globally across the treatment paradigm.""Additional Pfizer elranatamab presentations at ASH include:Elranatamab, a BCMA Targeted T-Cell Engaging Bispecific Antibody, Induces Durable Clinical and Molecular Responses for Patients with RRMM (abstract 158, oral)MagnetisMM-1 Phase 1/2 first in human MagnetisMM-1 study (NCT03269136)Safety and preliminary efficacy results from Part 1 (safety lead-in cohort) of MagnetisMM-5, a Phase 3 study of elranatamab + daratumumab in patients with RRMM (NCT05020236) (poster 1921)MagnetisMM-4: An Open Label, Phase 1b/2 Umbrella Study of Elranatamab in Combination with Other Anti-cancer Treatments for Patients with Multiple Myeloma (poster 4567)Phase 1b/2 MagnetisMM-4 (NCT05090566) ongoing clinical trialDose Optimization to Mitigate the Risk of CRS with Elranatamab in Multiple Myeloma (poster 3192)Dose-optimization analysis from across MagnetisMM-1 (NCT03269136), MagnetisMM-2 (NCT04798586), MagnetisMM-3 (NCT04649359) and MagnetisMM-9 (NCT05014412)A Systematic Meta-analysis of Cytokine Release Syndrome Incidence in B-Cell Maturation Antigen-Targeting Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell Therapy and Bispecific Antibodies for Patients with Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma (poster 4509)Meta-analysis of CRS among patients treated with BCMA-targeting CAR-Ts and BsAbs across 53 studiesMagnetisMM-3 (NCT04649359) is an ongoing open-label, multicenter, non-randomized study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of elranatamab as monotherapy in patients with RRMM. Additional data continue to be collected and will be shared as they mature. Prior to enrollment, participants had received a median of five lines of treatment. The participants included in this study represent a difficult-to-treat multiple myeloma patient population; almost all (97%) of the 123 patients included in this analysis were triple-class refractory and nearly half (42%) were penta-drug refractory*. The trial is part of the robust MagnetisMM multiple indication clinical research program that expands to additional patient populations over time, with ongoing registration-intent trials that explore elranatamab both as monotherapy and in combination with standard or novel therapies, spanning multiple patient populations from newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, double-class exposed disease and RRMM.In November 2022, Pfizer announced elranatamab received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of RRMM. Elranatamab has also been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of MM. The FDA and EMA have granted elranatamab Fast Track Designation and the PRIME scheme, respectively, for the treatment of patients with RRMM. The UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has also granted elranatamab Innovative Medicine Designation and the Innovation Passport for the treatment of MM.* Penta-drug refers to at least 2 proteosome inhibitors, 2 immunomodulatory drugs, and 1 anti-CD38 antibody.About Multiple MyelomaMultiple myeloma is a blood cancer that affects plasma cells made in the bone marrow. Healthy plasma cells make antibodies that help the body fight infection. There are over 34,000 new cases of multiple myeloma diagnosed annually in the U.S. and 176,000 globally.1,2 Despite treatment advances, there is currently no cure.

In the current economic environment, investors are gravitating toward dividend stocks to steadily increase the value of their investments. Historically, dividend stocks outperformed the market during recessionary periods.According to a report by AllianceBernstein, dividend-paying stocks have a long-term return potential and are a hedge against inflation. From 1971 to August 2022, high-dividend stocks delivered a risk-adjusted return of 0.83%, compared with a 0.71% return from the broader market during the same period. The report also mentioned that returns of high-dividend stocks are positively correlated with inflation during previous inflationary periods. Not only do dividend stocks perform better during periods of economic downturn, but these securities have also repeatedly outpaced inflation in the past. Quality companies tend to increase their payouts during these periods. In the past 15 years ending August 2022, the average dividend growth came in at 13.71% versus a 2.21% growth in the Consumer Price Index, as reported by S&amp;P Global. The report also referred to the data by IHS Markit, mentioning that the year-over-year dividend growth for the next four quarters is expected to be at 6.7%.When investing in dividend stocks, investors are advised to focus on the respective companies’ dividend growth track records and cash flows.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see 5 Most Trusted Companies in the World.Companies are created not just to provide solutions that previously did not exist, but also to provide returns to shareholders in the form of profits. This is one of the reasons why companies have a strong focus on growth in both revenue and profits. The issue is, often times, corporations in their bid to achieve new highs, forget about customers or consumers and engage in unethical activities which can breach the trust placed in them. Sometimes, the mistrust is unfounded such as coining the term ""Big Pharma"" which alludes to major pharmaceutical companies colluding to achieve sinister purposes such as coming up with the cure for cancer but not making it public among other implausible suggestions. However, sometimes they are right and corporations engage in both unethical and illegal behavior to maximize profits. This is how major companies established for decades folded such as Enron and WorldCom, where both companies engaged in deceptive accounting practices to overstate profits and upon discovery, ended up filing for bankruptcy. Their audit firm, Arthur Anderson, at the time one of the largest audit firms in the world, collapsed after details of its misleading accounting practices for the two aforementioned companies were made public.The scandals associated with the above companies, which had billions of dollars worth of assets, shook public confidence and even led to the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which mandates some practices in financial accounting and record keeping. However, if you expected the situation to improve, it is likely worse than it has ever been before. In an era of false information being spread like the gospel and the gap between the rich and the poor increasing, the scrutiny and lack of trust faced by corporations is a real concern. According to research by PwC in 2016, more than half the CEOs surveyed stated that the lack of trust is a significant threat for an organization to grow. Meanwhile, according to the Edelman Trust Barometer in 2019, 73% of respondents globally expressed concern about false information being used as a weapon, something which can further sew discontent and mistrust. According to a Harvard Business Review analysis, nearly two-thirds of global senior executives believed that trust among people and businesses was declining. Some of the reasons behind this mistrust pertains to cybersecurity exploits which lead to the leaking of personal data of people. Most will remember the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal, where Cambridge Analytica would collect the data of millions of Facebook users without any permission from them, which was then used for political advertising mainly. The data's misuse was exposed in 2018 and reports suggest that between Cambridge Analytica gathered data from between 50 million to 87 million profiles.Story continues15 most trustworthy companies in the worldVGstockstudio/Shutterstock.comSpeaking of Facebook, its parent company Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is among the least trusted companies in the world. Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) was initially hailed as the biggest social media company in the world by far, and in fact, was influential in ushering in the dawn of social media, only to now be derided for its many controversies. One of the primary controversies surrounding Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) is the spread of fake news and how easy it is, allowing incidents such as Russian bots attempting to influence the American Presidential elections or simply the spread of fake news. According to Business Insider, in September 2020, Facebook ranked last in digital trust among consumers, showing how the mighty giant has fallen in recent times, something reflected in its nosediving share price too.When the pandemic hit in 2020, many companies and businesses suffered across the globe as most countries went into lockdowns to avoid the spread of disease. However, in many countries, and especially in the United States, companies were given huge loans, ostensibly to pay employees and ensure they didn't go under, but many such loans were made to millionaire or major companies which laid off employees. A lot of these loans were then forgiven after just submitting a one page form instead of any robust review. In fact, according to NPR, 91% of all such loans were either partially or completely forgiven, while many people struggled to even afford proper meals. Corporations laid off millions of people leading to record unemployment in several countries including the U.S. even as the profits of such companies did not drop as much. In fact, many companies have since reported record profits in 2021 as the pandemic eased and none of these profits or benefits have been passed on to employees or even consumers, who have had to pay higher prices in an era where a recession is imminent and inflation has reached levels rarely seen before. The juxtaposition of companies enjoying record profits while people struggle to make ends meet because of high levels of inflations has furthered the mistrust in corporations, which is at an all-time high right now.Of course, that's not to say that companies aren't trusted at all. The most trusted companies in the world have worked hard to ensure that they are seen as shining lights in an era where the default assumption is that corporations are only looking out for themselves. These companies are generally multinationals with operations in several countries and are often household names as well. Trust is a complex and subjective concept, and different people and organizations may have different opinions about which companies are the most trustworthy. Additionally, trust can change over time based on a variety of factors, such as a company's financial performance, its treatment of employees, and its reputation for ethical behavior. As a result, it is difficult to definitively identify the most trusted companies in the world. To determine the most trusted companies in the world, we looked at various lists and gave the highest rankings to companies which appeared on the greatest number of lists. So, without further ado, let's take a look at some of the companies which have earnt the trust of consumers, starting with number 15:15. 3M Company (NYE:MMM)One of the biggest industrial companies in the world, 3M Company (NYE:MMM), 3M Company (NYE:MMM) produces more than 60,000 goods which include abrasives, adhesives, passive fire protection and personal protective equipment among many others. 3M Company (NYE:MMM) has also continued to commit to high ethical standards in order to improve its business while simultaneously having a positive impact on the planet, and details these plans through it Sustainability Report.14. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a financial technology company which operates in most countries which support online money transfer. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) used end-t0-end encryption and two factor authentication which ensures that the sums being transferred are safe from any malfeasance or manipulation.

The company is known for its commitment to security and convenience, and it has a large and dedicated customer base. In 2015, PayPal was spun off from its parent company eBay and became a separate publicly-traded company. Today, it operates in more than 200 countries and has over 300 million active users.13.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see 5 Most Trusted Companies in the World.Companies are created not just to provide solutions that previously did not exist, but also to provide returns to shareholders in the form of profits. This is one of the reasons why companies have a strong focus on growth in both revenue and profits. The issue is, often times, corporations in their bid to achieve new highs, forget about customers or consumers and engage in unethical activities which can breach the trust placed in them. Sometimes, the mistrust is unfounded such as coining the term ""Big Pharma"" which alludes to major pharmaceutical companies colluding to achieve sinister purposes such as coming up with the cure for cancer but not making it public among other implausible suggestions. However, sometimes they are right and corporations engage in both unethical and illegal behavior to maximize profits. This is how major companies established for decades folded such as Enron and WorldCom, where both companies engaged in deceptive accounting practices to overstate profits and upon discovery, ended up filing for bankruptcy. Their audit firm, Arthur Anderson, at the time one of the largest audit firms in the world, collapsed after details of its misleading accounting practices for the two aforementioned companies were made public.The scandals associated with the above companies, which had billions of dollars worth of assets, shook public confidence and even led to the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which mandates some practices in financial accounting and record keeping. However, if you expected the situation to improve, it is likely worse than it has ever been before. In an era of false information being spread like the gospel and the gap between the rich and the poor increasing, the scrutiny and lack of trust faced by corporations is a real concern. According to research by PwC in 2016, more than half the CEOs surveyed stated that the lack of trust is a significant threat for an organization to grow. Meanwhile, according to the Edelman Trust Barometer in 2019, 73% of respondents globally expressed concern about false information being used as a weapon, something which can further sew discontent and mistrust. According to a Harvard Business Review analysis, nearly two-thirds of global senior executives believed that trust among people and businesses was declining. Some of the reasons behind this mistrust pertains to cybersecurity exploits which lead to the leaking of personal data of people. Most will remember the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal, where Cambridge Analytica would collect the data of millions of Facebook users without any permission from them, which was then used for political advertising mainly. The data's misuse was exposed in 2018 and reports suggest that between Cambridge Analytica gathered data from between 50 million to 87 million profiles.Story continues15 most trustworthy companies in the worldVGstockstudio/Shutterstock.comSpeaking of Facebook, its parent company Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is among the least trusted companies in the world. Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) was initially hailed as the biggest social media company in the world by far, and in fact, was influential in ushering in the dawn of social media, only to now be derided for its many controversies. One of the primary controversies surrounding Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) is the spread of fake news and how easy it is, allowing incidents such as Russian bots attempting to influence the American Presidential elections or simply the spread of fake news. According to Business Insider, in September 2020, Facebook ranked last in digital trust among consumers, showing how the mighty giant has fallen in recent times, something reflected in its nosediving share price too.When the pandemic hit in 2020, many companies and businesses suffered across the globe as most countries went into lockdowns to avoid the spread of disease. However, in many countries, and especially in the United States, companies were given huge loans, ostensibly to pay employees and ensure they didn't go under, but many such loans were made to millionaire or major companies which laid off employees. A lot of these loans were then forgiven after just submitting a one page form instead of any robust review. In fact, according to NPR, 91% of all such loans were either partially or completely forgiven, while many people struggled to even afford proper meals. Corporations laid off millions of people leading to record unemployment in several countries including the U.S. even as the profits of such companies did not drop as much. In fact, many companies have since reported record profits in 2021 as the pandemic eased and none of these profits or benefits have been passed on to employees or even consumers, who have had to pay higher prices in an era where a recession is imminent and inflation has reached levels rarely seen before. The juxtaposition of companies enjoying record profits while people struggle to make ends meet because of high levels of inflations has furthered the mistrust in corporations, which is at an all-time high right now.Of course, that's not to say that companies aren't trusted at all. The most trusted companies in the world have worked hard to ensure that they are seen as shining lights in an era where the default assumption is that corporations are only looking out for themselves. These companies are generally multinationals with operations in several countries and are often household names as well. Trust is a complex and subjective concept, and different people and organizations may have different opinions about which companies are the most trustworthy. Additionally, trust can change over time based on a variety of factors, such as a company's financial performance, its treatment of employees, and its reputation for ethical behavior. As a result, it is difficult to definitively identify the most trusted companies in the world. To determine the most trusted companies in the world, we looked at various lists and gave the highest rankings to companies which appeared on the greatest number of lists. So, without further ado, let's take a look at some of the companies which have earnt the trust of consumers, starting with number 15:15. 3M Company (NYE:MMM)One of the biggest industrial companies in the world, 3M Company (NYE:MMM), 3M Company (NYE:MMM) produces more than 60,000 goods which include abrasives, adhesives, passive fire protection and personal protective equipment among many others. 3M Company (NYE:MMM) has also continued to commit to high ethical standards in order to improve its business while simultaneously having a positive impact on the planet, and details these plans through it Sustainability Report.14. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a financial technology company which operates in most countries which support online money transfer. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) used end-t0-end encryption and two factor authentication which ensures that the sums being transferred are safe from any malfeasance or manipulation. Founded in 1998, PayPal was one of the first companies to offer online payment services, and it has since become one of the most widely used payment platforms in the world. In addition to facilitating online transactions, PayPal also offers a range of other services, such as credit and debit card processing, fraud protection, and mobile payments. The company is known for its commitment to security and convenience, and it has a large and dedicated customer base. In 2015, PayPal was spun off from its parent company eBay and became a separate publicly-traded company. Today, it operates in more than 200 countries and has over 300 million active users.13.

(NASDAQ:ISRG) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/85-institutional-ownership-intuitive-surgical-110029655.html,1670756429.0,STORY,"['ISRG', 'TROW']","[A look at the shareholders of Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 85% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Intuitive Surgical. Check out our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Intuitive Surgical?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Intuitive Surgical does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Intuitive Surgical's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Intuitive Surgical. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.3% of shares outstanding. With 7.9% and 6.9% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 22 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Intuitive SurgicalThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Intuitive Surgical, Inc.. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$436m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 14% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Intuitive Surgical better, we need to consider many other factors.I always like to check for a history of revenue growth. You can too, by accessing this free chart of historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

For those looking for the best retirement stock picks for 2023, you have come to the right place. Investing in well-designed market leaders or up-and-coming innovators can help ensure long-term growth in retirement accounts.Of course, it’s easier said than done. There are plenty of value traps out there, and blue-chip companies that have lost their winning ways.That said, investing in consumer goods companies has proven to be consistently profitable year after year, thus providing a solid base for retirement portfolios. Making similarly wise retirement stock picks for 2023 can lead to financial security for years to come, even after retirement.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe year thus far has been marked by a sharp selloff in the broader market. At the time of writing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gone down 8.17%, and the S&amp;P 500 has lost 17.83% year-to-date. However, this is not the time to panic. By all indications, we should see the back of the bear market next year. Until that happens, though, attractive retirement stocks will remain cheap. As we head into 2023, now is the prime time to strike.MSFTMicrosoft$244.37BRK-BBerkshire Hathaway$305.82VVisa$207.81Microsoft (MSFT)Microsoft (MSFT) sign outside of office buildingSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.comOver the past few years, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has slowly but surely transitioned from a growth stock to a reliable performer. Although retirement investors would not traditionally pick up stock in Microsoft due to its past volatility, there are signs it is becoming more of a legacy company with steady gains and minimal drops.Investors should exercise caution when looking for retirement stock picks for 2023, and consider some allocation to industry giants in their portfolios. With careful monitoring and wise allocations among the companies, retirement portfolios can benefit from Microsoft’s steady growth and reliable performance.Story continuesThat is not to say the tech giant is not growing. Microsoft’s Azure stands in second place in the global cloud infrastructure market. Alongside Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google, the company accounted for two-thirds of cloud infrastructure revenues in the third quarter. As the market is still growing, this segment represents the future for Microsoft.In addition, Microsoft’s diversified business model includes developing numerous products and services, ranging from software products to consumer electronics and the cloud. Not only is this model ideal for those seeking a retirement investment well-equipped to endure any market turmoil, but it helps Microsoft to remain a top contender in an ever-changing industry. With such a surefire approach, Microsoft stands out as one of the premier retirement stock picks for many investors come 2023.Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)Warren Buffett gestures to an audience.Source: Krista Kennell / Shutterstock.comBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.B) is a world-renowned investment firm founded by Warren Buffett in 1965. Over the decades, it has become one of the most secure retirement stock picks. I think that this stock will remain so for 2023 and beyond, with many long-term investors profiting from its stable investments in blue-chip companies.Berkshire Hathaway also operates very leanly with minimal oversight, allowing it to control its own investment decisions without any restrictions, and navigate times of market uncertainty without relying on outside sources. This makes it an attractive retirement option for those looking for safety, yet still seeking a return on their retirement savings over time.The Wall Street legend delivered again in the third quarter, with operating earnings rising 20% over 2021. Although the investment firm reported a loss of $2.7 billion in the third quarter, operating earnings is a fairer metric that removes the volatility it suffered due to the market downturn.Despite the turmoil in the broader markets, operating earnings jumped 19% in the year thus far. Insurance underwriting and the company’s railroad business emerged as the portfolio’s biggest losers this report. However, share repurchases helped stem the negative momentum to some degree, ensuring the investment firm ended the quarter in a healthy enough shape.Berkshire Hathaway’s unique ability to take advantage of time arbitrage has been invaluable in creating and sustaining shareholder value through any economic climate. By being able to make decisions based on the interest of long-term value rather than short-term performance pressures, Berkshire Hathaway has proven its worth again and again. Comprehensive research and thorough analysis are just some key factors that have allowed this company to be such an effective retirement investment. Its recent results confirm it is an all-weather investment.Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comVisa (NYSE:V) is a global electronic payments network. It allows consumers and businesses worldwide to make payments and send money with just a few clicks. Thanks to the world’s largest retail electronic payment network, it is one of the top retirement stock picks for 2023. With countless retailers across the globe who accept Visa, investing in its brand could provide valuable returns in the future.By taking advantage of potential growth areas like online debit and credit card use, Visa could experience tremendous growth over the coming years. This makes it a key retirement stock pick, as its success should provide short-term investment gains and long-term retirement security.Despite recent macro headwinds, Visa is executing well. It has posted exceptional performance, thanks to a post-pandemic resurgence of cross-border transactions and travel. Constant-currency cross-border transaction volume, excluding intra-Europe, saw a 49% increase in fiscal Q4. The large-scale adoption and increased usage of cashless payment methods also contribute to Visa’s success.Analysts expect this trend to continue over the coming quarters, as Visa is well on its way to becoming one of the top retirement stock picks for 2023.

56,5665cb07-314a-338b-b998-c221ac9d25f5,APH,2022-12-11,Amphenol (NYSE:APH) shareholders have earned a 13% CAGR over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amphenol-nyse-aph-shareholders-earned-131537111.html,1670764537,STORY,['APH'],"[When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. For example, the Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH) share price is up 76% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 41% (ignoring dividends).Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. See our latest analysis for Amphenol While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Amphenol achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 14% per year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 12% average annual increase in the share price. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Amphenol has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Amphenol, it has a TSR of 85% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that Amphenol shares lost 5.8% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 19%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 13% for each year. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Amphenol better, we need to consider many other factors.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.  View our latest analysis for NVIDIA  NVIDIA Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Independent Director, Mark Stevens, for US$51m worth of shares, at about US$186 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$170. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).Insiders in NVIDIA didn't buy any shares in the last year. We do note however that CEO Jensen Huang acquired 2,150,000 shares off-market via a derivative exercise transaction.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At NVIDIA Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at NVIDIA. In total, Independent Director Mark Stevens sold US$20m worth of shares in that time.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of NVIDIAI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that NVIDIA insiders own 4.0% of the company, worth about US$17b. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At NVIDIA Tell Us?It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

(NYSE:CMI) On Your Watch List?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-238-time-put-cummins-143906949.html,1670683146,STORY,['CMI'],"[Cummins Inc. (NYSE:CMI) saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NYSE over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Cummins’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Cummins Is Cummins Still Cheap?The share price seems sensible at the moment according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Cummins’s ratio of 17.55x is trading slightly below its industry peers’ ratio of 20.87x, which means if you buy Cummins today, you’d be paying a decent price for it. And if you believe Cummins should be trading in this range, then there isn’t much room for the share price to grow beyond the levels of other industry peers over the long-term. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Cummins’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from Cummins?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 31% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Cummins. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in CMI’s positive outlook, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at CMI? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuate below the industry PE ratio?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on CMI, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for CMI, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 2 warning signs with Cummins, and understanding these should be part of your investment process.If you are no longer interested in Cummins, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

But it could also help mend fences between China’s government and its citizens who recently protested the country’s zero-COVID lockdown policies.Avatar: The Way of Water will hit theaters on Dec. 16, 13 years after the release of the original that went on to become the highest-grossing film of all time. To say the latest movie faces high expectations would be an understatement. The film’s huge budget means it will likely have to be one of the highest-grossing movies ever to recoup its costs, director James Cameron said in a recent interview with GQ.The likelihood of Avatar: The Way of Water, from Disney, becoming a box office smash was boosted last month after the film received a coveted release in China, the world’s second-largest film market behind the U.S. It was a huge victory for the film’s studio, Disney, that could help its chances of becoming a financial success.The overseas release of the original Avatar in 2009 and rereleased versions accounted for $2.13 billion of its $2.9 billion in total gross. Around $265 million of that came from China, where the film industry has grown quickly in the more than a decade since.On Wednesday, Cameron got more good news when China’s government said it would ease up COVID restrictions. Though many of the details are still unknown, such as the timing, it’s likely welcome news to fans of the original and, possibly, to protesters, too.Amid waves of COVID-induced lockdowns in China, film fans have increasingly clamored for greater “cinema freedom.” Protesters have shared the rallying cry, “I wanna see a movie!,” across Chinese social media, as part of their effort to return to normal life.Cameron’s big gambleThe sequel has a lot riding on its shoulders, and a lot of it comes down to its cost to make.Story continuesAvatar: The Way of Water’s production budget alone reportedly stands at $250 million. But with marketing and other expenses, the film’s price tag may be more than $350 million, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which would place it among the most expensive films ever.Even Cameron, who has ample experience helming expensive big-budget flicks from Terminator 2 to Titanic, is nervous about how much the film must make to avoid a loss, calling the film the “worst business case in movie history” during his recent GQ interview. For Avatar: The Way of Water to turn a profit, it would have to be “the third or fourth highest-grossing film in history,” he said. “That’s your threshold. That’s your breakeven.”Cameron refused to discuss reports of how much the movie had cost, saying only that it had been expensive. But to become the third or fourth highest-grossing film of all time, the Avatar sequel would need to make more than 2015’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which raked in $2.07 billion worldwide.If it doesn’t, two of the film’s three planned sequels will likely be canned, and the movie industry’s uneven rebound from the pandemic in 2022 will end on a low note.“Theater owners have been waiting for their lobbies to be packed with people and bustling with activity, and that’s what a movie like Avatar: The Way of Water can do,” Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore, told Fortune. “The stakes are really high.”He described cinema’s 2022 as a “breakneck roller-coaster ride” that was atypical for the industry. After high-profile films including The Batman and Top Gun: Maverick dominated the box office with big sales earlier in the year, interest in more recent films has been relatively subdued, according to Dergarabedian.So the release of the latest Avatar, which took over three years to shoot and has been subject to repeated delays since Cameron originally envisioned a 2014 release, comes with very high hopes attached to it as 2022 closes out.“Since [August], other than Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, we’ve really had a hard time getting a footing with a big blockbuster to build a huge box office,” Dergarabedian said, adding that the weekend of Dec. 3 brought in only $53 million in North American box office receipts for all films.“It looks like Avatar: The Way of Water will bring in hopefully more than that in a single day, which is good news for theaters both domestically and internationally,” he said.The China questionChina’s film market raced ahead of most other countries for large parts of the pandemic, as its theaters stayed open while other countries went into lockdown. China even briefly overtook the U.S. as the world’s biggest box office in 2020.As its domestic film industry has grown, China has limited the number of U.S.-made films or U.S. coproductions allowed in the country. Only 29 received a Chinese release this calendar year compared with 73 in 2018, according to Comscore.In recent years, China’s government has become bolder in justifying why it bans foreign-made films. For example, China has blocked the last seven movies in the superhero Marvel series for reasons ranging from portraying LGBTQ relationships onscreen to depicting an international newspaper known for opposing the Chinese Communist Party.Many foreign-made blockbusters have even been denied a release for political reasons. Top Gun: Maverick, Tom Cruise’s high-flying 2022 blockbuster that smashed Memorial Day records in May, has yet to get a China release and lost a Chinese investor ostensibly because of the film’s pro–U.S. military messaging and for showing a Taiwanese flag (it had been removed from the film’s earlier trailers).Lately, Western filmmakers have largely given up on China and are less willing to bow to China’s content censorship rules. But for Avatar: The Way of Water, ignoring China is not an option considering how much is riding on the film’s success.View this interactive chart on Fortune.com“If Avatar: The Way of Water had not gotten a release in China, that would really not be a good thing for the movie,” Dergarabedian said, adding that the country’s huge number of IMAX theaters and 3D cinemas is another important reason the Avatar sequel could succeed in China.“For Avatar, China is a key, key market, and it’s really because of the profile of the film,” he said.China’s uncertain marketFrom a commercial perspective, an Avatar China release is a no-brainer. The original film was well-received, and a rerelease in China last year brought in $44 million in 10 days, outperforming its main competitor: Disney’s Mulan, a live-action remake of a Chinese folk legend starring a famous Chinese actress.But success in China is far from guaranteed because of increasing unpredictability in the country’s movie market.China fell to second place in global box office rankings earlier this year owing to the pandemic lockdowns. Last month, China’s box office receipts were down 35% compared with 2021, and even on China’s National Day—a major public holiday celebrated on Oct. 1 that tends to see patriotic films hit theaters—turnout was underwhelming this year with receipts down 67% from last year.The decline in China’s domestic film industry this year might spark more interest in foreign movies such as the new Avatar, Wendy Su, a media and cultural studies professor at the University of California, Riverside and author of the 2016 book: China’s Encounter With Global Hollywood, told Fortune.“Hollywood blockbusters like Avatar are still very appealing, especially now the Chinese film industry and box office have plummeted to the lowest level given the harsh COVID lockdowns,” she said.China’s cinematic slowdown in 2022 comes as most other countries have lifted COVID restrictions and reopened public venues including movie theaters. Meanwhile, in China, widespread lockdowns sparked protests against China’s zero-COVID policy and a number of demands, including for press freedom, accountability for officials over the lockdowns, and an end to online censorship.Critics have also complained about China’s censorship rules on its own movie industry leading to more formulaic films, as well as a smaller slate of movies overall, which may be boosting domestic demand for more foreign fare.“Chinese audiences desperately need good entertainment and upbeat movies,” Su said. “China’s latest crackdowns on show business may lead to more Chinese audiences demanding more high-quality movies because of insufficient supply of domestic movies.”The long-awaited release of Avatar’s sequel in the country next week may help the government meet some of the film-loving protesters’ demands. But getting into a theater may not be as simple as officials, or Cameron, hope.As of last week, the government began easing its zero-COVID rules. However, any loosening will likely take place over months, and the government has said that public venues like cinemas will only be reopened gradually and with capacity limits.“It’s very hard to predict the box office right now,” Jimmy Wu, CEO of Lumiere Pavilions, one of China’s largest cinema chains, told the Hollywood Reporter this week. “It all depends on the lockdowns—and we have no idea exactly what the lockdown situation is going to look like across the whole of China next week.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune:  Rishi Sunak’s old hedge fund boss paid himself $1.9 million a day this year Meet the 29-year-old teacher with four degrees who wants to join the Great Resignation How much money you need to earn to buy a $400,000 home Elon Musk ‘wanted to punch’ Kanye West after deeming the rapper’s swastika tweet an ‘incitement to violence’ ]"

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide United Parcel Service with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. See our latest analysis for United Parcel Service How Fast Is United Parcel Service Growing?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. It certainly is nice to see that United Parcel Service has managed to grow EPS by 31% per year over three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. United Parcel Service maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 7.1% to US$101b. That's a real positive.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for United Parcel Service's future profits.Story continuesAre United Parcel Service Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$154b company like United Parcel Service. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Holding US$80m worth of stock in the company is no laughing matter and insiders will be committed in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders. This would indicate that the goals of shareholders and management are one and the same.Should You Add United Parcel Service To Your Watchlist?For growth investors, United Parcel Service's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. This EPS growth rate is something the company should be proud of, and so it's no surprise that insiders are holding on to a considerable chunk of shares. On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research. You should always think about risks though. Case in point, we've spotted   2 warning signs for United Parcel Service  you should be aware of, and 1 of them is concerning.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

These Phase 2 and Phase 1/2 trials (Abstract #236 and Abstract #1714, respectively) were presented at the 64th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting, held December 10-13, 2022, in New Orleans and virtually1,2.""Despite the significant advances we have made in the treatment of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) like MF, a need for additional options remains for those who have an inadequate response to or are unable to tolerate current therapies,"" said Peter Langmuir, M.D., Vice President, Oncology Drug Development, Incyte. ""The parsaclisib and ruxolitinib data presented at ASH demonstrate the clinical potential of the combination to improve upon the standard of care and continue to support the safety profile. We look forward to building on these results through our Phase 3 LIMBER-304 and LIMBER-313 trials evaluating parsaclisib as an add-on to ruxolitinib and in the frontline setting, both of which are currently underway.""Story continuesFinal results from the Phase 2 trial (Abstract #236; NCT02718300) evaluating the efficacy and safety of add-on parsaclisib to ruxolitinib for patients with MF who had a suboptimal response to ruxolitinib resulted in additional spleen volume reduction and improvement in symptom burden with add-on parsaclisib. Patients in the trial received parsaclisib daily for eight weeks in combination with stable dose ruxolitinib and then daily or weekly thereafter. Patients who received an all daily parsaclisib dosing schedule appeared to have a more durable efficacy profile compared with daily followed by weekly dosing of parsaclisib. Specifically:At 12 weeks of treatment, 59.5% (25), 21.4% (9) and 4.8% (2) of patients who received all daily dosing experienced ≥10%, ≥25% and ≥35% reduction in spleen volume, respectively.Comparatively, 28.1% (9), 3.1% (1) and 0% of patients who received daily followed by weekly dosing experienced ≥10%, ≥25% and ≥35% reduction in spleen volume, respectively.At 24 weeks of treatment the reduction was maintained, with 50% (21), 28.6% (12) and 7.1% (3) patients who received all daily dosing experiencing ≥10%, ≥25% and ≥35% reduction in spleen volume, respectively.Comparatively, 12.5% (4), 12.5% (4) and 3.1% (1) of patients who received daily followed by weekly dosing experienced ≥10%, ≥25% and ≥35% reduction in spleen volume, respectively.Addition of parsaclisib to ruxolitinib was generally well-tolerated, with limited grade 3 or 4 adverse events and treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE)-related discontinuations. TEAEs common to PI3Kδ inhibitors in lymphoma (e.g., hepatotoxicity, rash, colitis) were infrequent or absent with the addition of parsaclisib.Serious TEAEs occurring in ≥2 patients overall included pneumonia (n=6; 2 daily/weekly, 1 all daily), fall (n=3; 2 daily/weekly, 1 all daily) and pyrexia (n=2; 1 daily/weekly, 1 all daily).Overall, 9 patients (5 daily/weekly, 4 all daily) had a TEAE leading to parsaclisib discontinuation, and 4 patients (2 daily/weekly, 2 all daily) had a TEAE leading to ruxolitinib discontinuation.""MF is a rare, chronic blood cancer, and despite the advancements made in treatment, additional options are needed,"" said Abdulraheem Yacoub, Associate Professor, Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapeutics, University of Kansas Cancer Center. ""I am encouraged by these findings and the potential of parsaclisib and ruxolitinib to be an efficacious combination therapy to help improve outcomes for certain patients living with MF.""Additionally, data from a Phase 1/2 open-label, dose escalation and expansion study (Abstract #1714; NCT04455841) assessing the safety and tolerability of INCB00928 (zilurgisertib), a potent and selective ALK2 inhibitor, as monotherapy or in combination with ruxolitinib in patients with anemia due to MF were presented at ASH. Anemia occurs in more than one-third of patients at MF diagnosis and can be exacerbated during treatment3,4. Initial results of the study observed reduction in post-dose hepcidin levels at all dose levels and observed improvements in anemia among patients treated in both the monotherapy and combination cohorts, which suggest the potential for therapeutic activity. The data also support once-daily dosing of INCB00928 and continued dose escalation to achieve optimal exposure. Treatment with INCB00928 monotherapy and in combination with ruxolitinib resulted in predominantly grade 1/2 TEAEs and no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Few grade ≥3 TEAEs were observed, including thrombocytopenia in two patients with baseline grade 2 thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia in one patient with baseline grade 2 neutropenia. No TEAEs led to study drug discontinuation.More information regarding the congress and the more than 50 abstracts from Incyte’s oncology portfolio being featured at the meeting is available on the ASH website: https://www.hematology.org/meetings/annual-meeting.About Myeloproliferative NeoplasmsMyeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a closely related group of blood cancers in which the bone marrow functions abnormally. The bone marrow is where the body’s blood cells are made. MPNs are progressive blood cancers that can strike anyone at any age, but they are more common in older adults. Estimates of the prevalence of MPNs vary, but analysis of claims data suggests there may be as many as 200,000 people in the U.S. living with the most prevalent MPNs: myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia5.About LIMBERIncyte is a leader in the discovery and development of therapies for patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The Leadership In MPNs and GVHD BEyond Ruxolitinib (LIMBER) program is designed to evaluate multiple monotherapy and combination strategies to improve and expand treatments for patients with MPNs and GVHD. The program currently has three key areas of focus: development of a new, once-daily formulation of ruxolitinib; ruxolitinib-based combinations with new targets such as PI3Kδ, BET and ALK2; and new therapeutic options such as mutant CALR.About Jakafi® (ruxolitinib)Jakafi® (ruxolitinib) is a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor approved by the U.S. FDA for treatment of polycythemia vera (PV) in adults who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of hydroxyurea; intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis (MF), including primary MF, post-polycythemia vera MF and post-essential thrombocythemia MF in adults; steroid-refractory acute GVHD in adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older; and chronic GVHD after failure of one or two lines of systemic therapy in adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older6.Jakafi is marketed by Incyte in the United States and by Novartis as Jakavi® (ruxolitinib) outside the United States.

Given the rough year we’ve had along with a questionable macroeconomic backdrop for next year, investors may want to jettison some problematic market ideas.To be clear, picking out Dow stocks to sell natively generates controversy because each enterprise had to work hard to receive the honor. It’s like the World Cup: if you’re in, you’re among the elites of the planet. That said, some teams will perform better than others.For this list, I’ve recruited the services of Gurufocus.com, presenting ideas that the investment resource considers relatively overvalued. As well, some inquiries may be had about the targeted companies’ fiscal resilience and/or fundamental relevance. If you’re not put off by the concept entirely, here are Dow stocks to sell.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBABoeing$176.50CRMSalesforce$130.48DISDisney$92.15IBMInternational Business Machines$147.27UNHUnitedHealth$542.91NKENike$108.33VVisa$207.81Boeing (BA)An image of a money bomb with a spark on the end of its string.Source: ShutterstockIf you’ve been following the news for the last few years, the inclusion of aerospace giant Boeing (NYSE:BA) among the Dow stocks to sell probably comes as no surprise. Fundamentally, the enterprise brings arguably the most questions to the table. Without beating an expired horse, Boeing continues to suffer headwinds from safety issues related to its 737 Max jetliner.Naturally, the obstacles translated to some of the worst financial profiles among Dow stocks to sell. At the time of writing, the market prices BA stock at 56 times forward earnings. In contrast, the sector median value is only 19.5 times. Stated differently, BA shares overvaluation is worse than 96% of the aerospace and defense industry.On average, its gross margin sits 1.4% below parity, presenting challenges regarding economies of scale. Not only that, but its operating and net margins also dropped into negative territory. Combined with a distressed balance sheet, Boeing is best left for hardened speculators.Story continuesSalesforce (CRM)stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockOnce a blisteringly strong inclusion in the Dow 30, the market paradigm shift this year might make Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) one of the Dow stocks to sell. On a year-to-date basis, CRM slipped nearly 48%, drawing concerns even among gamblers. With the broader technology space disproportionately suffering from the Federal Reserve’s commitment to rising interest rates, Salesforce cuts a worrying profile.Moreover, macroeconomic headwinds forced management to make headcount cuts to its sales team. In particular, it wasn’t a great look because earlier, Salesforce nearly tripled its workforce in the past five years. As well, the specter of wider cuts exists should an aggressively hawkish Fed cause the economy to fall into recession.Financially, CRM appears overpriced relative to traditional valuation metrics. Currently, its price-earnings ratio stands at 476 times. On a less-glaring note, its forward PE is 23.7 times, which sits almost right on the nose with the sector median value.Disney (DIS)A white clock indicates it's time to sell.Source: ShutterstockJust for full transparency, I made a speculative bullish case before about Disney (NYSE:DIS). Earlier in the new normal, the extended months of lockdowns and mitigation measures sparked the revenge travel phenomenon. However, as consumers scratched the underlying social experience itch, they started to run low on discretionary funds.While I don’t want to overstate the narrative, it’s possible that entertainment consumption is finally returning home. With a global recession perhaps on the horizon, now’s not a great time to go on exotic vacations. Still, people want escapism, especially during hard times. Therefore, Disney’s cheap entertainment offerings such as its Disney+ streaming service could see increased demand.Here’s the rub, though: it’s a risky proposition against traditional valuation metrics. Currently, the market prices DIS at 53.7-times trailing earnings and 22.3-times forward earnings. Both represent terrible stats, ranking worse than at least 74% of the competition. Thus, conservative investors might consider Disney to be one of the Dow stocks to sell.IBM (IBM)a frustrated man with a white board behind him that features a black downward arrowSource: ShutterstockRunning through Gurufocus.com’s screener for Dow stocks to sell, IBM (NYSE:IBM) is the one that hurts. In my view, I believe Big Blue offers much for investors willing to ride some choppy waters. Conspicuously, IBM returned over 8% of equity value since the beginning of the year. That’s a far better performance than most other tech firms. For instance, the Nasdaq Composite index slipped 30.4% YTD.In addition, IBM provides a generous source of passive income with a forward yield of 4.47%. As well, the company enjoys 28 years of consecutive dividend increases. It’s a status that management will not want to give up. So, why consider it one of the Dow stocks to sell?Again, I don’t. Still, looking at the matter objectively, IBM may be overvalued. For instance, the market prices shares at 6.6-times book value, ranking worse than 83% of its peers. Also, the company’s balance sheet leaves much to be desired. For example, its cash-to-debt ratio is only 0.18 times, worse than almost 90% of the underlying industry.UnitedHealth (UNH)a keyboard with a greet enter key marked sell, representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockFor book smart investors, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) may come off as an ideal play under present circumstances. That’s because in general, the relationship between insurance stocks and interest rates is linear: as one metric moves up, so too does the other. Sure enough, UNH gained over 7% for the year so far. In contrast, the Dow Jones index slipped more than 8% during the same period.Nevertheless, an argument exists that UNH may be carrying too rich a premium. While Gurufocus.com labels UNH as fairly valued based on its proprietary calculations, the market prices shares at 26.4-times trailing earnings and 21.6-times forward earnings. Both stats are awful, each ranking worse than at least 92% of the competition.Another factor to consider is that UNH is priced at 6.8-times book value, far exceeding the sector median’s 1.9 times. As well, UNH’s price-to-free-cash-flow ratio is 16.4 times, worse than nearly 87% of the industry. Therefore, if your priority centers on discounted opportunities, then UNH ranks among the Dow stocks to sell.Nike (NKE)sell written on a chalkboard representing overvalued stocks to sellSource: ShutterstockTechnically speaking, Nike (NYSE:NKE) presents an intriguing case that doesn’t quite comprehensively fit the narrative of Dow stocks to sell. True, since the January opener, NKE gave up more than 34% of its equity value. At the same time, in the trailing month, shares gained over 15%, possibly indicating a recovery move.Nevertheless, fundamental concerns abound for the sports apparel and footwear icon. For one thing, consumer sentiment trends near all-time recorded lows. Frankly, macro pressures will do nothing to mitigate this concern. Also, the personal saving rate cratered since skyrocketing to blistering heights during the early days of the pandemic. Put another way, people may have less discretionary funds lying around, making NKE a potential candidate for Dow stocks to sell.Against financial metrics, NKE appears overpriced. While Gurufocus.com’s proprietary calculations for fair market value disagree, investors should realize that Wall Street prices Nike shares at 36.7 times forward earnings. This stat ranks worse than 97% of the company’s peers. At the very least, one should be careful with NKE.Visa (V)a businessman with his thumb facing downSource: ShutterstockPerhaps the most perplexing market idea on this list of possible Dow stocks to sell, Visa (NYSE:V) presents both a bullish and bearish argument. On the positive front, the financial services firm may enjoy upside relevance as a credit card company. Basically, Visa allows households to stretch their budgets, which might come in handy during these rough economic waters.Still, I’m not entirely sure how sustainable this argument stands. Throughout this year, we’ve seen companies – particularly tech firms – announce significant layoffs. The more high-paying white-collar jobs get the axe, the less likely debtholders will pay back their obligations. Therefore, the broader narrative for Visa may depend on some semblance of economic viability.Even in the financial department, Visa presents a tricky framework. While the company enjoys a solid balance sheet, decent sales growth, and excellent profit margins, it’s also hampered by valuation concerns. Particularly, the market prices Visa at 25.3 times forward earnings, worse than nearly 93% of the underlying industry.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

(NASDAQ:ADP) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 81% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Losing money on investments is something no shareholder enjoys, least of all institutional investors who saw their holdings value drop by 4.7% last week. However, the 11% one-year returns may have helped alleviate their overall losses. They should, however, be mindful of further losses in the future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Automatic Data Processing, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Automatic Data Processing?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Automatic Data Processing does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Automatic Data Processing, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Automatic Data Processing is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.5%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.2% and 4.3% of the stock.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Automatic Data ProcessingWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Automatic Data Processing, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$129m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 18% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Automatic Data Processing better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Automatic Data Processing that you should be aware of before investing here.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do.

78,f433c0f1-2981-3938-adfe-afdce6449a7e,PG,2022-12-11,Estimating The Intrinsic Value Of The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estimating-intrinsic-value-procter-gamble-110021260.html,1670756421,STORY,['PG'],"[Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble The MethodWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$13.4bUS$15.0bUS$16.0bUS$17.4bUS$18.2bUS$18.8bUS$19.4bUS$19.9bUS$20.4bUS$20.9bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x8Analyst x6Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 3.42%Est @ 2.99%Est @ 2.68%Est @ 2.47%Est @ 2.33% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.4% US$12.6kUS$13.2kUS$13.3kUS$13.6kUS$13.3kUS$13.0kUS$12.5kUS$12.1kUS$11.6kUS$11.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$126bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$21b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.4%– 2.0%) = US$478bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$478b÷ ( 1 + 6.4%)10= US$256bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$383b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$151, the company appears about fair value at a 6.5% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Procter &amp; Gamble as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For Procter &amp; Gamble, we've put together three important aspects you should explore:Risks: Case in point, we've spotted   1 warning sign for Procter &amp; Gamble  you should be aware of.Future Earnings: How does PG's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

79,78da74b9-9fb6-3b83-ba65-a244387753bc,DHI,2022-12-11,Returns On Capital Are A Standout For D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/returns-capital-standout-d-r-132252043.html,1670678572,STORY,['DHI'],"[To find a multi-bagger stock, what are the underlying trends we should look for in a business? Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in D.R. Horton's (NYSE:DHI) returns on capital, so let's have a look.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on D.R. Horton is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.31 = US$7.7b ÷ (US$30b - US$5.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, D.R. Horton has an ROCE of 31%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Consumer Durables industry average of 17%. Check out our latest analysis for D.R. Horton roceIn the above chart we have measured D.R. Horton's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Does the ROCE Trend For D.R. Horton Tell Us?The trends we've noticed at D.R. Horton are quite reassuring. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 31%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 152%. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at D.R. Horton thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.The Key TakeawayIn summary, it's great to see that D.R. Horton can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. And investors seem to expect more of this going forward, since the stock has rewarded shareholders with a 79% return over the last five years. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if D.R. Horton can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.Story continuesD.R. Horton does come with some risks though, we found 3 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 2 of those make us uncomfortable...High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?
