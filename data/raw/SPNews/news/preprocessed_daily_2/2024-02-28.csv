While this fund is not tracked by the Zacks Mutual Fund Rank, we were able to examine other factors like performance, volatility, and cost."", 'History of Fund/Manager', ""SWPPX is a part of the Schwab Funds family of funds, a company based out of San Francisco, CA. The Schwab S&P 500 Index made its debut in May of 1997 and SWPPX has managed to accumulate roughly $70.06 billion in assets, as of the most recently available information. A team of investment professionals is the fund's current manager."", 'Performance', 'Investors naturally seek funds with strong performance. This fund carries a 5-year annualized total return of 14.27%, and is in the top third among its category peers. Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3-year annualized total return of 10.95%, which places it in the top third during this time-frame.', ""It is important to note that the product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sale charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower."", ""When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. Compared to the category average of 17.36%, the standard deviation of SWPPX over the past three years is 17.46%. Over the past 5 years, the standard deviation of the fund is 18.28% compared to the category average of 18.68%. This makes the fund less volatile than its peers over the past half-decade."", 'Risk Factors', ""Investors should note that the fund has a 5-year beta of 1, which means it is hypothetically as volatile as the market at large. Another factor to consider is alpha, as it reflects a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark-in this case, the S&P 500. SWPPX has generated a positive alpha over the past five years of 0.02, demonstrating that managers in this portfolio are skilled in picking securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns."", 'Holdings', 'Investigating the equity holdings of a mutual fund is also a valuable exercise. This can show us how the manager is applying their stated methodology, as well as if there are any inherent biases in their approach. For this particular fund, the focus is principally on equities that are traded in the United States.', 'As of the last filing date, the mutual fund has 93.29% of its assets in stocks, with an average market capitalization of $373.94 billion. The fund has the heaviest exposure to the following market sectors:', 'Technology', 'Finance', 'Turnover is 2%, which means this fund makes fewer trades than comparable funds.', 'Expenses', 'For investors, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is key, since costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing. Competition is heating up in this space, and a lower cost product will likely outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, all things being equal. In terms of fees, SWPPX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.02% compared to the category average of 0.76%. From a cost perspective, SWPPX is actually cheaper than its peers.', 'Investors need to be aware that with this product, the minimum initial investment is $0; each subsequent investment has no minimum amount.', 'Fees charged by investment advisors have not been taken into considiration. Returns would be less if those were included.', 'Bottom Line', ""Don't stop here for your research on Index funds.

Soft demand in China amid the economic slowdown is also a concern.However, a resilient non-residential construction market and improved demand in the automotive space augur well for the industry. Industry players like Nucor Corporation NUE, Steel Dynamics, Inc. STLD and Universal Stainless & Alloy Products, Inc. USAP are worth a look despite near-term headwinds.', 'About the Industry', 'The Zacks Steel Producers industry serves a vast spectrum of end-use industries such as automotive, construction, appliance, container, packaging, industrial machinery, mining equipment, transportation, and oil and gas with various steel products. These products include hot-rolled and cold-rolled coils and sheets, hot-dipped and galvanized coils and sheets, reinforcing bars, billets and blooms, wire rods, strip mill plates, standard and line pipe, and mechanical tubing products. Steel is primarily produced using two methods — Blast Furnace and Electric Arc Furnace. It is regarded as the backbone of the manufacturing industry. The automotive and construction markets have historically been the largest consumers of steel. Notably, the housing and construction sector is the biggest consumer of steel, accounting for roughly half of the world’s total consumption.', ""What's Shaping the Future of the Steel Producers' Industry?"", ""Weaker Steel Prices to Hurt Margins: U.S. steel prices saw a significant downward correction after a strong run during the first three months of 2023. The benchmark hot-rolled coil (HRC) prices tumbled more than 40% from their April 2023 peak of around $1,200 per short ton to below the $700 per short ton level in late September. The downside was partly driven by shorter lead times. The United Auto Workers (UAW) strike and the lower cost of raw materials also weighed on HRC prices. Nevertheless, U.S. steel prices rebounded during the fourth quarter, with HRC prices breaking above $1,000 per short ton in December, driven by U.S. steel mills’ price hike actions and the resolution to the UAW strike. However, the upward momentum has lately hit a speed bump. HRC prices have again come under pressure since the start of 2024 on a pullback in steel mill lead times. Increased imports have also put pressure on steel prices. As such, lower realized prices are expected to weigh on the profitability and cash flows of steel-producing companies over the near term.Slowdown in China a Worry: Steel demand in China, the world’s top consumer of the commodity, has softened due to a slowdown in the country’s economy due to the protracted property crisis and weak global demand. The real estate sector has taken a hard hit amid a decline in new home prices, property investment and housing sales. Notably, real estate accounts for roughly 40% of China's steel consumption. A slowdown in manufacturing activities has led to a contraction in demand for steel in China. The manufacturing sector has taken a beating due to weaker external demand for manufactured goods and a slowdown in infrastructure spending. China has also seen a slowdown in the construction sector. The sluggishness in these key steel-consuming sectors is expected to hurt demand for steel over the short term.Strong Demand in Major Markets Bode Well: Steel producers are set to gain from strong demand across major steel end-use markets, including automotive and construction. They are expected to benefit from higher order booking from the automotive market. Steel demand in automotive is expected to rise on the back of an easing global shortage in semiconductor chips that has weighed heavily on the automotive industry for nearly two years. Also, the UAW reached a deal with the Detroit Big Three in November 2023, ending the roughly six-week strike that weighed on the U.S. steel industry due to a slowdown in automotive demand. The resolution to the UAW strikes augurs well for steel demand. Meanwhile, order activities in the non-residential construction market remain strong, underscoring the inherent strength of this industry. Demand in the energy sector has improved on the back of strength in oil and gas prices. Favorable trends across these markets bode well for the steel industry."", 'Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Downbeat Prospects', 'The Zacks Steel Producers industry is part of the broader Zacks Basic Materials Sector.

It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the book value per share.', 'In value investing, it is a common practice to pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally strong. There are a number of investment styles for finding great stocks at attractive values.', 'While considering valuation metrics, though price-to-earnings and price-to-sales are the first choices, the P/B ratio is also emerging as a convenient tool for identifying low-priced stocks that have high-growth prospects.', 'Here’s the formula for P/B ratio:', 'P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equity.', 'The P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks with high growth prospects. General Motors Company GM, Unum Group UNM, Compañía Cervecerías Unidas S. A. CCU, Owens Corning OC and Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft DB are some such stocks.', 'Now, let us understand the concept of book value.', 'There are several ways by which book value can be defined.\xa0Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.', 'It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.', 'By comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.', 'A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value or the stock is undervalued and, therefore, a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.', 'For example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.', 'But there is a warning. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.', 'Moreover, the P/B ratio is not without limitations. It is useful for businesses like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.', 'In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.', 'Screening Parameters', 'Price to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.', 'Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.', 'Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share — a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.', 'PEG less than 1: PEG links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects.', 'Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.', 'Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.', 'Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.', 'Value Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.', 'Here are five of the 10 picks that qualified the screening:', 'Headquartered in Detroit,\xa0General Motors is one of the world’s largest automakers.

The other was when Salesforce, Honeywell International, and Amgen replaced ExxonMobil, RTX, and Pfizer (respectively) in 2020.', 'Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) just replaced Walgreens Boots Alliance, which increased the retail representation in the Dow after Walmart (NYSE: WMT) issued a 3-for-1 stock split. The addition of Amazon was possible because the tech giant split its stock in the summer of 2022. At a price in the low $180-per-share range, Amazon will be an average-weighted stock in the Dow, similar to Apple. Walmart is now one of the least-weighted stocks in the time-tested index.', 'Amazon\'s inclusion makes it the third ""Magnificent Seven"" stock to join the Dow (the other two are Microsoft\xa0and Apple). It also adds more e-commerce and cloud infrastructure to the Dow as these two industries make up a growing share of the economy.', ""But just because a stock is joining the Dow doesn't mean it's automatically worth buying. Let's determine if Amazon or Walmart, both hovering around all-time highs, are worth a look."", ""Amazon is nothing short of an incredible business. The company has expanded beyond e-commerce to become a diversified giant in entertainment through Amazon Prime Video and Twitch, cloud infrastructure through Amazon Web Services (AWS), and even advertising. According to Statista, AWS commands a 31% market share of global cloud infrastructure revenues -- ahead of Microsoft Azure at 24% and Alphabet's Google Cloud at 11%."", ""AWS is, without a doubt, the most valuable aspect of Amazon's business. When Amazon fell below $1 trillion in market capitalization in 2022, there was talk that AWS alone was worth $1 trillion. And there's merit behind that view."", ""AWS generated $90.8 billion in 2023 revenue and $24.6 billion in operating income -- giving the business a 27% operating margin. A price-to-sales ratio of 11 on a business like AWS isn't bad -- if it was growing quickly. But the truth is that AWS' growth has slowed. Compared to 2022, AWS grew sales at just 13.3% and operating income by less than 8%."", ""Look at the whole business, and Amazon generated $30.4 billion in 2023 net income from $574.8 billion in sales. It's not a direct comparison, but Walmart generated $15.5 billion in net income from $648.1 billion in sales. It has a market cap four times smaller than Amazon's."", ""My biggest issue with Amazon is that it isn't growing at a blistering rate, and yet, it still conducts its business like a red-hot growth company. Other big tech companies focus on profits, free cash flow, and revenue growth, but Amazon is still all about revenue."", 'Big tech companies often use some form of stock-based compensation, but the best ones can more than offset it with stock buybacks. Apple, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms\xa0have significantly reduced their outstanding share counts over the last five years, whereas Amazon has diluted its shareholders.', ""Amazon is an impressive and powerful business. But it doesn't offer the same balance of growth and value as Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, and Meta. Again, it would be one thing if Amazon was growing far faster than these companies, but it isn't -- at least not enough to justify its 42 forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, far higher than Microsoft's 35, Apple's 28, Meta's 24, and especially Alphabet's mere 21 or so forward P/E."", ""When Walmart sold off after its fiscal Q3 earnings release last November, it looked like a healthy pullback. Walmart had suffered its fair share of setbacks, but the stock had been remarkably stable. Since that report, Walmart stock is up 12.5%. Not only has Walmart more than made up for the November sell-off, but it's now up over 23% in the past year."", ""To its credit, Walmart is growing sales at a rapid rate, and its margins have recovered to their pre-pandemic levels. Walmart's major concerns were lower margins, supply chain bottlenecks, inflation pressures, and store theft. In a relatively short period, it has made meaningful improvements in all of these categories."", ""Aside from Walmart's stock split and improving fundamentals, the most significant announcement has been its 9% dividend increase to a post-stock split price of $0.83 per share, or $0.2075 per share per quarter -- the largest raise in over a decade. But even when factoring in the raise, Walmart yields just 1.4%. It also has a P/E ratio over 30 -- which is a premium price for a stodgy, low-margin business with a low yield."", 'Walmart is a Dividend King, having paid and raised its dividend for over 50 consecutive years. However, there are far better value plays with higher yields.', ""For example, fellow Dow component and Dividend King Coca-Cola just raised its dividend to a record high. It has a yield above 3% and a P/E ratio of around 24. Walmart isn't growing fast enough to justify half the yield of Coke and a higher valuation. Walmart is the kind of stock worth buying when its valuation makes sense. But that isn't the case now, especially relative to other Dividend Kings."", ""Amazon was my top stock to buy heading into 2023. And Walmart has long been one of my favorite Dividend Kings. But valuation matters, and the truth is that these phenomenal businesses simply haven't put up the results needed to justify their higher multiples."", ""This doesn't mean it's worth selling Amazon or Walmart. But investors don't have to look far for better values. I'd take Apple, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, or Alphabet over Amazon right now. And there are plenty of other dividend stocks with higher yields, lower valuations, and comparable growth to Walmart out there.

Walmart may have built its dominance by providing unbeatable value to shoppers, but investors aren\'t afforded the same value today.', ""There's nothing controversial here. Walmart is a Dividend King and a great business. It has size and leverage with vendors that arguably nobody else does, meaning it can sell groceries and goods for less than anyone. But a great business can be a lousy stock when everyone already loves it. That's what is happening here."", 'Today, Walmart trades at all-time highs, and its resulting valuation is nearly 25 times its estimated 2024 earnings:', ""There are some problems with Walmart trading at such a high valuation. First, it likely won't grow fast enough to justify such a high price tag forever. Analysts believe Walmart will grow earnings by an annual average of roughly 7% over the next three to five years."", ""To put this in perspective, I like using the price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, which compares a stock's valuation to how fast the underlying business grows. Generally, I look for PEG ratios of 1.5 or less. Walmart's current PEG ratio is 3.5, which means the stock could fall 50% in value and still wouldn't necessarily be cheap."", ""A high valuation alone isn't the problem because a company with rapid earnings growth often commands a premium that it can grow into. But Walmart, a huge company doing hundreds of billions of dollars in sales and locations everywhere in the United States, will have a harder time catching up to the stock's hot valuation."", ""I'll outline the danger of overpaying below.

In that scenario, investors are looking at virtually dead money for the next four or five years because the dividend yields just over 1%, so you're not getting much there."", 'The S&P 500 historically averages 9% to 10% returns in a given year. Walmart will have to grow far faster than analysts expect, or the valuation will have to stay in the stratosphere for the stock to keep pace with the broader market.

And good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us today. National Vision finished the year quite strong with top and bottom line results above our expectations for both the quarter and the year. I'd like to sincerely thank our teams for this accomplishment and their efforts throughout the year.Fourth quarter net revenue grew 8% with adjusted comparable store sales growth of 5.7%. These results reflect ongoing strength within America's Best and sequential improvement in Eyeglass World, further supported by crisp execution from our teams and successful marketing campaigns at the end of the year. This strong top line performance combined with disciplined expense management, enabled us to deliver better than expected adjusted operating income for the quarter and the year for the year. Total net revenue grew 6% and adjusted comparable store sales grew nearly 3%, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $0.64 for fiscal 2023.Underlying our top line performance in Q4 and full year with ongoing strength in our managed care business as our traditional budget-conscious customer base continued to feel the impact of inflation and other macro related headwinds for the year, managed care represented approximately 35% of overall revenues, an increase of approximately 250 basis points compared to our prior historical trend. Of one-third of sales. This is another indication of the ongoing trade-down behavior we see from customers with higher incomes than our traditional customer base.We believe that managed care will continue to grow as a percentage of our business as we remain underpenetrated in this sector and we believe more balanced between our managed care and cash paid customers will make our business more resilient. Overall, 2023 was a year in which we began to transform our business to better compete in today's marketplace.When we started the year, we set out to enhance the foundation of ongoing profitable growth, and we have made great progress. Specifically, we delivered improved retention of optometrists, record optometrist recruitment and continued success of our remote exam initiatives. We successfully expanded exam capacity. This was the 2nd year of improvement in retention and a record year in recruiting more experienced and student hires, notably over 10% of all optimistic graduates from the entire class of 2023, joined our network in 2023.Also, we're happy to welcome 20 doctors that were previously practicing at Walmart vision centers under our management regarding our remote exam initiative, remote care proved to be profitable in its 2nd year of operations, an accomplishment we take pride in given that remote represents a complex multidimensional tech startup inside our more traditional bricks and mortar company. In 2023, we expanded remote capabilities into over 200 additional America's best locations.And as of year end, we had nearly 550 America's best locations. Remote enabled remote exams now represent over 5% of all accounts. While it's still evolving and improving, we regard the remote program as a success and are confident it will continue contributing to our business and profits.We also continued our store digitization efforts aimed at improving efficiency and productivity. The rollout of electronic health records or EHR in America's best locations continues to advance. And in our corporate office, we began the first phase of interim implementation of the back-office ERP projects to upgrade our financial systems. We made progress in our objective to leverage omnichannel capabilities by continuing to test and progress programs that attract consumers across omnichannel offerings. We opened 70 new stores in 2023, including 17 new stores in the fourth quarter, continuing to capitalize on whitespace opportunities as store openings remain an important part of our strategic growth initiatives.And finally, we're very proud that our philanthropic efforts helped 1.4 million people around the world to see better. In addition to this work, we also took actions to adapt our business and cost structure as we entered 2024 and embark on the first chapter of the post Walmart era, the transition of the Walmart stores is now complete. During the fourth quarter, we transitioned four of the 229 Walmart vision centers to Walmart, which prepared us for the smooth transition of the remaining 225 stores.Last week, I am deeply appreciative of the Walmart base associates and optometrists for their resilience, commitment and professionalism during this time of transition and for their decades of commitment and service to patient and customer care. In addition, we streamlined our lab network by ending our outsourced lab relationship in China in anticipation of lower landfill volumes due to the Walmart contract termination. This will enable us to leverage our fixed cost structure more effectively as we distribute the work between our four domestic labs and our remaining outsourced lab in Mexico, all of which can now match or beat the holding costs of the China Lab.Concurrently, this action diminishes our dependency on China, something we have been progressing towards for the past few years. We also implemented the various pricing and cost savings initiatives we discussed last quarter. These actions included approximately 15 million in pricing and a reduction of corporate overhead and other corporate costs, which we expect to result in $10 million of annual cost savings in fiscal 2024.With respect to our AC Lens operations, as we discussed in our third quarter release, we will fulfill the remaining commitments in our Walmart and Sam's Club agreements to supply contact lens distribution and related services through the end of June and are on track to streamline our distribution network and wind down these operations by June 30th.Finally, as part of our ongoing detailed performance review of all our stores and markets, we found that there would be significant operational efficiencies and increased profit profitability for the business. Overall, if we focus our California market exclusively on the America's Best brand versus dividing up the markets in the state, as we have previously done. We are therefore planning to convert the 20 Eyeglass World California stores to America's Best. This conversion is expected to be complete by the end of the first quarter. Operational efficiencies will come in the form of reduced field overhead, leveraging of national advertising, better leveraging of optimum optometrist deployment and reduce travel.Looking ahead to 2024, we plan to build off the stronger foundation we established in 2023 and remain focused on executing against our initiatives, including expanding exam capacity, furthering our digitization efforts to improve efficiency and productivity, leveraging our omnichannel capabilities and continuing to capitalize on our whitespace opportunity.With respect to expanding exam capacity, we will continue with our recruiting, retention and remote efforts. We will continue to leverage the recruiting and retention initiatives put in place in 2023, including flexible scheduling options.Regarding our 2024 plans for remote, our remote capabilities are an important tool to leverage, especially amidst the changing optometric landscape. As we look at new store openings, we're taking into consideration the ability to implement the remote offering, especially as we monitor doctor availability in new and fill-in markets. In 2024, we expect to open 65 to 70 new stores, the vast majority of which will be in our America's Best brand. Again, this year.As we mentioned on our last call, we plan to slow the pace of the rollout in 2024 as we near completion of the heavy initial implementation phase of this program and continue to monitor the evolving regulatory landscape. In 2024, we now plan to equip approximately 50 additional stores with remote exam capabilities. As Melissa will discuss our plans for expanding our remote technology have evolved over this year, particularly with respect to the timing of our deployment to larger stage such as Texas. While we continue to see opportunities to implement remote capabilities beyond the planned 600 stores by the end of 2024. We want to ensure we are taking a measured approach as we assess new states and markets.That said, we continue to expect to advance our electronic health records platform to over 400 of our America's Best stores by year end and complete the digitization of our paper records for the entire America's best fleet in 2024, which we believe will drive further efficiencies and productivity in our stores.As we discussed last quarter, we have initiated a review of our Eyeglass World operations. While we're pleased with the sequential improvement we delivered in Eyeglass World in the fourth quarter, there is still more work to be done Eyeglass World is not yet performing to our standards and we're taking actions to improve results.First, we're taking pages from the America's Best playbook with respect to recruiting retention and remote initiatives. While there are distinct differences in the DR models between America's Best and Eyeglass World, which are which make a full rollout of remote capabilities less feasible, we will be expanding remote into select Eyeglass World locations in 2024 as part of our overall remote deployment strategy, and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities over time.Second, we made leadership changes within Eyeglass World, including adding one of our most experienced and highly respected America's best leaders who brings a proven track record of driving results.Third, we have plans in place to better allocate marketing spend focused on driving results for Eyeglass World. We believe the leadership changes and marketing adjustments we are making will drive improvements as we progress through 2024 as these operational improvements gain traction, we intend to increase the number of Eyeglass World new store openings.Looking ahead, we also plan to continue our early-stage exploration of new technologies and leverage our investment in Toko, Inc., a leader in applying AI powered diagnostic and screening tools to retinol imaging eye is a treasure trove of medical information, and we look forward to over time potentially playing an expanded role in our patients' health care.Before I close, I want to provide our current thoughts on the purchase cycle as we head into 2024 we and our industry have been waiting for a return to a more normalized purchase cycle, especially for cash pay customers. Since the COVID disruptions of 2020 and 2021 to date, the data has been inconsistent and therefore, it's too soon to say the purchase cycle has normalized.While we had some encouraging signs in 2023 with a better back-to-school season and strong end of year sales. We are awaiting our next data point, which will come in March, typically our high seasonality period due to tax refunds. That said, our guidance, which Melissa will soon review, takes into account a softer than expected start to 2024. However, we are encouraged by the sequential improvement in revenues from January into February with that, I will turn the call over to Melissa to review our results and outlook in more detail."", 'Melissa Rasmussen', ""Thank you, Reade, and good morning, everyone.

As we said, we are pleased to have delivered fourth quarter and full year results that came in ahead of our expectations. Our strong year-end results were driven by crisp execution of our strategic initiatives and disciplined expense management, driving both top line improvement in our growth brands and better than expected adjusted operating income throughout the fiscal year, we made solid progress in improving exam capacity and mitigating the impact of dark and d.e.m.o. stores on our results for the year on average dark stores represented a low single digit percentage of our America's best fleet, which is in line with our historical norm and an improvement from the peak mid-single digit percentage we saw in 2022, 10 stores on average for the year represented a high single digit percentage of the America's best fleet, reflecting a trend that is still higher than our historical norm, but an improvement compared to the prior year. As Reade noted, store openings remain an important part of our growth plans and DR availability as well as remote capabilities are key considerations in our expansion plans as we select locations for new store openings.Now moving on to our fourth quarter results in more detail. For the fourth quarter, net revenue increased 8% compared to the prior year, driven by adjusted comparable store sales growth of 5.7% and growth from new store sales. Adjusted comparable store sales were driven by an increase in customer transactions and to a lesser extent, higher average ticket. The timing of unearned revenue benefited revenue in the period by 20 basis points. We opened 16 new America's Best and one Eyeglass World store in the fourth quarter unit growth in our America's Best and Eyeglass World brands increased 4.4% on a combined basis over the total store base last year.And we ended the quarter with 1,413 stores as a percentage of net revenue, cost applicable to revenue increased approximately 140 basis points compared with the prior year quarter, driven primarily by higher optometrist related costs and a lower service revenue, including warranty revenue as well as other mix and margin effects. These cost increases were offset by ongoing strength in exam revenue as well as a decrease in freight expense.For the quarter, the net impact from deleverage of optometrist related costs and the increase in exam revenue was approximately 90 basis points, which is higher than previous quarters in the year due to timing of benefit related accruals.Adjusted SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue decreased 260 basis points compared with the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease in adjusted SG&A as a percentage of net revenue was primarily driven by lower advertising, legal and professional expenses and reflects disciplined expense management we have taken across the organization.Depreciation and amortization expense was $24.1 million compared to $24.7 million in the prior year period and was slightly better than our expectations, primarily due to the intangible assets impairment recorded as a result of the termination of our Walmart partnership.Adjusted operating income was $0.3 million compared to an adjusted operating loss of $6.8 million in the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin increased 150 basis points to 0.1% compared to the prior year period due primarily to factors previously discussed.Net interest expense was $3.9 million compared to $2.6 million in the prior year period. The year-over-year interest increase was driven primarily by an increase of $3.1 million of non-cash mark-to-market charges, which were offset by an increase in interest income of $1 million and a decrease in interest expense of $0.8 million compared to the prior year period.As a reminder, our interest guidance excludes non-cash mark-to-market and deferred financing costs, which totaled $4.3 million for the period. Excluding these costs, interest was a benefit of $0.4 million and our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 10.1%, primarily due to increases in unfavorable book-to-tax differences, which offset the tax benefit of the pretax book loss in the period.Adjusted diluted EPS was negative $0.02 per share in the fourth quarter compared to negative $0.08 per share in the prior year period.Turning to our financial results for fiscal 2023 compared to the prior year period, net revenue increased 6% driven by new stores and adjusted comparable store sales growth of 2.9%. The timing of unearned revenue positively impacted net revenue by 20 basis points.Adjusted operating margin declined 100 basis points compared to the prior year period, driven primarily by the expected deleverage of optometrist related costs and the normalization of our incentive compensation program for the year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.64 compared to 65% in fiscal 2022. Please note our adjusted results for the fourth quarter and full year exclude the impacts associated with one-time charges related to the termination of our Walmart partnership and related wind-down of AC lines operations, cost savings initiatives, charges related to our ERP rollout and other nonrecurring items that are detailed in the reconciliation tables found in our press release, we are on track to substantially complete the first phase of our ERP project by the end of fiscal 2024.During 2023, we incurred approximately $2.5 million of expenses related to the project, of which approximately 2 million was capitalized. We continue to expect to incur approximately $11 million to $13 million in onetime expenses related to the first phase of the project inclusive of the 2023 expenses.Turning next to our balance sheet, we ended the year with a cash balance of approximately $150 million and total liquidity of $444 million, including available capacity from our revolving credit facility. As of December 30th, our total debt outstanding was $465 million.And for the trailing 12 months, we ended the year with net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 1.9 times in 2023, we generated operating cash flow of $173 million and invested $116 million in capital expenditures primarily driven by investments in new stores, our lab distribution center, Doctor equipment and in-store lab equipment.As we announced in November, we repurchased $100 million of our convertible senior notes for an aggregate cash repurchase price inclusive of premium paid of $99.25 million. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and healthy cash flow to support our growth and capital allocation priorities in 2024. Our first priority with respect to capital allocation will continue to be the investment in our growth through new store openings and technology investments as we continue to digitize our stores and corporate office.Our second priority will be our focus on our debt structure, giving the pending May 2025 maturity of the convertible notes. As we demonstrated with the repurchase in November, we plan to take fiscally responsible actions with our outstanding balance and are monitoring the market for future opportunistic actions and other potential strategies.Our third priority is returning excess cash to shareholders while we do not expect to repurchase shares in the near term, given our other stated priorities for 2024. We are pleased to announce a new repurchase authorization of 50 million in place through January third, 2026. Given our original repurchase authorization expired on December 30th, 2023. We continue to evaluate opportunities to repurchase shares based on available investment opportunities, our financial position and market condition.Moving now to the discussion of our 2024 outlook for our 2024 fiscal year, we currently expect net revenue between $1.965 billion and $2.005 billion, supported by adjusted comparable store sales growth of 2% to 4% and new store sales based on our expectation to open between 65 and 70 new stores this year.With respect to profitability for 2024 we expect adjusted operating income between [$61,000,076 million]. This includes a range for depreciation and amortization of $95 million to $100 million. We expect adjusted diluted EPS to be between $0.5 per share and $0.65 per share, which assumes approximately $79 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Our guidance range includes the expected revenue and profitability from the Walmart and AC Lens operations through their respective contract term.As laid out on slide 15 of our earnings presentation, we expect legacy segment revenue of approximately $16 million and adjusted operating income of $0.5 million in the first quarter. And AC Lens is expected to deliver approximately $129 million of revenue and $2 million of adjusted operating income in the first half of the year, split evenly across first and second quarter.In addition, our outlook for fiscal 2024 assumes a range of scenarios with respect to consumer sentiment, ongoing success with our America's Best Brand and Performance Improvement in Eyeglass World. As Reade noted, the year started softer than expected, but we have seen sequential improvement as the quarter has progressed.While it is not our practice to provide quarterly guidance, given where we are in the quarter, we felt it appropriate to provide some direction. For modeling purposes, we expect first quarter adjusted comparable store sales to be flat to slightly negative compared to the prior year. This expectation incorporates a 40 to 50 basis point drag from Walmart performance. The high end of our full year guidance assumes further strengthening in trends as the year progresses, supported by continued strong performance in America's Best and improved performance in Eyeglass World as well as improved consumer backdrop.The low end of our guidance assumes a weaker consumer environment, impacting demand trends and less success in improving Eyeglass World performance through the operational changes we've discussed. As we discussed on our last call, the profit gap created by the Walmart partnership termination would be addressed through non-headline pricing and expense actions, which were implemented before the end of fiscal 2023, allowing us to realize the full year benefit in 2024, which more than offset this headwind.Pricing actions focused on standalone exam and targeted product offerings, which are expected to benefit 2024 by approximately $15 million. In addition to the pricing actions, we also streamlined corporate overhead and third party spend in the fourth quarter of 2023, which we expect will result in approximately $10 million of annualized cost savings in 2024 at the midpoint of our guidance range.We expect to deliver an adjusted operating income margin in line with fiscal 2023, which came in ahead of expectations due to operational improvements in America's Best and disciplined expense management. We also expect gross margin expansion of approximately 200 basis points for the year. This assumes benefits from the pricing action margin expansion as we exit the lower-margin Walmart and AC Lens businesses and improved productivity. In addition, we expect adjusted SG&A to deleverage approximately 150 basis points, primarily driven by the year-over-year decline in revenue.Given the termination of Walmart business. This expectation also considers the $10 million of annualized cost savings as well as increased levels of annual operating expense related to cloud amortization and ongoing investments in our growth. We expect marketing spend dollars to be below 2023. But as Reade noted, we will be shifting marketing dollars to focus on driving improved Eyeglass World performance while continuing to leverage strong national presence at America's Best coal.Looking further ahead, we believe we are well positioned to achieve our mid-single digit adjusted operating margin target in 2025. However, the composition of how we expect to get there has evolved remote is now more fully embedded in our normal course of business. And as we have discussed, is an important tool in delivering improved results within the America's Best brand as reflected in our 2023 performance.We expect this capability to continue to be a healthy contributor to our overall financial results going forward, and its benefit is incorporated in our 2024 guidance, along with our updated plans for deployment, which Reade reviewed in addition to remote our 2025 margin target also included expectations related to returning to mid-single digit adjusted current performance, driven by expanding exam capacity and improving consumer sentiment.We have been and continue to be acutely focused on the factors of curve that we can control with respect to exam capacity and pricing and are continuing to monitor the evolving trends within the optical purchase cycle that Rick discussed. Given these current views on remote and the progress we are making in driving improved top line results, we now expect future margin expansion to come primarily from improved productivity. Gross margin expansion and expense leverage across the company through 2024 and into 2025.As illustrated on slide 17, with the strong progress made in 2023 and assuming we deliver at least the midpoint of our 2024 expectations for adjusted operating margin, we will be well positioned to achieve mid-single-digit adjusted operating margin in 2025 as we have always said, our 2025 objective is not our end goal, and we will continue to drive further margin improvement going forward. I am proud of our team's dedication and focus on driving our initiatives to date and believe we remain well positioned to deliver our objectives, including driving value for our shareholders. Thank you for your time today. I will now turn the call over to Reade for closing remarks before we open the call for question three."", 'Reade Fahs', ""Thank you, Melissa. To summarize our stronger than expected end of the year, was driven by crisp execution, including expanded exam capacity, disciplined expense management, continued strength in our managed care business and effective marketing campaigns. For the full year, we delivered on our initiatives and drove strong improvement at America's Best. We executed on cost and pricing actions, which will benefit 2024 and more than offset the profitability gap from the Walmart partnership termination in 2024.We're committed to building off the stronger foundation we established in 2023. We remain focused on executing against our initiatives, which have a proven track record as demonstrated in the progress we've made with America's Best. We plan to continue to build on this progress in America's Best and drive improvement in Eyeglass World, all of which is incorporated in our guidance. We believe through this work, we are well positioned to drive long-term profitable growth, create value for shareholders and further our mission to make quality, eyecare and eyewear more affordable and accessible for all.And with that, we will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Michael Lasser, UBS.', 'Michael Lasser', ""Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. Given the comp performance at Eyeglass World, along with your decision to re-brand the 20 locations in California, what's weighing on the performance of that business, especially given it had been a strong performer historically?"", 'Reade Fahs', ""Thank you, Michael. So to say, but let me let me first unpack the California Eyeglass World piece a little bit. So so we had 76 America's best store count, 76 America's Best stores in California and 20 Eyeglass World stores. And the 20 Eyeglass World stores were split between Southern California, San Diego and Northern California. Sacramento was they were really far away from from one another. And we had new America's Best stores in either Sacramento or San Diego, there was no overlap and it's a pretty big state. And so converting the 20 Eyeglass World stores over to America's Best helps us have reduced field overhead leverage, national advertising leverage a pump first deployment, reduce travel. It makes the state more profitable in the company, more profitable, but it's a very unique situation there.In California and California Eyeglass World stores were were underperformers versus the average of the fleet, but we're really focused on profitability. And this is a way to help profits while concurrently becoming more competitive in the state overall.Now to your other question about Eyeglass World in general, again, a positive comps in Q4 sequential growth in Q4 for that, that's nice. But we do think Eyeglass World is not yet performing to standard. We don't have the coverage levels we want yet there, and it's a little different from America's Best or America's Best is an employment model.And on and I guess was it is pretty much split between employment model and a lease model. And so we're working on various ways of recruiting, retaining and putting in remote and other things to address the current challenge there. As we mentioned, we were just up putting a leadership change there and we are shifting marketing dollars because I think maybe we were under underspending a bit and behind that. But the outlook assumes a few scenarios in Eyeglass World, but we think we still have some work to do.Yes, it was a consistent, strong performer sort of from from the time we bought it up to up through 2021, and we're getting it back on its feet again with the actions I just went through as you've done."", 'Michael Lasser', 'My follow-up question is on the return to a mid single digit margin in 2025, what calm is necessary in order to achieve that outcome? And are you if you do see a sluggish underlying optical retail market, how is that mid single-digit expectation, sensitized, meaning which would there be other actions you could take to still achieve that outcome even if your comps are a bit slower? Thank you.', 'Melissa Rasmussen', ""Hi, Michael. Yes, the return to mid single digit in 2025 has a couple of factors tied into that as we think about the return to mid-single digit operating margin, the comp that we have factored into that also includes the mid-single digit comp range. And we expect to get to that point based upon the initiatives that we started last year and continue to accelerate into this year, which includes the at the improved recruiting, recruiting and retention and the remote add benefit that we've been experiencing to date. So with all of that combined, we expect that to lead to the mid-single digit range in 2025."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from the line of (inaudible) Capital Markets.', ""Congrats on a strong finish to the year so I guess my first question in terms of, you know, the slow start that 2024 has gotten off to and it's certainly encouraging to hear that you're seeing sequential improvement, but is there any one or two things that you would sort of point to that you think are driving that slow start, particularly coming off such a strong finish to 2023?"", 'Reade Fahs', ""I mean, certainly the sector what they call the Arctic blast of our early January was that was a big factor for us. And so that was why we don't think it's a market share related, and we think that's remained healthy. But yes, if the weather piece was a large component of that, again, we're seeing sequential improvement into February."", ""Got it. And I remember that Arctic Blast Well, I probably wouldn't have gone out and gotten new classes then either. I guess my second question --"", 'Reade Fahs', ""And one other thing I'd add one other thing, Anthony, you asked or on that, we're all reading about the slow and delayed tax refunds information and for a tax refund getting to our customers and us a driver for us of Q1 performance is when that those tax refunds get into the hands of our consumer base."", 'Got it. That all makes perfect sense. And then just one follow-up question on what what are your expectations in terms of optometrist on wage pressure in 2024? It is certainly encouraging to hear about the improvements in recruitment and retention but just just wanted to see what your thoughts were there. Thank you.', 'Melissa Rasmussen', ""Hi, Anthony. We have been at the low single digits in ag inflation in optometrist related costs bumped up to mid-single digits in 23. And we expect that to continue into 24 and beyond will have continued pressure based on that. However, with pricing initiatives that we've put in place with exam, we feel that we'll be able to offset some of that pressure."", 'Got it. Thank you so much. Keep up the good work here.', 'Operator', 'Kate McShane, Goldman Sachs.', 'Reade Fahs', ""Okay. Maybe we'll move on and see if Kate wants to come in later."", 'Operator', 'Paul Lewis, Citi.', 'Brandon Cheatham', ""This is Brandon Cheatham on for Paul. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to also ask on like America's Best versus Eyeglass World if we could dig in on that. Do you think there's any cannibalization between the two brands? And then I understand the decision to convert some of the eyeglass worlds in California to America's Best because that's something, you know, if that's successful, you might look at doing them in other states or regions."", 'Reade Fahs', ""And as I said, thank you for that and a few things. First of all, to be clear in California, there was clearly no cannibalization because America's Best and Eyeglass World. We're not there's no overlap in the markets. There are effective. We have found in general these two brands can coexist in a in the same trading area, well, because they do have sort of a they have a different positioning. One one is designed really for people who are very low cost driven the 3D exam, absolute our price, absolute money out of pocket or the other has a broader assortment, more and more designer frames and are more U.S. time conscious consumers. So there's differentiation that that goes on there between them. And we think that California, it is it was a pretty unique situation. So we're not currently discussing and thinking about doing this elsewhere."", 'Brandon Cheatham', 'Got it. Thanks. And maybe the pricing change that you took on standalone exams. Can you detail the timing on that? And do you see consumers on kind of shift their purchasing behavior after you took that pricing in the day, though, kind of take advantage more of the two for two pairs of glasses eye exam for $79.', 'Reade Fahs', ""But so we took a pricing action for Eyeglass World in November, pricing for America's Best in December on it on sort of exam pricing. And me, let me point out something on that, that and I bet it's a minority of people who end up paying for an exam, the America's best experience. If you buy two pairs, the exam is free. The managed care customers who are now able to sell 35% of the business, their their eye exam is paid for by their their insurance. So on so that those who it affects us individually are pretty small in that way. We also showed up, but certainly took some pricing action in the area of various medical services, better optometrist provide that was in the summer that we did that. And that was a we just realized that we were under under the market on that. And that was that was one of the findings from our the pricing study that we talked about in prior Kohl's. And so again, medical services in summer I got through November and America's Best in December."", 'Brandon Cheatham', 'Got it. Thanks very much and good luck.', 'Operator', 'Simeon Gutman, Morgan Stanley.', 'Simeon Gutman', ""Yes, hey, good morning, everyone. My first question is on the adjusted operating income for the year. At the midpoint, it's still lower than the prior year. And even if you net out the savings, the 25 million some of that needs to annualize. I think I get that versus what's being lost. I guess at the midpoint, there's still year-over-year decline or pressure on Melissa mentioned amortization costs. Maybe still weighing on it, but can you give us what's inside like the core, even with the pricing actions? It looks like still declining year over year. So if you can talk about the drivers behind that, please."", 'Melissa Rasmussen', ""Hi, Simeon. If you refer to page 17, you'll see that the midpoint of our guidance range is 3.4%. And we ended 2023 with an adjusted operating margin of 3.4%."", 'Simeon Gutman', 'Yes, I was referring to the dollars.', 'Melissa Rasmussen', ""With these dollars, we had worked in a a range of scenarios. And with the loss of the Walmart AC Lens business, while the adjusted margins will improve, we do have some factors incorporated in there with the top line with the top line revenue loss. The overall guide takes into consideration several scenarios at the high end, which include improved consumer sentiment the and the productivity expansion and improvement in our Eyeglass World performance on the low end, we have the opposite of that as far as decreased consumer sentiment, which may lead to demand issues and less traction in improving our Eyeglass World brand. We've rationalized our home office and taken out and various expenses. As we said, we would last year to offset the Walmart profit loss in addition to taking price increases and with the two of those, we've more than offset it. However, we have in fact, you must add that business, which is a top line impact from."", 'Simeon Gutman', ""And maybe as a follow-up, and I apologize if this was asked on any of the headline pricing items. I don't know if anyone asks if that's exam or product? And are you seeing any elasticity or negative elasticity on some of these actions?"", 'Reade Fahs', ""When we refer to headline price, that's the two for 79 offer. That is the key headline price for America's Best, and we are not believing that that has affected our traffic."", 'Simeon Gutman', 'Okay. Thanks, guys. Good luck.', 'Reade Fahs', 'Thank you, Simeon.', 'Operator', 'Brian Tanquilut, Jefferies.', 'Good morning. (inaudible) on for Brian. Thank you for taking my question. So my first question has to do with the guidance for same-store comps for the year. Appreciate the call out that Q1 will be softer. Right? But just curious you could provide some commentary on how we should be thinking about the ramp throughout the year?', 'Melissa Rasmussen', ""Yes, hi, [Taji]. The rate throughout the year -- first quarter is historically a very strong quarter for us. It's an important quarter for the overall year. And with that coming in flat to slightly negative, that has been factored into the overall guidance range. With that, we historically have seen increased comps as the year progresses, and that too has been built into the past the range of scenarios."", 'Okay. Great. And then kind of looking too, page 17, appreciate the breakdown of the margin progression through 2025. As we think about the three key drivers of that improvement, right, just curious if you could bucket them by important or by influence on the margin. Which is the most important or most key to actually drive that mid-single digits or is it essentially a split between all three?', 'Melissa Rasmussen', ""Yes. So the path to mid-single digit adjusted comparable store sale is an important factor as is gross margin expansion and expense management. So all three of the factors are certainly important in the path to mid-single-digit operating margins in '25."", ""Got it. And just one more question if I can. I wanted to clarify on Michael's question earlier. When he was asking about what improvement in mid-single digit comp in the comps as necessary to reach your 2025 target, was that an application to Eyeglass World specifically? Were you saying like mid-single digits need for Eyeglass World to bridge to 2025? So I have that right?"", 'Melissa Rasmussen', 'No, that is for overall National Vision.', 'Okay, understood. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Adrienne Yih, Barclays.', 'Adrienne Yih', 'Good morning. Reade, just a couple of ones for you. The average managed care on kind of percentage from an industry standpoint, how should we be thinking about that maybe amongst your other competitors? Are there any accelerants to kind of doing that, getting that managed care higher? And what was the impetus sort of for the double that in a particular 50 basis point improvement to 35% stake and the more that I would raise our suite.', 'Reade Fahs', ""Absolutely. Thank you up. So we have always been underpenetrated versus the category in managed care. A few reasons. One is because we're overdeveloped and cash-pay because when it's your money and you don't have vision insurance, you seek out a great value and that's what we provide. In addition, when we bought America's Best in 25. They didn't even accept insurance at that point in time. So we started from a base of zero for the majority of the category, especially the independents especially the more the more mid to high end retailers, it is the majority of their of their business.So we are underpenetrated. We're pleased that it's been progressing in the way it has. And I think what that shows is that consumers are realizing that their managed care dollars go further with us. Then with other places, we do some some marketing to reinforce that. And then of course, there is a really nice word-of-mouth component to this our business because you tend to have the same insurances, the person sitting next to in your office or that you work with, so you can spread the word in that way.So it's been steadily increasing for years, increased even more last year. And we think that it should continue to increase as a percentage of our sales. And I think that's what's especially nice about that is as that grows, it makes us ever more resilient to difficult economic times, but we've got a long way to go before we're anywhere near it at category average."", 'Adrienne Yih', 'Absolutely. And is there on typical -- I know last year the cash card customer, the cash comp was a little bit under pressure. Seems like the fourth quarter was an inflection in both well, managed care probably accelerated, but is this the inflection point in the cash comp (inaudible)?', 'Reade Fahs', ""Well spotted. Good, good job. Yes, yes, indeed, Q4, we did have positive comps for cash pay consumers also. So yes, it was both. So that was a very nice as well. Good, good, good catch. And again, what it reinforced our Q4 was based on what it was primarily driven by transactions, not average ticket and we do like to grow by customer counts. That is the best way to be growing our business and the way we've historically done it majority through transactions more than average sales."", 'Adrienne Yih', ""Absolutely on the transactions. Melissa, for you. The 1Q comp guidance, so I guess when you guys have looked at sort of correlation to tax refunds, I assume that I mean, they're down right? They're kind of double digit that will fix itself over time kind of due to the delay. So how highly correlated to that? And I think the at-risk highly on that never would.And then any help kind of on that flat to slightly negative comp, how should we think about the leverage, the gross margin? Should it be more kind of measured over the four quarters? Or is it pretty even over the fourth quarter that we can start kind of like layering that in in Q1 to offset the comp deleverage? Thanks so much."", 'Melissa Rasmussen', ""Hi, Adrienne. As we think about the first quarter and we we do certainly factor in tax refunds in that guidance, which we've got range is factored into that. The outlook that we've provided and we feel comfortable with the first quarter guidance that we've provided Now with that being said, if the first quarter comes in on the lower end, it is harder to leverage that cost structure that we have in place. As you move into the back half of the year, all of the gross margin expansion will come in the back half of the year once we have exited the Walmart and AC Lens business. So for modeling purposes, that's where you should should see the gross margin improvement."", 'Operator', 'Dylan Carden, William Blair.', 'Dylan Carden', ""I'm just trying to understand the deceleration in remote care rollout. And I guess from the seeming discrepancy between about 60% of America's Best stores now having remote capacity and only 5% of exams, if I have that statistic right, is the deceleration more result of cost consciousness in this sort of year of some noise around costs? Or is it that you're seeing better progression on demand dark stores from a recruitment standpoint? I guess maybe let's start there for."", 'Patrick Moore', ""Hey, Dan, it's Patrick. Good morning, Bob. You're right. Remote has been a really important and high impact program for us. You get a couple of months that which was 5% of all exams and in and in states where we are running remote is significantly higher. The the slowdown in the rollout this year or that deployment is really a function of our comfort level of taking our remote model into specific states.And so at the end of 2023, we had taken it into all states that we consider effectively green goes sites there are a few large ones that we would really like to go to, but they're still in the yellow zone. We're monitoring that closely and over time have telemedicine laws and approaches remain fluid. I think we'll have a shot at that.So this is really all about where do we feel good about taking our removing sands and in doing that locally and according to SEC rules and regulations, I will say this even in light of us only taking it to 50 more APs this year, and that's basically a mostly new stores there will be a few EGW.s in there. We will continue to reap the benefits of getting better and better at remote for those 500 plus that we've already rolled it out to. So we've made great advances this year in terms of making remote way of life is having nice impacts for the business. But even stores that have been running running in for a year or so pay, they're still there still low hanging fruit to grab. There is our store teams get more and more comfortable and our doctors get more and more productive."", 'Dylan Carden', ""Well, I guess that's where I was going to go with this. As you do slow the pace of the rollout, just always felt to me like a pretty not insignificant margin opportunity in that you're sort of cutting down on that chair time, which I think you run higher than the industry average. I mean, should you -- is there any sort of embedded benefit this year or next to the mid-single digit target sort of from maturing remote capabilities that you can either quantify or speak towards?"", 'Patrick Moore', ""There are definitely benefits included in the guidance. We expect to see increasing levels of remote doctor productivity based on us getting kind of the supply and demand balance of better aligned in and frankly, still as we've seen some really nice improvements thus far this year that we think fall will aid our performance, and that's included in what Melissa shared."", 'Dylan Carden', ""Got it. And finally, just on pricing, it sounds I know you've taken headline price up in the last couple of years as America's Best. But on more recent late '23 priced met tons almost entirely related to exams. Any update or thinking around maybe sort of peripheral product price opportunity? Yeah."", 'Reade Fahs', ""We did that study last year. It's pricing is a lever we use. We're always looking at different pieces. We thought the lowest hanging fruit came in the exam and medical services areas since we provide still nice added value there. And where we are relative to competition.

I want to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter earnings call. It's such a great time to be in the cruise industry with wonderful new products available across all 3 of our award-winning brands. The demand for cruise vacations is certainly as robust as we have ever seen it. And the continued innovation on board is leading to outstanding financial performance and exceptional guest satisfaction scores and guest repeat rates. Today, it's my pleasure to discuss some of our key milestones in 2023, our progress on our near-term priorities, recent booking trends and our outlook for 2024. Later in the call, I'll turn it over to Mark, who will provide more color on our 2023 performance and guidance for 2024. Now 2023 can best be described as a landmark year for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. We started the year on the heels of the last of the impact from COVID and the last of the cruise ports reopening in the Asia Pacific region throughout Q1. But as you can see on Slide 5, consumer demand was quick to rebound in full and we were pleased to return to full ships and full year profitability. It is so incredibly rewarding for our staff and crew to be able to operate full ships and deliver vacation experiences of a lifetime to our happy guests. While that in and of itself would have made for a spectacular 2023, we were further going by the introduction of 3 new world-class ships into our fleet, one for each of our 3 award-winning brands. This was an unprecedented achievement and a first in the 57-year history of our company. We welcomed Oceania Cruises Vista in May, Norwegian Viva in August, and most recently, the highly anticipated Regent Seven Seas Grandeur in November. The successful launch of 3 vessels in 1 year would not have been possible without the hard work and unwavering commitment of crew and team members across the globe. Thanks to their dedication and passion for providing an unmatched guest experience, the reception for these new ships continues to be overwhelmingly positive across the board. This reception, combined with the strong demand environment, we continue to experience across all 3 of our brands, has enabled us to successfully absorb an 18% increase in capacity in 2023 versus 2019 levels at record pricing levels. As a result, we have driven revenue per passenger cruise day up 17%, allowing us to finish the year with year-end advanced ticket sales of $3.2 billion up an incredible 56% compared to 2019. At the same time, we continue to maximize onboard revenue generation, as shown by growth onboard revenue per passenger cruise day, which is up 27% over 2019. A main driver of this large improvement is through enhanced presold onboard revenue, so our guests come on board with a fresh wallet. But none of this is new news. As we have been and continue to be the industry leader in net yields. We are proud of the work our teams do day in and day out to drive the highest yields in the industry. But today, I also want to emphasize that we are equally passionate about the cost side of the business. Our relentless focus on cost optimization has produced 4 sequential quarters of year-over-year adjusted new -- of year-over-year adjusted net cruise cost per capacity day reduction with full year 2023 coming in 21% lower than the prior year. We achieved this by focusing our efforts on optimizing spend and investments across all areas of the business, from fuel to food and consumables and marketing. We are committed to continuing to optimize our margins by balancing products, revenue and cost considerations through better leveraging data and analytics to drive decision-making and accountability. The net result of these healthy revenue and cost metrics allowed us to get back to driving results. As we generated $1.9 billion in adjusted EBITDA in 2023, allowing us to generate the adjusted free cash flow to further strengthen our balance sheet with the repayment of nearly $2 billion in debt. On the product front, we are strategically enhancing the guest experience by identifying smart ROI-driven investments and decisions to profitably maximize guest satisfaction. Our recent success has been the rollout of Starlink high-speed Internet. We moved quickly and have been able to roll out this cutting-edge technology across half of our fleet since the spring of 2023 and expect to finish the full fleet by year-end this year. In addition, to significantly elevating the guest experience aboard our ships, we've been focusing on improving the pre-cruise guest experience and better leveraging digital tools across all 3 of our brands. For example, we've been making improvements to our pre-cruise planning functionality at Norwegian to allow guests to book even more before they leave their homes, and we rolled out a flexible air program at Oceania, sharing an innovation which began at Norwegian earlier in the year. This innovation gives guests the few day window to deviate their air at the beginning and end of their cruise so they can have more time to explore and enjoy destinations before and after they sail with us, while at the same time, allowing us to spread air demand over multiple days and save costs, a true win-win for us and our guests. On the digital side, we recently launched the Regent onboard mobile app on Seven Seas Grandeur, and we continue to see strong adoption of the NCL mobile app, which reached record high guest usage in January. These improvements are not only resonating with our guests, giving them a better and more frictionless experience before, during and after their cruise, but are also generating positive returns. Finally, we announced important interim sustainability commitments, announcing our target to reduce greenhouse gas intensity on a capacity a day basis by 10% by 2026 and by 25% by 2030 versus 2019 levels. The company is truly firing on all cylinders. These solid operational and financial results have laid the foundation for a strong 2024 and position us to deliver sustained profitable growth in the future and incredible vacation experiences to the millions of guests who sail with us every year. In addition to these priorities, a key cornerstone of our long-term strategy is delivering measured capacity growth and optimizing our fleet to drive strong financial results. Our new build pipeline of 5 ships, which you can see on Slide 7, represents a capacity growth of 28% from 2023 to 2028 with a 5% CAGR over the period. Historically, capacity growth has led to outsized revenue and EBITDA growth and we expect this capacity growth to be no different and deliver meaningful top and bottom line growth. We believe that these measured capacity additions will enable us to further enhance our long-term profitability and continue to significantly strengthen our balance sheet while providing guests new and innovative experiences. Shifting our discussion to the current booking environment shown on Slide 8. We continue to experience strong and resilient customer demand across all 3 of our brands. The strong momentum we saw in 2023 has continued into 2024 with an all-time high book position and pricing buoyed by strong wave season demand. This has led to some of the best booking weeks in the company history, which began with successful Black Friday and Cyber Monday promotions. In general, we continue to see healthy demand across all markets, brands and products. Let me walk you through some recent trends. First, close-in demand for Caribbean sailing is particularly strong prompting the redeployment of Norwegian Epic and Norwegian Getaway from offering shoulder season full 2024 voyages in the med to offering Caribbean sailings from Port Canaveral and New Orleans, respectively, beginning in October. As a result, our Caribbean capacity for the NCL brand is expected to increase by approximately 300 basis points in 2024 versus the prior year. Our industry's advantage lies in our ability to redeploy our ships and adapt to changes in consumer demand and preferences. These changes demonstrate our team's responsiveness to our guests' preferences. We have also seen demand return for sailings in Hawaii. While only accounting for approximately 4% of capacity in this period, these sailings are performing exceptionally well in 2024. Next, our Norwegian Cruise Line brand continues to see exceptionally strong demand and our book position and pricing are higher than last year for all 4 quarters of 2024. Oceania, Regent also continued to see strong demand across all geographies with the exception of redeployed voyages due to cancellations in the Middle East and Red Sea. Turning to the Middle East. Last quarter, we made the preemptive decision to cancel all calls to Israel in 2024. And recently, we have announced the rerouting of our cruises sailing through the Red Sea for the rest of the year. As a reminder, just 1% and 4% of our capacity in Q1 and full year '24, respectively, was expected to dip in the broader Middle East region. However, the Middle East represents a larger percentage of our capacity for our Oceania and Regent brands making up 12% and 8%, respectively. We now have no calls in the region in 2024 and all replacement cruises have been or are in the process of being put on sale. Overall, we are encouraged by the strength in our book position for 2024, which remains at all-time highs with commensurate higher pricing. As a result, 2024 is shaping up to be a solid year. We expect healthy full year net yield growth of approximately 5.4% this year on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by improved occupancy and pricing strength. Onboard revenue continues to be a bright spot with strength seen across the board, an encouraging indicator that our target consumer remains healthy and resilient. We are continuing to see strong demand for pre-cruise purchases which typically results in higher overall spend throughout a guest cruise journey. And while we have talked about our strong cost focus during 2023, we want to emphasize that this was not just a 1-year exercise for our team. Rather, it is a cultural shift in the way our entire company looks at cost to ensure that we are operating as efficiently as possible while delivering experiences our guests truly value. This company-wide focus should allow us to not only continue to reduce costs but even more importantly, create operating leverage to enhance profitability, which will be foundational for our long-term success. Our recently established transformation office is allowing us to monitor and track these changes holding each area accountable for their initiatives. We believe this is apparent in our guidance where we expect our core cost to be flat in 2024 versus 2023. In conclusion, our strong top line growth, combined with our continued focus on cost and margin enhancements are expected to drive 2024 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS to grow by 18% and 76%, respectively, over last year. We are very excited about the future, and we plan to discuss our multiyear targets with the investment community in mid-May. We look forward to meeting with you all then. With that, I'll turn it over to Mark to walk you through our financial results and outlook. Mark?"", 'Mark A. Kempa', ""Thank you, Harry, and good morning, everyone. My commentary today will focus on our fourth quarter 2023 financial results, 2024 guidance, and our financial position. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary on 2023 and 2024 net per diem, net yield and adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel per capacity day metrics are on a constant currency basis and comparisons are to the same period in 2019 and 2023, respectively. Let's begin with our fourth quarter results, which are highlighted on Slide 11. Starting with the top line, results were strong with net per diems increasing approximately 14.5% and net yield increasing approximately 8.6%. As discussed last quarter, Several factors contributed to the exceptionally strong growth we saw, including the favorable comp from the rapid exit of Cuba in 2019 as well as a very strong close-in demand for Caribbean sailings. Looking at costs. Adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel per capacity day was in line with guidance at $151 in the quarter marking our fourth consecutive quarter of improvement on this important metric. As expected, this included approximately $1 of certain nonrecurring net benefits realized in the quarter. We have made significant progress streamlining our cost base during 2023, demonstrating our focus and commitment to our margin enhancement initiatives, and expect to continue this focus in 2024 and beyond. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $360 million, in line with guidance, while adjusted EPS was a loss of negative $0.18 slightly below guidance due to a $0.06 impact from FX below the line. Overall, we were very pleased with the results we generated in the fourth quarter and full year. Strong top line growth combined with continued progress on reducing costs, enabled us to generate full year adjusted EBITDA just short of $1.9 billion and adjusted EPS of $0.70. All of which drove strong adjusted free cash flow of $1.1 billion. I am confident that our improved financial performance in 2023 has set the foundation for a solid 2024 and beyond. Moving on to expectations for '24. Our outlook for the first quarter and full year can be found on Slide 12. Starting with the full year, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately $2.2 billion, an 18% improvement versus 2023 with adjusted EBITDA margins expected to improve by almost 250 basis points. Adjusted net income is expected to be approximately $635 million with adjusted EPS expected at approximately $1.23, a 76% increase versus 2023. Before I get into our top line expectations, there are a couple of important points to keep in mind for your models. First, given our strong expected net income growth for the year, shares related to our exchangeable notes are expected to be dilutive and are included in our share count for 2024. As a reminder, we must settle the exchangeable notes due in 2024 and 2025 in shares while both of our exchangeable notes due 2027 can be settled in cash or shares at our sole election. However, the accounting treatment requires we consider all notes as if they were settled in shares. As a result, we assume our full year 2024 average share count to be approximately 516 million. Secondly, we successfully migrated our tax residency from the U.K. to Bermuda as of December 31, 2023, and we do not expect recently enacted Bermuda corporate income tax legislation to have a significant impact on our overall tax rate as this was already assumed in our planning. Taking a closer look at the components of the outlook, occupancy is expected to be approximately 105%. Net yield is expected to increase approximately 5.5% inclusive of the headwinds from the outsized impact of the Middle East and Red Sea on our Oceania and Regent brands primarily in the second and fourth quarter. For modeling purposes, our year yield growth will be highest in the first quarter as we are lapping lower load factors and a non-optimized itinerary mix in the first quarter of 2023. In addition, we are seeing strong demand for Caribbean sailings in the first quarter of 2024, which represents approximately 58% of our total deployment in the quarter. For the remainder of the year, yield growth is expected to return to more normalized levels despite the pressure from the aforementioned Middle East and Red Sea headwinds. Moving to costs. Adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day is expected to average approximately $159 for the full year. This represents a 3.4% increase versus full year 2023, but -- which includes the incremental impact of more dry dock days in 2024. Excluding that impact, our core costs are essentially flat on a year-over-year basis. To put this in perspective, this effectively represents approximately $100 million of cost savings given our expected core inflation rate of around 3% for next year. For modeling purposes, keep in mind that 2023 had less dry docks than normal as we took the opportunity to dry docks ships while they were out of service, this year we are returning to a more normalized dry dock schedule and expect roughly a 175 dry dock days in the year. This will impact adjusted cruise cost ex fuel by approximately 325 basis points on a year-over-year basis or approximately $5 on a unit cost basis. This includes both the impact of dry dock costs and the related reduction of capacity days. Excluding the impact of that, we expect full year adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel would be approximately $154 essentially flat on a year-over-year basis. Note that the timing of this impact is expected to be weighted more to the first half of the year, with approximately 2/3 of our dry dock days occurring in that period. This year we will continue to be relentless in our efforts to enhance margins and reduce costs. We are leaving no stone unturned and are continually identifying opportunities big and small across the business. Our transformation office is running full speed ahead in identifying operating inefficiencies and operating -- and opportunities for improvement across all areas of our operating platform in order to enhance the acceleration of our margin recovery and related cash generation. One key focus area for us has been optimizing both our fuel consumption and bunkering strategies. Fuel costs are one of our largest expense line items, and our teams have been hard at work at fostering partnerships with the likes of DNV on decarbonization and long term agreements with industry leader ABB to drive new opportunities to lower our fuel consumption per capacity day. In addition to the consumption side of the equation we have made a big leap in the optimization of our fuel bunkering strategy that allows us to maximize price leverage across the various ports and suppliers we use during a season and in many cases even during a single voyage. We believe this will drive double-digit millions in savings in the first year alone. This is just one of the many examples that support our relentless drive to improve our unit costs and leverage our scale all without impacting the guest experience. I look forward to sharing many more tangible examples at our upcoming Investor Day in May. The combination of our more efficient cost structure and strong expected top line growth for the year is expected to drive the expansion of our full year adjusted EBITDA margins up by approximately 250 basis points. Now let's take a look at our expectations for the first quarter. As I said earlier, net yield is strong in the first quarter and is expected to increase approximately 15.5%. Adjusted net cruise cost ex fuel per capacity day is expected to be $165 or approximately 3% versus the same quarter last year. As mentioned, we expect an increase in dry dock days in the quarter, which will have a $6 or a 350 basis point impact on adjusted net cruise cost in Q1. Excluding that impact, adjusted net cruise costs would be $159, essentially flat on a year-over-year basis, demonstrating our ability to offset the impact of inflation with our cost savings. As a result, adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter is expected to be approximately $450 million. Adjusted net income is expected to be approximately $50 million and adjusted EPS is expected to be approximately $0.12. Given the quarter is essentially complete, we do not expect significant outperformance in the top line versus expectations as the vast majority of our inventory is already sold. Any limited upside would result from our onboard revenue generating performance during the month of March. Moving on to our balance sheet and debt maturity profile on Slide 14. In 2023, we generated almost $2 billion of net cash from operating activities, which included $500 million return of cash collateral. And we repaid $1.9 billion of debt, including the full paydown of our $875 million revolving loan facility. Most recently, we successfully negotiated a refinancing of our $650 million backstop commitment from a secured to an unsecured basis. And in connection with this refinancing $250 million 9.75 secured notes due in 2028, our highest interest rate debt is expected to be repaid. This refinancing, which is expected to close in early March will reduce interest expense, improve leverage while also releasing all of the related collateral, another important step forward in improving our balance sheet. Moving to leverage on Slide 15. The company has a solid track record of delevering the balance sheet. From 2014 to 2019, we successfully delevered by over 3 turns. We will continue to be opportunistic and look for further ways to strengthen our balance sheet. We are confident we can make meaningful progress on this front going forward. At year-end '23, with reported net leverage of approximately 7.3x or approximately 6.75x when excluding the impact of ships delivered in the second half of the year. We continue to expect significant improvement in this metric over time, driven by our organic cash generation and scheduled debt amortization payments. Over the course of 2024, we expect to reduce our reported leverage by almost 1.5 turns with sequential improvements in each quarter. This improvement does not assume any prepayment of debt, apart from the aforementioned takeout of our $250 million notes expected in early March. Going forward, we are refining a multiyear plan to further accelerate the reduction of leverage and derisk our balance sheet in order to drive shareholder value. With that, I'll turn it back to Harry for closing remarks."", 'Harry J. Sommer', ""Well, thank you, Mark. Truly encouraging results. Moving forward, our entire team will be focused on the most important work. First, we will continue to execute on our near-term priorities and capitalize on the strong demand from cruising from our target upscale demographic. Second, we will build upon the progress we've already made with our ongoing margin enhancement efforts with further improvements in costs. And finally, we will continue to improve our balance sheet and reduce leverage over time. In closing, I couldn't be more excited about the year ahead. I am confident that we have the right resources in place to capitalize on the strong demand environment and deliver exceptional vacation experiences for our guests across all 3 of our brands, execute on our operational and financial goals for 2024 and ultimately deliver long-term profitable growth and shareholder value. I look forward to share you the results of our strategic assessment of our business and defining our vision for the future of the company, including long-term financial targets at our Investor Day this coming May. With that, I'm happy to turn it over to the operator for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions)Our first question is coming from Brandt Montour of Barclays.', 'Brandt Antoine Montour', ""So looking at your 1Q guidance and the full year net yield guidance, there obviously is a pretty big decel or sort of a more conservative implied growth in the back -- in the sort of 2Q through 4Q net yield. But it's not out of line with your longer-term algo on that 2Q to 4Q. So I guess the question is, one, would you be willing to, Mark, or Harry willing to sort of quantify the disruption from the Middle East and the repositioning of those ships and sort of give us a sense for what the core business outside of those disruptions, how you see that sort of growing in the back half of the year?"", 'Harry J. Sommer', ""Yes. Thank you, Brandt, again, for that. So I do think you have the right thought pattern. Q2 to Q4 are in line with our long-term express goals where we look to have low to mid-single-digit yield growth, of course, measured capacity growth, strong cost controls, all leading to outsized EBITDA and margin performances, which should allow us to continue to strengthen our balance sheet. I think you are right that the situation in the Red Sea, Suez Canal had some impact on our Oceania, Regent brand, not on NCL. NCL is extraordinarily strong in all 4 quarters, as we see the booking patterns now. But for the Oceania and Regent perspective, since it was 8% and 12% of their respective capacities, we would expect that to have an impact of about 1 to 2 points on yield in the back 3 quarters of the year. What that means, all that's taken into consideration in the guidance we provided. So we stand by our numbers. And what that means is we should have a modest tailwind in 2025 when those -- when we less those items."", 'Brandt Antoine Montour', ""That's super helpful. That's great. And then as a follow-up, taking the Middle East disruption -- direct disruption out of it and just thinking about core Europe sailings, core Norwegian-branded Europe sailings, Americans traveling to Europe. That's an area that people -- that some of us have been a little bit more concerned about. Maybe talk about the evolution of the bookings patterns you're seeing in that specific segment? And should we be taking that into account when we think about the cadence for the 3Q?"", 'Harry J. Sommer', ""We talked last year a little bit about some of the challenges we had coming out of COVID with some of our itineraries that require a slightly longer booking period like Europe. And I think that had impacted some of our results in Q3 or Q4 of last year -- I'm sorry, Q2 or Q3 of last year, my apologies, when we gave the results in our earnings calls. We learned from that, and we've absolutely extended our booking curve for Europe, primarily for Americans going into the 2024 season. So we're very happy with what we're seeing across all 3 brands, with the exception of those cruises that had previously been going to Israel and the Middle East on the Oceania, Regent brand."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. The next question is coming from Andrew Didora of Bank of America.', 'Andrew George Didora', ""Harry, I guess, just when I think about the visibility into the first half of '24 and maybe for the full year, just curious how kind of your booking curve has changed over the years. And I think Mark spoke about 1Q, obviously, being fully booked here. Kind of where do you stand in terms of 2Q being booked at this point? And how should we think about where you stand for full year '24 based on your budgeted capacity."", 'Harry J. Sommer', ""Well, thank you, Andrew, for that question. We don't give specific guidance on our book position for each quarter. Yes, Mark did say we are entirely booked for Q1 because we're sitting here on February -- late February, February 27. So we're not going to get any more meaningful bookings for Q1. But for the other 3 quarters, we continue to be with the exception of those Red Sea and Middle East Cruises, which I referred to before, in record booked positions where we're referring to as all-time high booked positions across the 3 quarters and especially on the NCL brand."", 'Andrew George Didora', ""Okay. And Mark, just on the balance sheet. Obviously, you're addressing the expense of 2028 maturity. I guess I thought you couldn't prepay debt before all the deferred amortizations, you can also kind of proactively pay down? I know it's not in your assumptions, but just curious if it's possible or is it just too costly to do at this point?"", 'Mark A. Kempa', ""Andrew, you're right. Technically, we do not have the capability to technically prepay debt until we have all of our deferred amortization cut up. However, with this particular transaction, it is deemed a refinancing and as such, we do have the ability to take out that portion of the debt. As we look forward over the course of the remainder of the year of '24, we do have some notes that are maturing in December $565 million, 3.625% notes which are very cost effective, but we will be looking to address those between now and sometime obviously, well before the end of the year. And then outside of that, a little bit too early for us to be thinking about or giving guidance in terms of what we may or may not take out. But I think the point to be made here really is that we are now starting to actively address the balance sheet and address the leverage. And we've always said this will be a little bit of a chip away each year, and we're happy that coming out of the gate for 2024, we've been able to start that. So we're very excited about that. It's definitely a solid path to -- in our journey."", 'Operator', 'The next question is coming from Steve Wieczynski of Stifel.', 'Steven Moyer Wieczynski', ""So Harry or Mark, first off, congratulations on the cost improvement. It's been pretty impressive. And as we move through this year and we think about costs then for the out years, I mean, how do you guys think about cost growth or lack of cost growth in those as we move past 2024. I mean, I would assume it's going to be tough to keep cost in that flattish range. So just maybe some color around your long-term cost outlook moving forward would be helpful."", 'Harry J. Sommer', ""So thank you, Steve, for those the kind words on cost control. It's something that we're extraordinarily proud of, and as Mark mentioned in his prepared comments, represents over $100 million improvement versus core inflation. Listen, I -- we're not here to give specific guidance yet on '25 and '26, so we won't. We'll do that in -- we give our long-term financial metric outlook in our Investor Day in May. But I will say that this goal of being able to grow cost at less than the rate of inflation is certainly something that we inspire to do on a long-term basis. So I know that's not exactly what you're looking for, but hopefully gives you some indication of our direction."", 'Mark A. Kempa', ""And Steve, to just further highlight what Harry is saying is I want to make it very clear. We've been laser-focused on this. We are looking at all different ways how we can improve and more importantly, improve and get more efficient to leverage our scale. We've said time and again, this is not a onetime exercise. This is what we've actually established a transformation office, which I imagine will become something like a continuous improvement office. But things -- we're setting up performance dashboards. I talked about some of our bunkering strategies. There's a lot of ways where we can improve the overall underlying fundamental cost structure, all without impacting the guest experience. I talked about our fuel, I talked about our bunkering strategy, food waste. Food waste is just a big area that when you start really monitoring the waste side of it, has significant upstream benefits when you think about the waste side of it. So again, we're focused on this. We got the message. We've been taking this serious. And we believe there's multiyear benefits here, but we look forward to certainly sharing more details around that in our May Investor Day."", 'Steven Moyer Wieczynski', ""Okay. Got you. And then second question, you mentioned in the release that pricing and bookings are higher for the Norwegian brand for all 4 quarters of this year. Just wondering if you can give a little bit more color about what you're seeing in terms of what kind of price action you can take for more second half of this year into 2025. And then maybe also a little bit of color around the luxury brands, which obviously are being somewhat impacted by what's going on in the Med, but any color there would be helpful as well."", 'Harry J. Sommer', ""Yes. So listen, on the NCL brand, we have very robust and sophisticated revenue management systems. And when we see demand as it is today, we take price action or promotional action, which is sort of an opaque way to take price action in order to generate the highest yields for the company, and we're doing that. So nothing has changed in our core philosophy from that perspective. When demand is good, we take advantage of it. And I think it's reflected in our oversized gains for Q1 and our reasonably strong gains for Q2 to Q4, especially on the NCL brand. In Oceania, Regent, I want to be clear, there's something fundamentally wrong with the model at the luxury space. We see demand for luxury being very high. But when you have to take 60 or 70 days out of service on 2 ships out of a regularly small fleet for 2 brands, it does have an outsized impact on the ability to grow yield at those 2 brands. We hope that to be a onetime thing. All the new voyages for Oceania, Regent, with the new deployment already on sale and starting to fill, well albeit because we're filling them closer in it at lower pricing than we normally would have gotten, but it's just limited to those areas. We are very happy with the performance on Oceania and Regent, in the other regions of the world."", 'Mark A. Kempa', ""And Steve, in terms of the Norwegian brand, not apart from our sophisticated revenue management systems, let's not forget our models around onboard revenue. We are in a continuous improvement mode in terms of expanding our presale of onboard revenue and getting more share of the wallet over a longer period of time from the point a customer enters our ecosystem. And we continue to refine that. We continue to look at that. And that plays a key part as we -- going forward as we look at our revenue opportunity. So that's something we are very, very focused on."", 'Operator', 'The next question is coming from Daniel Politzer of Wells Fargo.', 'Daniel Brian Politzer', ""I just wanted to dive a little bit deeper, just make sure I'm understanding your comments in terms of how you're thinking about the yield growth for this year. So the Middle East, it sounds like the impact is largest in the second quarter and the fourth quarter. So is it fair to assume the third quarter in terms of the yield growth, first quarter, third quarter and then 2Q, 4Q about the same in terms of greatest to least?"", 'Harry J. Sommer', ""Yes, Dan, certainly, when you look at the impact of the Middle East on the O&R brands, it's definitely impacting us more in the second and fourth quarter, as mentioned in our results. So I think as you look across the 3 quarters, as we said in our prepared remarks, you're going to see more of a normalized consistent yield growth. There's always some puts and takes within each quarter, but I wouldn't expect any significant lumpiness necessarily, so to speak, across the remaining 3 quarters."", 'Daniel Brian Politzer', ""Got it. And then just for my follow-up, this is maybe an add-on to Brandt's question. But as we think about that second quarter to fourth quarter and kind of getting back to a more normal algo, I think, Harry, you mentioned geopolitical was maybe 1 or 2 points of a headwind. But I think you've also been pretty adamant that you guys were going to guide a fairly conservative outlook for the year. So I guess as we think about that, the 2Q through fourth quarter outlook, like to what degree you're baking in conservatism and any impact from itinerary mix shifts?"", 'Harry J. Sommer', ""I think if we told you what level of conservatism we are baking into our guidance, I wouldn't be giving you new guidance. So listen, suffice to say that we are providing the numbers that we're confident in. We have, of course, incredible visibility into future book positions. So I'm not saying there's no upside there, but I certainly wouldn't expect huge upside to the numbers that we've provided. We're going to manage our business to the best of our abilities, and we're providing you numbers that we are confident that we can hit."", 'Operator', 'The next question is coming from James Hardiman of Citi..', 'James Lloyd Hardiman', ""Thanks for taking my call. So I don't want to belabor the point, but just this sort of this dichotomy between 1Q and the rest of the year on the yield front. Obviously, some of that is just occupancy, right, that catch up. But if I think about, what I get to is being maybe 800 to 900 basis point detail from 1Q to the rest of the year. How much can just be explained by mix, right? I mean you've got the slide that shows Europe going from 0% to 34% and 51%, while the Caribbean is coming down from 58% to 18%. Obviously, Caribbean pricing is a lot more robust than what we're seeing out of Europe. Is there any way to quantify how much of that decel just stems from that? And I guess is there a way to think about sort of how you're seeing like-for-like pricing in North America and Europe as we get past the first quarter and into the rest of the year?"", 'Harry J. Sommer', ""James, I appreciate the question as always. Listen, I don't think there's really much of a mix issue here from the perspective that our deployment in 2024 is not that much different than our deployment in 2023 with the exception of the couple of big NCL ships that we moved out of Europe a month or 2 early in early Q4. So I wouldn't necessarily say to Q4-ish, right? I think there's 2 primary issues that we've discussed, which I'm happy to articulate, Q1 of '23 was particularly weak, coming out of COVID, there was short booking curves. There were disruptions, especially on the Oceania and Regent brand with our itineraries that visited Asia, Australia. Both those brands have world crews, which was very difficult to sell, given the time commitment that gets past to make and the fact that they would have had to make those decisions in early '22 when COVID was still alive and well. So we're coming off a reasonably weak comp in Q1. That being said, we're still very, very happy that we were able to get Q1 of '24 back to where it is with a 16% growth year-over-year. So obviously, there's some spend in Q1. It's not of this year, not just the weakness of last year. I think the other 3 quarters, the only issue that we're seeing when we look across the brands, across the quarters, across the geographic areas, it's simply this issue with the Red Sea and Suez, which I want to elaborate because I talked to it before. We believe we have the right mix of Caribbean product for our guest set over the summer. We do have ships in the Caribbean. We don't go to a 0% capacity, but we have seen higher returns out of Europe and Alaska and Bermuda than we do out of the Caribbean, which is why we position our ships there. So it's possible that the growth in the Caribbean could have been more, but the end result would have been less. I repeat what I said in my prepared remarks, we still have the highest net yields within the competitive set. So maybe we would have grown more on a like-for-like basis, but it would have resulted in a lower overall number if we positioned more of our capacity in the Caribbean."", 'Mark A. Kempa', ""And James, just keep in mind, when you think about 2024, Obviously, we're getting the benefit in Q1 versus Q1 of '23 an outsized growth algo because of the aforementioned factors. But then you roll that forward and you look at Q4 of 2023, where we had roughly 8.5%, 9% yield growth, we're going to be lapping over that in the fourth quarter of this year. So there is a little bit of lapping issues going on. But I think as Harry said, the underlying strength in pricing in the business is looking good across all sectors and all geopolitical areas, I'm sorry, all geographical areas, apart from the Middle Sea and the Red Sea area."", 'James Lloyd Hardiman', ""Got it. And maybe just a follow-up there to that geographical point. So if I just think about 5.5, call it, yield growth for the year, I guess that's probably if we just thought about pricing, right, ex the occupancy piece maybe 4Q, call it, is there ex the Red Sea and the Middle East impact, is there a meaningful difference in terms of how we're thinking -- we should be thinking about pricing growth for Europe versus pricing growth for the Caribbean, but maybe not."", 'Harry J. Sommer', ""I don't think there's any meaningful difference between the markets, James. I think we're -- again, we're seeing strong pricing for all those markets and other markets. So obviously, you have a total difference in net per diem depending on the area of operation. But in terms of growth, we're not seeing any sort of significant differences between markets."", 'James Lloyd Hardiman', 'Got it. Very helpful. and good luck.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. The next question is coming from Vince Ciepiel of Cleveland Research.', 'Vince Charles Ciepiel', ""I wanted to dig into the margin a little bit helpful, your color on, I think, close to 2.5 points of improvement that gets you back to about the mid-20s, but there's still a handful of points behind where you were pre-COVID. And maybe you could help walk through some of those moving pieces. I think selling more air is probably just a headwind as it's more of a pass-through. I think that fuel is probably a point or so of headwind. But just help us kind of understand and bridge the margin differential versus pre-COVID times and get your confidence on a path back to getting close to something near 30% over time?"", 'Mark A. Kempa', ""Yes. Thanks, Vince. While I don't want to give too many details because I think we're going to give some significant visibility at our May Investor Day. But look, the bottom line is really that we have to continue to improve on our pricing. That's key number one. But it all comes down to leveraging our cost base and our unit cost and leveraging that scale. We've made significant progress, what I would say in the last 18 to 20 months when we really first started addressing this back in the second half of 2022. So we're going to continue to look at that. We have to improve. When you think about overall cost from 2019, when we look at it, I think we were somewhere about a 3% CAGR over 2019 through 2024 guidance. So we think we can definitely improve on that. Obviously, there is some incremental drag from fuel given new regulations versus '19 and '24 and so on. But we have to do a better job of leveraging our scale. We're doing that. As I've said, we've been able to confidently mitigate over $100 million of expected inflation in 2024. It's no small feat that I want to reiterate, when we look at our cost base, excluding the dry dock and the reduced capacity days, our cost base is flat, expected to be flat for 2024. So I want to make sure everybody understands that. It doesn't end here. We're looking at everything and we think there's continuous opportunity there. So we're going to chip away at that. And I think in a combination between, again, strong top line growth and moderate cost growth or improvement, we think definitely there's opportunity for significant margin expansion over time."", 'Harry J. Sommer', ""And just to add to that, I know we talk a lot about metrics, NCC excluding fuel, or NCC excluding fuel and dry dock, but I want to emphasize that fuel expense is not something we ignore. Mark talked about it extensively in his prepared remarks. And our goal is to find ways to reduce consumption. Ultimately, obviously, that's great for our sustainability goals, but it's also great for our overall profitability. So I don't want to -- despite the fact that we don't necessarily report on that metric extensively, I want to assure everyone that is one of the main focuses. I mean we spend something like $700 million a year on fuel, and Mark talked about the multi-, multi-, multi-million dollar things that we're going to do to improve fuel from bunkering to better monitoring and things like that. And those numbers are real and of course, are reflected in our EBITDA numbers."", 'Vince Charles Ciepiel', ""And then maybe one more for thinking about this kind of more normalized yield growth 2Q through 4Q. And maybe walk us through how you envision onboard versus ticket versus occupancy gains kind of contributing to that growth? And if it's equal, if one is a bigger driver? Any additional color there would be helpful."", 'Mark A. Kempa', ""Yes. Look, onboard revenue is always a significant generator of our overall revenue profile. When you look at the quarters 2 through 4, yes, I think we're getting probably, what, about 1.5 points of occupancy benefit in those 3 quarters, and the rest is really coming on the back of pricing. So on board is an important component, it always is, and it always has been. We'll continue to improve on that. Our goal, again, is to get more of that wallet share well prior to the customer over stepping on foot any one of our vessels. And we continue to improve on that. And that -- but I don't think there's going to -- I don't think we're expecting any meaningful outsized growth from that particular revenue stream versus necessarily our core ticket price across the 3 brands."", 'Harry J. Sommer', 'Donna, I think we have time for one more question, please.', 'Operator', 'Our final question today is coming from Conor Cunningham of Melius Research.', 'Conor T. Cunningham', ""Maybe if I could just sneak 2 in. Just on the cost trajectory in 2024. Trying to understand a little bit more. I understand the dry docks and the inflation, but it's -- what's the offset that's happening there? Is marketing spend kind of trending down? And maybe secondly to stick with Mark on that as well. The comments around the balance sheet improvement, the tone is definitely changing. So that's positive. Simple maths as you're going to 6x leverage. Are we going to get back to this 3x to 4x that you did pre-COVID? Just any thoughts there would be helpful."", 'Harry J. Sommer', ""Yes. So I'll let Mark talk about our balance sheet number because we're very proud of that. And I'll let him finish up the commentary on that. But on the cost side, this isn't specifically related to marketing. We obviously will look at improvements in efficiencies and marketing in the same way we look at efficiencies everywhere else. But any improvement we find in marketing will be strictly around efficiency, the volume, if you will, of marketing will remain the same. We're very happy with the demand we drive. We carefully track it through web visits, lead generation and all the other type of metrics that are necessary in order to keep both top and mid-funnel our marketing alive and well, and that volume will continue. Any benefit we have will be on efficiency, not on volume.But really, the cost is everywhere. I mean, we talked about fuel, we talked about food waste. But I mean we could go through every line item of the P&L. There is nothing off the table. I mean we've made improvements in air costs. We made improvements in our consumables and maintenance, really across the way in SG&A expenses. So I really want you to think about it as a whole P&L and not that we're going to, in any way, focus on marketing in order to reduce those important demand metrics. And Mark take it away."", 'Mark A. Kempa', ""Conor on leverage. Look, we've said we are very focused on it. And we've said that this will improve significantly over time. We're very excited that we expect our leverage -- current leverage levels at year-end. We expect to at least decrease that by 1.5 turns. And again, that's going to -- that's slowly but surely restoring our balance sheet back to pre-COVID levels. So obviously, that 3% to 4% range is something we're focused on. I would not -- certainly would not expect that to happen in 2024, but we are starting the sequential improvement quarter after quarter. This year, you will see significant improvements in leverage. And we're excited to see that same thing happening over the course of '25 and '26. So we're on the right path."", 'Harry J. Sommer', ""The only thing I'll add to Mark's comment is just a simple math one. If we were at 7.3%, and we plan to reduce it by 1.5%, I think the number would be in the 5-something range, not the 6-something range just to keep that in the back of your mind. That being said, I want to thank everyone for joining us today. We'll be around to answer any questions you may have. We look forward to seeing you all in May. We wish you a great day and all the best."", 'Operator', ""Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

It's such a great time to be in the cruise industry with wonderful new products available across all three of our award-winning brands."", ""The demand for cruise vacations is certainly as robust as we have ever seen it. And the continued innovation on board is leading to outstanding financial performance and exceptional guest satisfaction scores and guest repeat rates. Today, it's my pleasure to discuss some of our key milestones in 2023, our progress on our near-term priorities, recent booking trends, and our outlook for 2024. Later in the call, I'll turn it over to Mark, who will provide more color on our 2023 performance and guidance for 2024."", 'Now, 2023 can best be described as a landmark year for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. We started the year on the heels of the last of the impact from COVID and the last of the cruise ports reopening in the Asia Pacific region throughout Q1. But as you can see on Slide 5, consumer demand was quick to rebound in full, and we were pleased to return to full ships and full year profitability. It is so incredibly rewarding for our staff and crew to be able to operate full ships and deliver vacation experiences of a lifetime to our happy guests.', 'While that in and of itself would have made for a spectacular 2023, we were further going by the introduction of three new world-class ships into our fleet, one for each of our three award-winning brands. This was an unprecedented achievement and a first in the 57-year history of our company. We welcomed Oceania Cruises Vista in May, Norwegian Viva in August, and most recently, the highly anticipated Regent Seven Seas Grandeur in November. The successful launch of three vessels in one year would not have been possible without the hard work and unwavering commitment of crew and team members across the globe.', 'Thanks to their dedication and passion for providing an unmatched guest experience, the reception for these new ships continues to be overwhelmingly positive across the board. This reception, combined with the strong demand environment we continue to experience across all three of our brands, has enabled us to successfully absorb an 18% increase in capacity in 2023 versus 2019 levels at record pricing levels. As a result, we have driven revenue per passenger cruise day up 17%, allowing us to finish the year with year-end advanced ticket sales of $3.2 billion, up an incredible 56% compared to 2019. At the same time, we continue to maximize onboard revenue generation, as shown by growth onboard revenue per passenger cruise day, which is up 27% over 2019.', 'A main driver of this large improvement is through enhanced presold onboard revenue, so our guests come on board with a fresh wallet. But none of this is new news. As we have been and continue to be the industry leader in net yields, we are proud of the work our teams do day in and day out to drive the highest yields in the industry. But today, I also want to emphasize that we are equally passionate about the cost side of the business.', 'Our relentless focus on cost optimization has produced four sequential quarters of year-over-year adjusted new -- of year-over-year adjusted net cruise cost per capacity day reduction with full year 2023 coming in 21% lower than the prior year. We achieved this by focusing our efforts on optimizing spend and investments across all areas of the business, from fuel to food and consumables and marketing. We are committed to continuing to optimize our margins by balancing products, revenue and cost considerations through better leveraging data and analytics to drive decision-making and accountability. The net result of these healthy revenue and cost metrics allowed us to get back to driving results.', 'As we generated $1.9 billion in adjusted EBITDA in 2023, allowing us to generate the adjusted free cash flow to further strengthen our balance sheet with the repayment of nearly $2 billion in debt. On the product front, we are strategically enhancing the guest experience by identifying smart ROI-driven investments and decisions to profitably maximize guest satisfaction. Our recent success has been the rollout of Starlink high-speed Internet. We moved quickly and have been able to roll out this cutting-edge technology across half of our fleet since the spring of 2023 and expect to finish the full fleet by year-end this year.', ""In addition, to significantly elevating the guest experience aboard our ships, we've been focusing on improving the pre-cruise guest experience and better leveraging digital tools across all three of our brands. For example, we've been making improvements to our pre-cruise planning functionality at Norwegian to allow guests to book even more before they leave their homes, and we rolled out a flexible air program at Oceania, sharing an innovation which began at Norwegian earlier in the year. This innovation gives guests the few day window to deviate their air at the beginning and end of their cruise so they can have more time to explore and enjoy destinations before and after they sail with us, while at the same time, allowing us to spread air demand over multiple days and save costs, a true win-win for us and our guests. On the digital side, we recently launched the Regent onboard mobile app on Seven Seas Grandeur, and we continue to see strong adoption of the NCL mobile app, which reached record-high guest usage in January."", 'These improvements are not only resonating with our guests, giving them a better and more frictionless experience before, during, and after their cruise, but are also generating positive returns. Finally, we announced important interim sustainability commitments, announcing our target to reduce greenhouse gas intensity on a capacity day basis by 10% by 2026 and by 25% by 2030 versus 2019 levels. The company is truly firing on all cylinders. These solid operational and financial results have laid the foundation for a strong 2024 and position us to deliver sustained profitable growth in the future and incredible vacation experiences to the millions of guests who sail with us every year.', 'In addition to these priorities, a key cornerstone of our long-term strategy is delivering measured capacity growth and optimizing our fleet to drive strong financial results. Our new build pipeline of five ships, which you can see on Slide 7, represents a capacity growth of 28% from 2023 to 2028 with a 5% CAGR over the period. Historically, capacity growth has led to outsized revenue and EBITDA growth, and we expect this capacity growth to be no different and deliver meaningful top- and bottom-line growth. We believe that these measured capacity additions will enable us to further enhance our long-term profitability and continue to significantly strengthen our balance sheet while providing guests new and innovative experiences.', 'Shifting our discussion to the current booking environment shown on Slide 8. We continue to experience strong and resilient customer demand across all three of our brands. The strong momentum we saw in 2023 has continued into 2024 with an all-time high book position and pricing buoyed by strong wave season demand. This has led to some of the best booking weeks in the company history, which began with successful Black Friday and Cyber Monday promotions.', 'In general, we continue to see healthy demand across all markets, brands, and products. Let me walk you through some recent trends. First, close-in demand for Caribbean sailing is particularly strong, prompting the redeployment of Norwegian Epic and Norwegian Getaway from offering shoulder season full 2024 voyages in the med to offering Caribbean sailings from Port Canaveral and New Orleans, respectively, beginning in October. As a result, our Caribbean capacity for the NCL brand is expected to increase by approximately 300 basis points in 2024 versus the prior year.', ""Our industry's advantage lies in our ability to redeploy our ships and adapt to changes in consumer demand and preferences. These changes demonstrate our team's responsiveness to our guests' preferences. We have also seen demand return for sailings in Hawaii. While only accounting for approximately 4% of capacity in this period, these sailings are performing exceptionally well in 2024."", 'Next, our Norwegian Cruise Line brand continues to see exceptionally strong demand, and our book position and pricing are higher than last year for all four quarters of 2024. Oceania and Regent also continued to see strong demand across all geographies with the exception of redeployed voyages due to cancellations in the Middle East and Red Sea. Turning to the Middle East. Last quarter, we made the pre-emptive decision to cancel all calls to Israel in 2024.', ""And recently, we have announced the rerouting of our cruises sailing through the Red Sea for the rest of the year. As a reminder, just 1% and 4% of our capacity in Q1 and full year '24, respectively, was expected to visit the broader Middle East region. However, the Middle East represents a larger percentage of our capacity for our Oceania and Regent brands making up 12% and 8%, respectively. We now have no calls in the region in 2024, and all replacement cruises have been or are in the process of being put on sale."", 'Overall, we are encouraged by the strength in our book position for 2024, which remains at all-time highs with commensurate higher pricing. As a result, 2024 is shaping up to be a solid year. We expect healthy full-year net yield growth of approximately 5.4% this year on a constant-currency basis, driven primarily by improved occupancy and pricing strength. Onboard revenue continues to be a bright spot with strength seen across the board, an encouraging indicator that our target consumer remains healthy and resilient.', 'We are continuing to see strong demand for pre-cruise purchases which typically results in higher overall spend throughout a guest cruise journey. And while we have talked about our strong cost focus during 2023, we want to emphasize that this was not just a one-year exercise for our team. Rather, it is a cultural shift in the way our entire company looks at cost to ensure that we are operating as efficiently as possible while delivering experiences our guests truly value. This companywide focus should allow us to not only continue to reduce costs but, even more importantly, create operating leverage to enhance profitability, which will be foundational for our long-term success.', 'Our recently established transformation office is allowing us to monitor and track these changes holding each area accountable for their initiatives. We believe this is apparent in our guidance where we expect our core cost to be flat in 2024 versus 2023. In conclusion, our strong top-line growth, combined with our continued focus on cost and margin enhancements, are expected to drive 2024 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS to grow by 18% and 76%, respectively, over last year. We are very excited about the future, and we plan to discuss our multiyear targets with the investment community in mid May.', ""We look forward to meeting with you all then. With that, I'll turn it over to Mark to walk you through our financial results and outlook. Mark?"", 'Mark Kempa -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Thank you, Harry, and good morning, everyone. My commentary today will focus on our fourth-quarter 2023 financial results, 2024 guidance, and our financial position. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary on 2023 and 2024 net per diem, net yield, and adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel per capacity day metrics, are on a constant-currency basis, and comparisons are to the same period in 2019 and 2023, respectively. Let's begin with our fourth-quarter results, which are highlighted on Slide 11."", 'Starting with the top line, results were strong with net per diems increasing approximately 14.5% and net yield increasing approximately 8.6%. As discussed last quarter, several factors contributed to the exceptionally strong growth we saw, including the favorable comp from the rapid exit of Cuba in 2019 as well as a very strong close-in demand for Caribbean sailings. Looking at costs, adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel per capacity day was in line with guidance at $151 in the quarter marking our fourth consecutive quarter of improvement on this important metric. As expected, this included approximately $1 of certain nonrecurring net benefits realized in the quarter.', 'We have made significant progress streamlining our cost base during 2023, demonstrating our focus and commitment to our margin enhancement initiatives, and expect to continue this focus in 2024 and beyond. Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $360 million, in line with guidance, while adjusted EPS was a loss of negative $0.18 slightly below guidance due to a $0.06 impact from FX below the line. Overall, we were very pleased with the results we generated in the fourth quarter and full year. Strong top-line growth, combined with continued progress on reducing costs, enabled us to generate full-year adjusted EBITDA just short of $1.9 billion and adjusted EPS of $0.70.', ""All of which drove strong adjusted free cash flow of $1.1 billion. I am confident that our improved financial performance in 2023 has set the foundation for a solid 2024 and beyond. Moving on to expectations for '24. Our outlook for the first quarter and full year can be found on Slide 12."", 'Starting with the full year, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately $2.2 billion, an 18% improvement versus 2023 with adjusted EBITDA margins expected to improve by almost 250 basis points. Adjusted net income is expected to be approximately $635 million with adjusted EPS expected at approximately $1.23, a 76% increase versus 2023. Before I get into our top-line expectations, there are a couple of important points to keep in mind for your models. First, given our strong expected net income growth for the year, shares related to our exchangeable notes are expected to be dilutive and are included in our share count for 2024.', 'As a reminder, we must settle the exchangeable notes due in 2024 and 2025 in shares while both of our exchangeable notes due 2027 can be settled in cash or shares at our sole election. However, the accounting treatment requires we consider all notes as if they were settled in shares. As a result, we assume our full year 2024 average share count to be approximately 516 million. Secondly, we successfully migrated our tax residency from the U.K.', 'to Bermuda as of December 31st, 2023, and we do not expect recently enacted Bermuda corporate income tax legislation to have a significant impact on our overall tax rate as this was already assumed in our planning. Taking a closer look at the components of the outlook. Occupancy is expected to be approximately 105%. Net yield is expected to increase approximately 5.5% inclusive of the headwinds from the outsized impact of the Middle East and Red Sea on our Oceania and Regent brands, primarily in the second and fourth quarter.', 'For modeling purposes, our year yield growth will be highest in the first quarter as we are lapping lower load factors and a non-optimized itinerary mix in the first quarter of 2023. In addition, we are seeing strong demand for Caribbean sailings in the first quarter of 2024, which represents approximately 58% of our total deployment in the quarter. For the remainder of the year, yield growth is expected to return to more normalized levels despite the pressure from the aforementioned Middle East and Red Sea headwinds. Moving to costs.', 'Adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel per capacity day, is expected to average approximately $159 for the full year. This represents a 3.4% increase versus full year 2023, but -- which includes the incremental impact of more dry-dock days in 2024. Excluding that impact, our core costs are essentially flat on a year-over-year basis. To put this in perspective, this effectively represents approximately $100 million of cost savings given our expected core inflation rate of around 3% for next year.', 'For modeling purposes, keep in mind that 2023 had less dry-docks than normal as we took the opportunity to dry-docks ships while they were out of service. This year, we are returning to a more normalized dry-dock schedule and expect roughly a 175 dry-dock days in the year. This will impact adjusted cruise cost ex-fuel by approximately 325 basis points on a year-over-year basis or approximately $5 on a unit cost basis. This includes both the impact of dry-dock costs and the related reduction of capacity days.', 'Excluding the impact of that, we expect full-year adjusted net cruise cost ex-fuel would be approximately $154 essentially flat on a year-over-year basis. Note that the timing of this impact is expected to be weighted more to the first half of the year, with approximately two-thirds of our dry-dock days occurring in that period. This year we will continue to be relentless in our efforts to enhance margins and reduce costs. We are leaving no stone unturned and are continually identifying opportunities, big and small, across the business.', 'Our transformation office is running full speed ahead in identifying operating inefficiencies and operating -- and opportunities for improvement across all areas of our operating platform in order to enhance the acceleration of our margin recovery and related cash generation. One key focus area for us has been optimizing both our fuel consumption and bunkering strategies. Fuel costs are one of our largest expense line items, and our teams have been hard at work at fostering partnerships with the likes of DNV on decarbonization and long term agreements with industry leader ABB to drive new opportunities to lower our fuel consumption per capacity day. In addition to the consumption side of the equation we have made a big leap in the optimization of our fuel bunkering strategy that allows us to maximize price leverage across the various ports and suppliers we use during a season and, in many cases, even during a single voyage.', 'We believe this will drive double-digit millions in savings in the first year alone. This is just one of the many examples that support our relentless drive to improve our unit costs and leverage our scale, all without impacting the guest experience. I look forward to sharing many more tangible examples at our upcoming investor day in May. The combination of our more efficient cost structure and strong expected top-line growth for the year is expected to drive the expansion of our full-year adjusted EBITDA margins up by approximately 250 basis points.', ""Now, let's take a look at our expectations for the first quarter. As I said earlier, net yield is strong in the first quarter and is expected to increase approximately 15.5%. Adjusted net cruise cost ex-fuel per capacity day is expected to be $165 or approximately 3% versus the same quarter last year. As mentioned, we expect an increase in dry-dock days in the quarter, which will have a $6 or a 350-basis-point impact on adjusted net cruise cost in Q1."", 'Excluding that impact, adjusted net cruise costs would be $159, essentially flat on a year-over-year basis, demonstrating our ability to offset the impact of inflation with our cost savings. As a result, adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter is expected to be approximately $450 million. Adjusted net income is expected to be approximately $50 million. And adjusted EPS is expected to be approximately $0.12.', 'Given the quarter is essentially complete, we do not expect significant outperformance in the top line versus expectations as the vast majority of our inventory is already sold. Any limited upside would result from our onboard revenue generating performance during the month of March. Moving on to our balance sheet and debt maturity profile on Slide 14. In 2023, we generated almost $2 billion of net cash from operating activities, which included $500 million return of cash collateral.', 'And we repaid $1.9 billion of debt, including the full paydown of our $875 million revolving loan facility. Most recently, we successfully negotiated a refinancing of our $650 million backstop commitment from a secured to an unsecured basis. And in connection with this refinancing $250 million 9.75 secured notes due in 2028, our highest interest rate debt, is expected to be repaid. This refinancing, which is expected to close in early March will reduce interest expense, improve leverage while also releasing all of the related collateral, another important step forward in improving our balance sheet.', 'Moving to leverage on Slide 15. The company has a solid track record of delevering the balance sheet. From 2014 to 2019, we successfully delevered by over three turns. We will continue to be opportunistic and look for further ways to strengthen our balance sheet.', ""We are confident we can make meaningful progress on this front going forward. At year-end '23, with reported net leverage of approximately 7.3 times or approximately 6.75 times when excluding the impact of ships delivered in the second half of the year, we continue to expect significant improvement in this metric over time, driven by our organic cash generation and scheduled debt amortization payments. Over the course of 2024, we expect to reduce our reported leverage by almost 1.5 turns with sequential improvements in each quarter. This improvement does not assume any prepayment of debt, apart from the aforementioned takeout of our 250 million notes expected in early March."", ""Going forward, we are refining a multiyear plan to further accelerate the reduction of leverage and derisk our balance sheet in order to drive shareholder value. With that, I'll turn it back to Harry for closing remarks."", 'Harry Sommer -- President and Chief Executive Officer,', 'Well, thank you, Mark. Truly encouraging results. Moving forward, our entire team will be focused on the most important work. First, we will continue to execute on our near-term priorities and capitalize on the strong demand from cruising from our target upscale demographic.', ""Second, we will build upon the progress we've already made with our ongoing margin enhancement efforts with further improvements in costs. And finally, we will continue to improve our balance sheet and reduce leverage over time. In closing, I couldn't be more excited about the year ahead. I am confident that we have the right resources in place to capitalize on the strong demand environment and deliver exceptional vacation experiences for our guests across all three of our brands, execute on our operational and financial goals for 2024, and ultimately, deliver long-term profitable growth and shareholder value."", ""I look forward to share you the results of our strategic assessment of our business and defining our vision for the future of the company, including long-term financial targets at our investor day this coming May. With that, I'm happy to turn it over to the operator for questions."", '', 'Operator', 'Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question is coming from Brandt Montour of Barclays. Please go ahead.', 'Brandt Montour -- Barclays -- Analyst', 'Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my question.', 'Harry Sommer -- President and Chief Executive Officer,', 'Good morning, Brandt.', 'Brandt Montour -- Barclays -- Analyst', ""Good morning. So, looking at your 1Q guidance and the full-year net yield guidance, there obviously is a pretty big decel or sort of a more conservative implied growth in the back -- in the sort of 2Q through 4Q net yield. But it's not out of line with your longer-term algo on that 2Q to 4Q. So, I guess the question is, one, would you be willing to -- Mark or Harry, willing to sort of quantify the disruptions from the Middle East and the repositioning of those ships and sort of give us a sense for what the core business outside of those disruptions, how you see that sort of growing in the back half of the year?"", 'Harry Sommer -- President and Chief Executive Officer,', 'Yes. Thank you, Brandt, again, for that. So, I do think you have the right thought pattern. Q2 to Q4 are in line with our long-term express goals where we look to have low to mid single-digit yield growth, of course, measured capacity growth, strong cost controls, all leading to outsized EBITDA and margin performances, which should allow us to continue to strengthen our balance sheet.', ""I think you are right that the situation in the Red Sea, Suez Canal had some impact on our Oceania, Regent brand, not on NCL. NCL is extraordinarily strong in all four quarters as we see the booking patterns now. But for the Oceania and Regent perspective, since it was 8% and 12% of their respective capacities, we would expect that to have an impact of about one to two points on yield in the back three quarters of the year. What that means, all that's taken into consideration in the guidance we provided."", 'So, we stand by our numbers. And what that means is we should have a modest tailwind in 2025 when those -- when we less those items.', 'Brandt Montour -- Barclays -- Analyst', ""That's super helpful. That's great. And then as a follow-up, taking the Middle East disruption -- direct disruption out of it and just thinking about core Europe sailings, core Norwegian-branded Europe sailings, Americans traveling to Europe, that's an area that people -- that some of us have been a little bit more concerned about. Maybe talk about the evolution of the bookings patterns you're seeing in that specific segment? And should we be taking that into account when we think about the cadence for the 3Q?"", 'Harry Sommer -- President and Chief Executive Officer,', ""We talked last year a little bit about some of the challenges we had coming out of COVID with some of our itineraries that require a slightly longer booking period like Europe. And I think that had impacted some of our results in Q3 or Q4 of last year -- I'm sorry, Q2 or Q3 of last year, my apologies, when we gave the results in our earnings calls. We learned from that, and we've absolutely extended our booking curve for Europe, primarily for Americans going into the 2024 season. So, we're very happy with what we're seeing across all three brands, with the exception of those cruises that had previously been going to Israel and the Middle East on the Oceania, Regent brand."", 'Brandt Montour -- Barclays -- Analyst', 'Great. Thanks, everyone.', 'Harry Sommer -- President and Chief Executive Officer,', 'Thank you, Brandt.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. The next question is coming from Andrew Didora of Bank of America. Please go ahead.', 'Andrew Didora -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""Hey, good morning, everyone. Harry, I guess, just when I think about the visibility into the first half of '24 and maybe for the full year, just curious how kind of your booking curve has changed over the years. And I think Mark spoke about 1Q, obviously, being fully booked here. Kind of where do you stand in terms of 2Q being booked at this point? And how should we think about where you stand for full year '24 based on your budget capacity."", 'Harry Sommer -- President and Chief Executive Officer,', ""Well, thank you, Andrew, for that question. We don't give specific guidance on our book position for each quarter. Yes, Mark did say we are entirely booked for Q1 because we're sitting here on February -- late February, February 27. So, we're not going to get any more meaningful bookings for Q1."", ""But for the other three quarters, we continue to be -- with the exception of those Red Sea and Middle East Cruises, which I referred to before, in record booked positions where we're referring to as all-time high booked positions across the three quarters and especially on the NCL brand."", 'Andrew Didora -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""OK. And, Mark, just on the balance sheet. Obviously, you're addressing the expense of 2028 maturity. I guess, I thought you couldn't prepay debt before all the deferred amortizations, you can also kind of proactively pay down? I know it's not in your assumptions, but just curious if it's possible or is it just too costly to do at this point? Thanks."", 'Mark Kempa -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. Good morning, Andrew. You're right. Technically, we do not have the capability to technically prepay debt until we have all of our deferred amortization cut up."", ""However, with this particular transaction, it is deemed a refinancing, and as such, we do have the ability to take out that portion of the debt. As we look forward over the course of the remainder of the year of '24, we do have some notes that are maturing in December, our 565, 3.625 notes, which are very cost effective, but we will be looking to address those between now and sometime obviously, well before the end of the year. And then outside of that, a little bit too early for us to be thinking about or giving guidance in terms of what we may or may not take out. But I think the point to be made here really is that we are now starting to actively address the balance sheet and address the leverage."", ""And we've always said this will be a little bit of a chip away each year, and we're happy that coming out of the gate for 2024, we've been able to start that. So, we're very excited about that. It's definitely a solid path to -- in our journey."", 'Andrew Didora -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Great. Thanks, Mark.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. The next question is coming from Steve Wieczynski of Stifel. Please go ahead.', 'Steve Wieczynski -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst', ""Yeah, guys. Good morning. So, Harry or Mark, first off, congratulations on the cost improvement. It's been pretty impressive."", ""And as we move through this year and we think about costs then for the out years, I mean, how do you guys think about cost growth or lack of cost growth in those as we move past 2024. I mean, I would assume it's going to be tough to keep cost in that flattish range. So, just maybe some color around your long-term cost outlook moving forward would be helpful. Thanks."", 'Harry Sommer -- President and Chief Executive Officer,', ""So, thank you, Steve, for those the kind words on cost control. It's something that we're extraordinarily proud of, and as Mark mentioned in his prepared comments, represents over $100 million improvement versus core inflation. Listen, I -- we're not here to give specific guidance yet on '25 and '26, so we won't. We'll do that in -- we give our long-term financial metric outlook in our investor day in May."", ""But I will say that this goal of being able to grow cost at less than the rate of inflation is certainly something that we inspire to do on a long-term basis. So, I know that's not exactly what you're looking for but hopefully gives you some indication of our direction."", 'Mark Kempa -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""And, Steve, to just further highlight what Harry is saying is I want to make it very clear. We've been laser-focused on this. We are looking at all different ways how we can improve and more importantly, improve and get more efficient to leverage our scale. We've said time and again, this is not a one-time exercise."", ""This is what we've actually established a transformation office, which I imagine will become something like a continuous improvement office. But things -- we're setting up performance dashboards. I talked about some of our bunkering strategies. There's a lot of ways where we can improve the overall underlying fundamental cost structure, all without impacting the guest experience."", ""I talked about our fuel, I talked about our bunkering strategy, food waste. Food waste is just a big area that, when you start really monitoring the waste side of it, has significant upstream benefits when you think about the waste side of it. So, again, we're focused on this. We got the message."", ""We've been taking this serious. And we believe there's multiyear benefits here, but we look forward to certainly sharing more details around that in our May investor day."", 'Steve Wieczynski -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst', 'OK. Gotcha. And then second question. You mentioned in the release that pricing and bookings are higher for the Norwegian brand for all four quarters of this year.', ""Just wondering if you can give a little bit more color about what you're seeing in terms of what kind of price action you can take for more second half of this year into 2025. And then maybe also a little bit of color around the luxury brands, which obviously are being somewhat impacted by what's going on in the Med, but any color there would be helpful as well. Thanks."", 'Harry Sommer -- President and Chief Executive Officer,', ""Yes. So, listen, on the NCL brand, we have very robust and sophisticated revenue management systems. And when we see demand as it is today, we take price action or promotional action, which is sort of an opaque way to take price action in order to generate the highest yields for the company, and we're doing that. So, nothing has changed in our core philosophy from that perspective."", ""When demand is good, we take advantage of it. And I think it's reflected in our oversized gains for Q1 and our reasonably strong gains for Q2 to Q4, especially on the NCL brand. In Oceania, Regent, I want to be clear. There's something fundamentally wrong with the model at the luxury space."", ""We see demand for luxury being very high. But when you have to take 60 or 70 days out of service on two ships out of a regularly small fleet for two brands, it does have an outsized impact on the ability to grow yield at those two brands. We hope that to be a one-time thing. All the new voyages for Oceania, Regent, with the new deployment already on sale and starting to fill, well albeit because we're filling them closer in it at lower pricing than we normally would have gotten, but it's just limited to those areas."", 'We are very happy with the performance on Oceania and Regent in the other regions of the world.', 'Mark Kempa -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""And, Steve, in terms of the Norwegian brand, not -- apart from our sophisticated revenue management systems, let's not forget our models around onboard revenue. We are in a continuous improvement mode in terms of expanding our presale of onboard revenue and getting more share of the wallet over a longer period of time from the point a customer enters our ecosystem. And we continue to refine that. We continue to look at that."", ""And that plays a key part as we -- going forward as we look at our revenue opportunity. So, that's something we are very, very focused on."", 'Steve Wieczynski -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst', 'OK, great. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. The next question is coming from Dan Politzer of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.', 'Dan Politzer -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', ""Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to dive a little bit deeper, just make sure I'm understanding your comments in terms of how you're thinking about the yield growth for this year. So, the Middle East, it sounds like the impact is largest in the second quarter and the fourth quarter."", 'So, is it fair to assume the third quarter in terms of the yield growth, first quarter, third quarter and then 2Q, 4Q about the same in terms of greatest to least?', 'Harry Sommer -- President and Chief Executive Officer,', ""Yes, Dan. Certainly, when you look at the impact of the Middle East on the O&R brands, it's definitely impacting us more in the second and fourth quarter, as mentioned in our results. So, I think as you look across the three quarters, as we said in our prepared remarks, you're going to see more of a normalized consistent yield growth. There's always some puts and takes within each quarter, but I wouldn't expect any significant lumpiness necessarily, so to speak, across the remaining three quarters."", 'Dan Politzer -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', ""Got it. And then just for my follow-up, this is maybe an add-on to Brandt's question. But as we think about that second quarter to fourth quarter and kind of getting back to a more normal algo, I think, Harry, you mentioned geopolitical was maybe one or two points of a headwind. But I think you've also been pretty adamant that you guys were going to guide a fairly conservative outlook for the year."", ""So, I guess as we think about that, the 2Q through fourth-quarter outlook, like to what degree you're baking in conservatism and any impact from itinerary mix shifts?"", 'Harry Sommer -- President and Chief Executive Officer,', ""I think if we told you what level of conservatism we are baking into our guidance, I wouldn't be giving you new guidance. So, listen, suffice it to say that we are providing the numbers that we're confident in. We have, of course, incredible visibility into future book positions. So, I'm not saying there's no upside there, but I certainly wouldn't expect huge upside to the numbers that we've provided."", ""We're going to manage our business to the best of our abilities, and we're providing you numbers that we are confident that we can hit."", 'Dan Politzer -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', 'Understood. Thank you so much.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. The next question is coming from James Hardiman of Citi. Please go ahead.', 'James Hardiman -- Citi -- Analyst', ""Hey, good morning.

So, I don't want to belabor the point, but just this sort of this dichotomy between"", 'Harry Sommer -- President and Chief Executive Officer,', '[Inaudible]', 'James Hardiman -- Citi -- Analyst', ""I'll do it anyway."", 'Harry Sommer -- President and Chief Executive Officer,', '[Inaudible]', 'James Hardiman -- Citi -- Analyst', ""Sort of this dichotomy between 1Q and the rest of the year on the yield front. Obviously, some of that is just occupancy, right, that catch up. But if I think about, what I get to is being maybe 800 to 900 basis point detail from 1Q to the rest of the year. How much can just be explained by mix, right? I mean, you've got the slide that shows Europe going from 0% to 34% and 51%, while the Caribbean is coming down from 58% to 18%."", ""Obviously, Caribbean pricing is a lot more robust than what we're seeing out of Europe. Is there any way to quantify how much of that decel just stems from that? And I guess is there a way to think about sort of how you're seeing like-for-like pricing in North America and Europe as we get past the first quarter and into the rest of the year?"", 'Harry Sommer -- President and Chief Executive Officer,', ""James, I appreciate the question as always. Listen, I don't think there's really much of a mix issue here from the perspective that our deployment in 2024 is not that much different than our deployment in 2023 with the exception of the couple of big NCL ships that we moved out of Europe a month or two early in early Q4. So, I wouldn't necessarily say to Q4-ish, right? I think there's two primary issues that we've discussed, which I'm happy to articulate. Q1 of '23 was particularly weak, coming out of COVID, there was short booking curves."", ""There were disruptions, especially on the Oceania and Regent brand with our itineraries that visited Asia, Australia. Both those brands have world crews, which was very difficult to sell given the time commitment that gets past to make and the fact that they would have had to make those decisions in early '22 when COVID was still alive and well. So, we're coming off a reasonably weak comp in Q1. That being said, we're still very, very happy that we were able to get Q1 of '24 back to where it is with a 16% growth year over year."", ""So, obviously, there's some spend in Q1. It's not of this year, not just the weakness of last year. I think the other three quarters, the only issue that we're seeing when we look across the brands, across the quarters, across the geographic areas, it's simply this issue with the Red Sea and Suez, which I want to elaborate because I talked to it before. We believe we have the right mix of Caribbean product for our guest set over the summer."", ""We do have ships in the Caribbean. We don't go to a 0% capacity, but we have seen higher returns out of Europe and Alaska and Bermuda than we do out of the Caribbean, which is why we position our ships there. So, it's possible that the growth in the Caribbean could have been more, but the end result would have been less. I repeat what I said in my prepared remarks, we still have the highest net yields within the competitive set."", 'So, maybe we would have grown more on a like-for-like basis, but it would have resulted in a lower overall number if we positioned more of our capacity in the Caribbean.', 'Mark Kempa -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""And, James, just keep in mind, when you think about 2024, Obviously, we're getting the benefit in Q1 versus Q1 of '23, an outsized growth algo, because of the aforementioned factors. But then you roll that forward and you look at Q4 of 2023, where we had roughly 8.5%, 9% yield growth, we're going to be lapping over that in the fourth quarter of this year. So, there is a little bit of lapping issues going on. But I think as Harry said, the underlying strength in pricing in the business is looking good across all sectors and all geopolitical areas -- I'm sorry, all geographical areas, apart from the Middle Sea and the Red Sea area."", 'James Hardiman -- Citi -- Analyst', ""Got it. And maybe just a follow-up there to that geographical point. So, if I just think about 5.5, call it, yield growth for the year, I guess that's probably if we just thought about pricing, right, ex the occupancy piece maybe 4Q, call it. Is there -- ex the Red Sea and the Middle East impact, is there a meaningful difference in terms of how we're thinking -- we should be thinking about pricing growth for Europe versus pricing growth for the Caribbean."", ""I'm assuming yes, but maybe not."", 'Harry Sommer -- President and Chief Executive Officer,', ""I don't think there's any meaningful difference between the markets, James. I think we're -- again, we're seeing strong pricing for all those markets and other markets. So, obviously, you have a total difference in net per diem depending on the area of operation. But in terms of growth, we're not seeing any sort of significant differences between markets."", 'James Hardiman -- Citi -- Analyst', 'Got it. Very helpful. Thanks, guys, and good luck.', 'Mark Kempa -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Thanks, James.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. The next question is coming from Vince Ciepiel of Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.', 'Vince Ciepiel -- Cleveland Research Company -- Analyst', ""Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to dig into the margin a little bit helpful, your color on, I think, close to 2.5 points of improvement. That gets you back to about the mid-20s, but there's still a handful of points behind where you were pre-COVID. And maybe you could help walk through some of those moving pieces."", ""I think selling more air is probably just a headwind as it's more of a pass-through. I think that fuel is probably a point or so of headwind. But just help us kind of understand and bridge the margin differential versus pre-COVID times and get your confidence on a path back to getting close to something near 30% over time?"", 'Mark Kempa -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes. Thanks, Vince. While I don't want to give too many details because I think we're going to give some significant visibility at our May investor day. But look, the bottom line is really that we have to continue to improve on our pricing."", ""That's key number one. But it all comes down to leveraging our cost base and our unit cost and leveraging that scale. We've made significant progress, what I would say, in the last 18 to 20 months when we really first started addressing this back in the second half of 2022. So, we're going to continue to look at that."", ""We have to improve. When you think about overall cost from 2019, when we look at it, I think we were somewhere about a 3% CAGR over 2019 through 2024 guidance. So, we think we can definitely improve on that. Obviously, there is some incremental drag from fuel given new regulations versus '19 and '24 and so on."", ""But we have to do a better job of leveraging our scale. We're doing that. As I've said, we've been able to confidently mitigate over $100 million of expected inflation in 2024. It's no small feat that I want to reiterate, when we look at our cost base, excluding the dry dock and the reduced capacity days, our cost base is flat, expected to be flat for 2024."", ""So, I want to make sure everybody understands that. It doesn't end here. We're looking at everything, and we think there's continuous opportunity there. So, we're going to chip away at that."", ""And I think in a combination between, again, strong top-line growth and moderate cost growth or improvement, we think definitely there's opportunity for significant margin expansion over time."", 'Harry Sommer -- President and Chief Executive Officer,', ""And just to add to that, I know we talk a lot about metrics, NCC excluding fuel, or NCC excluding fuel and dry docks, but I want to emphasize that fuel expense is not something we ignore. Mark talked about it extensively in his prepared remarks. And our goal is to find ways to reduce consumption. Ultimately, obviously, that's great for our sustainability goals, but it's also great for our overall profitability."", ""So, I don't want to -- despite the fact that we don't necessarily report on that metric extensively, I want to assure everyone that is one of the main focuses. I mean, we spend something like $700 million a year on fuel, and Mark talked about the multi, multi, multi-million dollar things that we're going to do to improve fuel from bunkering to better monitoring and things like that. And those numbers are real and, of course, are reflected in our EBITDA numbers."", 'Vince Ciepiel -- Cleveland Research Company -- Analyst', ""Thanks. And then maybe one more for thinking about this kind of more normalized yield growth 2Q through 4Q. Maybe walk us through how you envision onboard versus ticket versus occupancy gains kind of contributing to that growth? And if it's equal, if one is a bigger driver? Any additional color there would be helpful."", 'Mark Kempa -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes. Look, onboard revenue is always a significant generator of our overall revenue profile. When you look at the Quarters 2 through 4, yes, I think we're getting probably, what, about 1.5 points of occupancy benefit in those three quarters, and the rest is really coming on the back of pricing. So, onboard is an important component, it always is, and it always has been."", ""We'll continue to improve on that. Our goal, again, is to get more of that wallet share well prior to the customer over stepping on foot any one of our vessels. And we continue to improve on that. And that -- but I don't think there's going to -- I don't think we're expecting any meaningful outsized growth from that particular revenue stream versus necessarily our core ticket price across the three brands."", 'Harry Sommer -- President and Chief Executive Officer,', 'Donna, I think we have time for one more question, please.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Conor Cunningham of Melius Research. Please go ahead.', 'Conor Cunningham -- Melius Research -- Analyst', 'Hi, everyone. Thank you. Maybe if I could just sneak two in. Just on the cost trajectory in 2024.', ""Trying to understand a little bit more. I understand the dry docks and the inflation, but it's -- what's the offset that's happening there? Is marketing spend kind of trending down? And maybe secondly to stick with Mark on that as well. The comments around the balance sheet improvement, the tone is definitely changing. So, that's positive."", ""Simple maths as you're going to six times leverage. Are we going to get back to this three to four times that you did pre-COVID? Just any thoughts there would be helpful. Thank you."", 'Harry Sommer -- President and Chief Executive Officer,', ""Yes. So, I'll let Mark talk about our balance sheet number because we're very proud of that. And I'll let him finish up the commentary on that. But on the cost side, this isn't specifically related to marketing."", ""We, obviously, will look at improvements in efficiencies and marketing in the same way we look at efficiencies everywhere else. But any improvement we find in marketing will be strictly around efficiency. The volume, if you will, of marketing will remain the same. We're very happy with the demand we drive."", 'We carefully track it through web visits, lead generation, and all the other type of metrics that are necessary in order to keep both top and mid funnel our marketing alive and well, and that volume will continue. Any benefit we have will be on efficiency, not on volume. But really, the cost is everywhere. I mean, we talked about fuel; we talked about food waste.', ""But I mean we could go through every line item of the P&L. There is nothing off the table. I mean, we've made improvements in air costs. We made improvements in our consumables and maintenance, really across the way in SG&A expenses."", ""So, I really want you to think about it as a whole P&L and not that we're going to, in any way, focus on marketing in order to reduce those important demand metrics. And, Mark, take it away."", 'Mark Kempa -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Conor, on leverage, look, we've said we are very focused on it. And we've said that this will improve significantly over time. We're very excited that we expect our leverage -- current leverage levels at year-end. We expect to at least decrease that by 1.5 turns."", ""And again, that's going to -- that's slowly but surely restoring our balance sheet back to pre-COVID levels. So, obviously, that 3% to 4% range is something we're focused on. I would not -- certainly would not expect that to happen in 2024, but we are starting the sequential improvement quarter after quarter. This year, you will see significant improvements in leverage."", ""And we're excited to see that same thing happening over the course of '25 and '26. So, we're on the right path."", 'Harry Sommer -- President and Chief Executive Officer,', ""The only thing I'll add to Mark's comment is just a simple math one. If we were at 7.3%, and we plan to reduce it by 1.5%, I think the number would be in the five-something range, not the six-something range just to keep that in the back of your mind. That being said, I want to thank everyone for joining us today. We'll be around to answer any questions you may have."", 'We look forward to seeing you all in May.

Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement."", ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance.

Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them."", 'In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions.

In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.', ""Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness.

In fact, MetLife research found that a majority (71%) of U.S. employees are concerned about outliving their retirement savings, up from 60% just two years ago. To address these concerns and help retirees enjoy a more confident future, MetLife is working with Fidelity Investments® to offer the MetLife Guaranteed Income Program®, a fixed immediate income annuity, through Fidelity’s new retirement income solution, Guaranteed Income Direct.', 'The passage of the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act in late 2019 removed the fiduciary barriers to offering lifetime income solutions through the workplace. As a result, MetLife research indicates growing interest in these products among plan participants and an increasing number of plan sponsors taking actions to implement them.', 'The availability of MetLife’s guaranteed income offering through Fidelity’s Guaranteed Income Direct solution is designed to help expand access to immediate income annuities by allowing plan sponsors to easily offer retirement income options within their defined contribution (DC) plans. This solution enables participants at all savings levels to purchase an immediate income annuity through an insurer selected by their employer and annuitize any portion of their savings. All funds not used to purchase the annuity remain in the plan.', '""At MetLife, we believe simplicity should be the guiding principle when offering income annuities, and this solution makes it simple for plan sponsors to offer guaranteed income and simple for plan participants to annuitize their savings,"" says Melissa Moore, senior vice president and head of Annuities at MetLife. ""Having a guaranteed stream of income can help retirees budget for their day-to-day expenses and protect against depleting their savings too quickly.""', 'By being able to obtain a guaranteed stream of income through their employer, plan participants can take an important step in creating a financially secure future. In contrast, retirees who choose to receive their savings as a lump sum rather than annuitize can face significant obstacles, including the risk of depleting their money too quickly and needing to fund a portion of their retirement years with no income other than Social Security. Unfortunately, this is a reality for many—a MetLife study found one in three retirees (34%) who took a lump sum from their DC plan, depleted the lump sum in 5 years, on average.', '""MetLife has a long history and deep expertise in offering retirement income solutions. We are committed to ensuring financial security for retirees and are pleased to be working with Fidelity Investments and middleware provider Micruity, who share our dedication to enabling positive retirement outcomes,"" says Moore.

This year, many financial leaders plan to invest in new technology, but a vital factor will be whether employees will want to use it. ', '“It’s better to have less technology with a workforce that accepts it than to have the cutting edge of technology and resistant employees,” Mallory Barg Bulman, senior director, research in the Gartner Finance practice, said in a new report.', 'Take, for instance, accounting. Gartner Inc., a research and consulting firm, found that 18% of accountants make financial errors at least daily, with about a third making at least a few financial errors every week, and 59% making several per month.', ""The findings are based on a recent survey of 497 controllers who oversee a firm's accounting operations. The errors were closely correlated with companies having to operate with smaller staffs as economic and regulatory pressures keep rising. To address staffing deficits, technology like automation is increasingly being implemented, but, according to Gartner, those gains have proved underwhelming."", ""Experts at the firm ran some tests with accounting teams and found that companies where technology is more readily accepted saw a 75% reduction in financial errors, according to the report. So is it fair to blame some firms' mistakes simply on a lack of employee engagement? I reached out to Bulman to find out more."", '“Employee engagement is directly tied to the trust employees have in their manager and work environment,” Bulman told me. She shared “critical steps” for controllers as they automate the work of their teams:', '—Highlight how technological tools will positively affect accountants’ day-to-day work. “Accountants instinctively understand technology’s potential to disrupt their job, and downplaying possible workplace changes will likely build skepticism rather than acceptance,” Bulman said.', '—Ensure that the technology made available “meets a minimum threshold” for acceptance. “New technology must allow accountants to access the data they need and minimize the time they need to switch tools or views to achieve necessary tasks,” she said.', '—Listen to accountants at critical decision points so employees have opportunities to influence decisions. “Controllers often ask for employee feedback too late to meaningfully inform decisions,” Bulman explained. “At the other end of the spectrum, controllers may include too many people involved across too many stages, slowing decision-making and causing opinion overload.”', 'How are you preparing your teams for new technology?

No one can fully predict the likelihood of this happening, and yet for some, it may not be an unlikely development. However, this January, CEOs from major big banks made statements highlighting their hopes for the financial sector in 2024, particularly for big banks, in the event of a Federal Reserve ""pivot"" on their interest rate hikes.', 'On January 20, CNBC\'s ""Power Lunch"" highlighted some statements made by several big bank CEOs on this matter. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\'s (NYSE:GS) CEO, David Solomon, made the following comments:', '""It\'s hard for me to see the market\'s view of seven cuts this year. I do think there\'s a reasonable possibility of some interest rate cuts and some easing. But it\'s really gonna be dependent on what the data says and how the economy transmits through the year.""', ""Morgan Stanley's (NYSE:MS) CEO, Ted Pick, also made a few comments on the subject:"", '""I do think we are probably past peak inflation. What\'s interesting though is that it is not inconceivable that we have to go faster, i.e., 50 basis points, if you sort of price that as 5% or 10%.""', 'Huntington Bancshares CEO, Steve Steinour, joined CNBC\'s ""Power Lunch"" on January 20 to discuss the above as well. On the impact of rate cuts on the financial sector, Steinour made the following comments:', '""If it\'s three or four cuts, it\'s helpful. If it\'s six or seven, that might imply a soft economy and that would not be helpful to us or anyone else. But we model it both ways, and in either direction, we\'ve got a very tight net interest margin - part of that through hedging.""', ""These observations brought Steinour to several conclusions, the most important one being that in the light of a Fed pivot, big banks will gain confidence in loaning to the general public. Generally speaking, Steinour believes that business is good in the banking sector so far this year. He noted that on multiple indicator fronts, including housing prices, things are continuing to look good, the consumer is still seen to be reasonably strong, and businesses are continuing to have a good year. The Federal Reserve's rate pivot in this atmosphere is thus considered to be helpful."", 'Considering these observations, investors in the financial sector can expect financial stocks, including big bank stocks, to have a strong start to the year.

Specifically, we decided to study Salesforce's  ROE in this article."", 'Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested.

Next, when compared to the average industry ROE of 12%, the company's ROE leaves us feeling even less enthusiastic. Therefore, Salesforce's flat earnings over the past five years can possibly be explained by the low ROE amongst other factors."", ""As a next step, we compared Salesforce's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 16% in the same period."", ""Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock.

I'll now turn the call over to Emile and Dustin. Operator, please turn to Slide 3. Emile?"", 'Emile Z. Chammas', ""Thank you, Brian, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and year-end earnings call. Today, Dustin and I will review SEE's financial performance, provide updates on the markets we serve, discuss relevant trends and highlight the significant progress made on the transformational actions discussed on our previous call. Lastly, we will conclude with our 2024 outlook before opening the call for questions. We closed the quarter with sales of $1.4 billion, and delivered $274 million in adjusted EBITDA, in line with our expectations. Our fourth quarter results reflected the continued impact of challenging protein cycles and trade downs in our food business as well as a muted fourth quarter seasonal pickup in our protective segment. For the full year, we finished with $5.5 billion in sales, and $1.1 billion of adjusted EBITDA, slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. Through the laser focused efforts of our global team, excluding payments and deposits related to the resolution of certain prior years tax matters, we delivered $467 million of free cash flow, well above our guided estimate. Dustin will provide a more comprehensive overview of our financial performance shortly. Now let us move on to our 2024 market and business update. While our end markets in 2024 should be better than 2023, we expect that best and out-shaped recovery with no near-term growth catalysts. We are continuing the transformational actions that we detailed during our third quarter call. We will continue to focus on our core business and customers, restore underlying fundamentals and position ourselves for accelerated growth in 2025 and beyond. I will now share some updates across our transformational initiatives. First, as we previously mentioned, we recognized the need to reallocate global resources back into our regions to enhance customer proximity and improve commercial effectiveness. As part of our reorganization efforts, we also determined [that branding] the Protective and Food commercial teams contributed to a loss of customer centricity and reduced commercial rigor. Consequently, we have reorganized our commercial teams by reestablishing food and protective operating units within each region and shifted global resources to our regional teams. This is an initial step in our broader transformation to improve our commercial execution and capture incremental market share as conditions improve. Second, with sustainability as an accelerating megatrend in both Food and Protective, now more than ever, innovation will play a critical role in driving outsized market growth. To maximize our opportunity, we are shifting our innovation focus from the laboratory to the field. What does this mean? We have a strong material science research and development capability, but we need to take the next step forward by better leveraging the voice of the customer to help prioritize and shape our innovation pipeline. Making this shift, combined with our scale, will allow us to outpace our competition, ultimately improving time to market and the commercial success of our new products. Throughout 2024, we will be introducing new recycle-ready products at an accelerating rate, bringing to market full automation solutions within case-ready and expanding applications within our fluids and liquids businesses. Moving to Slide 4. You can see a practical example of where sustainability pressures, driven by new regulations and consumer preferences, are driving unprecedented shifts in the protein trays market. In response, we recently introduced the first bio-based industrially compostable tray for protein packaging. These trays provide comparable performance and stability to traditionally expanded polystyrene trays, allowing us to gain share in an estimated $5 billion tray market while supporting our customer sustainability goals. Next, we have continued our portfolio optimization efforts, investing in core growth products while deprioritizing those that no longer align with our strategic objectives. We have made a lot of progress in redefining the long-term strategy for our portfolio of solutions, in large part getting back to SEE's differentiated material science, automation and service expertise. As our transformation takes hold, end markets recover and financing environment improves, we will be in a much stronger position to take actions to drive further shareholder value. Meanwhile, our primary focus remains on making improvements we can drive regardless of the operating environment. Finally, our cost reduction initiatives within CTO2Grow are progressing as planned. In 2023, we drove actions culminating in an annual run rate savings largely in 2024 of $50 million, up from $40 million at the end of the third quarter. As part of the effort, we have completed three plant closures in 2023, and are in the process of closing four additional sites as part of our footprint rationalization efforts with more sites on the review. In addition, we are rightsizing our Argentina operation given recent regulatory and economic instability. With the actions we have driven so far, we are currently at a total of $65 million in annual run rate savings. Building upon this momentum, we are confident in our ability to achieve $90 million in year-over-year cost savings in 2024. Moving on to updates on our Food and Protective segments. We observed ongoing challenges in the Food segment, where volumes declined year-over-year. However, sequential performance improved in Q4 due to increased holiday demand. The challenges we faced in the fourth quarter stemmed from multiple factors, including the rebuilding of the cattle herd in North America, shifts in the European protein production and consumption and consumer trade down in retail food. The depressed capital cycle, coupled with higher interest rates, negatively impacted our equipment business as customers scaled back their capital expenditures to preserve cash. We expect these trends to continue into 2024. For Protective, 2023 was a turbulent year. Real industrial production contracted year-over-year in most advanced economies. High inflation and the subsequent drag on real income continued to squeeze household spending power and is reducing the demand for consumer goods. Additionally, sustainability and new business models like shipping your own container and buy online, pick up in store continue to reshape e-commerce packaging choices and demand. Pricing pressures have intensified as competitors step up to address weak market demand. On a positive note, the destocking of downstream inventories is largely complete. Different from previously expected, while market indicators are signaling an improving 2024, we have not yet seen this translate into improving demand for our customers' businesses and subsequent restocking or uptick in volumes for our packaging solutions. While we do not see an immediate near-term market catalysts, we are anticipating a gradual recovery in our end markets throughout 2024 with volume lift towards the end of the year and continuing into 2025. As our markets recover, our focus on innovation and sustainability, coupled with our CTO2Grow and strategic commercial initiatives, gives us confidence in SEE's continued recovery. Now I'd like to turn it over to Dustin to review our financial results. Dustin?"", 'Dustin J. Semach', ""Thank you, Emile, and good morning, everyone. Moving to the fourth quarter and full year results. Let's turn to Slide 5. Net sales were $1.4 billion in the quarter, flat on a constant currency basis, and were $5.5 billion for the full year of 2023, down 1% at constant currency. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $274 million, down 8% compared to last year. For the year, adjusted EBITDA was approximately $1.1 billion, down 9%. Volumes have improved sequentially in Q4 as holiday demand drove a low single-digit seasonality pickup. As reported, adjusted earnings per share in the quarter of $0.88 were down 11% compared to a year ago. Our adjusted tax rate was 18% compared to 26.1% in the same period last year, driven by a onetime benefit due to the reversal of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $144.9 million. For the year, adjusted earnings per share of $3.18 was down 22%, primarily driven by lower adjusted EBITDA and higher interest expense, partially offset by lower tax expense. Turning to Slide 6. In Q4, Liquibox contributed 5% to total company sales or approximately $70 million, but was offset by lower pricing in Protective and lower volume in both businesses. The volume declines were driven by continued market pressures in Protective, lower automation sales as well as continued weakness in food retail end markets. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $274 million, which included $50 million contribution from Liquibox, decreased $23 million or approximately 8% compared to last year with margins of 19.9% and down 120 basis points. This performance was mainly driven by lower volumes within both segments, offset by contributions from Liquibox. Moving to Slide 7. In the fourth quarter, Food net sales of $893 million were down 3% on an organic basis, primarily due to the volume declines driven by lower automation sales as customers enforce tighter controls on capital expenditures and by continued weakness in retail demand. Food adjusted EBITDA of $195 million in the fourth quarter was down 3%, with margins at 21.8%, down 130 basis points compared to last year. The decrease in adjusted EBITDA was mainly driven by higher operating costs and lower volumes, partially offset by contributions from Liquibox and favorable net price realization of $10 million. Protective fourth quarter net sales of $485 million were down 10% organically, driven by lower pricing and volume declines in Americas and EMEA from continued market pressures in the industrial fulfillment markets. Protective adjusted EBITDA of approximately $90 million was down 12% in the fourth quarter, with margins at 18.7%, down 50 basis points. The decrease in adjusted EBITDA was driven by unfavorable net price realization and lower volumes, partially offset by favorable productivity benefits. On Slide 8, we review our fourth quarter net sales by segment and by region. In constant dollars, net sales were flat with 5% growth in Food, mainly driven by the Liquibox acquisition, while Protective was down 10% due to weak end market demand. By region, Asia Pac grew 5% organically driven by a strong Australian cattle cycle. Americas was down 6% due to lower automation sales, a weak U.S. cattle cycle and lower pricing in Protective. EMEA declined 11% on challenging market conditions across both segments and continued destocking within Protective. In constant dollars, full year net sales were up 9% in food, while Protective was down 15%. By region, we were up 3% in Asia Pac, offset by declines of 2% in Americas, and 1% in EMEA. Now let's turn to free cash flow and leverage on Slide 9. Through the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of the payments and deposits related to the resolution of certain prior year tax matters, free cash flow was $467 million compared to $376 million in the same period a year ago, representing an increase of 24% year-over-year. The primary driver of this improvement was significant inventory reduction, partially offset by lower earnings and higher interest costs. Since the peak in the second quarter of 2023, we have reduced total debt by approximately $280 million, exiting the year with a net leverage ratio of 3.9x, down from 4.1x in the third quarter. Our total liquidity position was $1.3 billion, including $346 million in cash and the remaining amount in committed and fully undrawn revolver. We will continue to focus on driving net debt to adjusted EBITDA to below 3.5x over the next 2 years. Let's turn to Slide 10 to review our 2024 outlook. We expect [no-shape] recovery through 2024 and into 2025. As a result, we expect net sales to be in the range of $5.2 billion to $5.6 billion, which at the midpoint assumes a 2% decline in organic growth with flat volume growth offset by negative pricing. Portfolio exits represent 0.5% lower volume in both segments. While the global protein end markets continue to be challenged, our food volume is expected to grow approximately 1%, driven by competitive wins in our core businesses, momentum in our fluids and liquids businesses, including Liquibox, and our new product launches, offset by pricing declines of 2%. Our work on integration and operational momentum at Liquibox is taking hold, and we expect the business to continue to improve across 2024, further supported by a positive outlook for the food service end markets. We see a slower market recovery in Protective than previously anticipated with a full year volume decline of approximately 1%. Pricing pressures have increased, further reducing top line by 3% as the competitive landscape has intensified in a lower volume environment. Protective volumes are expected to recover towards the end of 2024 as our new commercial model gains traction and market dynamics improve. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion, which assumes adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 20% at the midpoint. This outlook is lower than our soft guide provided during our Q3 earnings call, mainly driven by lower volume expectations. We anticipate continued softness in the first half of 2024 as volume reaches the trough and gradually improves as the market conditions and seasonality improve in the second half. We remain disciplined to drive the necessary cost actions to offset further volume weakness. The midpoint of our adjusted EBITDA guidance is in line with 2023, with $90 million year-over-year cost savings offsetting flattish overall volumes, negative net price realization and restoring bonus pools. Full year adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.65 to $3.05 per share. The lower 2024 adjusted EPS is largely driven by higher depreciation, interest and tax expense with an assumed tax rate of 26% to 27%. We expect full year 2024 free cash flow in the range of $325 million to $425 million. At the midpoint, our free cash flow conversion as a percent of adjusted net earnings is expected to be 90%. We are assuming approximately $80 million in restructuring charges, and approximately $20 million incremental cash interest payments, offset by favorable working capital of roughly $30 million. Lastly, for the first quarter of 2024, we expect net sales and adjusted EBITDA to be ranged around $1.3 billion and $240 million, respectively, with earnings per share between $0.50 and $0.60. Our ranges and outlook reflect the dynamic environment we continue to operate in. As we gain more visibility throughout the year, we will be able to adjust and update expectations accordingly. Turning to Slide 11. We closed out the year in line with our expectations and remain committed to executing against our caustic up to growth efforts. While our expectation for 2024 has reduced to a weaker and longer recovery period for our end markets, we are encouraged by the feedback from our customers and our distributors that destocking is largely behind us and are more confident in a second half modest recovery in volumes. We are focused on driving a transformation at SEE in 2024, improving commercial execution and restoring business fundamentals. We expect 2025 to be the year we return to a normal growth trajectory and where our cost reduction and operational excellence initiatives will position us well to return to adjusted EBITDA growth in 2025 and beyond. Lastly, I'd like to close by thanking the global SEE team, who are at the center of our transformation for their efforts solving our customers' most critical packaging challenges day in and day out. With that, Emile and I look forward to your questions. Operator, we would like to begin the Q&A session."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question, coming from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies.', 'Philip H. Ng', ""Dustin, if I hear you correctly, you're guiding to $240 million of EBITDA for 1Q. That implies a pretty steep year-over-year decline. So help us kind of think through what's driving, perhaps, a bigger hit to start the year? Certainly, volumes is an element of it. And the shape of the year, do you expect EBITDA to inflect positively by one would be helpful. And any color by segments would be helpful in terms of the shape of the year."", 'Dustin J. Semach', ""Phil, this is Dustin speaking. Again, I appreciate the question on Q1. A couple of comments I want to make. One is, you hit it nail on the head relative to volume, right? So volume in Q1 is going to be down a couple of points, and that negative leverage is impacting the EBITDA for the quarter. That's being partially offset by some of the cost takeout program, but that program is going to ramp across the quarters. That's really what's going to drive the sequential improvement as we go throughout Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 in terms of approving from here. And so then coupled with that, the pricing actions that we talked about in terms of some of the pricing flow through from the prior year coming across 2024 is also going to impact Q1, right? So the expectation from here is that we're going to improve EBITDA sequentially quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter, right coming from the $240 million that we mentioned for Q1. And then we'll -- and then obviously, when we get to roughly Q3 and Q4, going back to the mass recoveries in the second half volumes, we'll see that inflection point begin and it'll point towards EBITDA growth."", 'Operator', 'And our next question coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi from Baird.', 'Matthew T. Krueger', ""This is Matt Krueger sitting in for Ghansham this morning. So I was just hoping that you could provide us with some added detail on how volumes trended throughout the quarter on a monthly basis? And then given that we're essentially finished with the first 2 months of the first quarter here, how has 2024 kicked off for each segment from a monthly volume cadence as well? Any details there would be super helpful."", 'Dustin J. Semach', ""Matt, this is Dustin speaking. I'll kick it off. And again, I appreciate the question. So if you go back to the fourth quarter, and we'll start with Food, as we mentioned, underlying volumes throughout the entire year have been trending slightly kind of low single digits. Q4 was no different, with the exception of our automation sales, which we pointed to during Q3 that we expected that the impact of lower bookings throughout the year due to the capital constraints of our customers really impacted our equipment sales in the fourth quarter. However, we still achieved over $500 million of sales and we are kind of ahead of our own expectations. So when you shift to Protective. Protective ended where we set expectations around mid-single digits, right? That's obviously a big improvement coming off of the prior three quarters that we're in the teens up to almost 20% starting in Q1. So throughout 2023, volumes in that business, I would say, improved sequentially, slightly and wrapped around the prior year. What's important about both businesses that's different in Q4 of '23 versus '22 is that we saw the actual seasonal pickup in volumes, right, in the fourth quarter. And so -- in both businesses, this is Food and Protective. Now, as you move into Q1, right, January is coming in slightly ahead of expectations, and there's a number of different reasons for that, and this is really across both businesses, so both Food and Protective have performed quite well in January. And then in February, it looks to be in line. And this is obviously embedded in the current guide that we have for Q1."", 'Operator', 'Our next question coming from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Securities.', 'Unidentified Analyst', ""This is actually (inaudible) sitting in for George, he's traveling for our conference.So Dustin and Emile, you talked to it a little bit in your prepared remarks, but perhaps can you get a little bit more specific on what commercial and sales tactics you've changed in each segment since taking over? And what the competitive response might have been in each business at this juncture?"", 'Emile Z. Chammas', ""Thank you for the question. This is Emile speaking. So in terms of the commercial transformation that we've undertaken and recently announced, so we recognize that in the old structure that we had, combining both Food and Protective commercial teams really contributed to a loss of customer centricity and reduced our commercial rigor. So to solve this, we've recently announced that we've reorganized our commercial teams within Food and Protective operating units within each region. Now these units are not just sales units, but the units combined with sales, marketing and dedicated support functions, including R&D representation, finance and operation. The other pieces that we talked about in terms of our plans and that we've now implemented is the old structure really have shifted the resources from the regions into the global centers. And really, that put the voice of the customer even further away from the decision-making process. So as part of this reorg that we've announced, we've reallocated those resources from the global teams back to these operating units. So inherently, the new design is better in terms of us being faster in the market, in terms of being closer to the customers. But just as important around that, we're driving the whole culture and the culture of discipline and performance in terms to better execute in the marketplace. And to support that, we've realigned the incentives of everybody to be more localized, closer to the markets as well as in terms of our global goal alignment."", 'Dustin J. Semach', ""And the only two points I'll add on to what Emile said, which was -- is really, if you go back to the why, the why in terms of both Food and Protective is that those end markets and those customers are very different in terms of needs from a packaging solution, service capability, right? So that one is recognizing that those are two very unique segments, end markets, customers, et cetera, is one of the primary kind of motivations in terms of making that overall decision."", 'Operator', 'And our next question coming from the line Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.', 'Jeffrey John Zekauskas', ""Can you talk about how your Industrial Packaging business did in 2023, and how it's beginning the year in 2024? And can you talk about what your expectation for automation volumes are this year? And then lastly, in your compostable products that you feature in your slides, it has 54% biobased content, what's the other 46%?"", 'Dustin J. Semach', ""Okay. So I'm going to start with the overall industrial question, right? So if you think about 2023, and I think one of the comments that Emile -- this is Dustin speaking by the way, one of the comments that Emile made, which is really important, is around the fact that if you really look at [PMI] or you look at PMI equivalent across most of our overall advanced economies, right, what you see is a contraction, right, in industrial activity. And as a result of that, our business is our industrial packaging. Think of this as like Instapak and industrial inflatables and so on and so forth, performed poorly, and you're looking at -- if you look at overall impact for 2023, you're looking at volumes that were down in the low teens, right? And so -- and then it kind of in line with your expectation in terms of double digit for that kind of contraction you would have seen in industrials. On an encouraging sign is kind of coming into 2024 is that it's beginning to point towards growth. It's modest growth in '24 relative to industrial, but it is growth, it is more second half weighted. And we've seen those businesses already begin to perform better. And if you look at even Q4, it's embedded in that number, which is mid-single digit decline in volumes in the fourth quarter. You're seeing it open up well in the first quarter and continuing. So we see it as optimism in terms of showing signs of stabilization. And as we said earlier, there are signals right, relative to signals that are more positive for the year, but they haven't translated yet largely because we think it will take time to work through the system in the first half and then we'll begin to inflect more importantly in the second half."", 'Emile Z. Chammas', 'Let me maybe jump in, Dustin, on some of these other points on the biobased, right?', 'Dustin J. Semach', 'Sure.', 'Emile Z. Chammas', ""So as you mentioned, we've recently introduced the new biobased tray, and really, this is around addressing the market needs that is moving away from expanded polystyrene. And as you mentioned, 54% of the tray is from cellulose renewable sources. And the other portion of the polymers are acetic acid and other processing aids. So really, in terms of the tray, it's not only the sources of it that are renewable, but the fact that this is industrially compostable certified, so it can go into the industrial recycling streams and fully decompose into those natural components. And I just want to add a point on the automation piece in terms of where that's headed. So despite the external uncertainties in terms of our customers being slowed in terms of triggering new CapEx spend based on the inflation -- the interest rate environment as well as muted end markets, we do forecast it to be flat year-on-year. And as part of that, we're also expanding our offerings. So automation is still a critical part of our total solution sales. So we've signed recently some partnership agreements in the protective space to complement our box rightsizing capability, and we are actually going commercial, and we have orders of those based on that new partnership in the Asia Pacific region. And we just recently signed the IPPE show, a new partnership in terms of expanding our automation capabilities in our consumer-ready space. So we'll be announcing that publicly soon. And again, automation continues to be a big part of our capabilities. We're all about total solutions, materials, equipment as well as service, and we're expanding and filling the portfolio gaps that we have with those external partnerships."", 'Dustin J. Semach', ""And then one other final point on that question. I'll just say that as a reminder, we kind of closed the year at around $500 million, $0.5 billion in automation sales in 2023, which is a peak for us. And to Emile's point, we expect it to be flat next year despite the challenges."", 'Operator', 'And our next question coming from the line Anthony Pettinari from Citi.', 'Anthony James Pettinari', ""Looking at the '24 guidance, can you just help us quantify the impact to EBITDA from lower net pricing for the year? I think you talked about that on the bridge, but I just want to make sure I got that right. And then when you think about pricing, potentially stabilizing maybe in the back half of the year, I mean, is that just a function of volume recovery, volume stabilization? Or is there sort of anything else going on in the market or what you're doing internally that you would expect to help out?"", 'Dustin J. Semach', ""Yes, absolutely. So great question. This is Dustin speaking. So a couple of comments I would make. If you think about net price realization for fiscal year 2024, we're expecting it in the neighborhood of about down $60 million. So if you put that in the context of a flat EBITDA guide year-over-year, really this $90 million or so of cost takeout benefits that we're driving, offset by a negative net price realization of $60 million, and an additional -- and then this restoration of our overall bonus pools. And so that kind of gives what net-net gets you back to a flat guide.And so -- and the only other piece, in just terms of the price component, if you break down that price realization, just to give you some of the specifics, it's really a net negative of about $120 million being offset by an equivalent of benefits in direct materials. And then if you think about a net down on kind of labor inflation, on labor and nonlabor, which you will notice is more muted in the past, which we do see continuing to normalize kind of at a post-COVID, because it was at a historic high in 2024, or excuse me, 2023. Then if you think about the pricing environment in general, if you think about last year, there's really three components in our pricing that are affecting us. One is concessions that were given last year as part of contract renewals, et cetera, that we talked about in terms of putting a big piece of our business underneath that we renewed. The other piece was formula pricing. As if you think about in the second half of '23, a lot of resin costs came down. So formula pricing, as a reminder that tracks with indices began to kind of come into effect at the beginning of really of 2024. And then the third piece is obviously is just the pricing environment. That's why you decompose that $120 million. And if you think about the second half, that's where we -- there may be an area of opportunity because right now, if you look at it, our resin prices have kind of stabilized and we see them maybe slightly inflationary in the second half. And this is -- when I say inflationary, I mean, sequentially as you move throughout the year, still obviously net down from 2023."", 'Operator', 'And our next question coming from the line of Matt Roberts with Raymond James.', 'Matthew Burke Roberts', 'Discuss the new product focus. So could you maybe quantify a little bit, what type of addressable market do you think these new products represent? And which segments are they prioritized? And in that regard, how much of this is a new opportunity versus substitution of some of your existing sales?', 'Dustin J. Semach', ""All right, Matt. Yes, great question, and I appreciate you raising it. So I'll go ahead and start and then Emile will follow on. If you go back to kind of the prepared remarks, we talked about -- in the prior questions, what we talked about, the compostable tray. And that for us is, if you go back a number of years, we used to actually produce trays, and over the past couple of years, we haven't. And we sell them as part of a package solution when we think about something of our overwrap film, the tray as well as the equipment, I think about those three pieces of the solution, I think of it is as a poultry application. And so we're actually -- for us to go back into the tray business, which is really what this is in terms of compostable trays, our step back into manufacturing it, that overall addressable market is about $5 million. And what's really exciting about it is it's not just that we're entering a market because if you think about that market overall, it's a relatively low growth end market, but it's going through an unprecedented shift, right, where you're seeing whether it's consumer preference, very similar to fiber and protective, it's that same shift in the protein tray market, where consumers prefer to move out of expanded polystyrene and as well as the market in terms of regulations are coming to effect, which you've already seen in a number of states in the United States as well, across Europe, et cetera, which is presenting this opportunity where you need to have a new alternative, right, relative to that. And so this is a great opportunity there to take a big share in that market, and we're heavily invested in it. And then I'll let Emile kind of jump on to some of the other areas that we're focused on."", 'Emile Z. Chammas', ""Yes. Thank you for the question. And again, it gives us a chance to talk about some of these growth areas across multiple segments. So let me hit kind of through some of the key areas. So on Protective, a couple of areas, I did mention that new partnership in terms of expanding our capabilities and portfolio gaps around 3D box rightsizing. So again, that is commercial. We have our first orders and we have a pipeline. Two is, it will be a small impact this year, but we did mention in our past call that we were slow in terms of the shift of the market in Protective to fiber. We are introducing -- again, it will be a small impact this year, but on the AUTOBAG -- in our AUTOBAG segment, we are introducing a paper AUTOBAG solution as well as driving some more sustainability pieces around high recycled content in our protective businesses. Let me talk about fluids because I didn't come up so far. So fluid is actually a key part of our growth this year, both in our CRYOVAC fluids business as well as on Liquibox. So again, on our traditional CRYOVAC liquids, we continue to drive penetration around our FlexPrep solution. And beyond that, we are introducing later this year a further expansion of that capability, attacking the rigid squeeze bottle market, and we'll be bringing that to an initial customer later on this year. On the protein side, Dustin and I mentioned the compostable tray. We have launched based on customer, voice of the customer new capabilities around our chill tunnels, which are in market right now. And there also, we are introducing a whole host of second-generation recycle-ready flexible materials across the markets where our customers demand them. And then finally, maybe just the other piece tagging in on the innovation question and back into the tray. If you think about our tray launch, beyond that, it's a great product responding to the market. In terms of how we did it, we did it in a record time. It was really in terms of how we partnered strongly on that innovation together with our critical partners, both on the supply side and the customer side. And this is when we talk about our commercial transformation and how do we drive that capability to accelerate our innovations. This is really the model we're trying to reapply. It's not doing innovations internally and then going out there, trying to sell them. It's really bringing those customers in, those early adopters, and partner with them and our supply base to get to the market faster with more relevant innovations that will drive commercial success."", 'Operator', 'And our next question coming from the line of (inaudible) from Mizuho Group.', 'Unidentified Analyst', ""So as you look past 2024 and into '25, like how do you see the volume power of the portfolio? If you no longer have destocking going on and demand is gradually picking up, like what does volume look like on a normalized basis in 2025, 2026?"", 'Dustin J. Semach', ""So it's a great question, and I'll make a couple of comments, right. Going back to the prepared remarks. This is Dustin speaking, by the way. So one is, look, we still continue to operate in a very limited visibility environment, right? Our guidance reflects that and some of the progression of the next two -- kind of two halves reflect that. So the reason I say that is just take that into account because one of the expectations, too, once we get to a place where demand comes -- picks back up, there is an opportunity, potentially, for some restocking, right, which will also create an outside, at least, even if it's transitory uptick in overall volumes. So if you think about a normalized basis, and you think about the end markets we serve, and I'll break it down into three categories when I give this perspective. One is in our Food markets, on a normalized basis, i.e., you're not winning more business than you're losing. I think of it as a net churn perspective. You're looking at low single-digit volume growth, right? And so your opportunity set in that, if you're performing well commercially is GDP plus, right? Very similar if you look at Protective, I put it in that same kind of category, slightly ahead of Food, but again, low single-digit volume growth. Now in our fluids and liquids business, it's different in the sense, very similar to the comments we made about trays, where you have an opportunity for mid-single-digit, high single-digit growth because you are shifting other applications into that particular space. It's not just underlying demand because those markets are also very similar in terms of the end markets. And the worse, food service would be in low single-digit growth, but because you're disintermediating rigids and converting them into flexibles, you can see an uptick that will be there for quite some time as that market continues to shift into the fluids and liquids space."", 'Operator', 'And our next question coming from the line of (inaudible) with UBS.', 'Unidentified Analyst', ""Yes. I was hoping you could unpack a little bit more of, I guess, some of the structural dynamics at play in fulfillment. You talked about fiber taking share as well as companies seeking more optimization of pack type or changing the way they're kind of going to market. Is that -- how structural do you view some of those trends? And then what's your opportunity to maybe pivot more into fiber-based solutions?"", 'Dustin J. Semach', ""So I'll start with some of the market trends, then I'll have Emile kind of jump on to some of the other -- the fiber-based pieces from a portfolio perspective.So if you start with the trend, there's really -- there's an obvious -- and when I speak about this, I'm speaking really, which is a portion of the Protective overall, which really serves that fulfillment, kind of e-commerce end markets, right? Because industrials behave very differently. It's actually quite unique in 2023 that they both behave very similarly. So when you think about kind of fulfillment e-commerce, it's really a very huge positive up and then a net down, right? And the net down is the items we mentioned, which is if you think about overall e-commerce, it continues to -- it's kind of back on its normalized growth trajectory, right? So it went through a transitory phase during COVID, where it picked up dramatically, fell back in line with historic growth rates, but it's still continuing to grow in this kind of mid-single digit, high single-digit kind of structural growth rate that continues to move, right, which obviously drives more consumption around our packaging solutions, right? If you think about void fill, right, the [air pillars] that go into the box, if you think about whether it's flexibles and/or fiber-based solutions, if you think about mailers and so on and so forth. Now, what comes off that growth rate, right, is the shift to fiber, which we had not done a great job of capturing in the past, that we're looking to accelerate and make sure that we participate in the marketplace going forward. And the second piece, which is shipping on container and kind of buy now and then pick up at the store. And so both those pieces netted down, but we still see it as a low single-digit growth once you net that down, right? And so that's the opportunity set in it, within it, with the exception of the moves that we need to make in the fiber place to make sure we participate. Go ahead, Emile."", 'Emile Z. Chammas', ""Yes. And I'll just add a couple of pieces to that. So obviously, fiber is one piece of it, right? And we are -- we were late to the game, but we are introducing there, both in terms of the mailer, with our paper bubble mailer, on our AUTOBAG platform, which is a great platform because not only does it addresses the shipping needs, but also the automation benefits. And there, we're just coming out with our first generation of paper AUTOBAG. But also in terms of addressing the sustainability trends, we are launching our high recycled content for void fill as well as for cushioning solutions. And we have in our -- but these are early in our R&D pipeline, in terms of new paper forming capabilities that we are trying to develop.On the automation side, so that's why I mentioned our partnership there around the box rightsizing. So today, we have a 2D box rightsizing capability in our B plus platform, and we signed there a partnership to expand that capability to bring in the 3D rightsizing piece. So again, depending on the customer and the markets, there are different needs there, and we are actively working to address them either through recycled content, recyclability as well as further accelerating our capabilities in fiber and automation."", 'Operator', 'Our next question coming from the line of Michael Roxland with Truist Securities.', 'Michael Andrew Roxland', ""Congrats on a nice finish to the year. My question is just -- can you talk about the competitive advantage you have in protein? And while your peers may not be able to compete as effectively as you can, is it due to equipment? Is it due to service? Is it only in roll stock where there's less differentiation? Or are there other places -- other parts of the business, too, where you have more effectiveness in terms of the competitive effect that is relative to your peers?"", 'Dustin J. Semach', ""Mike, this is Dustin speaking. I'm going to start off, and then I'll give Emile an opportunity to jump in. But first, thank you for the comment on finishing the year. Jumping into your question, the heart of it, which is what is our competitive differentiation within the protein space. You actually nailed 2 legs of the stool already, right? So if you think about those 3 legs, it really is -- it starts with differentiation and materials, right? So we do -- we still believe we're best-in-class relative to competition in terms of our differentiated material science and there are -- our ability to produce those films that help increase the shelf stability of the proteins that they're packaged in. The second piece, which you mentioned, raised the automation capability, right? And then the third is service. And it's really those three aspects, they are best-in-class, each on their own, but when they come together, they really truly create that differentiated solution set that really puts a competitive moat around that particular business. Now, when I say that business, I'm really specifically talking about in a lot of ways, fresh red meat. If you think about other applications, whether it's poultry and so on and so forth, and think about it as going back to roll stock, whether it's film, overwrap film or if you think about different roll stock applications, we are working to continue to build those 3 legs of the stool. What Emile alluded to in our prior conversation, which is we're working to build that complete solution set. And one of the differentiated approaches that we're taking, alluded to it with the partnerships and even in protective in the 3D box rightsizing as well as you think about the solutions and roll stock is that in the past, we haven't had that full solution where, as an example, when you did a sale, an equipment manufacturer may be coming in and bringing the thermoformer or whatever type of roll stock type equipment, and then we're bringing in the materials and someone's (inaudible) particularly bringing service. We are now building those partnerships, which is great because it's an asset-light approach from a capital allocation perspective to build those solutions and going to market with those 3 legs of the stool in other areas. So we're replicating the strength of what we already have in our (inaudible) back business and other areas of the portfolio."", 'Emile Z. Chammas', ""Yes. And you started very well, Dustin. Just complementing to that. So again, on the roll stock side, we were playing in the -- we call it, consumer ready space, in a niche area in terms of those very high value added, and we were only selling the materials science piece. So again, there, in terms of going after that market, which is a much larger market than today we play in is about bringing more materials innovation. Again, the compostable tray is one example. So two is those equipment partnerships so that we can leverage the equipment, but also our services in there. And then thirdly, a piece we haven't talked about because again, it will not have much impact yet in 2024, is the work we're doing on the digital printing side for consumer ready. We are still ahead of the game in terms of what the capability is in the market in terms of introducing high-speed, economical digital printing capability to the consumer ready market, but that's going to be more of a end of '24 or '25 impact."", 'Operator', 'Our next question coming from the line of Lawrence De Maria from William Blair.', 'Lawrence Tighe De Maria', ""I know you discussed some of these things, but I just wanted to just dial down, on where are we really with on the e-commerce side on paper mailers and the ability to drive some more specifically with the e-commerce? And secondly, there's a lot of pressure with Amazon and Walmart to reduce void fill. I know you have some automation there. Is there any traction with that automation? Or is that more later '24, '25? Can you just talk about some of the commercial opportunities in those specific lines?"", 'Dustin J. Semach', ""Larry, this is Dustin speaking. So a couple of things. We discussed last year, in 2023, that we began to really step into -- you kind of bring in paper mailers to market, right? And one of the things that -- if you think about 2023 is in a lot of ways, there's introduction of some of our fiber solutions. And if you think about '24, it's about scaling, right? And what I mean by that is that even if you say, hey, I have paper mailers, it's not just -- it's the combination of the equipment, the combination in terms of how many different sizes, how well you could print on it. And so those aspects of it, we're beginning to bring up in a more scaled up way in 2024. However, it's still a small part of our overall portfolio, right? So having a meaningful impact to the business is really, if you think about it in '25 and '26 relative to be able to do that. Now on the flip side, as Emile related to the partnership in 3D box rightsizing, some of the automation opportunities, we see those as opportunities, whether it's big boxes, like you talked about Walmart. We are seeing traction in that space. It's still performing quite well. The backlog in that business is still strong relative to where we're at in terms of equipment that we deliver. So it's a bright spot in the automation portfolio that customers are still buying, I would say, despite some of the capital constraints. Part of it is the cost of solution, where some of our solutions that are -- obviously, that capital constraint goes up as you tend to buy higher pieces of equipment. And so that's going to give you some of the detail there."", 'Operator', 'Our next question coming from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.', 'Adam Samuelson', ""So I guess my question, I think, Dustin, in your prepared remarks, you alluded to about 50 basis points of lower volumes in each segment related to product exits. I was just hoping for a little bit more context on that. And I guess, specifically in Protective, where you're seeing some different substrate chips that are moving. You've been maybe a little slower to adapt to. And you're also seeing more pricing pressure in pockets of that portfolio, kind of as we sit here today, I know the company has been taking a closer look at this. What -- how would you size, kind of the Protective portfolio, and the proportion of the business that you really think has seen more commoditization over the last couple of years, and maybe has more diminished growth prospects than it would have 5 years ago or pre-COVID?"", 'Dustin J. Semach', ""It's a great question. If you go back to just the first part of the question, that piece didn't come through clearly."", 'Adam Samuelson', 'Sure. Just any color on the product line exits that you think -- you talked about 50 basis points in each segment, impacting volumes. Any clarity on that, what are you actually moving out of?', 'Dustin J. Semach', ""Yes, absolutely. So a lot of this -- I'm really glad you raised that question because a lot of it relates to things that we've already announced, right? So we talked about the exit of our [chemo-thermal] temperature assurance business in 2023, right? Just as a reminder, those are those refrigerated kind of panels that would be used to keep refrigeration around things like COVID vaccines. That business performed very well during COVID, and then trailed off post-COVID, and so we exited that business. So it's having a follow-on impact from a volume perspective because a lot of these businesses exited towards the end of 2020 [for your candidly], even in the beginning. So that's the first one in Protective that's by far having the biggest impact. The second piece in Protective is there's some other reductions that we have, smaller pieces that were trending relative to our [IFS], is our fabrication business that we have, a little piece of this in the EMEA region right now that we're turning back on, it's not a whole scale in terms of different areas, but very regionally specific and where some of the solutions we've seen -- what we see to be a permanent drop-off in demand. Then if you shift to our overall Food business, the first piece is it takes back to the plant-based roll stock that we talked about exiting during Q3. And that business really is beginning to, at this point in time, really. So once we announce it, you begin the ramp down, that ramp down is really concluding now at the beginning of -- kind of right now around January, February, and you're seeing now the impact full year to Food volumes as a result of that. And the only other piece that we really discussed today for the first time is our overall Argentinian business today. And thinking about it, you're looking at, it's kind of low -- kind of low double digits relative to revenue impact there, relative to specific pieces related to business that we're importing into Argentina that due to some of the FX issues as well as economic instability, it doesn't make sense at this point in time to continue to pursue that business, the (inaudible) going forward. And that primarily impacts Food. And then going back to your point about Protective in terms of commoditization. If you think about it, we've talked consistently around this 30% to 40% of the overall portfolio. Where you are seeing pricing pressure is what we call our utility business, and if you think about lightweight foam, if you think about bubble wrap, so on and so forth, that's where you're seeing the most pricing pressure, right? And then going back to your question about substrate transfer, it really goes back to some of the prior questions that we had. And where you're seeing it most predominantly is and void fill, right? So you think of it as the air (inaudible) continuing to shift into paper, which is also being disintermediated by shipping in own container, right? So the removal of all secondary packaging and shipping in just primary packaging, right? And then the second is even when you don't have a box that's an overwrap, that secondary packaging becomes a mailer and there's a big shift, obviously, from flexibles or hybrids into pure fiber-based mailers, right? And those are the two areas that we're -- we have paper systems today that compete directly as an example with Ranpak. And on the void fill side, and then on the paper, other side, as we talked about earlier, really, we have products in market but it's about scale, right, in terms of how broad that offering set is and how many different businesses you can actually work with and that our solutions can actually fit within those business models. And again, 2024, 2023 is a year of introductions, and '24 is a year of scaling in those particular areas."", 'Operator', 'And our next question coming from the line of Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets.', 'Arun Shankar Viswanathan', ""Congrats on finishing the '23 year. So yes, just following up on that last point, I guess, I can appreciate that you are pursuing the fiber-based solutions and the composable tray now. We did see a little bit of a reduction on the automation side. So I guess, another way to think about the volume growth opportunity is exiting these businesses that continue to be a drag. If you look over the last couple of years, you've had kind of minus 20% volumes when you stack the last couple of years in Protective. So with these product exits, would you say that you've somehow or at least addressed maybe the larger pieces of those volume drags? Or is there more to do there? And is there any timeline on maybe exiting some of those lingering negative headwinds?"", 'Dustin J. Semach', ""I appreciate the question and recognize the point that you're making in terms of multi-stacking Protective and seeing it net down. We fully recognize where the business is at, but I'll reiterate one point, which is that kind of coming -- a lot of that obviously declined, it really has happened over the past. Think of it as 18 months in terms of where you've seen a hard step down in that whole portfolio holistically. And part of what we're seeing today, if you look at Q4, it's a positive sign, right? You've seen those volumes of wrapping beginning stabilizing, you're down mid-single digits. And so a lot of what we're doing across this year is -- we mentioned, kind of if you go back to Emile's remarks, is that we've kind of recognized these areas of portfolio that we do longer term that we say don't necessarily fit with strategically. Do we have pieces today still within that portfolio? Absolutely, right? But right now, it's not the time to take action on those businesses. So what we're focused on, because there's a couple of things that we got this year that will become more clear. One is, we feel like we're hitting a trough. We're coming out of the cycle. We have a better understanding how those business is going to perform longer term, right? And then as Emile mentioned in the comments, right, the financing markets improves, outlook improves holistically, and then we'll better understand these fundamentals in this business as time goes on, and we'll continue to reevaluate that. But with that said, right now, the price of -- if you take that and put it to the side, our primary focus going back to the main part of the content today was around really what we're doing to transform that business because there's another element of if we are more commercially effective, what does that do from a performance standpoint. And so there's a lot of focus and energy going into that right now in terms of our overall transformation."", 'Operator', 'And our next question, coming from the line of Gabe Hajde from Wells Fargo.', 'Gabrial Shane Hajde', ""I'll try to be brief here. The protective L-shape recovery, and maybe a little bit worse than what you were expecting, can you kind of bifurcate for us between market-related and competitive landscape? I know it's sort of tough. And then, I guess, key learnings that you've had thus far in evaluating? You alluded to it here in the last question. But just reviewing some parts of the portfolio and strategic optionality there. It sounds like the timeline may be pushed out a little bit, but still a lot of work being done. I just want to make sure we're clear there. And then reinstituting the incentive compensation, I think it's $30 million that you talked about, is it more pronounced in any specific quarter? Just curious if that's depressing Q1 at all relative to the rest of the year?"", 'Dustin J. Semach', ""Gabe, I just missed the first part of that question. If you don't mind, if you can come back to the first part?"", 'Gabrial Shane Hajde', ""You talked about an L-shaped recovery in Protective. And I'm just curious if you can ascribe more of that weakness to market conditions or giving more (inaudible) competitive landscape more recently?"", 'Dustin J. Semach', ""Yes. No, understood. And great question. What I would tell you is, kind of was going into the -- so I'll go back to the positive note, right? Q4 came into that mid-single-digit range relative to volume. But again, when we talked about it, we're optimistic that we have even a stronger seasonality in terms of a quarter, which is really a good indication of how you're going to come out the year. So from our perspective, it doesn't seem from a competitive dynamics in the sense of customers you're able to win in the marketplace, churn that you're having in the business. We see that, obviously, if you go back to the past 2 years, there was a step up, but you've seen that normalize out, kind of even across 2023. So if you look at the business in Protective, it somewhat sequentially trended along in 2023 and was wrapping around and showing obviously very negative comps, going back with Q1 being down almost 20% and then kind of mid-teens for Q2 and Q3 now mid-single digits. So holistically, we feel very good about kind of coming out the gate, right, relative to -- in terms of our overall profit. But if Q4 was stronger, it would have pointed towards a much stronger kind of full year guide. And that's really where -- and then candidly, we're also just being cautious because we're operating in a limited visibility environment. So that's point number one. Going to your question around -- the next point around the overall executive, kind of our bonus pools and the restoration of those bonus pools. Obviously, we had a very challenging year in 2023. As you can imagine, our incentive compensation came down as a result of that. Now, as you think about this year and executing against our plan, in terms of where that pronouncement is, it's more of an impact to the overall second half than in terms of first half, right? In the sense that if you look at 2023, the second half benefited more from that reduction in compensation pools. Because as you went through '23, as we all know, our guidance came down our internal -- we missed our internal plan, and that was more pronounced in the second half than it was in the first half, right? So you have a bigger hill to climb as you go throughout this year. And then on your last point around in terms of portfolio optimization, there's nothing really further additive to say than, yes, to your point, there's still a lot of work going on, but really, now it's not the right time. And so what do you do? We don't want that to necessarily be a distraction relative to -- so that work is progressing, but we're really focused on, again, going back to that commercial transformation, restoring underlying fundamentals right, and improving underlying business performance."", 'Emile Z. Chammas', ""Okay. And with that, we're on top of the hour, and I would like to thank everyone for their time today. We are excited about the opportunities ahead for SEE, and we look forward to updating you on the progress of our transformation when we speak together in May.

To skip our detailed analysis of the financial sector, you can go directly to see 5 Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.', 'The financial sector went through a good amount of volatility last year, and many are now beginning to wonder whether the volatility will continue in 2024. No one can fully predict the likelihood of this happening, and yet for some, it may not be an unlikely development. However, this January, CEOs from major big banks made statements highlighting their hopes for the financial sector in 2024, particularly for big banks, in the event of a Federal Reserve ""pivot"" on their interest rate hikes.', 'On January 20, CNBC\'s ""Power Lunch"" highlighted some statements made by several big bank CEOs on this matter. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\'s (NYSE:GS) CEO, David Solomon, made the following comments:', '""It\'s hard for me to see the market\'s view of seven cuts this year. I do think there\'s a reasonable possibility of some interest rate cuts and some easing. But it\'s really gonna be dependent on what the data says and how the economy transmits through the year.""', ""Morgan Stanley's (NYSE:MS) CEO, Ted Pick, also made a few comments on the subject:"", '""I do think we are probably past peak inflation. What\'s interesting though is that it is not inconceivable that we have to go faster, i.e., 50 basis points, if you sort of price that as 5% or 10%.""', 'Huntington Bancshares CEO, Steve Steinour, joined CNBC\'s ""Power Lunch"" on January 20 to discuss the above as well. On the impact of rate cuts on the financial sector, Steinour made the following comments:', '""If it\'s three or four cuts, it\'s helpful. If it\'s six or seven, that might imply a soft economy and that would not be helpful to us or anyone else. But we model it both ways, and in either direction, we\'ve got a very tight net interest margin - part of that through hedging.""', ""These observations brought Steinour to several conclusions, the most important one being that in the light of a Fed pivot, big banks will gain confidence in loaning to the general public. Generally speaking, Steinour believes that business is good in the banking sector so far this year. He noted that on multiple indicator fronts, including housing prices, things are continuing to look good, the consumer is still seen to be reasonably strong, and businesses are continuing to have a good year. The Federal Reserve's rate pivot in this atmosphere is thus considered to be helpful."", 'Considering these observations, investors in the financial sector can expect financial stocks, including big bank stocks, to have a strong start to the year. As such, we have compiled a list of some of the best financial stocks to buy now.

We believe the company’s closed-loop network, brand equity and scale represent durable competitive advantages. Unlike most card issuers that process credit card transactions over third-party networks, American Express processes transactions over its own network. This allows American Express to earn greater economics than peers on each card transaction. The company retains part of this advantage in the form of higher profitability and reinvests the rest in enhanced customer rewards and service. Over time, these investments have helped American Express build its brand and attract more lucrative, high-spending card customers.

While a recent uptick in new construction has the potential to alleviate the historically low level of homes for sale on the market today, it\'s going to take some time to close the gap,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist at Realtor.com®. ""That said, the elevated level of both single- and multi-family construction coming to market this year is likely to put downward pressure on rent prices in many markets, welcome news for renters. It also means that the higher than usual share of new homes for sale is likely to continue, giving home shoppers willing to consider new homes more options.""', 'Household formation outpaces single-family home construction, despite uptick In 2023, an additional 1.7 million households formed, resulting in a total of 17.2 million new households between 2012 and 2023. Homebuilders started construction on 947,200 single-family homes and 472,700 multi-family homes in 2023, bringing the 2012 to 2023 overall housing starts total to 14.7 million homes, roughly 10 million of which were single-family. The gap between single-family housing starts and household formations grew from 6.5 million at the end of 2022 to 7.2 million at the end of 2023 as household formations remained steady and single-family home construction waned. Though the gap widened, it was the third smallest single-year gap between households and housing starts since 2016.', 'As household formations outpaced housing starts in 2023, the overall gap between household formations and total housing starts, including single- and multi-family homes, widened from 2.3 million housing units between 2012 and 2022 to 2.5 million units at the end of 2023.', 'Affordable new for-sale inventory starts to recover, sunbelt metros grow faster In 2022, just 38% of new homes were sold for less than $400,000, however, in 2023, this share increased to 43%, indicating a shift toward more affordability in the new construction space. Many builders offered price cuts and other incentives in 2023 to prompt home sales and also focused on smaller units, which likely led to this progress in affordability.', 'At the metro-level, some areas have seen outsized household growth relative to permitting activity. Looking at just the gap between single-family permits and household formations reveals that permitting activity has lagged household growth in 73 of the top 100 metros in the U.S. The metros with the largest single-family gap include San Antonio-New Braunfels, Texas; Austin-Round Rock, Texas; and Deltona-Daytona Beach-Ormond Beach, Fla. The top 10 list of metros by size of gap relative to population includes three Texas metros, five Florida metros, and two Washington metros. Many of these areas have seen significant population growth because of their affordable cost of living and overall desirability.', ""Who are today's new construction buyers? Realtor.com® is also releasing a New Construction Consumer Report today, a survey of recent new home buyers that looked into their motivations and buying behaviors. According to that report, the typical new construction buyer today skews younger, wealthier and more pet friendly compared to non-new home buyers. While new construction buyers were previously more likely to be Boomers, today it's Millennials; among respondents who bought new construction in the past 12 months, nearly half (48%) were Millennials. Despite skewing younger, most surveyed new construction buyers are experienced home purchasers, and 75% had previously owned a home. New home buyers are also more likely to be higher income earners, with more making between $100,000–200,000 versus non-new home buyers (30% compared to 22%)."", ""Newness, customizability and location top draws for new home buyers When it comes to the appeal of new homes, buyers purchased first for its newness, followed by customizability and resale value. Price is a top concern for new home shoppers, but location matters most; 28% of new construction respondents placed location above price (24%) as their prime initial consideration factor. When choosing a builder, their reputation rounded out the top three most important factors, and mattered to potential buyers almost as much as price and location. In fact, early half of surveyed buyers (48%) said they considered a builder's reputation and ratings as part of their selection criteria, scoring higher than the ability to customize and the timing/availability of the home. Repeat customers are top future customers too; 91% of recent buyers say they'd purchase a new construction home again."", 'Realtor.com® is helping educate homeshoppers about the benefits of new construction with a newly launched consumer campaign at www.realtor.com/newconstructioneducation.', 'Methodologies To view the full reports and methodologies, please visit the U.S. Housing Supply Gap Report and the New Construction Consumer Report pages.', ""About Realtor.com®Realtor.com® is an open real estate marketplace built for everyone.

The addition of Amazon was possible because the tech giant split its stock in the summer of 2022. At a price in the low $180-per-share range, Amazon will be an average-weighted stock in the Dow, similar to Apple. Walmart is now one of the least-weighted stocks in the time-tested index.', 'Amazon\'s inclusion makes it the third ""Magnificent Seven"" stock to join the Dow (the other two are Microsoft\xa0and Apple). It also adds more e-commerce and cloud infrastructure to the Dow as these two industries make up a growing share of the economy.', ""But just because a stock is joining the Dow doesn't mean it's automatically worth buying. Let's determine if Amazon or Walmart, both hovering around all-time highs, are worth a look."", ""Amazon is nothing short of an incredible business. The company has expanded beyond e-commerce to become a diversified giant in entertainment through Amazon Prime Video and Twitch, cloud infrastructure through Amazon Web Services (AWS), and even advertising. According to Statista, AWS commands a 31% market share of global cloud infrastructure revenues -- ahead of Microsoft Azure at 24% and Alphabet's Google Cloud at 11%."", ""AWS is, without a doubt, the most valuable aspect of Amazon's business. When Amazon fell below $1 trillion in market capitalization in 2022, there was talk that AWS alone was worth $1 trillion. And there's merit behind that view."", ""AWS generated $90.8 billion in 2023 revenue and $24.6 billion in operating income -- giving the business a 27% operating margin. A price-to-sales ratio of 11 on a business like AWS isn't bad -- if it was growing quickly. But the truth is that AWS' growth has slowed. Compared to 2022, AWS grew sales at just 13.3% and operating income by less than 8%."", ""Look at the whole business, and Amazon generated $30.4 billion in 2023 net income from $574.8 billion in sales. It's not a direct comparison, but Walmart generated $15.5 billion in net income from $648.1 billion in sales. It has a market cap four times smaller than Amazon's."", ""My biggest issue with Amazon is that it isn't growing at a blistering rate, and yet, it still conducts its business like a red-hot growth company. Other big tech companies focus on profits, free cash flow, and revenue growth, but Amazon is still all about revenue."", 'Big tech companies often use some form of stock-based compensation, but the best ones can more than offset it with stock buybacks. Apple, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms\xa0have significantly reduced their outstanding share counts over the last five years, whereas Amazon has diluted its shareholders.', ""Amazon is an impressive and powerful business. But it doesn't offer the same balance of growth and value as Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, and Meta. Again, it would be one thing if Amazon was growing far faster than these companies, but it isn't -- at least not enough to justify its 42 forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, far higher than Microsoft's 35, Apple's 28, Meta's 24, and especially Alphabet's mere 21 or so forward P/E."", ""When Walmart sold off after its fiscal Q3 earnings release last November, it looked like a healthy pullback. Walmart had suffered its fair share of setbacks, but the stock had been remarkably stable. Since that report, Walmart stock is up 12.5%. Not only has Walmart more than made up for the November sell-off, but it's now up over 23% in the past year."", ""To its credit, Walmart is growing sales at a rapid rate, and its margins have recovered to their pre-pandemic levels. Walmart's major concerns were lower margins, supply chain bottlenecks, inflation pressures, and store theft. In a relatively short period, it has made meaningful improvements in all of these categories."", ""Aside from Walmart's stock split and improving fundamentals, the most significant announcement has been its 9% dividend increase to a post-stock split price of $0.83 per share, or $0.2075 per share per quarter -- the largest raise in over a decade. But even when factoring in the raise, Walmart yields just 1.4%. It also has a P/E ratio over 30 -- which is a premium price for a stodgy, low-margin business with a low yield."", 'Walmart is a Dividend King, having paid and raised its dividend for over 50 consecutive years. However, there are far better value plays with higher yields.', ""For example, fellow Dow component and Dividend King Coca-Cola just raised its dividend to a record high. It has a yield above 3% and a P/E ratio of around 24. Walmart isn't growing fast enough to justify half the yield of Coke and a higher valuation. Walmart is the kind of stock worth buying when its valuation makes sense. But that isn't the case now, especially relative to other Dividend Kings."", ""Amazon was my top stock to buy heading into 2023. And Walmart has long been one of my favorite Dividend Kings. But valuation matters, and the truth is that these phenomenal businesses simply haven't put up the results needed to justify their higher multiples."", ""This doesn't mean it's worth selling Amazon or Walmart. But investors don't have to look far for better values. I'd take Apple, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, or Alphabet over Amazon right now. And there are plenty of other dividend stocks with higher yields, lower valuations, and comparable growth to Walmart out there. Many of them are in the Dow, like Coke or Procter & Gamble."", 'All told, Amazon and Walmart are worth holding, but not buying, now.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

These seven stocks delivered blockbuster gains in 2023 and were responsible for most of the upside in the benchmark S&P 500 index because of their sheer size.', 'The companies that make up the Magnificent Seven are:', 'Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)', 'Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)', 'Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)', 'Alphabet (Google) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG)', 'Apple ', 'Amazon ', 'Tesla', 'A case can be made for owning a slice of all seven companies. However, some of the shine has come off the group as a whole in the early stages of 2024, particularly because Tesla stock has plunged 22% for the year already. Apple is also in the red so far. On the other hand, Amazon is having a great 2024 with an impressive 16% gain to date, although it has yet to reclaim its all-time high from 2021.', 'The other four stocks in the Magnificent Seven -- Nvidia, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Alphabet -- have each set a new record high this year. Momentum is a powerful thing in the stock market, and each of these four companies is underpinned by unique fundamental drivers that could lead to more gains going forward.', ""Here's why it's not too late to buy these four Magnificent Seven stocks."", ""Nvidia designed a series of data center chips capable of processing artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, and they have led to a staggering amount of revenue growth, the magnitude of which the average investor may never see again in their lifetime. It's the reason Nvidia stock surged 236% in 2023, and it has already logged a further 63% gain in 2024."", ""Nvidia's H100 graphics processing unit (GPU) is currently the industry leader, but the company is about to ramp up shipments of its new H200 GPU. It can inference (ingest live data to make predictions) at twice the speed of the H100, and it also consumes half the energy, so it will be far cheaper for data center operators to run. It's expected that existing Nvidia customers like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta Platforms will race to get their hands on as many H200 GPUs as possible."", ""Nvidia just reported its financial results for fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28). Its data center revenue surged by 217% year over year to $47.5 billion, which carried its total revenue to a record $60.9 billion. The company's earnings per share (profit) also exploded higher by 288% to $12.96."", ""Those growth rates are the reason Nvidia stock isn't necessarily expensive right now, even though it trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 60.8, which is almost twice the 34.1 P/E of the Nasdaq-100 index. Wall Street expects the company's earnings to come in at $22.09 in fiscal 2025, which would shrink its P/E to a more palatable 35.6."", ""The stock will probably also deserve a premium to the broader market by then based on the company's growth, which alone paves the way for more upside. In short, it's unlikely Nvidia stock has finished delivering gains."", ""Meta Platforms is the parent company of social networks Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, which serve more than 3.1 billion people every single day. Its stock price is up 40% in 2024, and it has logged multiple all-time highs along the way. Meta is investing heavily in AI on a few different fronts, and the company has become one of Nvidia's largest customers."", ""Meta developed an open-source large language model (LLM) called Llama. LLMs are the foundation models that power AI software applications -- for example, OpenAI's GPT-4 LLMs power its ChatGPT platform. Llama is open source, unlike most other LLMs, which means it receives scrutiny from thousands of AI developers, who provide valuable feedback to Meta."", ""In other words, the open-source approach can accelerate the advancement of Llama for everyone, but especially Meta, which will use Llama to deliver a number of different AI applications. The company recently announced it will purchase 350,000 of Nvidia's H100 GPUs by the end of 2024, worth an estimated $9 billion. They will help Meta churn out new versions of its LLM more quickly. Llama 3 is currently in training, and will soon supersede the current Llama 2 model."", 'But AI is also helping Meta feed more relevant content to users on its social networks. AI curates 20% to 40% of the content users see on Facebook and Instagram, which drove an uptick in the amount of time they spent on those platforms last year. That creates more opportunities to serve users with ads, which leads to more revenue for Meta.', 'Like Nvidia, Meta stock remains relatively cheap despite trading at an all-time high. Its P/E ratio stands at 32.5 as of this writing, which is already a small discount to the 34.1 P/E ratio of Nasdaq-100 index. Wall Street expects Meta to deliver earnings growth of 23% in 2024, so the stock will soon look even cheaper.', ""Microsoft was one of the early movers when the AI frenzy kicked in at the start of 2023. All eyes were on OpenAI and its ChatGPT chatbot, and Microsoft swooped in with a $13 billion investment into that start-up, which laid the foundation for many of its AI initiatives. Microsoft stock is up 10% so far in 2024, though it's down fractionally from the record high it set in early February."", 'Microsoft has embedded AI into its entire product portfolio, including the Bing search engine and Edge internet browser. Its Copilot AI virtual assistant is also available to users of the 365 document suite (which includes applications like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint), and the Microsoft Power platform, which allows businesses to build websites and software without writing code.', 'The monetization opportunity is enormous. Microsoft says it has 400 million paid 365 users and all of them are candidates for the Copilot upgrade, which costs $30 per month. For context, the standard business 365 plan is $12.50 per month.', ""Microsoft's cloud platform for businesses, Azure, remains the fastest-growing piece of its entire organization. Over 53,000 businesses are accessing AI models and tools on Azure to accelerate their own development initiatives. In the recent fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Dec. 31), Azure's revenue grew by 30% year over year, and Microsoft attributed six percentage points of that growth to AI specifically -- that was double the contribution AI made in the prior quarter just three months earlier."", 'Microsoft is arguably the most diverse AI story available to investors. It could be one of the greatest beneficiaries of widespread AI adoption, and for that reason, its stock will likely march higher.', ""Alphabet is home to Google, YouTube, and the Waymo self-driving company, among other brands. The company was perceived to be under attack last year because of Microsoft's OpenAI investment, as investors feared the new ChatGPT-powered Bing would steal some of the 91.4% market share held by Google in the internet search industry."", ""Those concerns have since faded because Alphabet launched a series of its own LLMs and AI applications to compete with ChatGPT. Its latest model (called Gemini) outperforms OpenAI's latest GPT-4 models across most multimodal benchmarks. In other words, Alphabet says Gemini is better at understanding and generating text, images, videos, and computer code."", ""Beyond AI, the reason Alphabet stock logged an all-time high this year is because its advertising business -- led by Google Search and YouTube -- is bouncing back. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Google Search delivered a record $48 billion in revenue, marking a 12.7% year-over-year increase. It was the fastest rate of growth since mid-2022. Similarly, YouTube's quarterly ad revenue growth accelerated to 15.5%."", 'Like Microsoft, Alphabet is also building a formidable presence in AI in the cloud. Google Cloud has designed its own data center chips in-house to create an edge against competitors that only offer chips from Nvidia. Plus, Google Cloud offers over 130 generative AI models -- including Gemini -- which developers can use to build their own AI applications.', ""Alphabet stock trades at a P/E ratio of 24.8 as of this writing. By that metric, it's the cheapest stock in the Magnificent Seven, which paves the way for more upside in its stock beyond its recent all-time high."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

He was born in 1930 and bought his first stock at age 11. By 1965, he was running his own investment company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B).', 'Buffett remains at the helm of Berkshire today. It has amassed an expansive portfolio that includes several wholly owned private companies, and 47 publicly traded stocks and securities.', ""Berkshire's largest holding is Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which became the world's first $1 trillion company in 2018. That rare milestone has since been achieved by five other technology giants: Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Nvidia, and Meta Platforms."", ""Berkshire could be the first U.S. company outside the tech sector to join the $1 trillion club. Its stock has delivered a mammoth 4,384,748% gain since 1965, carrying the company to a valuation of almost $900 billion. Here's why it could cross the trillion-dollar milestone as soon as this year."", 'Buffett is all about value investing. He likes to buy great businesses at a fair price -- though the cheaper the better -- with the intention of holding on to them for the long term. He looks for companies generating a steady profit, combined with consistent revenue growth and strong management teams. He especially likes companies that return money to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.', ""Buffett's most powerful weapon is time. He's a big advocate for compound interest, which is responsible for building most of his wealth. For example, Berkshire spent $1.3 billion accumulating shares of Coca-Cola\xa0between 1988 and 1994. Today, that position is worth $24.4 billion -- but it also paid Berkshire $736 million in dividends in 2023."", ""In other words, Berkshire recoups its initial Coca-Cola investment in dividends alone every two years. But that's just one of the conglomerate's many success stories."", 'Berkshire was a textiles company on the brink of failure before Buffett stepped in and bought it in 1965. He quickly realized its core business was no longer viable, so he transformed it into a holding company to house various investments.', 'Berkshire now has a full ownership stake in a number of famous businesses including Dairy Queen, Duracell, and GEICO. Plus, its portfolio of publicly traded stocks and securities is worth $371.9 billion, a sizable portion of which is attributable to one stock: Apple.', ""Berkshire first bought Apple stock in 2016 and it has steadily increased the size of its position over time, spending around $38 billion in total. That single holding is worth $165.3 billion as of this writing, accounting for 44% of the total value of Berkshire's portfolio of publicly traded securities."", ""Bank of America and American Express are Berkshire's second- and third-largest holdings, respectively. Last year, Berkshire received more than $2.1 billion in dividends from its top three positions alone."", ""Berkshire owns smaller positions in energy companies like Chevron and Occidental Petroleum. Plus, if owning American Express wasn't enough, its portfolio also includes the two other major credit card companies, Visa and Mastercard."", 'While Buffett is known to avoid most technology stocks, Berkshire has accumulated small positions in Amazon and cloud computing company Snowflake.', 'As I touched on at the top, Berkshire stock has delivered a whopping 4,384,748% gain since 1965, or 19.8% compounded annually. That trounces the 31,223% gain in the benchmark S&P 500 index over the same period, which translates to just 10.2% compounded annually.', 'The difference is staggering in dollar terms. A mere $1,000 invested in Berkshire stock in 1965 would be worth $48.4 million today. The same investment in the S&P 500 would be worth just $313,230.', ""The conglomerate has the financial results to back up those substantial gains. It generated $49.3 million in revenue in 1965, and in 2023, that number was a record-high $364.4 billion. Over $155.6 billion came from sales and services across the various businesses under Berkshire's umbrella, with a further $83.4 billion coming from its insurance businesses. Its railroad, utility, and energy interests contributed $101.4 billion."", 'Berkshire also delivered a record profit last year, with a net income of $96.2 billion. That compares to just $2.3 million in net income in 1965.', 'With a market capitalization of almost $900 billion as of this writing, Berkshire stock only needs a gain of about 11% from here to cross the $1 trillion milestone. Considering its 58-year track record of delivering 19.8% annual returns, on average, it appears sure to get there in 2024.', ""A number of factors will probably work in the conglomerate's favor as the year progresses. The stock market is at an all-time high right now, and most Wall Street analysts predict it will continue to move higher. Plus, Berkshire could earn record dividends in 2024 because companies like Apple, Coca-Cola, and American Express continue to increase their payouts."", ""In the broader economy, the U.S. Federal Reserve estimates it will cut interest rates three times in 2024, which will serve as a tailwind for Berkshire's consumer-focused businesses. Its transport and logistics businesses would also benefit if rate cuts drive more economic activity."", ""Finally, Buffett continues to believe in the conglomerate's prospects because he authorized the repurchase of almost $9.2 billion worth of Berkshire's shares in 2023. Buffett has overseen $73.6 billion worth of share repurchases during the last five years alone, which is more than he has deployed into any other stock."", 'Buffett recently told investors that Berkshire\'s enormous size will prevent it from generating ""eye-popping performance"" in the future, but based on its share repurchases, it\'s clear he still feels Berkshire stock is the best bet he can make in the world.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

Home to many bleeding-edge technologies in today's world, it is tough to argue that the Magnificent Seven doesn't deserve this massive allocation of funds."", ""However, one company works behind the scenes to keep these juggernauts' operations humming: Netherlands-based ASML (NASDAQ: ASML). Playing a vital role in the semiconductor supply chain, ASML helps enable the Magnificent Seven's most ambitious technological aspirations."", ""Thanks to its unmatched technology, here's how ASML secretly powers the world's most influential companies -- potentially making it a more intriguing investment than its enormous peers."", 'ASML maintains a monopoly in the extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) market and controls around two-thirds of the more mature deep ultraviolet lithography (DUV) niche. Lithography uses ultraviolet light to draw infinitesimal patterns onto silicon wafers. These wafers are then layered to build semiconductors, which help power smartphones, computers, data centers, cars, and AI language models.', ""Seeing this array of end-product use cases, it isn't surprising that ASML's three largest customers are the semiconductor behemoths Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Intel, and Samsung Electronics. These companies' products (requiring ASML's lithography) are vital to the innovation machines that comprise the Magnificent Seven."", ""Just how important? Let's consider things through the lens of a snap test."", 'Popularized by Motley Fool\'s co-founder David Gardner, a ""snap"" test asks us to imagine a world where we snap our fingers and a company\'s products disappear. In ASML\'s case, many of today\'s advanced electronics would be much different or less sophisticated -- at a minimum. At worst, they may be nonexistent.', 'How is this so?', ""First, ASML's largest customer, Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC), counts Apple as its biggest client. Via this trickle-down effect from ASML to TSMC to Apple, there is no doubt that Apple's consumer electronics would be entirely different without using ASML's lithography. Sans ASML's help, Apple's products might be physically larger, slower, less powerful, and have fewer features."", ""Meanwhile, another of TSMC's largest customers is Nvidia, which relies upon the company to create chips for its graphic processing units (GPUs).

The company has repurchased 1% of its shares annually since 2014, bolstered by this immense profitability while boosting its dividend payments ninefold.', 'While ASML may not match its 14% annualized revenue growth rate from the last decade over the next 10 years, it grew sales by 30% in 2023 and has clear megatrends working in its favor. Supported by growth drivers in end markets such as the ongoing energy transition, the ""electrification of everything,"" and AI, the semiconductor market should double within 10 years, according to ASML\'s CEO Peter Wennink.', ""Commanding a lofty price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 43 today, the market expects this steady growth to come to fruition, with ASML maintaining its leadership position for many years.

Today, Druckenmiller manages his personal wealth through Duquesne Family Office, but he remains an excellent case study for investors given his impeccable track record.', 'As of December, Druckenmiller had 21.1% of his $3.3 billion portfolio invested in two artificial intelligence stocks: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) accounted for 9.1% and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) accounted for 12% of his invested assets. Those stocks have been brilliant investments in the past, but Druckenmiller clearly believes both will create value for shareholders in the future.', ""Here's what investors should know about Nvidia and Microsoft."", 'Nvidia impressed Wall Street with its fourth-quarter financial results. Revenue increased 265% to $22.1 billion on exceptional growth in the data center segment, driven by demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips. On the bottom line, non-GAAP net income soared 491% to $12.8 billion due to an expansion of 10 percentage points in gross margin, driven in part by pricing power. CEO Jensen Huang said conditions are excellent for continued growth into 2025 and beyond.', 'Nvidia is best known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), chips that have become the gold standard in multimedia and AI computing. The company holds more than 95% market share in workstation graphics chips, and more than 80% market share in machine learning processors. But Nvidia GPUs serve other purposes as well, such as accelerating scientific computing and data analytics. Collectively, the company controls about 98% of the data center GPU market.', 'Nvidia has extended its ability to monetize AI with networking equipment, central processing units (CPUs), subscription software, and cloud services. The company is now realizing the benefits of that diversification. Networking revenue more than tripled in the fourth quarter, while software and services revenue achieved a $1 billion run rate. Additionally, Huang said in the third quarter, ""We are on a very, very fast ramp with our first data center CPU to a multibillion-dollar product line.""', 'Nvidia has a significant advantage in its position as a full-stack AI computing company, meaning it brings together all the hardware, software, and services needed to build, deploy, and manage AI applications across private data center and public clouds. That strategy not only creates more opportunities to monetize existing customers, but also reduces friction for potential customers.', 'Going forward, Wall Street expects Nvidia to grow earnings per share at 35% annually over the next five years. That makes its current valuation of 66 times earnings look tolerable. That said, the stock could nosedive if earnings grow more slowly than anticipated. Investors comfortable with that risk should consider buying a few shares today.', 'Microsoft reported better-than-expected financial results in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Dec. 31, 2023), beating estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue rose 18% to $62 billion on especially strong growth in the cloud computing segment, supported by momentum in enterprise software. Non-GAAP net income increased 26% to $21.9 million due to disciplined expense management, among other factors.', 'Growth will likely slow in the coming quarters, but Microsoft remains well positioned to expand its business. The company dominates the enterprise software market due to strength in office productivity, enterprise resource planning, communications, and cybersecurity applications, among other categories. Microsoft accounted for 16.4% of software-as-a-service (SaaS) spending in 2022, more than twice as much market share as its closest competitor, according to the International Data Corp.', 'Meanwhile, the company has gained market share in cloud computing. Microsoft Azure captured 24% of cloud infrastructure and platform services revenue in the fourth quarter, up about 2 percentage points from the prior year. CEO Satya Nadella said the reason for that increased market share was differentiated AI capabilities.', 'Microsoft has an exclusive partnership with OpenAI, such that Azure is the sole cloud provider for the company and the only cloud provider that offers access to OpenAI models like GPT-4 and DALL-E 3. Businesses can use those models to build custom generative AI applications fine-tuned with their own data. That value proposition could bring more customers to Azure in the future, possibly extending its market share gains.', 'Going forward, enterprise SaaS spending is forecast to increase at 13.7% annually through 2030, and cloud computing revenue is projected to grow at 14.1% annually during the same period. That gives Microsoft a good shot at low-teens sales growth through the end of the decade. Meanwhile, disciplined expense management and share repurchases should support slightly faster earnings growth. Indeed, Wall Street expects Microsoft to grow earnings per share at 15% annually over the next five years.', ""Against that consensus estimate, the company's current valuation of 37 times earnings looks a bit pricey, especially when the three-year average is 32 times earnings. Microsoft is a wonderful company with reasonable growth prospects, but upside may be somewhat limited given its $3 trillion market capitalization. Additionally, I question whether the stock can outperform the market from its current price, so I would personally keep Microsoft on my watch list right now."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

For context, we're talking about a nearly 20% annualized return spanning six decades, which is roughly double the annualized total return, including dividends, of the benchmark S&P 500 over the same period."", ""Even though the Oracle of Omaha and his team of investors aren't perfect, their track record undeniably points to a history of recognizing plain-as-day values hiding in plain sight. This is why investors pay such close attention to Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)."", ""A 13F offers a snapshot of what Wall Street's brightest minds purchased and sold in the latest quarter (in this instance, the December-ended quarter). However, Berkshire's 13F doesn't tell the complete story of Berkshire Hathaway's equity holdings."", ""In 1998, Buffett's company completed a $22 billion acquisition of General Re. While the reinsurance segment was the catalyst behind the deal, General Re also owned a specialty investment firm known as New England Asset Management (NEAM). When Berkshire purchased General Re, it became the new parent of NEAM."", 'Because New England Asset Management continues to oversee more than $100 million in assets under management, it\'s required to file a 13F with the SEC every quarter. Although Warren Buffett isn\'t involved with the investing activity at NEAM in the same way he is with Berkshire Hathaway\'s $371 billion portfolio, the $621 million NEAM had invested as of Dec. 31, 2023 is, nevertheless, part of Berkshire Hathaway\'s aggregate holdings. In other words, New England Asset Management is Warren Buffett\'s ""secret"" portfolio.', ""As of the end of 2023, this $621 million portfolio held positions in 115 securities, which includes common stock, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and preferred stock. But what really stands out is this portfolio's stake in two of the Magnificent Seven stocks."", ""They are seven of the largest and most-influential publicly traded companies in the United States. I'm referring to:"", 'Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)', 'Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)', 'Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)', 'Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)', 'Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG)', 'Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)', 'Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)', 'The Magnificent Seven stocks have two lures. First, as you can see in the chart above, they have handily outperformed the broad-based S&P 500.', 'More importantly, the Magnificent Seven provide sustained competitive advantages and/or virtually impenetrate moats.', ""Microsoft's Windows is the leading global operating system, while its Azure has quickly become the world's No. 2 provider of cloud infrastructure services."", ""Apple's iPhone is the clear leader in smartphone market share in the United States. Furthermore, Apple's share-repurchase program is unrivaled, with more than $600 billion worth of its common stock bought back since the start of 2013."", ""Nvidia's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) could account for up to a 90% share of GPUs deployed in artificial intelligence (AI) accelerated data centers in 2024."", ""Amazon's marketplace captured a nearly 38% share of online spending in the U.S. in 2023. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's leading provider of cloud infrastructure services."", ""Alphabet's Google accounted for more than 91% of global internet search in January. It also owns Google Cloud, the world's No. 3 cloud infrastructure service provider, and YouTube, the second-most-visited social site on the planet."", ""Meta Platforms' social media real estate is unmatched. Facebook is the most-visited site globally, and its family of apps attracted just shy of 4 billion monthly active users in the fourth quarter."", ""Tesla is North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) maker and the only EV pure play that's generating a recurring profit, based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)."", ""Warren Buffett's secret portfolio holds stakes in two of these seven companies."", ""The first Magnificent Seven stock you'll find in Warren Buffett's hidden portfolio is Alphabet, the parent of internet search engine Google, streaming platform YouTube, cloud infrastructure service platform Google Cloud, and autonomous vehicle company Waymo, among other ventures. NEAM closed out December with 18,200 shares of Alphabet's Class A shares (GOOGL), which were worth more than $2.5 million at the time."", ""The longtime draw for investors to Alphabet has been its foundational search engine. It's been nearly nine years since Google last accounted for less than a 90% share of worldwide internet search in a given month. As a virtual monopoly, it is able to command exceptionally strong ad-pricing power and take advantage of disproportionately long periods of economic expansion. Internet search should continue to be a healthy cash-flow driver."", ""However, the company's most-exciting cash flow growth is liable to come from its smaller but substantially faster-growing segments. For instance, Google Cloud delivered four consecutive quarters of operating income in 2023 after years of steady operating losses. Businesses are still very early in the cloud spending cycle, which suggests the high margins associated with cloud infrastructure services can really lift Alphabet's cash flow."", ""Similarly, YouTube's monthly active user count is marching higher. Daily views for Shorts (short-form videos that usually last less than 60 seconds) have climbed from 6.5 billion in early 2021 to north of 50 billion in early 2023. This represents an excellent monetization opportunity for YouTube, as well as another catalyst to spark an increase in high-margin subscriptions."", ""Alphabet remains cheap, as well. Despite a sizable bounce from their 2022 bear market low, shares of the company can be picked up for less than 13 times estimated cash flow per share in 2025. That's a marked discount to the average multiple to cash flow of 17.9 that Alphabet has traded at over the trailing-five-year period."", 'At one time, Warren Buffett\'s ""secret"" portfolio had a sizable position in Apple and owned shares of GPU giant Nvidia. But as of Dec. 31, 2023, neither company remained in New England Asset Management\'s $621 million portfolio. The only Magnificent Seven stock represented in that portfolio, other than Alphabet, is tech stock Microsoft. NEAM held 30,845 shares of the company as of Dec. 31, which equated to roughly $11.6 million in market value.', 'The reason asset managers are attracted to Microsoft is its exceptional cash flow, which is a function of its seemingly flawless operating model and pristine balance sheet.', ""As I've pointed out previously, Microsoft's success is a reflection of its blending the old with the new. Although its legacy Windows and Office segments are no longer growing much, if at all, they still generate exceptionally juicy margins that provide abundant cash flow. The company is able to use this cash to reinvest in high-growth initiatives or make acquisitions."", 'On the other side of the coin, Microsoft is betting its future on cloud services (including Azure), as well as the rise of AI. It has invested billions in OpenAI, the company behind popular chatbot ChatGPT, and is expecting longtail growth from the AI revolution.', ""And Microsoft is one of only two publicly traded companies with the highest possible credit rating (AAA) from Standard & Poor's, a division of S&P Global. The company closed out 2023 with $81 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, and it's on pace for almost $99 billion in net cash generated from operations in fiscal 2024, based on the $49.4 billion of net cash it has generated through the first six months of its current fiscal year."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

A study conducted by Jeremy Siegel and Jeremy Schwartz of the University of Pennsylvania measured the performance of all stocks deleted from the S&P 500 SPX between 1957 and 2003.

A similar result was reached by another study , which focused on stocks added and deleted to the Russell 2000 RUT between 1979 and 2004.', 'Contrarian analysis helps us to understand why this pattern exists.

Being able to work because you want to, not because you have to, is the ultimate flex. You can take different roads and get to the same place, but dividend stocks are an excellent path for this journey.', 'Dividend stocks are shares of companies that share their profits with you. Own enough of them, and the dividends might even cover your living expenses without you having to sell shares to raise money.', 'Consider adding these five fantastic stocks to your portfolio if you want dividend-driven financial freedom.', 'They have the goods to pay you ever-increasing dividends for the foreseeable future.', 'Realty Income (NYSE: O) is a real estate investment trust (REIT): a company that leases real estate it owns and pays at least 90% of its taxable income to shareholders as dividends. A REIT allows investors to benefit from real estate profits without owning properties.', 'Realty Income focuses on single-tenant retail properties, including grocery stores, convenience stores, dollar stores, restaurants, and more. These are recession-proof businesses, which means they can reliably pay their rent.', ""The company uses net leases, which obligate the tenant to pay taxes, insurance, and maintenance. It makes Realty Income's business more dependable because there isn't much to disrupt its revenue streams."", 'Realty Income has paid and raised its dividend for 31 consecutive years, and its 71% dividend payout ratio leaves room for plenty more increases.', 'Altria Group (NYSE: MO) sells tobacco products, primarily Marlboro cigarettes, in the United States. It also sells cigars, oral tobacco, and smokeless nicotine products like On oral pouches. Smoking rates in America have declined for decades, but Altria uses its pricing power to offset declining volumes with higher prices. The company is a Dividend King with 54 consecutive years of increases.', 'A high dividend yield can be a red flag. However, Altria looks like an exception to the rule. Dependable cash flows, a manageable 80% payout ratio, and a strong balance sheet should allow management to keep tacking on small increases. The company must slowly transition away from cigarettes as a core business, but there is time for that to happen over the coming years. Until then, keep banking that humungous dividend.', ""Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is more than a household name for its iOS devices: It's the largest investment in Warren Buffett's holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, by a country mile. Buffett admires the company for its strong loyalty from consumers who religiously buy and upgrade their iPhones, smartwatches, and other personal electronics. Apple is so big it generates a remarkable $106 billion in free cash flow annually. Not revenue, free cash flow."", 'That sets up investors for a ton of dividend growth. Apple has raised its dividend yearly since it began paying shareholders 11 years ago. The dividend payout ratio is still tiny at just 14%, so decades of dividend increases are likely ahead. That should be music to the ears of any long-term investor.', ""Home Depot (NYSE: HD) is one of the most successful stocks ever. Shares have returned more than 3,000,000% since its initial public offering (IPO), creating life-changing returns for long-term investors. How? Home Depot became the largest home improvement retailer in North America. Homes are part of people's identity. People make upgrades and repairs, and new homes are constantly being built."", 'The company is also a stellar dividend stock. The company has raised its payout for 14 consecutive years after freezing it during the Great Recession. Today, the payout ratio is manageable at 46% of cash flow, so investors should look for raises to continue at a healthy pace. The average increase over the past five years is an impressive 15%.', ""Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) has a grip on consumers that few food and beverage companies do. I'm sure you, or someone you know, loves their Starbucks. The company's loyalty program has a whopping 34.3 million active 90-day users in America alone."", 'Starbucks has expanded from the northwestern United States to become a global juggernaut with 38,587 open stores worldwide. Starbucks is highly profitable and returns a lot of its profits to investors. The company has paid and raised its dividend for 13 consecutive years.', ""It also repurchases a ton of stock to help boost earnings growth. The company's outstanding shares have decreased 25% over the past decade. Juggling both has made Starbucks a stock that can deliver income at its current 2.4% yield and total returns. The payout ratio is solid at 56%, so investors can continue to buy and hold confidently and expect more of the same."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Realty Income wasn’t one of them.

As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today we will analyse the most recent data on Synopsys’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.', ' View our latest analysis for Synopsys ', ""Synopsys appears to be expensive according to our price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average. In this instance, we’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. We find that Synopsys’s ratio of 62.21x is above its peer average of 43.59x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Software industry. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that Synopsys’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility."", ""Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations.

This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value."", 'Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in SNPS’s positive outlook, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe SNPS should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable.

If you’ve been keeping tabs on SNPS for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock.

TD Cowen Managing Director Helane Becker and Citi Managing Director Steve Trent weigh in on the strength of airline operators amid 2024 travel forecasts.', 'While stating incentives like customer loyalty programs can drive revenues, Trent believes airline stock prices could see some moderation: ""It\'s possible that we won\'t see them as high as they\'ve been over the last year and a half, but a fair bit of that is coming down to oil prices.

I don\'t think anybody would give airlines really high marks for the service that they deliver...""', ""Catch more of Yahoo Finance's Travel Guide 2024: Industry Insights special coverage this week, or watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live here."", ""Editor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan."", ""SEANA SMITH: Airline stocks are taking flight just a bit so far in 2024. We want to take a look at shares of Delta, United, American Airlines all gaining year-to-date. You can see, though, not much of an uplift here since the start of the year. Now as we approach the very busy spring travel season of the year, what stocks are best positioned? Joining us now is part of Yahoo Finance's Travel Guide 2024 Industry Insights. We have Helane Becker, TD Cowen managing director, and Steve Trent, Citi managing director."", 'Steve, let me start with you. In terms of how airlines are positioned ahead of the rest of the year, from your view, are we going to see more of that recovery take place and who do you think has that lead position?', 'STEVE TRENT: Yeah, absolutely. And thank you for having me. So I do think that the network airlines look better-positioned. We continue to have generally to very good demand trends not only talking about ticket revenue but all the ancillary stuff they do-- co-branded card, loyalty program revenue. International capillarity is still a very good place to be.', ""The discount airlines that are mostly US-based, we're a little less sanguine on those in terms of what opportunities we see. But overall, the picture looks good from a capacity perspective. So 2019, we had $23 of US economic activity per available seat mile. We, last year, finished around $28. So the pie itself looks very good. We think the distribution of the economics could be tilted toward the network airlines."", ""BRAD SMITH: Helane, I want to bring you into this as well. I mean, when you think about the international exposure that airlines need to have in order to be among your top picks, how important is that international demand into this year's performance that trickles through to what investors are going to be watching in the stock price action?"", ""HELANE BECKER: Well, I think, in terms of international received a pretty strong demand. The airlines, though, have adjusted capacity lower since we initially cautioned back in December that we thought airfares, internationally, would come down this summer because capacity was rushing into the market-- and not so much from US carriers but from international carriers that didn't have the ability to add capacity last summer."", 'So for example, Lufthansa is up 16% this summer versus last year, while United is just reinstating seasonal service and their capacity is actually up low single digits.', 'SEANA SMITH: Steve, what do you think the pricing power looks like from these airlines, and how much higher some of those airfares could potentially go?', ""STEVE TRENT: Yeah. So I think, relative to last year or the year before-- relative to 2019-- it's possible that we won't see them as high as they have been over the last year and a half. But a fair bit of that is coming down to oil prices. So we did, of course, have a lot of pressure from jet fuel prices 2022 and into 2023. So some of that moderation should be related to fuel."", ""But when we think about this from an Xfuel perspective, we do think there should be stability. To even some upside in fares. As Helane mentioned, we do have some capacity constraints. We have the powder metal alloy contamination on GTF engines. Boeing has had some issues. So it's possible that elements of the market won't have as much equipment at the end of the year that they're expecting to have today, and that could support pricing."", 'BRAD SMITH: Just to follow on that-- does that mean any material reduction in route schedules that the airline operators are flying right now?', 'STEVE TRENT: Yeah, it could be depending on which ones. I think regional airlines come to mind in terms of where we could continue to see some scarcity of equipment. So yeah. I think, in pockets, yes. And then you also have markets that, over the last three years, have been hot like South Florida where everybody put metal into that market during the pandemic. Now probably, you see some rotation out of those regions.', ""BRAD SMITH: Helane, one of the things that we've continued to hear from airline CEOs is just when they expect to take delivery of some of these new aircraft and add that into the fleet, how would you be evaluating that and when that could actually be a pass through a boon for some of these businesses as well?"", ""HELANE BECKER: Yeah. The way we think about it is everything slides to the right. So if an airline tells us they're looking to take delivery of 50 or 60 aircraft this year, we probably think we'll be closer to 40 aircraft because the delivery delays, the supply chain issues. And we think that we'll probably see some lease extensions into 2025 to cover some of the gaps because of all the delivery issues that we're seeing in the OEM problems."", ""And so that's how we think about it. We push everything off to the right, which is really helpful. Our hope is that the government doesn't shut down because the FAA Reauthorization expires March 8. It was punted to early March, which is just two weeks away. And we need-- or next Friday. I guess March 8."", ""And we just need to have continuity in that regard because if we don't, air travel is going to get worse than it already is. I don't think anybody would give airlines really high marks for the service that they deliver."", ""And without the support network of the government, air traffic control, even the OEM, the suppliers for maintenance-- without their support, air ticket prices are going a lot higher over time because demand isn't going down and yet, the supply, the number of seats available, is going down or at least is not keeping pace. So we view that as concerning because it will-- eventually, if fares get too high, people will opt out, especially in the domestic market."", ""SEANA SMITH: I see, we're also getting some developments on the JetBlue-Spirit saga that's playing out yesterday, urging the US appeals court to allow the merger to go forward. What's your assessment of that risk? Or, I guess, is it more of a short-term risk? And how do you see this ultimately impacting the industry at large?"", ""STEVE TRENT: Yeah. Certainly, I think, right now, it's a very difficult time in the aviation industry for any M&A to get done at least over the short term. So we know there's some other stuff out there that's cooking that might be less controversial than what JetBlue is trying to do. But when we look at this particular case-- the business model differences and the government's desire to preserve Maverick pricing carriers for example-- it looks like it's going to be a difficult road."", ""And possibly, the airline industry could use a little bit of consolidation. So does that come through M&A? Does it come through carriers doing filings or what have you? I hope it's not going to be the latter. But we think, one way or the other, we could see on some level capacity continue to come out of the industry at least over the short term, whether that's M&A, or as Helene mentioned, we get ongoing delays from the OEMs.""]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of the global tobacco market, the effect of taxes on smoking, and the heavy investments in marketing by tobacco companies, and go directly to the Top 5 Most Valuable Tobacco Companies in the World.\xa0', ""Tobacco was first used by the people of pre-Columbian Americas. Archeological studies suggest that the Maya people of Central America started using tobacco leaves as far back as the 1st century BC, mainly for smoking in sacred and religious ceremonies. By the time Columbus arrived in the New World in 1492, the Native Americans were already cultivating and smoking tobacco in pipes, cigars, and snuff. Although Cristopher Columbus brought with him a few tobacco leaves and seeds back to Europe, most Europeans didn't get their first taste of the plant until the mid-16th century, when adventurers and diplomats like France's Jean Nicot – for whom nicotine is named – began to popularize its use. Tobacco was introduced to France in 1556, Portugal in 1558, Spain in 1559, and finally England in 1565. By the early 17th century, smoking was common in all of Europe’s maritime nations, and their colonial empires soon carried tobacco all over the world."", 'According to Research and Markets, the global tobacco market is expected to reach $1.049 trillion by 2030, with a CAGR of 2.1% during the forecast period. The market is fuelled by a growing demand from developing nations, coupled with the rising proliferation of next-generation products (NGPs) across the globe. The high marketing expenditure and discounting of products undertaken by major tobacco companies is also adding to the growth of the industry.\xa0', 'While tobacco consumption is leveling off and even decreasing in some countries, the number of people smoking is still increasing globally, and smokers are smoking more than before. An estimated 1.3 billion people worldwide use tobacco products, 80% of whom are in low- and middle-income countries.', ""Marlboro, produced by Philip Morris International, is the No. 1 Cigarette Brand in the World.\xa0 Marlboro Gold Shorts and Marlboro Gold 100's have also been known to be the Best Cigarettes for Women, meanwhile, the Marlboro Light brand has been placed among the Best Cigarettes for New Smokers.\xa0"", 'Most studies have found that increasing cigarette prices through increased taxation is a highly effective measure to reduce smoking among youth and young adults. From 2001 through 2015, increases in state-level excise taxes were associated with significant declines in prevalence of cigarette smoking, with the strongest effect among young adults aged 18 to 24.\xa0', 'However, this strategy hasn’t been very effective for reducing the smoking prevalence among participants with annual income below $25,000, probably due to their limited exposure to cessation treatment and anti-smoking programs. Poor working conditions are also linked to high smoking prevalence. And as both low- and high-income smokers pay the same amount of cigarette tax per pack, the former spend a disproportionately large share of their income on smoking. Thus, since low-income individuals are price-insensitive, raising cigarette taxes and prices would further deepen income disparities.', 'The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) has led to widespread restrictions on tobacco advertising, promotion, and sponsorship around the world. This, coupled with the evidence of the causal role of marketing in the tobacco epidemic, has inspired more than half the countries worldwide to ban some forms of tobacco marketing.\xa0', 'Yet, tobacco companies have found creative ways to maneuver their way around these barriers, using a variety of marketing strategies to create demand for cigarettes and other tobacco products by urging the youth to experiment, reducing smokers’ motivation to quit, and encouraging former smokers to take it up again. According to the Federal Trade Commission, in 2020 alone, the American tobacco industry spent over $8.4 billion on marketing for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, spending more at the point-of-sale than anywhere else.

Moreover, indicators suggest corporate finance activity could increase later this year. As such, it makes for a good time to review Goldman Sachs' prospects."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with GS.', 'Here are a few factors to consider regarding the American banking giant.', 'Goldman Sachs released its third-quarter earnings in January, revealing a $ 370.54 revenue beat and a $1.21 earnings-per-share triumph.', ""The earnings beat was a welcome surprise. However, numerous talking points surfaced upon releasing the bank's results."", ""Firstly, the bank's global banking & markets equity revenues rose by 26% year-over-year to $2.61 billion as intermediation and financing activities experienced higher uptake due to an unexpected rise in public equity market activity in the latter stages of 2023. Furthermore, Goldman's net revenues from asset and wealth management rose to 22% year-over-year to $4.39 billion as management fees from both equity and debt offerings increased amid higher market volumes. "", 'The sub-segments above will likely experience sustained growth throughout 2024 as Goldman is well-placed to expand its assets under management. A lower implied interest rate curve is luring a lot of capital into the debt markets, while a continuous rally in high-beta technology stocks has raised optimism among investors.', ""While experiencing solid performance from recovering debt and equity markets, Goldman's corporate finance activities struggled during its fourth quarter. The bank's investment banking activities stalled, leading to $6.22 billion in investment banking fees, 16% lower than in 2022. Even though debt underwriting and structuring activities phased out some of the downturns, lower merger and acquisition volumes upended the segment."", 'It might take time for merger and acquisition volume to increase because resilient interest rates have priced many leveraged acquirers out of the market. I expect mergers and acquisitions to pick up in late 2024 or early 2025 when capital is less scarce and valuations have bottomed.', 'Stabilization in investment banking advisory is probably. However, increased activity still seems a mile down the road.', ""Goldman Sachs' platform solutions sustained momentum in the company's fourth quarter, achieving 12% year-over-year growth to deliver $577 million in revenue."", 'This segment is aligned for growth due to two reasons. Firstly, modern offerings, such as an ETF accelerator program, merchant point-of-sale lending, and digital enterprise partnerships, are suited to modern commerce as the flourishing ETF business, consumer credit, and cloud-based solutions are in hypergrowth mode. Moreover, the segment follows a growth-by-acquisition approach, allowing it to scale at a rate of knots.', ""Goldman's Platform Solutions segment provides diversified revenue, making it a key asset leading forward."", ""Goldman's latest endeavors have mostly been positive. However, controversies regarding trading fees and David Solomon's remuneration have surfaced."", ""It was made public earlier this month that Goldman Sachs' commodity futures trading department is under investigation regarding improper fee charges. Goldman paid about $50 million in fines in 2023 to settle at least four other cases of a similar nature. As such, additional penalties are highly probable. However, based on my experience, futures trading fees are highly elastic, making it difficult to deem what's fair. "", ""Furthermore, David Solomon received a 24% pay bump in 2023 to raise his compensation to $31 million. Although Solomon's work as a CEO substantiates such a comprehensive salary, the timing of the pay bump is questionable, given that the economic outlook is somewhat gloomy and much of the bank's segments experienced negative growth in the past year."", ""Goldman is never shy of controversy, meaning these latest debacles aren't too big of a deal. Nevertheless, they are influencing variables worth considering."", ""The price-to-book ratio is salient to banking stocks as banks hold marketable assets. Therefore, a bank's book value provides a fair reflection of the organization's fair value."", ""Goldman's price-to-book ratio of 1.08 is below its mean of 1.5, indicating relative value. In addition, interest and discount rates could pivot in late 2024, concurrently marketing Goldman's asset base up. Thus, conventional measures suggest the bank's stock is relatively undervalued."", ""Goldman Sachs' dividend is compelling. Its trailing dividend yield of 2.7% is above the U.S.'s target inflation rate, suggesting it possesses the latitude to phase out inflationary risk on a pre-tax basis. Although an investor holding assets in a taxable account will experience lower post-tax dividend earnings, Goldman's dividend still provides solid income."", ""Goldman Sachs is looking good from a risk-based vantage point. The bank's Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 14.5% standardized and 14.9% advanced is well above industry requirements. Capital adequacy is critical when assessing a bank because it shows how well it is covered against adverse market events. Goldman's data is solid, likely providing most market participants with confidence."", 'Source: Goldman Sachs', ""Goldman Sachs' impressive run looks set to continue as its salient variables align toward additional growth. Moreover, Goldman Sachs' risk-based measures are on solid ground, while key metrics suggest its stock is undervalued on a relative basis."", 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

No one can fully predict the likelihood of this happening, and yet for some, it may not be an unlikely development. However, this January, CEOs from major big banks made statements highlighting their hopes for the financial sector in 2024, particularly for big banks, in the event of a Federal Reserve ""pivot"" on their interest rate hikes.', 'On January 20, CNBC\'s ""Power Lunch"" highlighted some statements made by several big bank CEOs on this matter.

I do think there\'s a reasonable possibility of some interest rate cuts and some easing. But it\'s really gonna be dependent on what the data says and how the economy transmits through the year.""', ""Morgan Stanley's (NYSE:MS) CEO, Ted Pick, also made a few comments on the subject:"", '""I do think we are probably past peak inflation. What\'s interesting though is that it is not inconceivable that we have to go faster, i.e., 50 basis points, if you sort of price that as 5% or 10%.""', 'Huntington Bancshares CEO, Steve Steinour, joined CNBC\'s ""Power Lunch"" on January 20 to discuss the above as well. On the impact of rate cuts on the financial sector, Steinour made the following comments:', '""If it\'s three or four cuts, it\'s helpful. If it\'s six or seven, that might imply a soft economy and that would not be helpful to us or anyone else. But we model it both ways, and in either direction, we\'ve got a very tight net interest margin - part of that through hedging.""', ""These observations brought Steinour to several conclusions, the most important one being that in the light of a Fed pivot, big banks will gain confidence in loaning to the general public. Generally speaking, Steinour believes that business is good in the banking sector so far this year. He noted that on multiple indicator fronts, including housing prices, things are continuing to look good, the consumer is still seen to be reasonably strong, and businesses are continuing to have a good year. The Federal Reserve's rate pivot in this atmosphere is thus considered to be helpful."", 'Considering these observations, investors in the financial sector can expect financial stocks, including big bank stocks, to have a strong start to the year.

Over time, these investments have helped American Express build its brand and attract more lucrative, high-spending card customers.

The company's brand is synonymous with high-quality wealth management and asset servicing, which has helped it cultivate a loyal customer base. This brand strength is reflected in the company's substantial assets under management and custody, which serve as a testament to client trust and satisfaction. Moreover, Northern Trust's strategic focus on recurring, scalable sources of fee-based income demonstrates its ability to generate stable revenue streams, further solidifying its market position."", ""Financial Stability: Northern Trust's conservative balance sheet is a significant strength, providing resilience in the face of economic fluctuations.

In fact, the company's global production network makes it fairly immune to strikes and other filming slowdowns in any particular place."", ""That was my hypothesis. Surely, Netflix's current schedule must be packed to the gills with foreign productions, a few months after the Writers' Guild and Screen Actors' Guild ended their respective strikes. Right?"", ""Well, a hypothesis without data is like a movie without actors -- just some hot air blowing across an empty screen. On the other hand, I don't have access to tons of data and a huge staff ready to mine insights in that hypothetical trove of information. So I settled for the next best thing, spending an hour or so with the best publicly available info I could find."", ""More specifically, I looked into how many of the titles on Netflix's current top-10 lists of movies and shows are true originals, and what portion of those names was produced abroad. Then I did the same for the year-ago versions of the same lists."", ""The results weren't exactly what I expected, but I do think they support my hypothesis just fine."", 'Shows are more important to Netflix than movies. Serial content keeps viewers engaged longer, whether they binge-watch or go through the material more slowly. The top-rated streaming movie in the latest available ranking from Nielsen Media only ranks seventh overall, nestled within nine streaming series.', ""So I wasn't surprised to see 10 true Netflix originals in today's ranking of the 10 most popular shows. There are no licensed titles from other production companies here, and no rehashed hits from yesteryear. Sure, you'll find a few new seasons of long-running shows such as Formula 1: Drive to Survive and Love Is Blind, not to mention the unique Screen Actors Guild Awards show, which Netflix started live-streaming in 2023. But it's all fresh Netflix original content, all the time."", 'Furthermore, only three of the leading shows today were produced on American soil, and that includes the SAG Awards. Avatar: The Last Airbender and Resident Alien were filmed in Canada. One Day and Can I Tell You a Secret? are British productions. Warrior takes place in San Francisco but the filming actually happens in Cape Town, South Africa. Formula 1 jumps between various race tracks and team headquarters around the world, and The Tourist is covered in thick layers of Australian dust.', ""The three American titles are an awards show, a single stand-up comedy special, and a romance-themed reality show. Those reality shows are more scripted than they look, but I'm still not talking about heavy-hitting scripted drama with an ensemble cast of card-carrying Actors' Guild members."", ""Here's the thing, though -- the post-strike situation really wasn't very different from the 2023 version of the same week. That list showed two titles licensed from other studios and six Netflix originals filmed overseas. In other words, the company didn't need to change its publishing strategy by much. Most of the hit shows were filmed far away from Hollywood's sound stages anyway."", ""Mind you, Netflix tends to dominate the Nielsen ratings with or without the influence of Hollywood strikes. Nobody outspends Netflix in terms of production budgets, and the company has a reputation for working well with independent creators. That's the real secret sauce behind Netflix's ratings success."", ""But it sure doesn't hurt to have a uniquely flexible production network with hit-making nodes in places like South Korea (Squid Game, Extraordinary Attorney Woo), Spain (Money Heist, Elite), and Canada (Anne With an E, Kim's Convenience). It gives the company the option to adjust production schedules based on shifting costs, available talent, and the global zeitgeist. And while management was initially surprised to see how well local productions traveled around the world, border-crossing hits are par for the course now."", ""So international production is just one more competitive advantage in Netflix's bulging toolbox. There are many chapters left to read in this worldwide growth story, and Netflix remains my largest stock holding in 2024."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Netflix right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Netflix, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Netflix wasn’t one of them.

While retail gasoline prices reached an all-time high June 14, 2022, both in California and at the federal level, the figure for the state was $4.578 higher per gallon at $6.438 compared to the national average of $5.016 a gallon, OPIS said.', 'Governor Gavin Newsom responded by imposing maximum refining margins with penalties for violations. A senate bill introduced 2022 to amend California’s Public Resources Code claims gasoline prices stayed high despite crude prices falling and levies staying put; Democrat Newsom signed it into law March 28, 2023. The so-called anti-price gouging law took effect June 26, 2023.', 'On the other hand the industry has been resisting regulatory control of fuel prices insisting they should be determined by market forces. In a statement opposing a similar proposal at the federal level, American Petroleum Institute vice-president for federal relations Lem Smith said May 18, 2022, “Prices at the pump currently reflect\xa0–\xa0to name a few factors\xa0–\xa0workforce and supply-chain challenges, increasing demand post-pandemic, and lagging supply due to government policy”.', 'Smith said to hold down prices, “Washington policymakers should consider policies that would foster additional investment and bring on new energy supplies, which the U.S. and our allies abroad are desperate to secure now and over the long-term”.', 'While OPIS also cited declining gasoline production in California as one of the contributing factors to high prices of the fuel in the state, it said it “found that many of those causes stem from the unique nature of the state’s gasoline market”.', 'Blending Specifications', 'Not all refineries in California and other West Coast states are capable of producing the gasoline sold in California’s spot markets especially during spring and summer, when the state government requires lower Reid Vapor Pressure, the report said. California’s RVP standards aim to minimize fuel emissions; lower RVP means lesser evaporative emissions.', 'The unfinished gasoline called California reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygenate blending (CARBOB), which is blended with ethanol at rack terminals for transport to retail stations, “can be a costly and complex fuel to produce”, OPIS said.', '“With limited options to source the boutique fuel blend from other U.S. refineries, California suppliers are often forced to rely more heavily on imports for gasoline components that can be blended to meet the most environmentally friendly summer RVP specifications in the nation”, the report stated.', 'Lack of Pipeline Links', 'Gasoline from the Gulf Coast, the country’s biggest refining region, can be sent via pipelines to the Midwest and East Coast. While some refineries in the Gulf Coast produce CARBOB, the West Coast lacks the pipeline network, the report said.', '“Furthermore, in 2023, those challenges included restrictions on passage through the drought-ravaged Panama Canal”, it noted.', 'Moreover, while California has the Kinder Morgan pipeline system to transport gasoline from Los Angeles and San Francisco, there is no pipeline link between these two points of origin and no connection in place to carry fuel from the Gulf Coast to California, the report said.', 'Refinery Consolidation', 'Also to blame for high prices is falling gasoline production as refineries consolidated or came under the control of fewer companies, reducing spot trade liquidity, OPIS said. There were 14 refineries in the state at the start of 2023, from 40 two decades ago, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Capacity dropped to 1.8 million barrels per stream day in 2023 from 2.5 million in 1983, based on data on the EIA website.', 'Import Reliance', 'Take control of your future.Search THOUSANDS of Oil & Gas jobs on Rigzone.com Search Now >> ', 'Besides decreasing supply at home, California buyers also face challenges importing. “Fixing gasoline cargoes for import to the West Coast is a multiweek endeavor and the option only becomes available once pricing dynamics, known as the arbitrage, are favorable”, OPIS said.', 'When the West Coast faces a supply disruption in transport fuels, it is more likely to see prices increase both at the wholesale and retail level than the Gulf Coast and the East Coast, where alternative sources are readily available, according to an EIA report September 2015.', '“Additionally, the amount of crude oil produced within California has declined over time, while the amount of crude oil brought in from other countries has increased”, OPIS said. Foreign crude made up 59 percent or 527.8 million barrels of the state’s oil supply 2022, according to data from the California Energy Commission (CEC) website.', 'Regulatory Costs', 'While California has become a leader in energy transition policy in the U.S., that has come with more costs for fossil fuel producers, which pass the burden to consumers, according to the report.', 'One such policy is the state’s Low-Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS). Companies may spend to obtain carbon credits to offset emissions, besides having to account for costs directly associated with LCFS compliance. Compliance costs for CARB reformulated gasoline, or CARBOB blended with ethanol, sold at the wholesale rack level rose from around 10 cents per gallon 2015 to over 30 cents by the fourth quarter of 2023, OPIS said. “An analysis of OPIS data reveals that the spread between West Coast crude oil prices, gasoline spot prices, and rack and retail fuel prices widened further since 2015\xa0–\xa0the year when transportation fuels sellers at the wholesale rack were required to comply with cap-and-trade regulations”, it added.', 'The state has also increased its gasoline tax to 58 cents per gallon since July 1, 2023, as part of a legislative amendment adding inflation adjustments to the tax annually. According to CEC estimates as of December 11, taxes and fees added $1.386 to the price of each gallon of gasoline sold in California.', 'Spot Volatility', 'Despite spikes in 2022 and 2023, prices at the pump do not appear to have become more volatile, OPIS noted. Retail gasoline price volatility in California from 2006 to 2014 was 21.23 percent while that of 2015–23 was 20.53 percent, it pointed out.', '“However, a comparison of spot price volatility indicates that between 2006 and 2014, Los Angeles CARBOB spot price volatility was at 129.9 percent, compared to a 2015-2023 value of 206.4 percent, showing a substantial increase in volatility at the spot level”, OPIS wrote. “Likewise, San Francisco CARBOB spot price volatility was 134 percent between 2006 and 2014 and increased to 181.5 percent between 2015-2023”.', 'OPIS attributed the spot volatility to declining participation in California’s spot markets. “In this environment, spot prices rise quickly, but they also fall quickly, a trend that is not mirrored at the retail level, with its steadier pricing”, it explained.', 'Weak Competition from Unbranded Retailers', 'OPIS went on to cite an analysis made by Severin Borenstein, faculty director of the Energy Institute at the University of California Berkeley’s Haas School of Business, that found a disproportionately higher number of gasoline stations operated by oil companies in California. Oil producers owning pumps have “tremendous” control over their downstream prices, Borenstein told a CEC hearing November 29, 2022.', '“California has a disproportionate share of gasoline, far higher than the rest of the country, going through branded stations”, Borenstein told the hearing, accessible on the CEC YouTube channel. These branded stations “have a much higher differential” than unbranded stations in California, compared to other parts of the U.S., 23 cents versus seven cents in 2018, the panelist said.', 'Anti-Price Gouging Law', 'The state government has sought to rein in price control by oil companies through the California Gas Price Gouging and Transparency Law. However, OPIS said, “It is not yet clear whether the new law will be effective in keeping a lid on fuel prices at the retail level, given the various factors behind retail prices in the region, as well as challenges with finding benchmarks to measure profitability”.', 'To contact the author, email jov.onsat@rigzone.com', 'More From Rigzone.com, The Leading Energy Platform:', 'PetroChina Posts Higher Annual Profit on Higher Production', 'UK Oil Regulator Publishes New Emissions Reduction Plan', 'US, SKorea Launch Task Force to Stop Illicit Refined Oil Flows into NKorea', 'Macquarie Strategists Expect Brent Oil Price to Grind Higher', '>> Find the latest oil and gas jobs on Rigzone.com <<']"

You can skip our detailed analysis on the most formidable and well-trained units a country can boast and head over directly to the 5 Countries with the Best Military Special Forces in the World.', 'The concept of special forces varies among different countries. While some view them as elite soldiers of the military, others consider the forces as special units of the armed forces tasked to perform specialized operations. Irrespective of how their roles are interpreted, the special forces are made up of the finest soldiers recruited from across the country.', 'What makes these soldiers special is their level of training and personality traits such as strong mentality and bravery. They are also equipped with state-of-the-art military hardware that allows them to dominate the battlefield and overcome challenging scenarios that come in their way. For instance, according to an analysis on Business Insider, weapons and gear the US military special forces head to the field with include assault rifles such as the M4A1 and MK18, the MK46 and MK48 machine guns, as well as other vital equipment like night-vision goggles, first aid kits, GPS devices, ballistic helmets, and belts. It is common for these troops to carry grenade launchers and anti-tank missiles as well if they need to.', 'The FGM-148 Javelin anti-tank missile, jointly developed by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) and RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX), had been deployed extensively by the United States in its combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. The American forces had experienced over 5,000 engagements with this weapon system during the war in these two countries, as noted by defense news website, Army Technology.', 'More than 45,000 units of these portable and platform-employed anti tank missiles had been produced until 2019 by these companies since its first launch in 1996. While RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) builds the command launch unit (CLU), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) shoulders the responsibility of assembling the missile itself.', 'Javelin is being widely used by the Ukrainian military as well to repulse Russian invasion of their country. According to a report, as of late August 2023, the US had provided over 10,000 Javelin anti-tank missiles to Kyiv, which has helped Ukraine in keeping Russia at bay from the capital. Owing to the demand for this weapon, both Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) and RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) have been taking measures to increase Javelin production from 2,000 units to 3,500 per year.', 'On the other hand, the Remington Modular Sniper Rifle (MSR) is a key weapon in the Delta Force arsenal that is enhancing the operational effectiveness of the elite group. Launched to enter service in 2013, the MSR has a firing range of 4,920 feet and a rate of 12 shots per minute. The sniper has also received acclaim from defense experts for its modularity that allows users customizable configurations of the equipment. In 2013, each unit cost around $15,000, according to a report.', 'Moreover, large defense sector corporations also offer tactical and strategic support to the special forces. General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD)’s information technology unit in 2016 was awarded a contract to provide professional support services to the American special operation forces in carrying out their global missions. Under the agreement, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) was to provide infinite delivery of services for an indefinite time period, with a maximum ceiling of $900 million over five years. General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) is the sixth largest defense contractor in the world, and posted its highest-ever revenue of $42.3 billion last year.

For instance, if a country ranked first, it received a score of 1 (8/8); if it was third, it received 0.75 (6/8). For the remaining two sources, we counted the number of times a military special forces group was mentioned on these websites and assigned a score of 1 for each time they received a mention. Finally all scores were aggregated to get an overall score. Countries with the best military forces in the world are ranked in ascending order of their overall scores.

These measurements are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that NRG’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.', 'EBITDA represents net income before interest expense (including gain/loss on debt extinguishment), income taxes, depreciation and amortization, asset retirement obligation expenses, contract amortization consisting of amortization of power and fuel contracts and amortization of emission allowances. EBITDA is presented because NRG considers it an important supplemental measure of its performance and believes debt-holders frequently use EBITDA to analyze operating performance and debt service capacity. EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:', 'EBITDA does not reflect cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures, or contractual commitments;', 'EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs;', 'EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on debt or cash income tax payments;', 'Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and', 'Other companies in this industry may calculate EBITDA differently than NRG does, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.', 'Because of these limitations, EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to use to invest in the growth of NRG’s business. NRG compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA only supplementally. See the statements of cash flow included in the financial statements that are a part of this news release.', 'Adjusted EBITDA is presented as a further supplemental measure of operating performance. As NRG defines it, Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA excluding the impact of stock-based compensation, amortization of customer acquisition costs (primarily amortized commissions), impairment losses, deactivation costs, gains or losses on sales, dispositions or retirements of assets, any mark-to-market gains or losses from forward position of economic hedges, adjustments to exclude the Adjusted EBITDA related to the non-controlling interest, gains or losses on the repurchase, modification or extinguishment of debt, the impact of restructuring and any extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring items, plus adjustments to reflect the Adjusted EBITDA from our unconsolidated investments. The reader is encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons NRG considers it appropriate for supplemental analysis. As an analytical tool, Adjusted EBITDA is subject to all of the limitations applicable to EBITDA. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, the reader should be aware that in the future NRG may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this news release.', ""Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and other users of NRG's financial statements in evaluating its operating performance because it provides an additional tool to compare business performance across companies and across periods and adjusts for items that we do not consider indicative of NRG’s future operating performance. This measure is widely used by debt-holders to analyze operating performance and debt service capacity and by equity investors to measure our operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis and to readily view operating trends, as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations, and for evaluating actual results against such expectations, and in communications with NRG's Board of Directors, shareholders, creditors, analysts and investors concerning its financial performance."", 'Adjusted Cash provided by operating activities is a non-GAAP measure NRG provides to show cash provided/(used) by operating activities with the reclassification of net payments of derivative contracts acquired in business combinations from financing to operating cash flow, as well as the add back of merger, integration, related restructuring costs, changes in the nuclear decommissioning trust liability, and the impact of extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring items. The Company provides the reader with this alternative view of Cash provided/(used) by operating activities because the cash settlement of these derivative contracts materially impact operating revenues and cost of sales, while GAAP requires NRG to treat them as if there was a financing activity associated with the contracts as of the acquisition dates. The Company adds back merger, integration related restructuring costs as they are one time and unique in nature and do not reflect ongoing Cash Flows from Operating Activities and they are fully disclosed to investors. The company excludes changes in the nuclear decommissioning trust liability as these amounts are offset by changes in the decommissioning fund shown in Cash Flows from Investing Activities.', 'Free Cash Flow before Growth Investments is Adjusted Cash provided by operating activities less maintenance and environmental capital expenditures, net of funding and insurance recoveries related to property, plant and equipment, dividends from preferred instruments treated as debt by ratings agencies, and distributions to non-controlling interests and is used by NRG predominantly as a forecasting tool to estimate cash available for debt reduction and other capital allocation alternatives. The reader is encouraged to evaluate each of these adjustments and the reasons NRG considers them appropriate for supplemental analysis. Because we have mandatory debt service requirements (and other non-discretionary expenditures) investors should not rely on Free Cash Flow before Growth Investments as a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures.', ""Free Cash Flow before Growth Investments is utilized by Management in making decisions regarding the allocation of capital. Free Cash Flow before Growth Investments is presented because the Company believes it is a useful tool for assessing the financial performance in the current period. In addition, NRG’s peers evaluate cash available for allocation in a similar manner and accordingly, it is a meaningful indicator for investors to benchmark NRG's performance against its peers. Free Cash Flow before Growth Investments is a performance measure and is not intended to represent Net Income/(Loss), Cash provided/(used) by operating activities (the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure), or liquidity and is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies."", 'View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240227811641/en/', 'Contacts', 'Media: Chevalier Gray832.763.3454', 'Investors: Brendan Mulhern609.524.4767']"

Why? It’s very simple. With this sector, you’re dealing with permanent relevance.', 'In the connected world we live in, going off grid won’t get you very far. Everything we do depends on power and other critical resources. Further, the top utility stocks are effectively entrenched in their key markets. Protected by significant barriers to entry – including steep regulations – legacy utility companies benefit from natural monopolies.', 'Second, as a direct result of this permanent relevance, utility stocks can be among the most reliable investments. Generally, you’re not going to get rich off the exposure. However, with many companies in the field offering passive income, stakeholders are able to sleep easier at night.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Finally, companies in this space enjoy some protection from inflation. Basically, they’re able to pass on cost increases to their customers. It’s cynical but it works. And with that, below are utility stocks to warm up your holdings this winter.', 'Source: zhao jiankang / Shutterstock.com', 'An integrated retail electricity and power generation company, Vistra (NYSE:VST) is the largest competitive power generator in the U.S., per its public profile. Featuring a diverse portfolio of natural gas, nuclear, and solar power, Vistra can serve its customers through multiple channels. In addition, the company features battery energy storage facilities.', 'Regarding the financial performance, Vistra is a bit of a mixed bag. For example, it doesn’t have the greatest stability in the balance sheet, as evidenced by its lowly Altman Z-Score. Also, its three-year revenue growth rate of 11.2% is slightly worse than the average of its main independent power production industry.', 'However, the company offers a return on equity (ROE) of nearly 27%, beating out almost 88% of its peers. Also, VST trades at a forward earnings multiple of 11.48X, below the sector median of 15.11X.', 'While it’s not the greatest dividend, Vistra offers a forward yield of 1.87%. And the payout ratio sits at 17.7%, indicating high confidence regarding yield sustainability. Therefore, it’s a top idea for utility stocks to buy.', 'Source: Pand P Studio / Shutterstock.com', 'An electricity power generator and wholesale marketing company, TransAlta (NYSE:TAC) operates 76 power plants in Canada, the U.S. and Australia. Its portfolio consists of wind turbines, hydroelectric facilities, natural gas and coal power generation plants. To be fair, TAC hasn’t enjoyed the greatest market performance among utility stocks. However, an argument can be made that the selloff has gone on too far.', 'Financially, TransAlta is again a mixed bag although it enjoys many positives. Yes, the balance sheet could use some work. Also, its three-year revenue growth rate of 9.8% is below average. However, the company enjoys a stellar ROE of 41.62%. Also, its return on invested capital (ROIC) clocks in at 10.5%.', 'Enticingly, TAC stock trades at only 4.36X trailing-year earnings. Also, a price-to-free-cash-flow (FCF) ratio of only 5.9X suggests that TransAlta could be a discount for the contrarian investor. Presently, the utility offers a forward yield of 2.55%.', 'Analysts also view TAC as a unanimous strong buy with an $11.64 price target. With such intense support, it’s one of the utility stocks to buy.', 'Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com', 'Based in Houston, Texas, NRG Energy (NYSE:NRG) is involved in energy generation and retail electricity. Its portfolio includes natural gas, coal, oil, nuclear, wind, and utility-scale power generation. As well, it offers distributed solar generation. Per its public profile, NRG serves over seven million retail customers in 24 states.', 'Unlike some other utility stocks, NRG has been flying over the past one-year period. Some of that enthusiasm may center on NRG benefitting from millennial migration trends. States like Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas offer lower costs of living than many other regions.', 'Unsurprisingly, NRG also prints a robust three-year revenue growth rate of 53.2%, beating out nearly 87% of its peers. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period stands at 24.5%. Even better, NRG stock trades at only 7.7X forward earnings, below the sector median 15.11X.', 'Regarding passive income, NRG carries a forward yield of 3.14%. As well, its payout ratio sits at a very sustainable 22.84%. Thus, it’s a worthy idea for reliable utility stocks to buy.', 'Source: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com', 'One of the top utility stocks firmly entrenched in the renewables space, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) features about 72 gigawatts (GW) of operating capacity, per its website. In addition, the company has earmarked about $85 billion to $95 billion in planned investments in U.S. infrastructure through 2025. As an intriguing food for thought, it claims a 98% reduction in its dependency on foreign oil since 2001.', 'To be fair, NEE stock hasn’t exactly been a great investment over the past 52 weeks. As The Wall Street Journal pointed out last year, investors pummeled NextEra with red ink due to lingering concerns about higher interest rates impacting the renewable energy space. Those questions aren’t completely addressed. However, as the economy slowly recovers, NEE could be an enticing long-term opportunity.', 'No, it’s not a great discount but a trailing-year earnings multiple of 15.8X is relatively low given its recent history. Also, over the past three years, NextEra posted a sales expansion rate of 14.8%. Analysts view shares as a consensus moderate buy with a $69.60 price target. Lastly, the company offers a forward yield of 3.61%.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'A public utility holding company, Alliant Energy (NASDAQ:LNT) provides power services in Iowa and Wisconsin. Fundamentally, Alliant may offer a geographic advantage. According to one report, the cost of living in Iowa comes out to $29,000 a year. That’s about 28% lower than the national average. And while Wisconsin is more expensive, it too is about 2% lower than the national average.', 'With so many people – especially young folks – being priced out of the real estate market, these and similar states offer attractive landing spots. Therefore, Alliant is placed right where the money will be. True, LNT hasn’t enjoyed the best start to the new year. And it’s down on a 52-week basis. But with a little patience, investors could be looking at a solid deal.', 'In full disclosure, Alliant’s financial print isn’t exactly sterling. However, where it does shine is in its strong margins and consistent annual profitability. As a result, it’s able to deliver a forward dividend yield of 3.97%. Also, it’s been consistently boosting its payout over the past 21 years. That makes it one of the top utility stocks to buy.', 'Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com', 'Headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, American Electric Power (NASDAQ:AEP) represents a major investor-owned electric utility in the U.S. Per its public profile, the company delivers electricity to more than five million customers in 11 states. Further, AEP ranks among the nation’s largest generators of electricity, owning nearly 38,000 megawatts of generating capacity.', 'As with other utility stocks, AEP benefits from a geographic advantage. Serving states such as Texas, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio, American Electric should benefit from the mobility of money. In other words, as people become priced out of their coastal metropolitan homes, they may start looking inward. Therefore, booming population trends could help fuel long-term growth.', 'In fairness, the balance sheet for American Electric is shaky. Moreover, its three-year revenue growth rate of 6.8% is somewhat pedestrian. However, it’s consistently profitable which shouldn’t be overlooked. And that fact helps support the forward yield of 4.33%. Also, the payout ratio is sustainable at 59%.', 'Analysts view shares as a moderate buy with an $86.86 price target. Overall, it has potential to be one of the top utility stocks.', 'Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com', 'Last but definitely not least we have Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK). An electric power and natural gas holding company, Duke may offer the best geographic advantage on this list of utility stocks. With a strong presence in the Carolinas, Duke should benefit from millennial migration trends. Consistently, North Carolina in particular sees significant interest among young people looking to escape ridiculous costs of living.', 'And because these are young folks, Duke enjoys a long-term tailwind. With many, many years of working and consuming resources left, the company should see improved financials. Yes, its 6% three-year revenue growth rate isn’t anything to write home about. Indeed, it’s worse than 60% of the competition. However, over time, this metric will likely see significant improvements.', 'In the meantime, investors can bank on the company’s consistent profitability. In turn, the black ink helps support Duke’s forward yield of 4.46%, which is above the utility sector’s average yield of 3.75%. Finally, DUK also commands 19 years of consecutive dividend increases, making it one of the most dependable utility stocks to buy.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

When examined over short timelines, it can be virtually impossible to accurately predict directional moves in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite. Over the previous four years, these three major stock indexes have oscillated between bear and bull markets in successive years."", 'But the beauty of putting your money to work on Wall Street is that it overwhelmingly favors the patient. Stocks have handily outpaced the annualized long-term returns of bonds, commodities, housing, and bank certificates of deposit (CDs). In other words, every notable downturn in the stock market has served as a buying opportunity for long-term-minded investors.', 'To make things even better, most online brokerages have completely done away with barriers that had previously kept retail investors on the sidelines. Specifically, a lot of brokers have eliminated minimum deposit requirements and commission fees for common stock trades completed on major U.S. exchanges. This means any amount of money -- even $100 -- can be the ideal amount to put to work.', ""If you have $100 that's ready to invest, and there's no question this cash won't be needed to pay bills or cover emergency expenses when they arise, the following three stocks stand out as no-brainer buys right now."", ""The first sensational stock that's begging to be bought with $100 right now is none other than America's largest electric utility by market cap, NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE)."", 'Investors usually flock to utility stocks because they offer low volatility and dividend yields that handily outpace the broader market. However, with the Federal Reserve aggressively raising rates over the past two years, Treasury bond yields have soared. With bonds presenting investors with a safer path to income, utility stocks like NextEra Energy paid the price. Thankfully, this weakness looks to be short-lived and represents the perfect opportunity to buy into a world-leading electric utility on the cheap.', 'To begin with, NextEra should benefit from the Federal Reserve pumping the brakes on rate hikes. As the yield curve normalizes and short-term yields fall, traditional utility stocks are likely to become attractive, once again, to income seekers.', ""Don't overlook the predictability of NextEra's operating cash flow, either. Virtually all homeowners and renters need electricity to power their appliances and/or HVAC systems. This leads to consistent demand for electricity year after year. Being able to accurately forecast its cash flow one or more years in advance is what's afforded management the confidence to undertake new projects, make acquisitions, and maintain average annual dividend growth of more than 10% over the past decade."", ""But the premier catalyst for NextEra Energy continues to be its industry-leading renewable energy portfolio. As of Sept. 30, the company had 70 gigawatts (GW) of operating capacity, 34 GW of which derived from renewables. The company's solar (6 GW) and wind (23 GW) capacity is higher than any other electric utility in the world."", 'Despite green-energy projects being costly, they provide NextEra with an easily identifiable competitive edge. Wind and solar are helping to demonstrably lower electricity generation costs, which, in turn, is translating into sustained high-single-digit adjusted earnings growth in an industry known for low-single-digit expansion.', 'Though NextEra stock has averaged a forward-year earnings multiple of 26 over the trailing-five-year period, opportunistic investors can grab shares right now for a forward-year earnings multiple of just 15.', ""A second phenomenal stock that's itching to be added to investors' portfolios with $100 right now is China's No. 2 e-commerce company, JD.com (NASDAQ: JD)."", ""JD.com has been in a nearly three-year funk, with shares of the company shedding about 80% of their value. Growing online competition in the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product, coupled with China's stringent COVID-19 mitigation measures, has put JD's operating performance under a microscope. But following its sizable pullback, JD appears to be a phenomenal bargain."", 'Similar to NextEra Energy, macro factors are working in JD\'s favor. Chinese regulators abandoned the country\'s controversial ""zero-COVID"" mitigation strategy in December 2022 following three years of unpredictable lockdowns. Though it\'s going to take time to work out various supply chain issues, China\'s economy should be able to find its stride sooner rather than later.', ""Compared to most developed countries, China's e-commerce segment is still in a relatively early growth stage. The country's burgeoning middle class is in the process of discovering and utilizing online ordering. Considering that China has historically grown at a faster pace than most developed countries, e-commerce should enjoy a long growth runway."", 'Despite playing second fiddle to Alibaba in e-commerce market share in China, JD offers a more favorable margin outlook. Whereas Alibaba has relied heavily on third-party sellers on its online marketplace, JD plays the part of a true direct-to-consumer (DTC) company. It handles the inventory and logistics of getting purchased products to consumers. Having more control over the DTC process should lead to a more robust operating margin.', ""In addition to its investments in artificial intelligence (AI), JD.com's plan to spin off its industrial and property units and list each segment on the Hong Kong stock exchange should help unlock shareholder value. Spinoffs typically make it easier for investors to understand how a complex business makes money."", ""JD.com is also historically cheap. Shares are currently valued at a little north of 7 times Wall Street's consensus earnings for 2024. That's the lowest earnings multiple for JD.com since it became a publicly traded company in 2014."", 'The third top-notch stock that makes for a no-brainer buy with $100 right now is social media company Pinterest (NYSE: PINS).', 'Pinterest has faced a bit of a double whammy over the past two years. First, its monthly active user (MAU) count began retracing after an initial surge during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Social media stocks are often superficially judged by their user growth. The other issue has been a challenging advertising environment, with a couple of predictive indicators and money-based metrics pointing to a U.S. recession.', 'With regard to the latter, time has a way of healing all wounds for ad-driven businesses. Even though recessions are an inevitable aspect of the economic cycle, downturns are short-lived. While no recession has surpassed 18 months in length since the end of World War II, there have been two periods of growth that reached the 10-year mark. Disproportionately long periods of growth allow ad-fueled businesses like Pinterest to thrive.', ""As for Pinterest's MAUs, the company is growing, once more. It closed out 2023 with an all-time high 498 million MAUs. The more eyeballs the company can attract, the likelier it is to be able to command impressive ad pricing power."", ""Despite a less-than-favorable advertising environment, Pinterest delivered low-single-digit average revenue per user (ARPU) growth globally in 2023, which came on the heels of low-double-digit ARPU growth in 2022. Regardless of what's happened with Pinterest's MAUs, it's had no trouble monetizing its user base."", ""What makes Pinterest a particularly attractive investment for growth seekers is that it's well protected from data-tracking changes implemented by app developers. The purpose of Pinterest's platform is for users to willingly and freely share what things, places, and services interest them. This vital info can be presented to merchants on a silver platter. It also serves as the logical jumping-off point for Pinterest to further edge its way into e-commerce in the years to come."", ""Lastly, the valuation makes sense. Wall Street's consensus calls for average annual earnings growth of 23% over the next five years. With a forward-year earnings multiple of 21, Pinterest represents a bona fide bargain."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy right now?', 'Before you buy stock in NextEra Energy, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and NextEra Energy wasn’t one of them.

Importantly, these companies must be financially built for the tough times."", 'Here are four fantastic industrial and energy stocks with rock-solid fundamentals, all trading near their 52-week lows today.', 'Energy giant ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) is a fixture in fossil fuels. The company explores for, extracts, refines, and sells oil and gas products. ExxonMobil enjoyed banner years in 2022 and 2023, but the stock is near its 52-week lows due to weakness in commodity prices. The price of oil has retreated from triple-digits to between $70 and $80 per barrel. While refining margins improve when oil prices drop, the exploration business is too big to offset falling oil prices.', ""The good news is that ExxonMobil is financially sound. The company has $31 billion in cash on its balance sheet against $41 billion in total debt, resulting in just $10 billion net debt. Investors can enjoy a solid 3.6% dividend yield at the current share price, and the company has raised its dividend for 41 consecutive years, showing it's endured multiple industry ups and downs."", ""Renewable energy company and electric utility NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) is the opposite of Exxon, playing a massive role in renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. Its renewable energy subsidiary is the world's largest, with projects across North America, and its utility business, Florida Power & Light, services over 12 million people in Florida. The company is also an outstanding dividend stock, with a 28-year streak of raises and a solid 3.6% yield today."", ""NextEra Energy's stock is struggling due to high interest rates. The company relies on borrowing money to fund investments in its business, and the higher rates make debt more expensive and potentially inhibit growth. However, rates tend to be cyclical, and the market expects rate cuts to come sometime this summer. Don't lose sight of NextEra's leading position in a growing renewable energy industry. Embrace the stock's valuation dropping from over 30 times earnings to 16 times."", 'Food is a core need of society, and Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE: ADM) plays a crucial role in feeding the world. The company processes and trades grains, seeds, oils, and other agricultural products worldwide. Its giant footprint spans 750 facilities and 42,000 employees, packing size and scale that make competing with Archer-Daniels-Midland no easy task. The stock is nearing Dividend King status, with 48 consecutive years of dividend increases.', 'The company is currently under investigation by the Department of Justice for account practices related to how it priced commodities traded within its business. Shares fell sharply after the news, putting the stock near its 52-week low. Investors should follow developments closely and respect the severity of potential violations. At the same time, Archer-Daniels-Midland has such a long track record that it seems unlikely that the severity of any alleged violations would ruin a long-term investment thesis. That makes this black-eye situation a potential buy-the-dip opportunity.', ""There is no food without farming, and Deere & Company (NYSE: DE) is arguably the flagship brand of machines used for commercial agriculture, construction, and forestry. The company's famous green paint marks every machine in service. Deere isn't just a machinery company, though. It's become a technology company, too. It provides farmers with machinery and software solutions to maximize efficiency and crop yields."", ""Right now, Deere is in a slump.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) so let's look a bit deeper."", ""For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for NextEra Energy, this is the formula:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.067 = US$10b ÷ (US$177b - US$28b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""Thus, NextEra Energy has an ROCE of 6.7%.  On its own that's a low return, but compared to the average of 4.6% generated by the Electric Utilities industry, it's much better."", ' Check out our latest analysis for NextEra Energy ', ""Above you can see how the current ROCE for NextEra Energy compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering NextEra Energy  for free."", ""We're glad to see that ROCE is heading in the right direction, even if it is still low at the moment. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 6.7%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 74%. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at NextEra Energy thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital."", ""To sum it up, NextEra Energy has proven it can reinvest in the business and generate higher returns on that capital employed, which is terrific. Considering the stock has delivered 31% to its stockholders over the last five years, it may be fair to think that investors aren't fully aware of the promising trends yet. So with that in mind, we think the stock deserves further research."", ""One more thing: We've identified   3 warning signs  with NextEra Energy (at least 1 which is significant)  , and understanding these would certainly be useful."", ""While NextEra Energy isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets."", 'Have feedback on this article?

This significant 15.6-kilometer rapid transit project aims to enhance accessibility and cut travel time for commuters.Under the PTUS contract, this renowned infrastructure consulting firm’s responsibilities encompass designing three kilometers of twin tunnels beneath Pape Avenue, two underground stations, emergency exit and service buildings, and a crucial crossover section. The project, anticipated to generate numerous job opportunities annually during construction, will substantially benefit more than 227,500 Toronto residents by providing convenient access to Ontario Line stations.AECOM's expertise in tunneling and transit design positions the company advantageously for large-scale projects like this. Through collaboration with Metrolinx, AECOM aims to deliver a sustainable transit solution that not only offers reliable access but also mitigates traffic congestion and reduces environmental impact.The PTUS contract, executed under a Development and Master Construction Agreement with Metrolinx, adopts a multi-stage design process facilitating a collaborative approach between the stakeholders.

To skip our detailed analysis of the financial sector, you can go directly to see 5 Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.', 'The financial sector went through a good amount of volatility last year, and many are now beginning to wonder whether the volatility will continue in 2024. No one can fully predict the likelihood of this happening, and yet for some, it may not be an unlikely development. However, this January, CEOs from major big banks made statements highlighting their hopes for the financial sector in 2024, particularly for big banks, in the event of a Federal Reserve ""pivot"" on their interest rate hikes.', 'On January 20, CNBC\'s ""Power Lunch"" highlighted some statements made by several big bank CEOs on this matter. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\'s (NYSE:GS) CEO, David Solomon, made the following comments:', '""It\'s hard for me to see the market\'s view of seven cuts this year. I do think there\'s a reasonable possibility of some interest rate cuts and some easing. But it\'s really gonna be dependent on what the data says and how the economy transmits through the year.""', ""Morgan Stanley's (NYSE:MS) CEO, Ted Pick, also made a few comments on the subject:"", '""I do think we are probably past peak inflation. What\'s interesting though is that it is not inconceivable that we have to go faster, i.e., 50 basis points, if you sort of price that as 5% or 10%.""', 'Huntington Bancshares CEO, Steve Steinour, joined CNBC\'s ""Power Lunch"" on January 20 to discuss the above as well. On the impact of rate cuts on the financial sector, Steinour made the following comments:', '""If it\'s three or four cuts, it\'s helpful. If it\'s six or seven, that might imply a soft economy and that would not be helpful to us or anyone else. But we model it both ways, and in either direction, we\'ve got a very tight net interest margin - part of that through hedging.""', ""These observations brought Steinour to several conclusions, the most important one being that in the light of a Fed pivot, big banks will gain confidence in loaning to the general public. Generally speaking, Steinour believes that business is good in the banking sector so far this year. He noted that on multiple indicator fronts, including housing prices, things are continuing to look good, the consumer is still seen to be reasonably strong, and businesses are continuing to have a good year. The Federal Reserve's rate pivot in this atmosphere is thus considered to be helpful."", 'Considering these observations, investors in the financial sector can expect financial stocks, including big bank stocks, to have a strong start to the year.

While retail gasoline prices reached an all-time high June 14, 2022, both in California and at the federal level, the figure for the state was $4.578 higher per gallon at $6.438 compared to the national average of $5.016 a gallon, OPIS said.', 'Governor Gavin Newsom responded by imposing maximum refining margins with penalties for violations. A senate bill introduced 2022 to amend California’s Public Resources Code claims gasoline prices stayed high despite crude prices falling and levies staying put; Democrat Newsom signed it into law March 28, 2023. The so-called anti-price gouging law took effect June 26, 2023.', 'On the other hand the industry has been resisting regulatory control of fuel prices insisting they should be determined by market forces. In a statement opposing a similar proposal at the federal level, American Petroleum Institute vice-president for federal relations Lem Smith said May 18, 2022, “Prices at the pump currently reflect\xa0–\xa0to name a few factors\xa0–\xa0workforce and supply-chain challenges, increasing demand post-pandemic, and lagging supply due to government policy”.', 'Smith said to hold down prices, “Washington policymakers should consider policies that would foster additional investment and bring on new energy supplies, which the U.S. and our allies abroad are desperate to secure now and over the long-term”.', 'While OPIS also cited declining gasoline production in California as one of the contributing factors to high prices of the fuel in the state, it said it “found that many of those causes stem from the unique nature of the state’s gasoline market”.', 'Blending Specifications', 'Not all refineries in California and other West Coast states are capable of producing the gasoline sold in California’s spot markets especially during spring and summer, when the state government requires lower Reid Vapor Pressure, the report said. California’s RVP standards aim to minimize fuel emissions; lower RVP means lesser evaporative emissions.', 'The unfinished gasoline called California reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygenate blending (CARBOB), which is blended with ethanol at rack terminals for transport to retail stations, “can be a costly and complex fuel to produce”, OPIS said.', '“With limited options to source the boutique fuel blend from other U.S. refineries, California suppliers are often forced to rely more heavily on imports for gasoline components that can be blended to meet the most environmentally friendly summer RVP specifications in the nation”, the report stated.', 'Lack of Pipeline Links', 'Gasoline from the Gulf Coast, the country’s biggest refining region, can be sent via pipelines to the Midwest and East Coast. While some refineries in the Gulf Coast produce CARBOB, the West Coast lacks the pipeline network, the report said.', '“Furthermore, in 2023, those challenges included restrictions on passage through the drought-ravaged Panama Canal”, it noted.', 'Moreover, while California has the Kinder Morgan pipeline system to transport gasoline from Los Angeles and San Francisco, there is no pipeline link between these two points of origin and no connection in place to carry fuel from the Gulf Coast to California, the report said.', 'Refinery Consolidation', 'Also to blame for high prices is falling gasoline production as refineries consolidated or came under the control of fewer companies, reducing spot trade liquidity, OPIS said. There were 14 refineries in the state at the start of 2023, from 40 two decades ago, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Capacity dropped to 1.8 million barrels per stream day in 2023 from 2.5 million in 1983, based on data on the EIA website.', 'Import Reliance', 'Take control of your future.Search THOUSANDS of Oil & Gas jobs on Rigzone.com Search Now >> ', 'Besides decreasing supply at home, California buyers also face challenges importing. “Fixing gasoline cargoes for import to the West Coast is a multiweek endeavor and the option only becomes available once pricing dynamics, known as the arbitrage, are favorable”, OPIS said.', 'When the West Coast faces a supply disruption in transport fuels, it is more likely to see prices increase both at the wholesale and retail level than the Gulf Coast and the East Coast, where alternative sources are readily available, according to an EIA report September 2015.', '“Additionally, the amount of crude oil produced within California has declined over time, while the amount of crude oil brought in from other countries has increased”, OPIS said. Foreign crude made up 59 percent or 527.8 million barrels of the state’s oil supply 2022, according to data from the California Energy Commission (CEC) website.', 'Regulatory Costs', 'While California has become a leader in energy transition policy in the U.S., that has come with more costs for fossil fuel producers, which pass the burden to consumers, according to the report.', 'One such policy is the state’s Low-Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS). Companies may spend to obtain carbon credits to offset emissions, besides having to account for costs directly associated with LCFS compliance. Compliance costs for CARB reformulated gasoline, or CARBOB blended with ethanol, sold at the wholesale rack level rose from around 10 cents per gallon 2015 to over 30 cents by the fourth quarter of 2023, OPIS said. “An analysis of OPIS data reveals that the spread between West Coast crude oil prices, gasoline spot prices, and rack and retail fuel prices widened further since 2015\xa0–\xa0the year when transportation fuels sellers at the wholesale rack were required to comply with cap-and-trade regulations”, it added.', 'The state has also increased its gasoline tax to 58 cents per gallon since July 1, 2023, as part of a legislative amendment adding inflation adjustments to the tax annually. According to CEC estimates as of December 11, taxes and fees added $1.386 to the price of each gallon of gasoline sold in California.', 'Spot Volatility', 'Despite spikes in 2022 and 2023, prices at the pump do not appear to have become more volatile, OPIS noted. Retail gasoline price volatility in California from 2006 to 2014 was 21.23 percent while that of 2015–23 was 20.53 percent, it pointed out.', '“However, a comparison of spot price volatility indicates that between 2006 and 2014, Los Angeles CARBOB spot price volatility was at 129.9 percent, compared to a 2015-2023 value of 206.4 percent, showing a substantial increase in volatility at the spot level”, OPIS wrote. “Likewise, San Francisco CARBOB spot price volatility was 134 percent between 2006 and 2014 and increased to 181.5 percent between 2015-2023”.', 'OPIS attributed the spot volatility to declining participation in California’s spot markets. “In this environment, spot prices rise quickly, but they also fall quickly, a trend that is not mirrored at the retail level, with its steadier pricing”, it explained.', 'Weak Competition from Unbranded Retailers', 'OPIS went on to cite an analysis made by Severin Borenstein, faculty director of the Energy Institute at the University of California Berkeley’s Haas School of Business, that found a disproportionately higher number of gasoline stations operated by oil companies in California. Oil producers owning pumps have “tremendous” control over their downstream prices, Borenstein told a CEC hearing November 29, 2022.', '“California has a disproportionate share of gasoline, far higher than the rest of the country, going through branded stations”, Borenstein told the hearing, accessible on the CEC YouTube channel. These branded stations “have a much higher differential” than unbranded stations in California, compared to other parts of the U.S., 23 cents versus seven cents in 2018, the panelist said.', 'Anti-Price Gouging Law', 'The state government has sought to rein in price control by oil companies through the California Gas Price Gouging and Transparency Law. However, OPIS said, “It is not yet clear whether the new law will be effective in keeping a lid on fuel prices at the retail level, given the various factors behind retail prices in the region, as well as challenges with finding benchmarks to measure profitability”.', 'To contact the author, email jov.onsat@rigzone.com', 'More From Rigzone.com, The Leading Energy Platform:', 'PetroChina Posts Higher Annual Profit on Higher Production', 'UK Oil Regulator Publishes New Emissions Reduction Plan', 'US, SKorea Launch Task Force to Stop Illicit Refined Oil Flows into NKorea', 'Macquarie Strategists Expect Brent Oil Price to Grind Higher', '>> Find the latest oil and gas jobs on Rigzone.com <<']"

While some view them as elite soldiers of the military, others consider the forces as special units of the armed forces tasked to perform specialized operations. Irrespective of how their roles are interpreted, the special forces are made up of the finest soldiers recruited from across the country.', 'What makes these soldiers special is their level of training and personality traits such as strong mentality and bravery. They are also equipped with state-of-the-art military hardware that allows them to dominate the battlefield and overcome challenging scenarios that come in their way. For instance, according to an analysis on Business Insider, weapons and gear the US military special forces head to the field with include assault rifles such as the M4A1 and MK18, the MK46 and MK48 machine guns, as well as other vital equipment like night-vision goggles, first aid kits, GPS devices, ballistic helmets, and belts. It is common for these troops to carry grenade launchers and anti-tank missiles as well if they need to.', 'The FGM-148 Javelin anti-tank missile, jointly developed by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) and RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX), had been deployed extensively by the United States in its combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.

The company’s revenue growth is being driven by higher demand for drugs like Mounjaro, Verzenio, Jardiance Taltz and others.Lilly’s new FDA-approved tirzepatide medicines, diabetes drug Mounjaro and newly launched weight loss medicine, Zepbound, are expected to be key top-line drivers. Lilly has also launched some other new products recently like Omvoh and Jaypirca. These new products are expected to drive Lilly’s top line in 2024.Lilly is also making rapid pipeline progress in areas like obesity, diabetes and Alzheimer’s.

Given that the markets usually pay for the long-term financial health of a company, we wonder if the current momentum in the share price will keep up, given that the company's financials don't look very promising. Specifically, we decided to study Medtronic's  ROE in this article."", 'ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.', ' See our latest analysis for Medtronic ', 'The formula for ROE is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Medtronic is:', '8.1% = US$4.2b ÷ US$52b (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2024).', ""The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.08 in profit."", 'We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company\'s future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don\'t have the same features.', ""On the face of it, Medtronic's ROE is not much to talk about. We then compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to see that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 11%. Given the circumstances, the significant decline in net income by 2.6% seen by Medtronic over the last five years is not surprising. We believe that there also might be other aspects that are negatively influencing the company's earnings prospects. Such as - low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital."", ""That being said, we compared Medtronic's performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 14% in the same 5-year period."", ""Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is MDT fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know."", ""With a high three-year median payout ratio of 87% (implying that 13% of the profits are retained), most of Medtronic's profits are being paid to shareholders, which explains the company's shrinking earnings. The business is only left with a small pool of capital to reinvest - A vicious cycle that doesn't benefit the company in the long-run."", ""Additionally, Medtronic has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 52% over the next three years. The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 14% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio."", ""In total, we would have a hard think before deciding on any investment action concerning Medtronic. The company has seen a lack of earnings growth as a result of retaining very little profits and whatever little it does retain, is being reinvested at a very low rate of return.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John."", 'Jon Vander Ark', ""Thanks, Aaron. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The Republic team finished the year strong by executing our strategy designed to profitably grow the business. We outpaced expectations throughout the year and deliver results that exceeded our full year guidance. During 2023, we achieved revenue growth of 11%, including 5% from acquisitions, generated adjusted EBITDA growth of 13%, expanded adjusted EBITDA margin by 60 basis points, including margin expansion in the underlying business of 100 basis points, reported adjusted earnings per share of $5.61, and produced $1.99 billion of adjusted free cash flow.We continue to believe that investing in value-creating acquisitions to further expand our business is the best use of our free cash flow. We invested $1.8 billion in acquisitions in 2023, including transactions in both the recycling and waste and environmental solutions businesses. As part of our balanced approach to capital allocation, we returned $900 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The results we are generating are made possible by executing our strategy, supported by our differentiated capabilities. Regarding customers' zeal, our efforts to provide industry-leading service continues to drive sustained customer loyalty and organic growth in the business. Our customer retention rate remained high at over 94% and we continue to see favorable trends in our Net Promoter Score due to the value of our offerings and quality of our service delivery.We delivered outsized organic revenue growth during the fourth quarter with simultaneous increases in price and volume. Core price and related revenue was 8.8% and average yield on related revenue was 7.7%. Organic volume growth on related revenue was 40 basis points. Turning to our digital capabilities. The team continued to advance the implementation of digital tools that improve the experience for both customers and employees. Development of our new asset management system is underway, which is expected to increase maintenance technician productivity and enhanced warranty recovery. We expect to begin utilizing the new system in late 2024. The continued operational enhancements supported by our RISE digital operations platform are expected to drive additional productivity through improved route optimization and safety performance and provide more predictable service delivery to our customers. We anticipate the RISE platform will drive approximately $100 million of total annual earnings contribution, of which approximately $65 million has been realized to date. We continue to implement advanced technology on recycling and waste collection routes. Our platform utilizes cameras to identify overfill containers and contamination in recycling containers. This technology is reducing contamination and driving incremental revenue. Moving on to sustainability. We believe that our sustainability innovation investments in plastic circularity and renewable natural gas are a platform for profitable growth. Development of our polymer centers and Blue Polymers joint venture facilities remain on track. We are finalizing commissioning at our Las Vegas polymer center this week. Delivery of plastic flake to our offtake partners is expected in the coming weeks. Construction is progressing on our Indianapolis polymer center. This development will be co-located with Blue Polymers production facility and construction at the site is expected to be completed in late 2024. The renewable gas projects being codeveloped with our partners continue to advance. Five projects came online in 2023, and we expect at least 8 additional projects to be completed in 2024. Efforts to support decarbonization, including our industry-leading commitment to fleet electrification. We currently have 11 electric collection vehicles in operation. We expect more than 50 additional EVs will be added to our recycling and waste collection fleet in 2024. We have 6 facilities with commercial EV charging infrastructure with more than 40 additional sites in varying stages of development. As part of our approach to sustainability, we continue to strive to be a workplace with the best people from all backgrounds who wants to work. In 2023, employee engagement improved to a score of 86% with 90% -- 99% of employees participating in the survey. Turnover rates continued to churn lower with full year turnover improving 400 basis points compared to the prior year. As a result, we are better staffed to optimize our operations and capitalize on growth opportunities in the market.Our comprehensive sustainability performance continues to be widely recognized as Republic Services was deemed to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the eighth consecutive year. Our 2023 results clearly demonstrate our ability to create sustainable value. And our ongoing investments strengthen the foundation from which we will continue to grow our business.With respect to 2024, we expect to deliver outsized profitable growth while continuing to make investments in the business to drive lasting value creation. More specifically, we expect full year revenue in a range of $16.1 billion to $16.2 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in a range of $4.825 billion to $4.875 billion. We expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.94 to $6, generate adjusted free cash flow in a range of $2.1 billion to $2.15 billion. Our pipeline supports continued acquisition activity in both recycling and waste and environmental solutions. We are targeting at least $500 million of investment in value-creating acquisitions in 2024. Our 2024 financial guidance includes the rollover contribution from acquisitions that closed in 2023.I will now turn the call over to Brian, who will provide details on the quarter and year."", 'Brian M. DelGhiaccio', 'Thanks, Jon. Core price on total revenue was 7.2% in the fourth quarter. Core price unrelated revenue was 8.8%, which included open market pricing of 10.6% and restricted pricing of 6%. The components of core price on related revenue included small container of 12.3%, large container of 8.6% and residential of 8.2%.Average yield on total revenue was 6.3% and average yield on related revenue was 7.7%. In 2024, we expect average yield on total revenue in a range of 5.5% to 6%. We expect average yield on related revenue in a range of 6.5% to 7%. Yield is expected to step down sequentially during 2024 due to relatively lower index-based pricing and certain fees implemented throughout 2023, which begin to anniversary.Fourth quarter volume on total revenue increased 30 basis points and volume on related revenue increased 40 basis points. The components of volume on related revenue included an increase in small container of 20 basis points and an increase in landfill of 7.4%. Landfill was primarily driven by a 12.7% increase in special waste revenue. Volume growth was partially offset by a decrease in large container of 1.4% and a decrease in landfill C&D volume of 2.1%, primarily due to a slowdown in construction-related activity. In 2024, we expect organic volume growth in a range of flat to positive 50 basis points.Moving on to recycling. Commodity prices were $131 per ton during the fourth quarter. This compared to $88 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales increased revenue by 50 basis points during the quarter. 2023 full year commodity prices were $117 per ton. This compared to $170 per ton in the prior year. Current commodity prices are approximately $135 per ton, which is the baseline used in our 2024 guidance.Now turning to our environmental solutions business. Fourth quarter environmental solutions revenue was flat compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the environmental solutions business was 19.7%, an increase of 250 basis points compared to the prior year. Fourth quarter total company adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 260 basis points to 29.9%, which was driven by margin expansion in the underlying business of 230 basis points. Other changes in margin performance during the quarter included a 30 basis point increase from recycled commodity prices and a 20 basis point increase from net fuel, which was partially offset by a 20 basis point decrease from acquisitions. Our full year adjusted EBITDA margin was 29.7%, which represents margin expansion of 60 basis points compared to the prior year. In 2024, we expect total company adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 30%. We expect to more than overcome a 30 basis point headwind from acquisitions. Depreciation, amortization and accretion was 10.7% of revenue in 2023 and is expected to be approximately 11% of revenue in 2024. Full year 2023 adjusted free cash flow was $1.99 billion, an increase of 14% compared to the prior year. This was driven by EBITDA growth in the business and the positive contribution from changes in working capital. Total debt at the end of the year was $13 billion and total liquidity was $2.7 billion. Our leverage ratio at the end of the year was 2.9x. We expect net interest expense of approximately $545 million in 2024. With respect to taxes, our combined tax rate and impact from equity investments in renewable energy resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 25.1% during the fourth quarter and 24.8% for the full year. We expect an equivalent tax impact of approximately 26% in 2024 made up of an adjusted tax rate of 20% and approximately $190 million of noncash charges from equity investments in renewable energy. The expected increase in the interest expense and taxes would result in a $0.20 EPS headwind in 2024. With that, operator, I would like to open the call to questions.', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.', 'Toni Michele Kaplan', 'I wanted to ask about margins. In the fourth quarter, I know you mentioned a couple of factors, the commodities and fuel costs. But maybe just talk about how margins were so far ahead of the guide and what factors could continue into 2024 that could provide upside to the guidance there.', 'Jon Vander Ark', ""Sure. Yes. [The] team had a really strong fourth quarter. Lots of things went in our favor, managed the middle -- the P&L well. There were some onetime opportunities both on MSW and a very strong special waste fourth quarter on that, that we felt good with. Weather was actually very positive in the fourth quarter, which has slipped here in the first quarter of the year, so I feel great about that. And then, listen, we've got a lot of momentum headed into '23. Some of the event-based work, you can't build a budget against that, right? You've got to look at that as a potential upside, which we're going to go after those opportunities. But oftentimes, an election year, some of those jobs end up pushing and rolling forward, so we're not going to build a plan based on that outsized performance that we got in Q4, but still looking at a very positive year in '24."", 'Brian M. DelGhiaccio', 'Yes. And Toni, we had mentioned all year long that we expected margin expansion to sequentially improve quarter-on-quarter. Ending the year with the highest level of margin expansion compared to the prior year. So that played out exactly as we thought. Now the margin expansion itself was a little bit stronger than we originally anticipated. But ending the year with that type of performance and the type of margin expansion in the -- over 200 basis points was in line with the way we thought it would end.', 'Toni Michele Kaplan', ""Perfect. Wanted to ask about environmental services. Maybe just talk about what you're seeing and the different pieces there. And I think it's a little bit flattish in the quarter. So does that turn around next year?"", 'Jon Vander Ark', ""Yes. Most of the flatness is based on the comp. We had a really, really strong Q4 and '22 that we were covering. Listen, there is some slowdown in parts of that business, so rig counts are down, and that's part of the opportunity in there. We've had a facility that we've shut down to turn around that we're going to reopen here in the middle of the year. So that'll provide some incremental lift, and that was closed in the fourth quarter. And then we continue to -- we'll trade price over volume where we need to. So we've turned out some less profitable customers on that and feel really good about the book and the pipeline going forward."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Kevin Chiang with CIBC.', 'Kevin Chiang', ""Congrats on a strong end of the year there. Maybe just on the 2024 guidance, the implied kind of 30, 40 basis points of margin expansion, reported margin expansion you're guiding to. Is the way to think about how that splits between solid waste and ES, is it pretty balanced between the 2? Or would you expect 1 to maybe outperform the other end as you look out into 2024 here?"", 'Brian M. DelGhiaccio', ""Yes. Look, overall, I would sit there and say that we expect margin expansion in both of the business types. We're expecting just as -- when you take a look in basis points, a little bit more on the ES side, the environmental solutions side, but it is still relatively balanced between the 2. Just given the sheer size of the recycling and waste business relative to the environmental solutions business, it will drive a majority of the overall expansion when you think about the enterprise taking this whole."", 'Kevin Chiang', ""That's helpful. And maybe just my follow-up question. Just looking at the -- your yield volume table that you provided in your disclosure. Just, I noticed the strong yield in residential volume's maybe a little bit worse than recent trend. Just wondering if you could provide some color in terms of what's happening there and if you're -- as you mentioned earlier, are you maybe being more purposeful in shedding maybe lower-quality volume to the benefit of yield in the fourth quarter?"", 'Jon Vander Ark', ""Yes. we're always purposeful in trading up price versus volume. I'd say in this quarter, there was a couple of contracts that went out to bid, that we bid a rate that we thought was going to cover our costs and give us a fair return. We lost those opportunities. And then in previous quarters, we've had some nice wins, right? And these things come in fits and spurts, so we didn't have anything in that quarter. That's really -- the combination of those 2 things drives the volume picture. On the pricing side, this is the manifestation of high CPI and the alternative indices over the last couple of years really flowing through our pricing, which is great to see. That's the challenged part of the yield story historically, and to see that number, we were really pleased with."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Brian Burgmeier with Citi.', 'Bryan Nicholas Burgmeier', ""Maybe just following up on Toni's question. I think margins have typically expanded kind of quarter-over-quarter from 4Q to 1Q. I imagine that'll be a little bit more flattish this year. Just if you can identify maybe some of the factors weighing 1Q margins or, more broadly, like, why historical seasonality might not apply."", 'Jon Vander Ark', ""Brian, what I would say is that when you talk about historical seasonality, I think you have to go back before just the last several years, kind of post pandemic. I think you have to look at a broader data set there. So when we came into this year, we said this year, we thought, was going to have what we would call a normal level of seasonality. And when you take a look at what that means, that would typically -- when you look at margin performance, you would have peak margin performance in Q2 and Q3 during those summer months where you're getting some more of those seasonal volumes, in particular, on the landfill side, followed by Q4. And then finally, the first quarter would seasonally be your lowest margin performance, and that's what we've seen for decades. And so we said that at the beginning of the year, that's kind of what played out. And that's, what I would say we would also expect going into '24, based on what we see right now. So we would expect a sequential step down in margin from Q4 to Q1. In part, you've got more winter months when you're dealing with the first quarter.As well as when you just think about some of the taxes, you have your highest burden from a labor perspective in the first quarter. And those tend to max out and then as you move through the balance of the year, again, some of those -- some more of those state and local taxes, then those basically reach their max in the first quarter.And we have weather, right? We had mild weather in Q4 of last year. We had pretty intense weather in January, where we've lost some -- certainly some hauls and some tons. Some of that will come back, but some of that will get pushed out through the remainder of the year. So that's what will lead to Q4 number that probably looks -- our Q1 number, that probably looks more flat than historically might have."", 'Bryan Nicholas Burgmeier', ""Got it. Got it. And then just following up on M&A, with the deals you completed in 4Q, did you provide a split -- rough split for how that is divided up between the 2 segments? And did you provide a rollover contribution to '24 revenue in guidance?"", 'Brian M. DelGhiaccio', ""Rollover contribution will be about 200 basis points. From deals closed in '23, that'll have a rollover impact into '24. Just on the split from a revenue perspective, it was about $200 million on the environmental solutions of the annualized revenue acquired in the fourth quarter and about $140 million on the recycling waste side."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets.', 'Walter Noel Spracklin', 'So I wanted to follow up on M&A here. A big year for you in terms of deals done, I think, $1.86 billion there acquired. And I was wondering if you could give us an update on, first of all, what the pipeline looks like going forward, particularly relative to such a large year this past year. And then second is in terms of integration, will you be focusing a bit more given how big the year was in 2023 on integration and perhaps assess or put a little bit on -- touch a little bit on how that integration is going? Or do you see room and capacity to continue at a fairly heady space -- pace here in terms of M&A for 2024?', 'Jon Vander Ark', ""Yes. Listen, we look at 2 things. Obviously, the strategic fit and the financial return on any type of deal, and we're going to stay disciplined on both of those things. Are we the natural owner, and does it meet our expectations in terms of cash on cash returns. And then we do think about our ability to absorb it. And listen, we have a lot of capacity across the enterprise. We wouldn't necessarily do a couple of big deals in the in the same part of the country at the same time because the local team does play a pretty strong role in that day-to-day integration activity. Last year was the product of our normal tuck-ins, which are -- we've done forever, and those are very value creating. It's hard to do those deals poorly because we've done it for so long. And then some nice kind of medium-sized deals. We built the plan, right, not anticipating that those medium-sized deals are going to be there. Not that we're not pursuing it, but you just don't know when they're going to move or when they're going to come. So that's predicated on a step-down in our expectation this year for what we've done. It's not because the pipeline is weaker. Pipeline is strong, but we never know exactly what we're going to close, and we're going to stay disciplined."", 'Walter Noel Spracklin', ""Got it. That's great color. And just for my follow-up, turning to recycling. I know your Las Vegas polymer center opened in December. Can you talk a bit about the build out on that -- on the polymer center? And I don't know if you've had enough time now to assess, but do you see this as a better investment than kind of EPR -- or not better, but how do you -- how does that compare to EPR projects in terms of the return profile of that one?"", 'Jon Vander Ark', ""Yes. We're very satisfied with both the execution and the return. We're pretty conservative in terms of our financial modeling, leaving ourselves room and we feel very good about the demand in the marketplace. We could have sold our Las Vegas 5x over at front. And the pricing expectations are ahead of what we modeled. So the returns are going to come in, again, ahead of our expectations on that front. And that's certainly given us confidence, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, to go to Indy, and then we're planning on at least 2 more across the country."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from John Mazzoni with Wells Fargo.', 'John Peter Bonner Mazzoni', ""Maybe just a quick one on pricing. Could you just remind us how the restricted book will layer through '24, especially with sort of the lag effects in CPI?"", 'Brian M. DelGhiaccio', ""Yes. One thing, as I mentioned with respect to the cadence from a pricing perspective in my prepared remarks, is we do expect a sequential step down in the level of pricing throughout the year, primarily due to the impact that, that index pricing will have. So again, we expect this to report the highest level of average yield in Q1 and the lowest level in Q4 with a step down in between. Just to give you a little bit of perspective, when you take a look at the 2 primary components that may make up our basket that are related to some sort of index, 1 being headline CPI and then the other being the alternative indices. And when you take a look at headline CPI, right, it saw its peak in June of '22, and has been stepping down sequentially since. Water sewer trash and garbage trash saw peak levels in August of '23 and have been stepping down since then. Now that said, the water sewer trash and garbage trash still remain at elevated levels. Water sewer trash, the recent print was 5.5% and garbage trash was 6.4. So we're still pretty pleased about the level, but it is going to sit there and step down just due to the math."", 'John Peter Bonner Mazzoni', ""Great. And maybe for a quick follow-up. Could you just talk to the strength in small container, especially with the 11.2% yield? It seems like that's kind of above the average. And any other thing you're seeing within that kind of end market and any other commentary around anything different that you've done compared to peers?"", 'Jon Vander Ark', ""Sure. Yes, we rolled out some new technology around AI, which helps us spot contamination and also helps us assess overages, when the containers are overfilled. And that certainly contributed to the small container performance. Again, underlying pricing was great, but that put it on top. And that's why we talked about our '24 number. We expect to anniversary that in the second half of the year, so that will come down a bit."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Michael Hoffman with Stifel.', 'Michael Edward Hoffman', ""I've always challenged for that Stifel, Stifel, Stifel, whatever. So free cash flow and the guide, it is at about 7% in the midpoint versus the top line's at 7.9% and EBITDA is at 9.1%. I'm presuming we've got higher interest expense and probably higher cash taxes, because you're not counting on bonus depreciation being retroactively reverted back to 100%. Is that how I think about the bridge between the growth rates through the P&L?"", 'Brian M. DelGhiaccio', ""That's correct, Michael. If you just take -- taxes alone, when you take a look at 2 components, so one, we are assuming that the current loss stays in place, which means bonus depreciation will sit there and have a further headwind '24 compared to '23, combined with the settlement we had with the IRS in '23, where we received $20 million of cash back to a matter that dates back to 2017.Combined, those 2 create a $45 million headwind in cash taxes. That alone is a 2.3% headwind to year-over-year growth on the free cash flow. So you just take taxes alone and you'd sit there and say you'd be kind of 9.5% growth in free cash flow were it not for the impact of taxes. Interest, to your point, would just be considered headwind."", 'Michael Edward Hoffman', ""All right. And that was what I was trying to get at is the underlying cash growth is there and you've got some timing issues related to what we just discussed. Okay. On margin…"", 'Brian M. DelGhiaccio', 'And Michael, to that point, from an underlying business perspective, the growth in free cash flow is double digit.', 'Michael Edward Hoffman', ""Right. Okay. That's, I think, important. And then on margins, I think there's another sort of message to potentially to be drawn out. So your pattern in your solid waste business, given the sheer scale of managing price costs, as you're being pretty ratably able to deliver all 30 basis points, so if the whole company is doing 30 and you've got an M&A headwind and, actually, environmental comes in as a nice add in ES, but it's probably pretty dilutive. So how do we think about that ES dilution? It's much better structurally ex that dilution is what I think, which..."", 'Brian M. DelGhiaccio', ""Just to give you the middle perspective, if you look across, right, both business types, we're expecting 30 basis points of dilution from acquisitions. And we would expect dilution, from an acquisition perspective in both recycling and waste and environmental solutions. If you're looking at the underlying business itself within ES, we're expecting over 100 basis points of margin expansion in the environmental solutions business due to the underlying business itself."", 'Michael Edward Hoffman', ""Right. And about 30 in solid waste and then a net in the total company dilution, but it's greater in ES than it is in solid waste. It's just 1 size of the deal relative to the base?"", 'Brian M. DelGhiaccio', ""That's correct."", 'Michael Edward Hoffman', ""Yes. Okay. I think that's important to draw that. You're still on that track of 25% or better margins at ES, ex acquisitions and the acquisitions will then contribute to that as you integrate them?"", 'Jon Vander Ark', 'Yes.', 'Operator', 'The next question is from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer & Company Inc.', 'Noah Duke Kaye', ""Can you talk to us about this new asset management system that you're putting in place? What are you functionally doing? And where does that ultimately show up in the P&L? Is it maintenance and repairs? What kind of savings are we talking about with this new the system?"", 'Jon Vander Ark', ""Yes. It's really with the RISE platform. Think about digitizing our operations, from our logistic operation all the way through our fleet and how our drivers operate every day. This brings this to the maintenance shop. And so now rather than moving paper around, right, when the driver does their vehicle condition report before they take off in the morning, that digitally flows and is recorded into the maintenance organization. So they're dealing with tablets as well. So they're getting out of the paper-based business. And a big driver of that -- there's a productivity benefit to that for sure, but then there's also the warranty recovery element of that. Because when you're chasing paper, that becomes a very manual process. When you could do this digitally, it allows you to quickly understand what warranty is available, are you fully claiming all the parts that are warranty-eligible and allowing us to get full recovery."", 'Brian M. DelGhiaccio', ""Yes. When you think about the linkage, so a couple of years ago, we started on our journey of modernizing our core systems, and that started with our general ledger and procurement systems. This is an extension of that. So the asset management system will be directly linked and integrated on a common platform with our procurement system. So now you can sit there and say, from the point of PO all the way to putting something on a truck, you can sit there and you can track that part. So to Jon's point on warranty management, this is something, before, we had to do very manually, which means that we had a lot of leakage in the system. Now we feel very confident that we're going to get every single portion of that warranty that we're entitled to."", 'Noah Duke Kaye', 'Very nice. Just a quick housekeeping one. You already detailed the expectations for yield-ins through 2024. But just picking up your comments around weather, tough volume comps for 1Q and you just mentioned the weather flipped to be a little bit of a drag here to start. We all felt that cold. So how do we think about kind of the volume trends Q-to-date and how that trends through the year?', 'Brian M. DelGhiaccio', ""Look, I mean, the good news, right, is that while January, we did experience quite a bit of weather. We've seen most of that volume return. Not a total recovery, but we saw what we would've expected in February so far to date. Look, we're guiding to flat to 50 basis point positive. Q1, may be kind of the low point of that because of the weather. But I would think of it relatively ratable, that type of cadence throughout the year."", 'Noah Duke Kaye', ""And in an environment where your yield is decelerating year-over-year at a pretty, pretty shallow step down, you can get the March expansion that you're looking for without a lot of volume contribution. So you let the volume of the upside to where margins can go. Is that the basic takeaway?"", 'Jon Vander Ark', 'Correct.', 'Operator', 'The next question is from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies.', 'Stephanie Lynn Benjamin Moore', ""I wanted to touch a bit on maybe the underlying macro environment, probably a decent follow-up to the prior question. You called out some weakness in the quarter on financials, C&D volumes. I don't think any of us would be really surprised to hear that. But maybe any other areas you might be seeing weakness or other levels of strength of the opposite? And then what is the kind of the underlying macro assumption embedded in the 2024 guidance?"", 'Jon Vander Ark', ""Yes. I think the picture is mixed. So again, we're planning on having a strong year. If you think about the direct things, we talked about weather, certainly housing, interest rates being high, mortgage rates being high, housing activity is certainly a byproduct -- or depressed housing activity is a byproduct to that. So we would have hoped for a quicker recovery there, both for our business and because we need more homes in the United States, but we think that'll be more delayed towards the later end of the year, so we're not planning a robust recovery on that front. And then if you think about the other macros, the manufacturing, I think, is a mixed picture. We see pockets where, while we're winning business, there are some service declines in certain subsectors of manufacturing, but other places, in terms of remediation projects and other things have been very, very strong. PFOS has been a nice contributor to the business in 2023, and we've got a good pipeline in 2024. And then the background, we have 2 wars going on, right, 1 in Israel, 1 in the doorstep of Europe. Credit card debt is high with consumers, so we have a cautious kind of macro perspective on that, but the underlying demand signals for our business are largely positive."", 'Stephanie Lynn Benjamin Moore', ""Great. No, that's helpful. And then you touched on this a little bit, but if you could kind of walk through kind of what you've seen from the cost inflation standpoint clearly getting better, but some of those clear headwinds that we saw through most of 2023, kind of how those are trending now to start 2024."", 'Jon Vander Ark', ""Yes, certainly stepping down operating labor, clearly stepping down year-over-year. Transportation is stepping down. Maintenance has been a little bit stickier and most of that is the fact that we're growing and we're driving a fleet that's aging just because the supply chain is still a little congested and we're not getting all the trucks that we wanted. And it's really been a 3-year phenomenon in that front. So we're going to catch up some in this year, but we're not going to fully catch up on that. And all that is when you're driving a 12-, 13-year-old truck, right, with its kind of a peak cycle in terms of its maintenance versus a new truck that has relatively high-warranty recovery, and so therefore, very low maintenance cost, that's going to show up in the underlying maintenance bucket. So that spend will be, we think, elevated throughout the year. We hope we do a little better, but we'll see."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.', 'Jerry David Revich', ""Yes, I would just love to continue the conversation on the cost side. I mean, really impressive in the quarter. Your cost per unit were up just 1% year-over-year. So I'm wondering where are you starting to see deflation. It sounds like the tailwind from better equipment availability is still in front of us, so I'm wondering what's gotten better for you folks already in the fourth quarter number.And then Brian, I'm wondering if you'd just put a finer point on the comments that you made about yield slowing over the course of the year on comps. Do you expect to exit the year with price cost spread still favorable fourth quarter versus fourth quarter?"", 'Brian M. DelGhiaccio', ""Yes. Yes, Jerry. So Jon mentioned one of them already. Our labor has continued to improve, right, really throughout the year. And in part, that's just due to a reduction in turnover, right, that we've seen. And so again, when you just take a look at the impact that turnover has, there's a hiring cost of bringing someone else, as well as there's a productivity impact. A newer driver just tends not to be as productive as those that have some tenure. And so we're starting to see, as the turnover rates have come down, we're seeing that kind of come through that labor line item, which has had a positive impact. So I would say that's where we've seen some of the biggest improvements. Together, we mentioned throughout the year, some of the impact that transportation cost it had. These were things where we had multiyear agreements, they came up for renewal in the second half of '22. And we said that we took some pretty big price increases and that they were going to comp out in the second half of '23 and we've certainly seen that. So I would say those are some of the tailwinds we've seen it from a cost perspective. The maintenance has stayed relatively sticky in kind of that 7% to 8% type cost increase range year-over-year. To your question just on the price/cost spread, I would say there's -- we expect the biggest or the most positive impact between that in the first quarter. We expect that to modulate throughout the year, but still, price exceeding cost by the time we exit 2020."", 'Jerry David Revich', ""Okay. Super. And then nice progress on a $100 million efficiency program. How much progress did you make in '23 specifically and the remaining $35 million of productivity improvement? When do you expect -- how much of an improvement do you expect in '24 relative to that remaining $35 million?"", 'Brian M. DelGhiaccio', 'Approximately about $10 million or the remaining $35 million.', 'Operator', 'The next question is from Tobey Sommer with Truist.', 'Jack Wilson', 'This is Jack Wilson on for Toby. Can we double-click on sort of the state of the fleet and specifically fleet electrification in the long term and sort of where you see that going?', 'Jon Vander Ark', ""Sure. We've mentioned in the prepared remarks that we have 11 right now, we'll have -- add 50 to that this year. We'll be at several hundred next year and climbing our path. That's going to start in residential, and then it will move into small container over time. And we've got a really thoughtful strategy in terms of how we roll that out. I mentioned the infrastructure side of that as well, it's not just a truck, right? It's a system. So you need to understand the infrastructure. You need to understand the incentives. You need to understand the customer's willingness to pay for the vehicle. And if we feel that the trucks that we've had delivered out of our partnership with Oshkosh, those trucks are working very, very well. So we're excited to see the next 50 come into the fleet."", 'Jack Wilson', 'Okay. And then just as a follow-up, can we sort of dig into the moving parts of volume? Are there any sort of specific geographies or market segments that are especially volatile or changing?', 'Jon Vander Ark', ""No, I mentioned the housing piece, large-container temp, but that's been certainly soft as we're not putting up as many new houses as we need and even for movement, people are kind of keeping their existing mortgage rates and are reluctant to move. And oftentimes, we see move -- we see remodeling activity or other ancillary opportunities and large container temp, and that's been muted. We don't think that will last forever here, but we're planning on a relatively benign year this year, looking to 2025 to see that accelerate."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Tony Bancroft with Gabelli Funds.', 'George Anthony Bancroft', ""Nice job on the quarter. Just some more color maybe. You mentioned PFOS remediation. Could you just maybe talk about what is going on currently at your landfills or whatever you're doing regarding PFOS? And what could that -- maybe just a general idea what could that business look like opportunity-wise going forward?"", 'Jon Vander Ark', ""Yes. We think we've got a very compelling offering for customers in an end-to-end solution. So we can hand all the way from the assessment to the frontline remediation with doing our field service work and then a range of disposal options on the back end, whether that's into hazardous landfill, whether that's in deep well, some of that waste can be profiled. We're going to put into a solid waste landfill as well, and you're seeing some of that flow through our special waste.So that's measured in the tens of millions if you look at last year. This year, it'll be the high end of tens of millions or potentially tipping into a 9-digit number in terms of revenue. So this is a real growth opportunity for us. And this is all mostly people self-selecting in advance of the EPA regulations coming down as well as some of the Department of Defense work that's been accelerated on that front. So we feel like our national footprint positions us well to -- in our strategic accounts organization, positions us very well to serve customers on this issue."", 'George Anthony Bancroft', ""That's great. And then maybe switching to trucks. You talked about what's going on with EVs and the amount of deliveries coming, which sounds great. Any issues with maybe on just traditional trucks and EVs on supply chain, getting those deliveries? And then just to piggyback on that one, if surprises -- you see any surprises in EV performance. You hear and read a lot of things about how it's performing. Obviously, you're pretty well situated just based on the routing system. But just some real-time color on how those -- I guess there's only a few right now, but that's going to be growing, and I'm sure you've done a lot of testing."", 'Jon Vander Ark', ""Yes. The supply chain is -- again, we're probably getting about 80% of the trucks we want over the last couple of years. And that includes the rollover from the previous year, right? So we're not continuing to fall way behind, but we haven't fully caught up yet either. But keep in mind, we've grown a lot. We're coming off our third straight year of double-digit revenue growth on that. So as we grow and do these acquisitions, that creates more demand and need for new trucks. So we see the supply chain improving. I think we'll get -- we'll shorten that -- we'll shrink that gap as we exit '24. I don't expect that we'll close that gap until 2025 on that front. And then the EV specifically, the McNeilus truck is the first purpose-built refuse truck ever and it's electrified. And that truck is driving a full route. Most of the other EVs that we've piloted, that you spend the first 60 days with a lot of software issues that you're working through. We've been really, really surprised by the performance level and the uptime of this vehicle. We're working through some bugs. We're still in a test-and-learn environment, but really promising in terms of what this is going to be able to do to operate at scale with EVs."", 'Operator', 'This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jon Vander Ark for any closing remarks.', 'Jon Vander Ark', 'Thank you, Debbie. I would like to recognize and thank our more than 40,000 employees for their great work and commitment to serving our customers. Their efforts enable our strong 2023 results and the continued growth of our company. Have a good evening and be safe.', 'Operator', ""The conference has now concluded.

Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", 'A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:', '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$19.1b', 'US$22.4b', 'US$24.4b', 'US$25.9b', 'US$26.4b', 'US$26.9b', 'US$27.4b', 'US$28.0b', 'US$28.6b', 'US$29.2b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x3', 'Analyst x8', 'Analyst x5', 'Analyst x4', 'Analyst x4', 'Est @ 1.91%', 'Est @ 2.02%', 'Est @ 2.10%', 'Est @ 2.16%', 'Est @ 2.20%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.0% ', 'US$18.0k', 'US$20.0k', 'US$20.5k', 'US$20.5k', 'US$19.7k', 'US$19.0k', 'US$18.3k', 'US$17.6k', 'US$17.0k', 'US$16.4k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$187b', ""We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period.

You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Merck as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

We thank you for joining us, and we welcome you to the HEICO First Quarter Fiscal '24 Earnings Announcement Teleconference. I am Larry Mendelson and Chairman and CEO of HEICO Corporation. I am joined here this morning by Eric Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group, Victor Mendelson, HEICO's Co-President and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group; and Carlos Macau, our Executive Vice President and CFO. Before reviewing our operating results in detail, I would like to take a moment and thank all of HEICO's talented team members for delivering another very, very strong quarter. Your continued focus on exceeding customer expectations and operating at peak performance level continued to fuel our excellent financial results. I personally have never been more optimistic about the future of HEICO. I would now like to summarize the highlights of our first quarter fiscal '24 record results. Consolidated operating income and net sales in the first quarter of fiscal '24, improved by 39% and 44%, respectively as compared to the first quarter of fiscal '23. These results reflect mainly a 12% organic net sales growth in Flight Support, commercial aerospace products and services as well as the impact from our profitable fiscal '23 and '24 acquisitions. Consolidated net income increased 23% to $114.7 million or $0.82 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal '24 and that was up from $93 million or $0.67 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal '23. Net income attributable to HEICO in the first quarter of fiscal '24 and '23 were both favorably impacted by a discrete income tax benefit from stock option exercises. The benefit in the first quarter of fiscal '24, net of controlling interest, was $13.3 million, and that was up from $6.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal '23. Consolidated EBITDA increased 43% to $224.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal '24, and that was up from $157.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal '23. I mean that is an enormous increase, if I say so myself. The Flight Support Group set an all-time quarterly net sales and operating income record in the first quarter of fiscal '24, improving 67% and 63% respectively, over the first quarter of fiscal '23. The increases principally reflect the impact from our fiscal '23 acquisition of Wencor and 12% organic growth mainly attributable to increased demand within our aftermarket replacement parts and repair and overhaul parts and services. Our net debt-to-EBITDA was 2.79x as of January 31, '24, and that was down from 3.0x as of August 31, '23. When we acquired Wencor, our pro forma leverage ratio was slightly above 3x. And we had projected pro forma leverage to be 2x within 12 to 18 months post-acquisition. At this time, I am pleased to report that we continue to remain on track to achieve this target. Cash flow provided by operating activities increased 46% to $111.7 million in the first quarter fiscal '24 and that was up from $76.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal '23. We continue to forecast strong cash flow from operations for fiscal '24. In January '24, we paid our regular semiannual cash dividend of $0.10 per share, and this represented our 91st consecutive semiannual cash dividend since 1979. In January '24, we were honored to announce that I received the Kenn Ricci Lifetime Aviation Entrepreneur Award from the Living Legends of the Aviation Organization. The Living Legends of Aviation recognition is given to remarkable people of extraordinary accomplishment in aviation, including entrepreneurs, innovators, industry leaders, astronauts, record breakers, pilots who become celebrities and celebrities who have become pilots. I was profoundly humbled and honored that this storied and a unique organization would include me with such aviation and space pioneers for this special honor. However, in my opinion, the honor really belongs to HEICO's 10,000-plus team members who are the ones that make HEICO the great company that it is. Now let me discuss our recent acquisition activity. In December '23, we entered into an exclusive license and acquired certain assets for the capability to support Boeing 737NG/777 cockpit display and legacy display products line from Honeywell International. We do expect the exclusive license and asset acquisition to be accretive to our earnings in the year following closing. The acquisition broadens our avionics capability and it's another example of ways that HEICO has grown into adjacent markets to increase our overall value proposition to customers and the industry. At this time, I would now like to introduce Eric Mendelson who is Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Flight Support Group. He will discuss the first quarter results of the Flight Support Group. Eric?"", 'Eric A. Mendelson', ""The Flight Support Group's net sales increased 67% to a record $618.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal '24, up from $371.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal '23. The net sales increase in the first quarter of fiscal '24 reflects the impact from our profitable fiscal '23 acquisition of Wencor which continues to perform above our expectations as well as strong 12% organic growth. The organic net sales growth mainly reflects high teens organic net sales growth from both our aftermarket replacement parts and repair and overhaul parts and services product lines. The Flight Support Group's operating income increased 63% to a record $136 million in the first quarter of fiscal '24, up from $83.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal '23. The operating income increase in the first quarter of fiscal '24 principally reflects the pre-mentioned net sales growth, partially offset by higher, as expected, intangible asset amortization expenses due to the Wencor acquisition well as increased inventory obsolescence expense. The Flight Support Group's operating margin was 22% in the first quarter of fiscal '24 as compared to 22.5% in the first quarter of fiscal '23. The Flight Support Group's operating margin before intangible amortization expense was 24.8% in the first quarter of fiscal '24 versus 24.3% in the first quarter of fiscal '23. The small decrease in operating margin principally reflects a slightly lower gross profit margin in the previously mentioned higher expected intangible asset amortization expense due to the Wencor acquisition partially offset by lower performance-based compensation expense. Now I would like to introduce Victor Mendelson, Co-President of HEICO and President of HEICO's Electronic Technologies Group, to discuss the first quarter results of the Electronic Technologies Group."", 'Victor H. Mendelson', ""Thank you, Eric. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income was $55.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal '24 -- excuse me, jumped ahead.

The net sales increase is mainly attributable to the impact from our fiscal '23 acquisitions and a double-digit increase in organic net sales of our aerospace products, partially offset by lower organic net sales of our other electronics, medical and space products. We continue to forecast strong net sales and earnings growth for the remainder of fiscal '24. The Electronic Technologies Group's operating income was $55.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal '24 as compared to $56.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal '23. We expect higher net sales and profit margins in the quarters ahead and over the long term. This is due to our shipment schedule supported by our near-record backlog, combined with the revenues we expect because of our new product research and development activities. The slight operating income decreased principally resulted from our subsidiary shipment schedules of our record backlogs with fewer shipment in the first quarter than scheduled in future quarters, something that was scheduled prior to the quarter start and is in line with our internal plan. For those familiar with our last earnings call and our public interaction since then, you will remember that we said to expect high results variability quarter to quarter this year with the first quarter being our weakest quarter. So this proceeded just as expected. Naturally the less favorable product sales mix resulted in lower SG&A efficiencies also recognizing our large record backlogs and our forward growth potential, we increased new product research and development investment, which increased expenses in the quarter so that we can gain revenue in future quarters. As I sit here today, I'm very pleased that we made those investments and that we continue to fully fund these activities which provide the important forward growth. Importantly our net sales increased an acquisition cost in the first quarter of fiscal '23 related to the closing of an acquisition were beneficial to our results. The ETG's operating margin was 19.3% in the first quarter of fiscal '24 as compared to 22.2% in the first quarter of fiscal '23. This acquisition related amortization was around 400 basis point what we and others to be -- consider to be our true margin was closer to 23.5%. Again we expect the margin, both before and after amortization to improve materially in the quarters ahead. The lower margin principally reflects what I just discussed namely the product sales mix due to the shipment schedule, higher new product research and development expenses as well as increased selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales which supports our forecasted strong net sales and earnings growth for the remainder of fiscal '24, partially offset by the previously mentioned lower acquisition costs. For the full year, we expect SG&A expenses to decrease as a percentage of net sales as our net sales increase. I now turn the call back over to Larry Mendelson."", 'Laurans A. Mendelson', 'Thank you, Victor. I think it should be clear to everyone on this call that Victor and we are expecting a quite different result from ETG from the second quarter through the end of the year. And in the first quarter, some people, I think, misunderstood and they said, ""Oh, ETG is not doing well."" And I think Victor explained it very well. So you understand that it is a lumpy business and the sales and earnings should come through from the second to the fourth quarter. As we look ahead to the remainder of fiscal \'24, we continue to anticipate net sales growth in both the Flight Support and ETG principally driven by contributions from our fiscal \'23 and \'24 acquisitions as well as demand for the majority of our products. Notably, we fully expect future ETG quarters to be materially stronger than the first quarter. In addition, we plan to continue our commitment to developing new products and services with further market penetration as well as maintaining our financial strength and our flexibility.In closing, I would again like to thank our incredible team members for their continued support and commitment to HEICO. Our strategy of growing a highly diversified portfolio of excellent businesses continues to produce favorable results for all shareholders. Our end markets are very healthy and fiscal \'24 is looking to be another great year. Thank you for your continued confidence. And as I said before, I have never been more bullish about HEICO\'s future. One other comment. We do not now give any guidance. Some analysts have asked us to give guidance. We prefer not to. However, I have said publicly that our goal is to grow net income 15% to 20% annually compounded. Over the last 30 to 33 years, I think, we have done that and the actual growth has been somewhere around 18% or 19%. I can tell you that based on everything that I know at this moment, and based upon our -- what we expect for the future of this year. I clearly am highly confident that we will attain that 15% to 20% growth in the current year and that without any future acquisitions which we might make. So with that, I would like to turn the call back to our operator, Samara, and open the call for questions from listeners. I thank you again very much. Samara?', 'Operator', ""(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research."", 'Scott Stephen Mikus', ""This is Scott Mikus on for Rob Spingarn. Eric, I wanted to ask you some of the U.S. airlines, they've readjusted their capacity growth plans for the year. Some of that's due to aircraft delivery delays or the GTF issues, but some of it's -- just are concerns related to the U.S. domestic market being overcapacitized. So are you seeing any change in order patterns from customers where maybe the low-cost carriers are slowing down their orders but the large network carriers, like United and Delta are accelerating their orders?"", 'Eric A. Mendelson', ""So thanks for your question, Scott. With regard to what we see in the market, the market continues to be extremely strong across the board. I think yes, the large commercial carriers are particularly strong. There has been a little bit of weakness in -- with some of the lower-cost carriers. But nothing really pronounced at this point. There are natural order patterns where things can get a little lumpy shift around. So I don't want to -- I wouldn't want to predict any weakness there. Right now, there continues to be a shortage of parts. Airlines are still in need of parts, are still trying to grow their inventory. So we see the market as very strong."", 'Scott Stephen Mikus', ""Okay. Got it. And then I wanted to ask, you've owned Wencor for about a little more than half a year. So I was just wondering if you could share some of the best practices that Wencor has learned from HEICO? And what are some of the best practices that HEICO has learned from Wencor so far?"", 'Eric A. Mendelson', ""Yes, that's a good question. The Wencor acquisition has been exceeding expectations in every single area, the business, the people, the strategy, it's been incredibly strong. And we had very high expectations for it, and they are even beating those numbers. Specifically, looking at areas of best practices. I would say that HEICO is particularly strong in the technical arena. Wencor is also strong in the technical arena. But I think there are some things where Wencor has been able to benefit from us as well as HEICO benefiting from Wencor and other areas. And then in particular, in the e-commerce area. I think Wencor has been able to benefit HEICO in that area. So we see continued synergies without integration. So we -- our plan is to continue to operate Wencor for the time being or for the foreseeable future as an independent business. And that's the DNA of HEICO. That's how we operate all of the HEICO businesses, and we want Wencor to continue, obviously, to have its own P&L, its own strategy, its own team members and HEICO is strongest when each of the individual business units take care of themselves and coordinate with the other ones. So I would say that I look at the cooperation between HEICO and Wencor is somewhat analogous between the cooperation, if you look at a number of the European airline groups. We look at Lufthansa and Swiss or Air France and KLM or British Airways and Iberia and they maintain their independence, their separate touch and feel and relationships with the customers, separate people, but they coordinate some of the activities behind the scenes, making sure that they're -- the schedules and the product offerings are supportive of each other. And that's what we've been able to do very successfully. So Wencor continues as an individual autonomous business, no plan to change that. And we are making sure that we provide tremendous value to our customers as a result of making sure we don't have, for example, product development overlap, where we rationalized some of the repair offerings in various centers of excellence focused on different products and technology. So our customers have been very happy as a result of the acquisition and are really excited about where we're headed there. And I think they really want to reward us with a significant additional new business. They view HEICO in a very different light as a result of the Wencor merger."", 'Operator', ""And we'll take our next question from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs."", 'Noah Poponak', ""Last quarter, you had talked about the ETG margin for the full year being around 24%, that segment operating margin. Does that stand such that you'd have one or 2 quarters above that? And I know you don't give quarterly guidance, but given the variability here, I don't know if it makes sense to just speak to the shape of that over the remaining 3 quarters of the year?"", 'Victor H. Mendelson', ""Sure. Noah, this is Victor. The answer to your question is yes. And as to the shape of it over the remaining quarters, I think that the year should build. I'm not sure yet that the fourth quarter is a little far out, whether the fourth quarter finishes above or a little less than the third quarter, and the third is our high point or fourth is our high point, not sure about that. But at this point, and based on the shipment schedules, that's how we think it will play out."", 'Noah Poponak', ""Okay. And Eric, on the FSG margin, the full year look was around 21% on the GAAP segment operating margin. And I think you guys had also said you expected the first quarter to be the low point of the year. So I don't know, maybe you could update us on how you see that playing out through the rest of the year or if there's a new number for the full year, given what you did in the first quarter?"", 'Eric A. Mendelson', 'Well, the first quarter was very strong at 22%. And when you add back the (inaudible) amortization, we get to about 24.8%, so extremely strong. We anticipate continued strength. I think I want to be a little bit conservative going forward. We often go ahead and we come out with our budgets and our numbers and our folks end up beating those numbers. But maybe Carlos wants to shed some light specifically on that.', 'Carlos L. Macau', ""Noah, it's Carlos. I don't think my view on the segment -- can you hear me okay? So I was going to say, I don't think my mind has changed on what the segment should produce this year. Back in December when we were sort of looking out, and I got the margin question. I felt like the FSG was probably between 21% and 22% OI margin, that's what I felt the company would do for the year. We could always do better than that, but that's what we planned. And so -- and we did plan on having a strong first quarter in the FSG. So I think that, that thesis continues to hold up. But of course, as we get into the second quarter and we get to the next call, we'll I'll see if I can tighten that range up for you."", 'Noah Poponak', ""Okay. I appreciate that. One other thing I wanted to ask, I guess, it's kind of for everyone, but you're in this unique position now vis-a-vis PMA and pricing in the aftermarket that's maybe more unique than we've seen in a long time because your peers in the -- that build and sell spare parts have had such strong pricing for 2-plus years now. We don't really know exactly how you price PMA, presumably, that gap has widened, maybe it has widened a lot. And so you have the opportunity to take more price than you normally do or take more share than you normally do or both. And I'm curious to hear you talk about how you will strategically manage which of those you want to go after and how you will look to triangulate that over the medium term here?"", 'Eric A. Mendelson', ""Noah, that's a great and insightful question. The short answer is I think we need to do both. We need to adjust pricing to reflect our increased costs. and we also need to grow market share. So that is the strategy. We have a number of customers who have been purchasing parts at fairly old prices before there was cost inflation. So we need to make sure that we pass along our cost increases. And I think our customers are very understanding of that. Some customers get it and are just fine and go ahead and incorporate the other -- the new pricing. Other customers want to have the discussion over it, and we -- obviously, we don't show them what our costs are, but we explain what's happened to our costs, and this is only reasonable. So honestly, I think that our pricing has been a lot more conservative and gentle then it could be. Our competitors are substantially raising prices, we're seeing now last night from a -- I don't want to call out the OEM, but it's an OEM that everybody knows and they increased price twice last year, once 10% and another time 18%. And by the way, I will mention it was not TransDigm. So I know people are very interested in the TransDigm story, but it was not TransDigm. So it shows how pervasive the price increases are. So I think that we've been very mild. And I think, frankly, with costs going up and the need to spend additional dollars on new product development that it would be reasonable to have additional increases. And I think we'll be able to capture market share at the same time. So I don't think those 2 are mutually exclusive. We've -- if you talk to the airlines, I mean nobody wants the price increase, as you say. But the airlines all recognize that HEICO has been extremely gentle with regards to price increase. And frankly, in areas where we have been more restrictive on price increase, we anticipate significant share gains as well."", 'Operator', ""We'll take our next question from Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank."", 'Scott Deuschle', ""Eric, did Boeing's challenges in January have any impact to FSG Specialty Products growth in the quarter?"", 'Eric A. Mendelson', ""Yes. I would say they did. Boeing had some challenges and as a result, the new bill has been impaired. So that definitely had an impact on specialty products. I would also like to point out that while specialty product sales were a little soft, and caused the reported organic growth rate to be, if you will, understated because the aftermarket growth rate was very high teens. A lot of the -- we're very bullish on the future. And a lot of what specialty products does is on the defense side. And as you know, in a lot of missile defense and space programs, rocket motor programs, these are very long lead time items. So our order book is extremely strong. We're very, very bullish on the future. We feel that we're well embedded. We've got some great secular trends we are the low-cost, high-quality, sole-source producer on most of the stuff, and we think that the future will be very good. So I'm not at all concerned about the specialty products being down. And I think Boeing also will get their act together. I mean, obviously, they've got some challenges that we've all read about but Boeing is still a great company. And I think that they'll get that all figured out, and it will permit our specialty products to grow at sort of more historic rates."", 'Scott Deuschle', 'Okay. So it would be fair to think that maybe some of that Boeing related weakness is probably lingered in the February, but the growth in the space and defense side allows you to return to growth overall in specialty products next quarter?', 'Eric A. Mendelson', ""I need to look at specifically with regard to next quarter, but what you're saying sounds logical."", 'Scott Deuschle', ""Okay. And then Victor, are you able to quantify how much R&D was up at ETG in the quarter? And then if there's any specific areas of investment you can talk about, I think that would be pretty interesting to hear."", 'Victor H. Mendelson', 'It was pretty broad-based. There were places I think where somewhere I know that we invested more than in the past. But I would say pretty broad-based scenario, which is good because I like to see -- and we like to see that all of our companies are investing in R&D. R&D was up by about I believe in the quarter about 25%, 24%, something like that. So it was a significant increase for us.', 'Scott Deuschle', 'Okay. And then last question. Victor, were there any changes in your F-35 content with the shift to [TR3] ?', 'Victor H. Mendelson', ""By the way, it's closer to 22%, I think, was the net increase for ETG alone in the quarter. Yes, that for [ETG] in the quarter. I'm sorry, the question you just asked. Could you repeat that, please?"", 'Scott Deuschle', 'Yes. It was whether there are any changes in F-35 content with the shift to [TR 3]?', 'Victor H. Mendelson', ""I don't think it's material to us. We do have in a fuel business as F-35 content. But overall, it's not a material change."", 'Operator', ""We'll take our next question from Larry Solow with CJS Securities."", 'Lawrence Scott Solow', ""Eric, thanks for the color on Wencor and also just the segment. Just a couple of follow-ups on that. So the high-teens growth, you're experiencing -- I think it's relative comping to a mid-20s growth last year. So pretty remarkable, congrats to that. Obviously, end market demand sounds like it's still growing. But can you give us a little more color on where else those gains are coming from? Just kind of bucketing market share gains? Are there obviously some of that's still occurring. The inventory levels, you mentioned still low, but are they building back up if some of that still creating some of the differences in to end market demand and the growth you're reporting, you catch up the maintenance maybe? I'm just trying to figure out the -- trying to gap the difference there."", 'Eric A. Mendelson', ""Yes. Larry, I'd be happy to answer that. The strength within site support on the aftermarket side has really been across the board. I would say, in general, a little more strength in the parts side as compared to the repair side. Airlines are finding the equipment hard. It's more difficult to get things repaired, but in general, I would say the parts side is a little bit stronger, but the repair side is also doing very well as well. As far as market share gains, we continue to grow market share. Our customers are really happy with us. And speaking with our sales head yesterday, I have specific information from a number of customers that they really are very, very happy as a result of the Wencor acquisition. While HEICO was always a significant player in the space. And so it was Wencor, the fact that we've come together and we can offer a broader product line, a broader suite of products is really significant. And a fair amount of energy was spent in each business focusing on capturing as much as it could. And now by creating more of these centers of excellence, where each business focus is on where it has a true competitive advantage it doesn't need to, if you will, reinvent the wheel, makes a lot of sense. And our customers are really happy about that because we're able to provide a much fuller suite of offering to the customers and they recognize that this is true structural advantage that they can benefit from as opposed to more niche-oriented strategy. So market share gains, we have had some pricing gains. I don't have a breakout between the two. But I wouldn't say that market share is definitely the leading number there."", 'Lawrence Scott Solow', ""Got it. And I appreciate that. And then just switching gears to question, Victor. Just on the quarter and the outlook, it sounds like aerospace had some good follow-through and it was a little slow last year, at least on deliveries, but that just sounds like that's continuing to return to growth mode. Just in terms of the other categories, I know it sounds like you mentioned a few there was just slower due time in electronic medical consumer space, and those sound like they're all higher margin categories. I think on the last call, you guys had mentioned that there would be some of those, I think maybe the electronics piece would be slower. Is that still the case? Has anything changed in terms of your sort of full year outlook for ETG in terms of revenue composition and growth?"", 'Victor H. Mendelson', ""So overall, all in for the year right now, I think our expectations are pretty much what they were at the -- during our last call. It is the general markets that all-in gave up ground in the quarter as we expected they would. We're beginning to see some, what I'd call, the proverbial green shoots in a few of the businesses, but we're still not running at order levels higher than prior year. And I -- as I kind of talked about before, I expect that sometime over the next couple of quarters, orders to start to reverse overall. And then -- one second. Thank you. (inaudible) off here in the room. And then I would expect that if you factor in lead times onto the backlog -- on to the orders and so on, as we get later in the year, that starts to turn overall in the right direction in terms of revenue."", 'Lawrence Scott Solow', 'Got you. Okay. Great. And then just lastly, Carlos, I think the tax rate, a little lower this quarter. I know you usually get those stock comp benefit in Q1. And any change to the full year outlook?', 'Carlos L. Macau', ""No. I think for the full year, I continue to think we'll run between 20% and 21%, Larry. I think the effective tax rate we have in the first quarter here is about what I expected. I thought we'd catch about half our effective rate for the year this quarter, and then we make it up more normalized rate in Qs 2, 3 and 4 but no real surprises. It played out the way I thought it would slightly better than last year's benefit, but still in line with history and what we've seen in the past."", 'Operator', ""And we'll take our next question from Peter Arment with Baird."", 'Peter J. Arment', ""Victor, maybe just a quick one on if you're still seeing lingering impacts from the supply chain, and that's also a factor that's kind of impacting you on the top line."", 'Victor H. Mendelson', ""Thanks for asking. It's a good question. We're not seeing much of it. It has really improved, whether it's exactly back to normal. I'm not sure because I'm not sure what the new normal will be, in fact, but I wouldn't -- I would say that at this point, supply chain is almost back to where it was. And the -- the labor market is -- has been challenging for a while and continues to be. And so I would say that impacts us as much, if not more, probably these days than the supply chain, just getting good, qualified people into the businesses."", 'Peter J. Arment', 'And maybe if you could just update us on how your -- how (inaudible) is doing after owning the business now for, I guess, almost a year, right?', 'Victor H. Mendelson', ""Yes, we're very happy we own it. It's doing essentially as we expected and a lot of good potential ahead. Also, they're looking at a number of acquisitions we've been able to bring to them, they bring up some. We'll see whether they transpire. But a lot of good things happening there and so far, so good."", 'Peter J. Arment', ""Great. And a quick one for Carlos. Carlos, just rough expectations on how you're thinking about interest expense for the year. I know the goal is obviously to continue to delever."", 'Carlos L. Macau', ""Yes. I mean -- so right now, if everything plays out, I'm expecting our interest expense quarterly to run $35 million to $37 million. That's pretty much what -- we booked this quarter about $38 million. So I think as we pay some debt down, if we catch a break on a few rate cuts, you never know. I have a sort of tailing off a little bit at -- that also is a function, Peter of how quickly I can pay the debt down depending on how many businesses Eric, Victor and Larry want to buy will certainly influence that during the year."", 'Peter J. Arment', 'Got it. I appreciate all the details and Larry, congrats on the award.', 'Victor H. Mendelson', 'I just might add something to -- this is Victor, what Carlos had to say. We continue to look at acquisitions. Most are in our historical -- overwhelmingly in our historical size. And we have an excellent acquisition pipeline, very strong. Again, whether we do that remains to be seen. But we will continue to those acquisitions that would fit the right way while being mindful of the importance of reducing debt and capital structure.', 'Laurans A. Mendelson', ""Just to further expand on what Victor said, it's completely correct. It's a balancing act. We are in the business of expanding, creating cash flow and bottom line income. And if we see an outstanding acquisition, we will make it. At the same time, we have to watch our debt level, and we're trying to reduce it. So as you saw, we made a Honeywell acquisition recently because we believe it will be very accretive and very positive cash flow. So we made the decision to acquire it by using debt which reduced our ability to reduce our debt to overall debt. But on the bottom line, it was helpful to HEICO and actually where you get more income and debt. So the balance actually benefits the ratio of debt to EBITDA. But anyway, this is all a balancing act and we watch it very, very carefully because, as you know, we are focused on bottom line cash flow. So we will make these acquisitions when they are very, very desirable and we might have to use some debt, but we'll take each one as it comes.We are here to grow HEICO bottom line cash flow. Again, it's a balancing act, and we're very careful with it."", 'Operator', ""We'll take our next question from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies."", 'Sheila Karin Kahyaoglu', ""Victor, I'm going to start with you if it's okay, given the ETG margins spotlight. You gave us some color on R&D up 20%, so it implies about 100 basis points of margin pressure. Can you maybe talk about the less favorable sales mix, how much it was maybe even pricing into the mix as well just on the bridge and how we think about that improvement, as you said, Q3 and Q4 are headed to be better and should we expect a similar sub-20% rate in Q2?"", 'Victor H. Mendelson', ""Sure. Sheila, a couple of things. One, I would be surprised to see a sub-20% rate in Q2. Number two, the sales difference was not based on pricing, it was based on the shipment schedule. So we -- I would call it a fairly normal pricing environment, which means in some instances, the customers can accept the prices that recognize our cost that maybe higher and other instances we have longer term contracts where pricing is a lot thin. So it's kind of a normal scenario on the pricing side. Really, on the revenue side, it was all about the shipment schedule and when things were supposed to ship. It's not necessarily, by the way, the production rate. So we try to keep the facilities level loaded. Our businesses try to stay level loaded in production. But it depends upon when the order is due for delivery or acceptance and test by the customer, that dictates a lot of how it works for us. So again, just to emphasize, I would expect north of 20% GAAP margin -- operating margin on the quarter, which, of course, would be north of 24% the true margin, excluding intangibles amortization."", 'Sheila Karin Kahyaoglu', 'Got it. Any sort of color on the mix impact in the quarter in terms of margin headwind?', 'Victor H. Mendelson', ""Not really other than the shipment schedules in our higher-margin businesses were lower than they had been in the prior period and that brings down the margin. But I don't want to break out which business is what margins, but I think our business..."", 'Sheila Karin Kahyaoglu', ""Well, hopefully not. Eric, one for you if it's okay. Wencor, how do we think about this revenue synergy is the best? Is the best way to look at it based on a number of PMA parts? And the sales per part is about 4x greater at HEICO than it is at Wencor. So if you have that marketing channel, is that a potential way to think about the sales opportunity? Or how are you thinking about it?"", 'Eric A. Mendelson', ""That is -- that's one way to think about it. I'm also really looking at it as how the product sets are very complementary, number one. Number two, without getting into specific customers, I would say there are a number of extremely strong relationships, sales relationships on the Wencor side as well as the HEICO side. And I think that we can help each other. The businesses can help each other with sharing those relationships and just basically one hand, helping the other. If you look historically, we've taken up our margins over the last decade that you covered us quite significantly and frankly, an even beat where I thought they would be. And I think that there is more potential in that regard. There's some -- there's a lot of sharing that also can occur over on the repair side in terms of DER repairs as well as they're already using the PMA parts. So I think that, that's an advantage. In the defense side, we're already cooperating and working together, whereas orders used to go out to third-party companies that are now being placed internally, and that's very strong likewise over in our specialty manufacturing. There's a lot of product that our specialty manufacturing group can build for our other businesses including Wencor, and we're really pushing that as well. So I think it's just a very broad-based level of cooperation, as I said, without integration. When you've got really talented people who are running these businesses, who have really mastered their businesses, we find that by getting them autonomy, that's very intrinsically motivating feature. And that's not something that exists in many companies. If you look at HEICO overall across all of HEICO, we've got roughly 100 business heads and for a company of our size to have 100 people of this talent and skill set where they performed so well and they really enjoy what they do because of way that they're treated, I think that's the real synergy here. It's not going to be from knocking out little costs here and there. I mean, yes, there's an opportunity to do that. And for example, in trade shows, in a number of the trade shows, Paris, Farmborough and others will have booths together. So HEICO and Wencor will be together. There'll be certain other trade shows where they can be separate. And we want the businesses to each have their own strategy and to really take responsibility for the results. So I think that's why we're getting these benefits."", 'Operator', ""I'll take our next question from Mariana Perez Mora with Bank of America."", 'Mariana Perez Mora', ""So first of all, congratulations, Larry, on the award. My first question is about R&D, follow-up on ETG R&D. What are the main trends? Because you said like it's pretty much across the board increase. But what are the main trends that are driving this increase in R&D? What are the opportunities that you guys are seeing that actually are calling for this increase R&D? Is this the particular technology, is it the trend, is it the -- I don't know, an end market? Could you please discuss that."", 'Victor H. Mendelson', ""Sure, this is Victor. It is a very good question. And by the way, when I say across the board, it doesn't mean in every business, but it's kind of -- I should clarify what I mean by that is the majority of the business or sort of the super majority of the businesses. It is what I could call, the trend. There is a tremendous amount of opportunity for our businesses or newer and evolved products. Sometimes it's not just what you would consider revolutionary change, right? It's not necessarily developing something that is wholly new. In our case, it is more typically evolutionary and it is an improvement on an earlier version or iteration of a product. And so what we're seeing in a high number of our customers is demand for what you would consider our next generation of products. So it's not just technology based. It's not for example as though there is a new design that has been developed. Like Bluetooth came up many years and everybody was implementing Bluetooth. It's not like that. It's more responsive to the individual needs of our customers."", 'Mariana Perez Mora', 'And are usually customers calling for this improvement? How this like R&D, how you pay, what arenas, what specific products are still are on the option?', 'Victor H. Mendelson', ""So we leave it to each one of our businesses to make those choices. In some cases, it's customer-initiated. In other cases, it's initiated by our subsidiaries or somewhere in between. I mean our businesses had regular meetings and visits and calls with customers. And so they're aware of new programs, the customer may be on. New designs that they might need. And that's probably the most typical but it runs the gamut, depending on the architecture of the particular business as well as the products. But the key to it is, one, a willingness to always invest and respond to the customer needs depending upon the history and relationship with the customer, the likelihood that they will, in fact, turn into orders. I mean let's be honest, there are companies who will always ask their suppliers, their vendors, partners to develop something on their dime. And then they may not buy it. So that is a factor that we consider is what is the history with the customer? Are they likely to, in fact, convert to orders? Is there a PO standing behind it? Are they on a program of record, for example, if it's defense and where do they stand with that program? What Intel are we getting in the broader community? What do we hear from our other partners, customers, even trade shows, government people, things like that. So each business, though, is responsible for that. And that, to be honest, the beauty, I think, of our company is that it's not from on high, it is experts talking with experts. We believe in devolving those decisions down at the lowest level to be able to understand the customer best."", 'Mariana Perez Mora', 'And my last one is on M&A. Could you please discuss when you do acquisitions like the recent Honeywell licenses (inaudible), they are adjacent opportunities for you. But I could imagine that a company like this or a license could be able to unlock more upside opportunity in terms of revenues under the HEICO ecosystem compared to if this license ends up in another third-party MRO shop. Like can you please discuss how you think about those outside opportunities and how long it could take to actually see them?', 'Eric A. Mendelson', ""Sure. Mariana, this is Eric. I'd be happy to answer about that. So HEICO has done a number of licensing deals over the last decade. So we're very well experienced on doing those licensing deals. And in particular, when you look at the component repair footprint, HEICO has got 19 individual MRO businesses just within Flight Support. And then over in ETG, there are another number of them there as well. So we've been able to buy these licenses and basically take the technology and put it into a business that's already incredibly experienced in that market niche and really understands the technology. So when we buy a license, we're able then to go out to the customer with people who can hit the ground running in many cases, are already working with the customer on other items, and it's really a seamless experience. So I think that there is plenty of opportunity for HEICO in this area to continue to grow in adjacent white spaces. I can tell you that our reception at the customers for the Honeywell product has been extremely strong. They've been very happy about that. They're used to our experience with regard to quality, turn time and price. So the reception has been very strong. So I think that it was a great move for both Honeywell as well as for HEICO as well as for our customers. There's just a net benefit increase to the industry here. So I think that there is additional opportunity for us."", 'Operator', ""And we'll take our next question from Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen."", 'Gautam J. Khanna', ""Congrats on the award. A lot of questions have been asked and answered. I was wondering if you guys are seeing any difference in activity level in the direct channel versus the indirect and maybe you could just talk by market, whether it be aftermarket, whether it be OE, if you're seeing anything discernibly different -- restocking, destocking in the distributor channel and the like."", 'Eric A. Mendelson', ""Yes. We're -- Gautam, this is Eric. So you want to know how we're doing with regard to aftermarket and OE on order pattern or what you like me to comment on?"", 'Gautam J. Khanna', 'Maybe just distributors, defense and aero, like is there -- are you seeing any differences in those order patterns versus selling direct outside of the distribution channel.', 'Eric A. Mendelson', ""Well, so our distribution businesses are doing extremely well. They're continuing to gain market share. They have the right inventories. I think our customers are very happy as a result of working with them. Likewise over in the PMA area where we -- and the repair area where we sell direct, it's likewise -- it's the same thing. So I would say a very good strength in both. With regard to product availability on the flight support side, things are tough where, frankly, our vendors are quite behind. And I think our results could be even better if they were able to shift the overdue backlog. And this is really across the board in the parts area. I would say both the PMA as well as the distribution. I think there have been some raw material challenges as a result of the sanctions. And then, of course, as Victor alluded to with regard to labor, that continues to be a challenge. But definitely, the supply chain is tight. There really isn't -- there's no excess capacity. Things are very tight. And we're hoping that by the end of '24, things normalize, Frankly, I would have thought by now things would have normalized more. But unfortunately, our vendors are -- they're really struggling. Things will get better after November in a lot of ways."", 'Gautam J. Khanna', ""Yes. And Carlos, you mentioned -- you talked about the 21% to 22% Flight Support margins is sort of the right ballpark and I think previously, you said the cycle would be somewhere in that range as well. I mean, is there any -- like what is the -- it sounds like Wencor is going better. There is some pricing opportunity, as you've mentioned in response to Noah's question, I'm just curious, like what is your confidence longer term of maybe doing better than that, forget fiscal '24, but just looking at..."", 'Carlos L. Macau', ""Highly confident. I mean I think if you look back over the last decade, just if you want to do a history lesson, go back from pre-COVID and just look back 10 years, and you'll see a pattern of where the FSG continually ekes out 20, 30, 40 basis points a year. I mean, sometimes it's a little flatter. But if you look at that trend, I think we're returning to that. I think we -- that's on an annual basis, by the way. I think we're heading in that direction. We can't continue to grow at a breakneck pace. I think we're at a pretty high growth level right now. And at some point, we get back to what I'll call a normal business cycle, and that's when you'll see our margin take those nice incremental jumps up. Until then, with our end markets being as hard as they are, the margin could fluctuate a little bit based on volumes, what we're selling. But I do think at some point when this hyper growth scenario we're in softens and gets back to, I don't want to say business as usual, but a more customary demand in the market, I would say that, that incremental eke out of growth north, small increments is what we would expect to see. By the way, as far as the 21% to 22% I mean I feel very confident that we're going to wind up in there. We always could do better. But for modeling and thinking about the business, that's why I keep your focus in that area."", 'Operator', ""(Operator Instructions) And we'll take our next question from Bert Subin with Stifel."", 'Bert William Subin', ""Maybe, Eric, first question for you. You talked about pricing being a primary growth driver when it comes to new customers just relative to existing customers where it's more a function of inflation pass-through. Can you just talk about what your new customer strategy is and maybe what percent of sales come from new customers in a given year? And just also, is this a new customer increasingly an internationally based customer?"", 'Eric A. Mendelson', ""Yes, it's a good question, Bert. We don't have that many new customers, and that's pretty much because we deal with everybody. So occasionally, when an airline gets formed, there can be a new one. I would say that our biggest opportunity is to continue to increase our market penetration with our existing customers. So that really is where the big opportunity is as opposed to new ones. I mean we do get new ones, but we're pretty much dealing with everybody in the world. So like a new airline gets created, there wouldn't be that type of opportunity."", 'Bert William Subin', ""And just a clarification there, Eric, just in terms of the pricing, if you're having sort of greater market share gains or market penetration, is that a different sort of function like if you're selling an existing product to an existing customer, you're pricing that, I guess, more gently in terms of just passing through inflation instead of maybe into market. But if you're selling them a new product, is that an opportunity when you think about margins?"", 'Eric A. Mendelson', ""The answer is yes. So if a customer is buying a product and it's under contract, then obviously, they would have price protection for the terms of the contract, the duration of the contract if that's what it's provided for. And of course, there are different things which matter to different customers. So we're very accommodating there. However, if a customer -- if that customer wants to start buying a part that they haven't purchased, then they would get a price based on the new list price as opposed to what the old price was. So there's definitely a big incentive to get started and get locked in with us as early as possible."", 'Bert William Subin', ""Okay. Got it. Super help, Larry. Just one follow-up. Were you reaffirmed your view towards 15% to 20% earnings growth that you sort of highlighted last quarter for FY '24, at least based on what you're seeing today. If we were to get to the end of the year and you were to outpace, I guess, on the positive side, the 20% mark, I'm just curious if you think that would be more a function of FSG, ETG or faster debt paydown?"", 'Laurans A. Mendelson', ""Well, it could be the result of all 3. And however, we try to control earnings growth. We really do. And HEICO, I think investors like consistency. I know we're probably the largest single investor in our company to get 401(k) and Carlos and -- so we like consistency. We don't like to go up 1 year, down the other. In order to do that and to generate cash flow, so we don't get over leverage. We'd like to continue to be within 15% to 20%. So it is possible we could go over 20%. At this point, everything I know in my -- our own thought projections, we will be within 15% to 20% -- would we go over it, it's possible. But at this moment, I wouldn't predict that. Again, I am conservative. And however, I do say that my own guesstimate is that we will be within 15% to 20%. So I don't know if that answers your question. But the other thing is I see that both of our businesses are really very strong. You've heard the whole story. And Victor has described the first quarter of ETG is really a weak quarter because we couldn't ship and these various things. The backlog supports a huge increase from the second to the fourth quarter. So we should see the ETG definitely level out and return to what I would call reasonably normal profitability. Flight Support similarly is very strong, too. And with the Wencor acquisition and the possibilities of gaining some of the synergies, which we're doing very slowly and we want to build it in. But it's a long answer to your question, but I really think at this point, we'll be within 15% to 20% growth. And if we go over, I can't predict who might do it."", 'Operator', ""We'll take our next question from Louis Raffetto with Wolfe Research."", 'Louis Harold Raffetto', ""Carlos, you talked about expecting, I guess, FSG to be pretty strong in 1Q. Was there anything specific there on mix? I'm just trying to bridge sort of the 100 basis point clean margin sequential improvement with sales that weren't sort of too dissimilar from last quarter?"", 'Carlos L. Macau', ""There was -- I would say that the -- we had strong performance in parts is kind of leading the pack. The repair was close second. Specialty products were soft and went behind. I think that based on shipments. That business is a little more predictable, believe it or not, than the parts and repair business are. So we had anticipated that the specialty products has slowed down slightly in Q1 and it did, and we have expectations, it's going to be fine for the rest of the year. But I don't -- there is -- if your question is, is there any one-off or strange mix? No, this has pretty much played out the way I thought it would."", 'Louis Harold Raffetto', ""All right. Great. And then, Victor, just one for you. You laid out strong aerospace in the quarter and then some of those other markets. I didn't hear anything on defense. So I know it's a big part of the business, just making sure how that did in the quarter. You've seen -- I know you kind of have seen some sequential improvement. Does that continue this quarter? Did we step back at all?"", 'Victor H. Mendelson', ""Yes, Louis, it's continued overall all-in to grow. And so what I was segmenting out was the areas that were weak as before, but defense is as we expect and moving in the right direction."", 'Louis Harold Raffetto', 'All right. Great. And then, Larry, just one for you. you kind of talked about balancing M&A and leverage. So I guess as we think about the rest of the year, is really -- would you be willing to go above 3x leverage if you saw a deal that would put you there? Or is that kind of a hard limit?', 'Laurans A. Mendelson', ""The answer is if it was super sensational and it really added to the bottom line, and we looked at it and the payback as a result of it would drop us below the 3x back into the 2x area, we might consider it. We're very careful with debt and also interest rates are very, very high. So to make these acquisitions now because of interest rates, it's a little bit harder. So to answer your question, it would have to be something sensational to make us go above 3x. And so far, I have not seen something so sensational. So I think it's highly unlikely but as we get from, say, just under 3x as we head to 2x, which we estimate in the press release, we said 12 to 18 months from the time we incurred the debt and that's -- we believe that's accurate. But along the way, we might find, as we did with Honeywell, a very accretive cash flow and EPS acquisition which would actually make the ratio, if you do the arithmetic, you make the ratio of debt-to-EBITDA would go down because of the earnings that it would produce, we would do that.So again, that's why I say it takes a lot of thought process. We just don't make acquisitions willy-nilly. And remember one thing, that the Mendelsons as a family and our 401(k) we're there to protect that [nest egg]. And we're going to be very careful in incurring any kind of debt, and we don't want to get into any kind of financial problem. We have great cash flow. We have a great business. It's growing nicely. So we'll be very careful with that debt. I don't know if that answers your question."", 'Operator', 'And there are no additional questions.', 'Laurans A. Mendelson', ""Well, I would like to again thank everyone on this call for their interest in HEICO. We are available if you have other questions, you can contact Carlos, Eric, Victor, myself. And if you don't, we look forward to speaking to you on the second quarter earnings teleconference. That's the end of this teleconference. And again, thank you. Have a wonderful day."", 'Operator', ""And this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.""]"

Management said that January figures were well above that, which could presage better full-year results if air cargo demand improves, as expected, as 2024 progresses.', 'The all-cargo carrier operates a domestic overnight network in Canada that supports large express delivery and e-commerce companies, and provides outsourced airlift for dedicated shippers. Its net loss worsened from $1.9 million during the same period in 2022.', 'Cargojet (TSX: CJT) operating revenue fell 5.75% year over year to $188.7 million, due to a 21% drop in revenue from fuel surcharges but stayed steady for the core flying business thanks to a modest rebound in demand that benefited all carriers in the second half of 2023. Lower jet fuel prices reduced the opportunity to charge additional fees above contract rates.', 'Co-CEO Jamie Porteous, in his first earnings call with analysts since taking the top role at the start of the year, said Cargojet is seeing strong demand from customers buying transportation service with dedicated aircraft and crews, as well as ad hoc charter flights. The charter business produced $20 million in revenue during the fourth quarter, which is about $3.5 million to $7 million more than normal. Cargojet has spare 757s that can pick up extra flights or free up larger 767s for other assignments.', 'Higher demand from DHL Express, for example, meant that Cargojet operated 18 freighters during the recent peak season instead of the 15 that are under contract with the parcel giant, and DHL is retaining the extra aircraft for at least the first half of the year.', 'Cargojet’s results were mostly in line with investor expectations. The positive momentum in demand mirrors the continuing signs of stabilization in the broader airfreight market, with preliminary data showing a 10% volume increase in January versus the prior year.', 'Cargojet’s full-year net earnings fell $113.5 million, to $27.6 million. Earnings adjusted for interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization fell 9.3% to $222.7 million for the full year. Pre-tax earnings were down 43% to $11.7 million, largely due to interest expense for aircraft. Despite the decline, adjusted EBITDA is double what it was in 2019, before COVID, in large measure due to diversified lines of business such as dedicated contract transportation.', 'Cargojet reduced fourth-quarter flight activity by 7.4% year over year, which significantly decreased operating costs and, in conjunction with flat operating revenue, helped support profit margins in excess of 30%. Consolidating routes is a major way the airline improves efficiency when planes are not full.', '“Given the challenging economic environment we faced, we are very pleased with our Q4 and full year results. 2023 was a transitional year for us as we moved from managing a period of hyper growth during the COVID-19 era to focusing on cost management and preparing the business to face the current economic environment,” Porteous in a statement that coincided with the earnings release.', 'He expressed confidence Cargojet can easily add 10% to 15% more revenue on the domestic network without increasing flight time.', 'Management said its continued emphasis on productivity gives confidence it can maintain profit margins.', 'Cargojet executives admit they got caught up in the euphoria over sky-high demand and rates fueled by the pandemic, which continued midway through 2022 and led them to invest in aircraft bigger than any previously operated by the company.', 'But in response to a severe downturn in freight activity that extended until late 2023, and forecasts for the international airfreight market to remain soft for the short-to-medium term, the company unwound $739 million in capital expenditures by reversing course on aircraft investments, including for eight large Boeing 777 converted freighters.', 'Last month it sold production slots for four used Boeing 777-200 aircraft it had planned to buy and convert into freighters after abandoning investments in four 777-300s. The airline said Monday it is trying to sell the 777-200s, one 777 simulator and two Beechcraft aircraft purchased for crew transport. It expects to recover the $85.7 million book value of the aircraft and complete the sale in the first quarter.', 'Cargojet in 2023 sold three 777-300s already purchased and canceled conversion orders for them. It took a $1.7 million loss on the resale of one 777-300 and a net loss of $1.6 million on the other two after receiving an insurance payment for severe hail damage. It also wrote off nearly $1 million related to construction for a 777 hangar that will no longer be used and sold four GE90 engines for $43.8 million.', 'Late last year, Cargojet said it would try to sell or lease four newly purchased Boeing 757 aircraft that were modified for dedicated cargo use and slowed plans to convert two used 767-200 aircraft to freighters until demand recovers. In Monday’s briefing with analysts, Chief Financial Officer Scott Calver said Cargojet only intends to offload two 757 jets after finding new work for two others in its existing network. Depreciation on the two surplus 757s are having a material impact on the bottom line until the company designates them for disposal. The other two freighters could also be activated if demand recovers faster than anticipated. Keeping the planes is a strong possibility because the market for used 757s is oversupplied and values are low.', 'Cargojet recently exercised an option to purchase one Boeing 767-300 coming off a lease. The airline now has a fleet of 41 aircraft — up from 34 at the end of 2022. A fleet table shows Cargojet plans one less unit this year after its lease expires and to stick with 40 freighters through 2026 after indicating three months ago that the fleet could rise to 46 aircraft by the end of 2025. But the fleet strategy is subject to change if revenue opportunities increase.', 'With two 767-200s and one 767-300 scheduled to be converted over the next three years, the planes could end up replacing older aircraft unless Cargojet experiences a spurt of new business and wants to utilize all available aircraft.', 'Cargojet hasn’t permanently abandoned its dreams for 777 freighters, said founder and Executive Chairman Ajay Virmani. The company still retains four 777-300 conversion slots with Israel Aircraft Industries and is negotiating to defer them between three to four years, when market conditions are more conducive to growth.', '“We don’t want to put it into today’s market where the yields are down and competition from widebody passenger aircraft is very, very substantial. So it will not be prudent to put them in. But since we have done a lot of work [developing technical manuals and feasibility studies], we have developed a lot of infrastructure around it, that keeps us at least looking at when the timing is right,” he said.', 'Adjustment in capital expenditures and other belt tightening helped Cargojet generate $28 million in free cash flow during the fourth quarter. The company doesn’t expect any meaningful capital expenditures for growth in 2024 and 2025 as it focuses on dividend growth, share buybacks and maintaining low debt leverage. A reduction in inventory levels for spare engines also helped to reduce capital spending on maintenance last year.', 'Cargojet’s total revenue actually fell an additional $24 million when including a one-time, noncash amortization of a stock warrant issued to Amazon. The warrants, issued several years ago, give Amazon the option to own about 15% of its strategic partner once certain commercial milestones are reached. Calver said the adjustment was made because revenue from new ground operations conducted for Amazon-controlled aircraft in Canada, which now amounts to about $29.5 million per year, does not qualify as an approved business line toward the warrant target.', 'Click here for more FreightWaves/American Shipper stories by Eric Kulisch.', 'Sign up for the weekly American Shipper Air newsletter here.', 'Jetran buys Cargojet rights for 777 freighter conversions', 'Cargojet reverses course on 777 freighter ambitions', 'Cargojet founder Virmani passes torch to co-CEOs', 'The post Cargojet sees strong volumes after 2023 fleet reversal appeared first on FreightWaves.']"

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Diversified Dividend Stocks To Invest In.\xa0', ""Diversified stocks mean companies with exposure to a variety of sectors, industries, and geographic regions. These are usually conglomerates that make money operating in a number of businesses (think Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway). The purpose of diversification is to reduce risk by spreading investments across different assets, thereby minimizing the impact of any single stock or sector performing poorly. In 2023, global stock markets experienced significant growth, with particular attention on Wall Street's impressive performance. The U.S. stock market, being the largest globally, notably led the way with remarkable gains. The S&P 500 index surged by 24.2% in 2023 and the Nasdaq index witnessed an outstanding increase of 43.4%, achieving its highest annual gain since 2020. Despite initial expectations, the economy managed to evade a recession, and the stock market rally surpassed many predictions. However, analysts hold divergent views on what lies ahead for the stock market in 2024, offering a mixed outlook for the year."", 'Based on the positive trends observed last year, analysts are optimistic about the stock market\'s prospects for the current year, although they anticipate some minor declines along the way. A report from JP Morgan suggested that due to decreasing inflation in the US and the possibility of the Federal Reserve adopting more relaxed policies, there\'s growing discussion of a ""soft landing"" rather than a severe economic downturn or bear market. Leading indicators point to a slowdown in growth but not a complete collapse. Generally, equity markets tend to hit their lowest point well before economic conditions reach their worst, although there have been exceptions such as during the dot-com cycle. While there\'s still a risk of recession in the upcoming year, the key takeaway is that even if it does happen, it\'s likely to be mild, especially considering the support the Fed is providing to the banking system through increased liquidity. The report further mentioned that in 2023, earnings for the S&P 500 remained stagnant overall. However, they saw a significant increase of 33% for the seven largest companies, while the rest of the S&P 500 experienced a decline of 5%. Looking ahead to 2024, it appears to be a year characterized by slowing GDP growth, single-digit increases in earnings, and single-digit returns for the typical S&P 500 stock.', 'According to analysts at JP Morgan, investors should consider a diversified portfolio consisting of cash, long-term government bonds, high-quality corporate bonds, and equities. They also find the industrial and energy sectors appealing, particularly due to the industrial policies in the US. Analysts express positivity towards the energy sector primarily because it continues to offer attractive opportunities for earnings yield, dividends, and stock buybacks.', ""According to Bloomberg's 2024 Outlook report, numerous analysts are favoring dividend stocks as an investment choice for the current year. The strategists at Capital Group made the following statement:"", '“With investors swept up in the artificial intelligence fervor, valuations for dividend-paying stocks have quietly drifted toward multi-decade lows compared to the broader market. With growth expected to moderate in 2024, and the potential for recession lingering, dividends may take a more prominent role in driving total returns for investors.”', ""As previously stated, diversified companies play a crucial role in reducing risk. By investing in a diversified portfolio of dividend-paying companies across various sectors, investors can spread their risk and reduce exposure to any single company or industry's performance. Furthermore, dividend-paying companies tend to be more mature and financially sound, as they prioritize returning profits to shareholders. General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are some of the best diversified dividend stocks among others that are discussed below."", 'Photo by Sharon McCutcheon on Unsplash', 'Our Methodology:', 'For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of Q4 2023 and selected conglomerate firms that specialize in several different businesses and pay regular dividends to shareholders.

To skip our detailed analysis of the financial sector, you can go directly to see 5 Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.', 'The financial sector went through a good amount of volatility last year, and many are now beginning to wonder whether the volatility will continue in 2024. No one can fully predict the likelihood of this happening, and yet for some, it may not be an unlikely development. However, this January, CEOs from major big banks made statements highlighting their hopes for the financial sector in 2024, particularly for big banks, in the event of a Federal Reserve ""pivot"" on their interest rate hikes.', 'On January 20, CNBC\'s ""Power Lunch"" highlighted some statements made by several big bank CEOs on this matter. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\'s (NYSE:GS) CEO, David Solomon, made the following comments:', '""It\'s hard for me to see the market\'s view of seven cuts this year. I do think there\'s a reasonable possibility of some interest rate cuts and some easing. But it\'s really gonna be dependent on what the data says and how the economy transmits through the year.""', ""Morgan Stanley's (NYSE:MS) CEO, Ted Pick, also made a few comments on the subject:"", '""I do think we are probably past peak inflation. What\'s interesting though is that it is not inconceivable that we have to go faster, i.e., 50 basis points, if you sort of price that as 5% or 10%.""', 'Huntington Bancshares CEO, Steve Steinour, joined CNBC\'s ""Power Lunch"" on January 20 to discuss the above as well. On the impact of rate cuts on the financial sector, Steinour made the following comments:', '""If it\'s three or four cuts, it\'s helpful. If it\'s six or seven, that might imply a soft economy and that would not be helpful to us or anyone else. But we model it both ways, and in either direction, we\'ve got a very tight net interest margin - part of that through hedging.""', ""These observations brought Steinour to several conclusions, the most important one being that in the light of a Fed pivot, big banks will gain confidence in loaning to the general public. Generally speaking, Steinour believes that business is good in the banking sector so far this year. He noted that on multiple indicator fronts, including housing prices, things are continuing to look good, the consumer is still seen to be reasonably strong, and businesses are continuing to have a good year. The Federal Reserve's rate pivot in this atmosphere is thus considered to be helpful."", 'Considering these observations, investors in the financial sector can expect financial stocks, including big bank stocks, to have a strong start to the year. As such, we have compiled a list of some of the best financial stocks to buy now.

PayPal’s rapidly growing payment processing brand, Braintree, represents one of those revenue growth opportunities, either by raising prices, as the Company had previously used a low-price strategy to establish a beachhead in this market, or by adding value-added services. PayPal’s branded checkout remains the largest volume and profit driver for the business, and we expect this to continue to track in-line with e-commerce growth in the near term, and eventually take share as the Company rolls out new features to its over +400 million users and +30 million merchants.

While many experts caution against falling into yield traps, historical data suggests that high-yield stocks have performed well. However, combining both dividend growth and high yield can be a powerful strategy to maximize returns. One example is the S&P Sector-Neutral High Yield Dividend Aristocrats (HYDA) index, which aims to blend dividend growth with higher relative yield while maintaining sector weights similar to the S&P Composite 1500. This index is noted for its defensive characteristics. According to a report from S&P Dow Jones Indices, it has historically provided a buffer against market volatility. On average, the index has outperformed the benchmark when the VIX level, a measure of market volatility, was above 20, with the strongest outperformance seen when the VIX level was above 30. The report further noted that from January 31, 2005, to July 31, 2023, the index's overall return was nearly the same as the benchmark. That said, the S&P Sector-Neutral HYDA showed lower volatility throughout the entire period compared to the benchmark, resulting in better risk-adjusted returns. Moreover, the maximum drawdown experienced during that time frame was reduced by around 5%, indicating a more resilient performance during market downturns."", ""Given investors' preference for dividend-paying stocks and their track record of returns, numerous companies are striving to initiate, sustain, and enhance their dividend payouts. In a notable recent development, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has commenced paying a quarterly cash dividend to its shareholders. This move underscores the increasing popularity of dividends in the market. Notably, Morningstar analysts have observed a significant rise in the funds targeting dividend-paying stocks, with the total amount reaching $1 trillion. This figure has been growing at a rate of 10% annually since 2018, indicating a robust and expanding interest in dividend investments."", 'Dividend stocks have consistently gained traction due to their resilience and strong performance during previous periods of inflation. Over time, dividends have been a significant contributor, comprising approximately 40% of the total return of the S&P 500 since 1930. However, during decades characterized by high inflation rates, such as the 1940s, 1970s, and 1980s, where inflation averaged 5% or more, dividends accounted for an even larger portion, generating 54% of the total return. Naveed Rahman, co-manager of the Fidelity Equity-Income Strategy, highlighted this trend. He also emphasized that while seeking the best-performing dividend stocks today, investors may need to look beyond the traditional industries or sectors that have historically dominated such investments.

We're gathering data, which indicate that Rayaldee may slow chronic kidney disease progression. Some of you have been asking about my long-time enthusiasm for our once-weekly oxyntomodulin product to treat type two diabetes and obesity. You'll remember that we had completed a successful Phase two trial achieving significant weight loss lowering of serum cholesterol and triglycerides and lowered A1C levels with the way the Phase three trial when other products appeared which provided greater weight loss, noting the great commercial success of these products, we decided to have a closer look at ours. The polyethylene glycol PEG added to our base peptide to increase its half-life is large and bulky and increase the viscosity of the injection, which limit the maximum dose administered, which is related to the amount of weight loss. We have now found a substitute for PEG, which makes our molecule size similar to those on the market with guarded optimism. We're in early stages of preclinical evaluation of this product. Switching to our international business, our goal at Uber America, fine tech and urgent are all doing well turning to Bio-Reference Health, our team has worked hard to improve our cost structure and enhance revenue. In addition to our expense reduction efforts by reference has been aiming to drive growth in higher value segments with new tests, larger customers and better insurance reimbursement. We are laser focused on returning this segment to profitability in the near term. And again, LEOs will provide more detail. With that overview, I'll turn it over to Elias."", 'Elias Zerhouni', ""Thank you, Phil, and good afternoon, everyone. As Phil mentioned, last year was quite eventful for both of our operating segments. Of CorVel. And again, a lot launches in all major global markets, as mentioned by Phil, is progressing well and we believe this drug is well positioned for significant growth. This next-generation long-acting therapies administered once a week and not daily and assist in easing the burden, especially for the pediatric market and increases medication adherence. Again, loan or annual growth is anticipated to be in excess of 12% as part of our partnership with Pfizer, of course, entitled to an additional $100 million milestone payments associated with approvals for the new adult indication for growth hormone deficiency and additional pediatric indications. These are global registration strategies underway for the adult application and other Petra pediatric indications, which are currently in Phase three clinical trials Phil also mentioned our success last year securing collaborations for Monex therapeutics with Varda and Mark most recently with borrow secured an initial 59 million grant to fund R&D and clinical evaluation for a Phase one study of our multi-specific antibodies against known variants of source code, the two for the treatment as well as prevention of COVID-19, which remains in particular travel especially for immunocompromised patients. Additional funding of up to $109 million based upon the achievement of certain milestones in the first phase may be available from Varda to develop more multi-specific antibodies targeting other viral pathogens such as influenza and as part of the research program, gene-based delivery methods for the multi-specific antibodies will be developed using mRNA or DNA vectors to supplement the body's natural product protein production processes and hopefully provide partner with a platform that can be used very quickly for any emerging player. In addition, we announced the collaboration with Merck to develop MDX. 2201, which is our Epstein-Barr virus multivalent nanoparticle vaccine. We received a $50 million upfront payment for the license of this vaccine with a potential 872.5 million in development and commercial milestones and scale royalties on global sales ranging from single digit to double digit percentages this program truly Macrovision's Medex nanoparticle based vaccine platform, which enables simultaneous position against several major HBV proteins in this case for major EV proteins. But the platform itself has the potential to, in fact, address multiple antigens against multiple viral viral viral diseases. The market opportunity here is quite large as the Epstein-Barr virus affects up to 95% of the global adult population during their lifetime. Moreover, there are over 260,000 cancer cases annually caused by EBV, along with an association between multiple sclerosis and this virus. We're working with Merck on IND-enabling studies, and we expect Phase one clinical trials to start later this year to round out our Model X pipeline, we have partnered with the NIH to develop an anti-viral multispecific antibody focused on the treatment and prevention of HIV. We've had success with our first generation candidate in a Phase one trial, and we are moving forward with a more potent next-generation Tetra specific antibody versus the previous trispecific one, we believe there is an unmet need for therapies that can provide longer-acting protection treatment for patients who require options beyond small molecule based therapies. And lastly, our immuno-oncology programs, our focus on hard-to-treat solid tumors as well as liquid tumors such as leukemias and lymphomas, are multi-specific antibody candidate can simultaneously target several tumor antigens and enable better control of the immune system activation. Our Tetra specific laser program to treat solid tumors is expected to enter the clinic. The first half of this year. Now I'd like to turn to review of our Diagnostics segment. Bio-reference fell to 2020. 23 was a transition year for our diagnostics division as we get closer to turning the corner to profitability. As you know, we implemented our recent initiative to reduce costs, improve efficiency and enhance productivity. For example, we've reduced our headcount by 8% or 252 headcount into 2023. In parallel, we're driving growth in various testing segments, including our higher value specialty segments like oncology, women's health and urology, primarily through our proprietary 4K Score test. The forecast Cortez volume has continued to perform, and we expect these volumes to continue as the test was included in the 2023 American Urology Association and the NCNN. guidelines for early detection of prostate cancer and for follow-up after PSA screening for initial and repeat biopsy risk stratification. In addition, we expect that the recent expansion of insurance coverage will continue to bolster those levels this year. Genpath continued to launch innovative testing, including an expanded hematologic malignancy panel and introducing several new tests in the market that will sustain growth of the GenPath oncology products. Other advances have been made over the 2023 years. For example, we have signed over 300 new accounts in Q4 of 2023 with over 40,000 accessions additional accessions. And we've also signed major oncology groups like the Virginia oncology oncology oncology group with 90 oncologists, which is a component of US Oncology that started in November. So in summary, Bio-Reference has made great progress last year, and we expect to continue to build on these achievements in 2024, we narrowed our operating loss sequentially and through both expense reduction and revenue growth. We continue to feel confident that these efforts will further improve financial metrics and return this segment to profitability in the next few years. I will now turn the call over to Adam Logal to discuss our fourth quarter financial results. Adam?"", 'Adam Logal', ""Well, yes, starting with our financial pharmaceutical segment revenue increased to $57.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 from 46 million for the comparable period of 2022. Revenue from products, including our international pharmaceutical businesses and Rayaldee increased by 5.1 million, reflecting from improvements in the number of prescriptions and in overall net price. Further, revenue increased as a result of gross profit share payments from Pfizer due to the global launch of Jamelah, resulting in $12.2 million of revenue during the quarter. The fourth quarter revenue includes a catch-up payment for the US at market related to the third quarter of 3.1 million. As I mentioned last quarter, the US launch occurred mid-August and Pfizer was delayed in reporting our gross profit share amounts and as a result that were included in our third quarter results. Costs and expenses were 73.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to 68 million for the 2022 period. Research and development expenses for the fourth quarter of 23 were $18.7 million compared to 16.6 million for the comparable period of 2022. This increase reflects activities for our modem development programs, partially off set by decreased spending on in Genoa as well as an R&D tax credit for our REO activity. The resulting operating loss for the quarter ended December 31st, 2023 was 16 million, a $6 million improvement from the operating loss of $22 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Amortization expenses related to intangible assets were 16.4 million and $16.5 million for the 2023 and 2022 fourth quarters, respectively. Moving to our Diagnostics segment, we reported revenue for Q4 2023 of 124.2 million compared with 139.4 million for the 2022 period. This decline primarily reflects lower COVID testing of 7.1 million, as well as a change to our estimated collections of 8.1 million, partially offset by increased testing volumes. Cost of expenses increased to 166.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 from 162.5 million for the 2022 period. Operating loss for our Diagnostic segment and included a change in estimated collections as well as approximately 4.7 million of nonrecurring costs related to employee severance and retention programs associated with our efforts to return to profitability depreciation and amortization expense were 8.1 and 8.7 million for the 2023 and 2022 periods, respectively. Turning to our consolidated financial results for the first fourth quarter of 2023, we reported an operating loss of 69.1 million compared to an operating loss of 55.3 million for the 2022 quarter. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 66.5 million, or $0.09 per share, which compares with a net loss of 85.2 million or $0.11 per share for the 2022 quarter, reflecting lower noncash mark-to-market losses related to our investment in GDS. I'd like to briefly comment on our balance sheet and the really recently completed refinancing of our convertible debt. On December 31st, we had two convertible debt issuances that were set to mature in early 2025, our 4.5% notes, which were held by a number of institutions in our 5% notes, which were primarily held by Dr. Frost, Dr. Hsiao and a long-term investor bucket. In consultation with our advisers at JPMorgan, we chose to issue new five year notes, reducing our coupon interest rate to 3.75% and took advantage of the strong demand from institutional investors to raise a total of 230 million. We used the proceeds to buy back the outstanding 4.5% notes and the 55 million shares of our common stock, and we added approximately 25 million in cash to our balance sheet. Our 5% note holders exchanged their principal and accrued interest of approximately $71.1 million into notes with identical financial terms as the 3.75% note holders, this refinancing strengthen our balance sheet, reduce the number of shares outstanding and provided the company with additional cash to fund our ongoing development activities. The offering was oversubscribed and brought in an impressive group of new prominent investors to OpCo during 2024, we anticipate receipt of a receipt receipt of additional non-dilutive cash payments under our existing collaborations with Merck, Varda and other potential transactions as the year progresses. As we look ahead, we're providing the following financial guidance with the following assumptions for our pharmaceutical segment. There are a number of factors that impact our gross profit share payments from Pfizer including revenue from product sales of Genotropin antigen and general global sales of Genotropin for 2023, as reported by Pfizer were 539 million. Pfizer is not separately reported sales of in Jamelah. However, we have observed consistent prescription growth globally for generalists as reported by IQVIA and Symphony. As such, for the full year, we estimate our gross profit share will be between 40 and 50 million. Although we anticipate that a number of scenarios may impact sales of unit troponin and GEN-1 globally, we assume stable foreign exchange rate for ex U.S. pharmaceutical businesses, which will allow for continued and profitable growth. R&D expenses for the first quarter of 2024 will reflect higher activities related to our Mode X programs, including CMC and efforts related to the initiation of our fuse first immuno-oncology clinical trial. Those increased activities will be partially funded through our barter agreement and partially offset by lower R&D costs related to the wind-down of our clinical operations for the ongoing open-label pediatric extension study for Jamba, which we expect to substantially complete by the end of the first quarter for our Diagnostics segment. As Elias outlined, we are diligently working to align the business to achieve cash flow breakeven by the middle of 2024 and profitability by the end of the year. This work includes consolidating our geographic footprint and rationalizing our test offerings. As a result, we expect our client mix to improve and cost structure to appropriately support our go-forward strategy. During this transition phase, we expect consistent core testing volumes with a slight increase in the average per patient collection amounts to order up due to our revenue cycle management initiatives, partially offset by volume impact due to several weather events that occurred during the first quarter, although before considering any nonrecurring costs that may result from our restructuring activities, we expect our costs and expenses to decline sequentially by 7 million to approximately 159 million. As a result, we expect the following for the first quarter of 2024, total revenues between 180,000,185 million dollars, revenue from services between 126 and $130 million, revenue from product sales between 36 and $40 million and other revenue between 14 and 18 million, inclusive of the estimated Pfizer gross profit share payments between nine and 11 million. We expect first quarter costs and expenses to be between 235 and $245 million, including R&D expense between 20 and $29 million, dependent on the timing for certain CMC activities for our modem programs and depreciation and amortization expense of 26 million. That concludes our prepared remarks, and thank you for your attention. Operator, let's open the call for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Jeffrey Cohen, Ladenburg.', 'Jeffrey Cohen', ""Well, good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for taking our questions. I guess first to add and could you just we can't your financials with regard to the the 4.5% and 5% instruments out there. So currently then share count is down toward approximately 701 would be on appropriate cash and debt levels we have on we're estimating pro forma."", 'Adam Logal', 'Yes. So we ended ended the year with 95 million in cash. So if you pro forma and the additional 25 million, that would put us right at right at about 120 million in cash on a pro forma basis, the total convertible notes were just over 300 million. So just right at 300 million in principle, you got the share count, right, that the Ocampo.', 'Jeffrey Cohen', ""Okay, perfect. Got crude on to one of you discuss a little bit about on the press release with regard to the Alibaba on global platform in China and talk about perhaps some of the products that you're planning on offering, what would we should expect as far centers during 24?"", 'Phillip Frost', ""The products involved are made by our Irish company and the I'm sorry, by our Spanish company and or primarily nutritional products for animals for which there appears to be a large market in China and it is just beginning. So there's not much else to say about it Okay. And then lastly for us, can you provide any commentary on general and January going to weekly and what you've learned or what Pfizer's learned perhaps, you know, versus what you anticipated as far as costs and transference of patients from one to the other and new patients and how that may look over the coming year?"", 'Adam Logal', ""I'll start off, Jeff, as though so, you know, I think what we've seen in the markets that are the most mature from from Pfizer where they launched initially, as you know, good steady growth in the conversion is happening broadly. I think with one of the competitors launching a bit earlier in the US market, we've seen that that conversion happen similar to really what we've seen globally. We expect that to continue and accelerate as Pfizer enters the market as well as if Novo eventually enters the market and with their long acting products. So the conversions are happening and we expect those to accelerate over the next 18 to 24 months."", 'Jeffrey Cohen', ""Okay. Perfect. And then lastly, on reality test sounds like you're expecting growth and will affect Q4 had some strong lifts identify for us where they may be coming from either demographically or geographically or pricing-wise and what we should expect for that."", 'Adam Logal', ""So Charlie, do you want to cut? Yes, happy to do that. So we're seeing growth for a number of reasons with the reality brand."", 'Phillip Frost', 'First is the obvious passing of the adverse effects of the pandemic, which slowed the ability of our sales force to get into clinics and promote the brands.', 'Adam Logal', 'And it also slowed the ability of patients to get into the clinics to get prescriptions. That seems to have abated as of the beginning of Q2 of last year. In addition, our sales force is much more adept now at moving the product into areas of business that have low co-pays.', 'Phillip Frost', 'This would include the Medicaid sector. This includes the low-income subsidy Medicare Part D patients, and it also includes the commercial patients who have zero co-pay.', 'Adam Logal', 'So these are the main drivers of the growth in the business.', 'Jeffrey Cohen', ""Okay. Got it. It seems like it's on a nice trajectory, our first cover currently. Okay. I think that does it for us and thanks for taking all the questions."", 'Operator', 'Maury Raycroft, Jefferies.', 'Maury Raycroft', 'Thanks for taking our questions. Tom, I was wondering if you can talk more about timing and next steps for general label expansions for the adult setting in additional pediatric indications.', 'Elias Zerhouni', ""Quickly on the adult indication, basically, we are in the process with Pfizer, obviously to put our application to the FDA. And as I mentioned in my comments, we're in that it was the end of Phase three for the pediatric indication. So timing wise, you know, probably the end of the year, beginning of next year for the adult and probably early next year for the pediatrics, if I could as well."", 'Adam Logal', ""Got it. Okay. And then and then for profit share with Pfizer. Just wanted to make sure I heard this correctly that the guidance for 2024 is 40 to 50 million. Is that right? And wondering if there are more details you can provide on the profit share currently and how that will change as a general, it takes more market share from Genotropin and what would a peak profit share percent look like? Sure. So somewhere, you know, the way the 40 to 50, you're correct, is the full year guide based on the information we know today. Right? So Pfizer, Pfizer doesn't separately forecast out in general or or Genotropin sales. So we're using our internal models to calculate what we anticipate the franchise revenues to be globally and then and then we apply the various tables that we have to to come up with our estimated calculation. So we've got some conservatism built into that with some uncertainty on the daily portion for Genotropin and a modest growth rates that we would expect for in general. And so you've got the 40 to 50, right. So in the fourth quarter, if you look if you take out the the third quarter catch-up, we had about $9 million in gross profit share payments. So when you think about that modest growth that we're forecasting in the gross profit share, you can see you can you can see what that math kind of looks like. Overall, when we look out at peak, when you look at the growth hormone franchise as a whole. So the combination of in general and Genotropin when when the product is at its peak, where we think the peak could be and I think Pfizer has stated what they think the total market potential is for Jamelah and it's a substantial substantial revenue stream. We've estimated an effective royalty rate to be in the mid 20s on that franchise. So at peak, it's a pretty substantial cash flow. And we would expect to see the growth from now until we hit that peak kind of anything."", 'Maury Raycroft', ""That's helpful. And maybe last question, just on oxyntomodulin, if you could talk about time lines for the new formulation and what would a clinical development path look like there? And is this something you're going to keep in-house or partner out and does leader. Matt have any rights to this product?"", 'Phillip Frost', ""I think with respect to both of those questions, it's early we'll get back to you as soon as we have something more definitive to talk about understanding."", 'Maury Raycroft', 'Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.', 'Operator', 'Edward Tenthoff, Piper Sandler.', 'Edward Tenthoff', ""Great. Good evening, everyone. So two quick questions, if I may. Firstly, just at a high level with respect to again love versus schedule, what are the differences that Pfizer is pushing in terms of marketing or is it really just a land grab at this point where they're going to the Genotropin clients and converting them over? And, you know, basically trying to get into as many other accounts as possible. And then the second question, really for Phil high level as Bio-Reference and the diagnostic business returns to breakeven is the plan here still to keep that as part of OpCo or potentially to monetize that, how you have for some of the other arm diagnostic segment, flash problem on how do you ultimately see that business being pharma and diagnostic going forward? Thanks."", 'Phillip Frost', ""Well, for those of you who know me, you realize that first and foremost, we will always know what's in the best interest and the shareholders in terms of creating value. So at a particular point in time, it is one approach is advisable. We'll certainly consider it seriously. I don't want to be more specific than that right now, it's clear that we have an asset on our books that is at the moment losing money, although we're very optimistic about turning that around that has inherent value as an asset. And so we're very mindful of that, be assured."", 'Adam Logal', ""Yes, thank you. And then on the competition and sort of, you know, a little bit more on marketing in the long acting or weekly? Congrats on that. Yes. So obviously, Pfizer is leading the charge on the commercial efforts. So so where we think that they are going to be very successful is in the near term is where they're alone in the market, right? So when you think about the Japanese market, which is a substantial market in for the growth hormone space where they're by themselves currently, they've they had meaningful market share penetration and continued growth. And there's a number of other countries where they're by themselves. Now they've they've done a great job marketing throughout Europe as well and enforcing or forcing the conversion or suggesting the conversion there as well. On the US market, it's they've got access commercially to a strong number of plans. We think they're well positioned with their with their teams to go ahead and take substantial share in the U.S. as well as far as how they're going to go about that. I think that's a question for Pfizer to answer. Okay, great. Thank you, guys. Next question comes from Nick Chan of H.C. Wainwright & Co. Go ahead. Your line is open. Are you needed on your end about a year? We can hear you now."", 'Elias Zerhouni', ""I'll sorry about that so much regarding the storefront O'Malley. Bob, can you talk about the potential market size that is that, of course, the target? And what what is the potential revenue contribution in 2024 can how is the current economic environment? Could affect your market prospects and Jeff, thank you."", 'Phillip Frost', ""You know, this is a product line that is very successful sold by our Spanish unit. They manufacture the products, develop the products in and out have done so well, but are beginning to expand into France as a matter of fact, and have every intention to continue to expand geographically, we were approached by a company that has a partnership with Alibaba. And I'm thinking that because of the tremendous interest in pet animals now in China and because such products as we have are successful, that we might be willing to let them distribute them through Alibaba China. And we said why not? And that's where we are now we it's just getting go launch. So it's too early to say much more about the market size for our products sold by Alibaba, we it's a wait-and-see situation, so it's strictly animal health products, right?"", 'Adam Logal', ""There are no human products offer at this time, Mr. so the so there's a combination of human health and veterinary products that will eventually go on the plant. Right? Yes. Thank you."", 'Operator', 'This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Dr. Phillip Frost for any closing remarks.', 'Phillip Frost', ""Where we'd like to certainly thank you for participating in today's search and we hope it will close again, we'll report the first-quarter results. Thank you."", 'Operator', ""The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.""]"

These collaborations provide nondilutive funding to advance our unique pipeline to commercial realization. Specifically, last March, we announced an exclusive worldwide license and collaboration agreement with Merck to develop ModeX's nanoparticle vaccine candidate against Epstein-Barr virus. We received a sizable up-front payment and are eligible for milestone and royalty payments."", ""In September, ModeX was awarded a contract from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, known as BARDA, to develop novel multispecific antibodies against viruses that cause infectious diseases deemed to be public health threats. The BARDA contract included an initial payment to develop multispecific antibodies to treat and prevent COVID-19, and additional funding may be available to develop multispecific antibodies targeting other viral pathogens such as influenza.

And again, Elias will provide more detail. With that overview, I'll turn it over to Elias."", 'Elias Zerhouni -- Vice Chairman and President', ""Thank you, Phil, and good afternoon, everyone. As Phil mentioned, last year was quite eventful for both of our operating segments of OPKO Health. NGENLA launches in all major global markets, as mentioned by Phil, is progressing well, and we believe this drug is well-positioned for significant growth. This next-generation long-acting therapy's administered once a week and not daily and assisted easing the burden, especially for the pediatric market, and increases medication adherence."", ""NGENLA annual growth is anticipated to be in excess of 12%. But as part of our partnership with Pfizer, OPKO's [Inaudible] achieve additional $100 million in milestone payments associated with approvals for an adult indication for growth hormone deficiency and additional pediatric indications. These are global registration strategies underway for the adult application and other pediatric indications, which are currently in Phase 3 clinical trials. Phil also mentioned our success last year in securing collaborations for ModeX Therapeutics with BARDA and Merck."", ""Most recently, with BARDA, we secured an initial $59 million grant to fund R&D and clinical evaluation through a Phase 1 study of our multispecific antibodies against known variants of SARS-CoV-2 for the treatment, as well as prevention of COVID-19, which remains a particular drug, especially for immunocompromised patients. Additional funding of up to $109 million based upon the achievement of certain milestones in the first phase may be available from BARDA to develop more multispecific antibodies targeting other viral pathogens such as influenza. And as part of the research program, gene-based delivery methods for the multispecific antibodies will be developed using mRNA or DNA vectors to supplement the body's natural protein production processes and hopefully provide BARDA with a platform that can be used very quickly for any emerging platforms. In addition, we announced the collaboration with Merck to develop MDX-2201, which is our Epstein-Barr virus multivalent nanoparticle vaccine."", ""We received a $50 million up-front payment for the license of this vaccine, with a potential $872.5 million in development and commercial milestones and scaled royalties on global sales, ranging from single-digit to double-digit percentages. This program truly leverages ModeX's nanoparticle-based vaccine platform, which enables simultaneous immunization against several major EBV proteins, in this case, four major EBV proteins, but the platform itself has the potential to, in fact, address multiple antigens against multiple viral diseases. The market opportunity here is quite large, as the Epstein-Barr virus affects up to 95% of the global adult population during their lifetime. Moreover, there are over 260,000 cancer cases annually caused by EBV along with an association between multiple sclerosis and this virus."", ""We're working with Merck on IND clinical studies, and we expect Phase 1 clinical trials to start later this year. To round out our ModeX pipeline, we have partnered with the NIH to develop an antiviral multispecific antibody focused on the treatment and prevention of HIV. We've had success with our first-generation candidate in the Phase 1 trial, and we are moving forward with a more potent next-generation tetraspecific antibody versus the previous trispecific one. We believe there is an unmet need for a therapy that can provide long-acting protection and treatment for patients who require options beyond small molecule-based therapies."", 'And lastly, our immuno-oncology programs. Our focus on hard-to-treat solid tumors, as well as liquid tumors such as leukemias and lymphomas. Our multispecific antibody candidates can simultaneously target several tumor antigens and enable better control of immune system activation. Our tetraspecific laser program to treat solid tumors is expected to enter the clinic the first half of this year.', ""Now I'd like to turn to a review of our Diagnostics segment, BioReference Health. 2023 was a transition year for our Diagnostics division as we get closer to turning the corner to profitability. As you know, we implemented our REACH initiatives to reduce costs, improve efficiency and enhance productivity. For example, we've reduced our headcount by 8% or 252 headcount in 2023."", ""In parallel, we're driving growth in various testing segments, including our higher-value specialty segments like oncology, women's health and in urology, primarily through our proprietary 4Kscore test. The 4Kscore test volume has continued to perform, and we expect these volumes to continue as the test was included in the 2023 American Urology Association and the NCNN guidelines for early detection of prostate cancer and for follow-up after PSA screening for initial and repeat biopsy risk stratification. In addition, we expect that the recent expansion of insurance coverage will continue to bolster levels this year. GenPath continued to launch innovative testing, including an expanded hematologic malignancy panel and introducing several new tests in the market that will sustain growth of the GenPath oncology products."", ""Other advances have been made over the 2023 year. For example, we have signed over 300 new accounts in the fourth quarter of 2023 with over 40,000 accessions, additional accessions. And we've also signed major oncology groups like the Virginia Oncology group with 90 oncologists which is a component of US Oncology that started in November. So in summary, BioReference Health made great progress last year, and we expect to continue to build on these achievements in 2024."", 'We narrowed our operating loss sequentially. And through both expense reduction and revenue growth, we continue to feel confident that these efforts will further improve financial metrics and return this segment to profitability in the next few years. I will now turn the call over to Adam Logal to discuss our fourth quarter financial results. Adam?', 'Adam Logal -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Thank you, Elias. Starting with our pharmaceuticals segment. Revenue increased to $57.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 from $46 million for the comparable period of 2022. Revenue from products, including our international pharmaceutical businesses and RAYALDEE, increased by $5.1 million, reflecting from improvements in the number of prescriptions and in overall net price.', 'Further, revenue increased as a result of gross profit share payments from Pfizer due to the global launch of NGENLA, resulting in $12.2 million of revenue during the quarter. The fourth quarter revenue includes a catch-up payment for the U.S. market related to the third quarter of $3.1 million. As I mentioned last quarter, the U.S.', ""launch occurred mid-August, and Pfizer was delayed in reporting our gross profit share amounts. And as a result, none were included in our third quarter results. Costs and expenses were $73.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $68 million for the 2022 period. Research and development expenses for the fourth quarter of '23 were $18.7 million, compared to $16.6 million for the comparable period of 2022."", 'This increase reflects activities for our ModeX development programs, partially offset by decreased spending on NGENLA, as well as an R&D tax credit for our Irish activities. The resulting operating loss for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, was $16 million, a $6 million improvement from the operating loss of $22 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Amortization expenses related to intangible assets were $16.4 million and $16.5 million for the 2023 and 2022 fourth quarters, respectively. Moving to our Diagnostics segment.', 'We reported revenue for Q4 2023 of $124.2 million, compared with $139.4 million for the 2022 period. This decline primarily reflects lower COVID testing of $7.1 million, as well as a change to our estimated collections of $8.1 million, partially offset by increased testing volumes. Costs and expenses increased to $166.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 from $162.5 million for the 2022 period. Operating loss for our Diagnostics segment included a change in estimated collections, as well as approximately $4.7 million of nonrecurring costs related to employee severance and retention programs associated with our efforts to return to profitability.', 'Depreciation and amortization expense were $8.1 million and $8.7 million for the 2023 and 2022 periods, respectively. Turning to our consolidated financial results. For the fourth quarter of 2023, we reported an operating loss of $69.1 million, compared to an operating loss of $55.3 million for the 2022 quarter. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $66.5 million or $0.09 per share, which compares with a net loss of $85.2 million or $0.11 per share for the 2022 quarter, reflecting lower noncash mark-to-market losses related to our investment in GeneDx.', ""I'd like to briefly comment on our balance sheet and the recently completed refinancing of our convertible debt. On December 31, we had two convertible debt issuances that were set to mature in early 2025. Our 4.5% notes, which were held by a number of institutions, and our 5% notes, which were primarily held by Dr. Frost, Dr."", 'Hsiao and a long-term investor of OPKO. In consultation with our advisors at J.P. Morgan, we chose to issue new five-year notes, reducing our coupon interest rate to 3.75% and took advantage of the strong demand from institutional investors to raise a total of $230 million. We used the proceeds to buy back the outstanding 4.5% notes and the 55 million shares of our common stock, and we added approximately $25 million in cash to our balance sheet.', 'Our 5% note holders exchanged their principal and accrued interest of approximately $71.1 million into notes with identical financial terms as the 3.75% note holders. This refinancing strengthened our balance sheet, reduced the number of shares outstanding and provided the company with additional cash to fund our ongoing development activities. The offering was oversubscribed and brought in an impressive group of new prominent investors to OPKO. During 2024, we anticipate receipt of additional nondilutive cash payments under our existing collaborations with Merck, BARDA and other potential transactions as the year progresses.', ""As we look ahead, we're providing the following financial guidance with the following assumptions. For our pharmaceuticals segment, there are a number of factors that impact our gross profit share payments from Pfizer, including revenue from product sales of GENOTROPIN and NGENLA. Global sales of GENOTROPIN for 2023 as reported by Pfizer were $539 million. Pfizer has not separately reported sales of NGENLA."", 'However, we have observed consistent prescription growth globally for NGENLA as reported by IQVIA and Symphony. As such, for the full year, we estimate our gross profit share will be between $40 million and $50 million, although we anticipate that a number of scenarios may impact sales of GENOTROPIN and NGENLA globally. We assume a stable foreign exchange rate for our ex U.S. Pharmaceutical businesses, which will allow for continued and profitable growth.', 'R&D expenses for the first quarter of 2024 will reflect higher activities related to our ModeX programs, including CMC and efforts related to the initiation of our first immuno-oncology clinical trial. Those increased activities will be partially funded through our BARDA agreement and partially offset by lower R&D costs related to the wind down of our clinical operations for the ongoing open-label pediatric extension study for NGENLA, which we expect to substantially complete by the end of the first quarter. For our Diagnostics segment, as Elias outlined, we are diligently working to align the business to achieve cash flow breakeven by the middle of 2024 and profitability by the end of the year. This work includes consolidating our geographic footprint and rationalizing our test offerings.', 'As a result, we expect our client mix to improve and cost structure to appropriately support our go-forward strategy. During this transition phase, we expect consistent core testing volumes with a slight increase in the average per patient collection amount due to our revenue cycle management initiatives, partially offset by volume impact due to several weather events that occurred during the first quarter already. Before considering any nonrecurring costs that may result from our restructuring activities, we expect our costs and expenses to decline sequentially by $7 million to approximately $159 million. As a result, we expect the following for the first quarter of 2024: total revenues, between $180 million and $185 million; revenue from services, between $126 million and $130 million; revenue from product sales, between $36 million and $40 million; and other revenue, between $14 million and $18 million, inclusive of the estimated Pfizer gross profit share payments between $9 million and $11 million.', ""We expect first quarter costs and expenses to be between $235 million and $245 million, including R&D expense between $20 million and $29 million, dependent on the timing for certain CMC activities for our ModeX programs and depreciation and amortization expense of $26 million. That concludes our prepared remarks. And thank you for your attention. Operator, let's open the call for questions."", '', 'Operator', '[Operator instructions] And our first question comes from Jeffrey Cohen of Ladenburg.', 'Jeff Cohen -- Ladenburg Thalmann and Company -- Analyst', ""I guess, first, Adam, could you just recap on your financials with regard to the 4.5% and 5% instruments out there? So currently then, share count is down toward approximately 700, and then what would be appropriate cash and debt levels whereupon we're estimating pro forma?"", 'Adam Logal -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Yes. So we ended the year with $95 million in cash. So if you pro forma in the additional $25 million, that would put us right at about $120 million in cash on a pro forma basis. The total convertible notes were just over $300 million, so just right at $300 million in principal.', ""And you've got the share count right, the 700."", 'Jeff Cohen -- Ladenburg Thalmann and Company -- Analyst', ""OK. Perfect. Got it. Could one of you discuss a little bit about the press release with regard to the Alibaba global platform in China and talk about perhaps some of the products that you're planning on offering and what would -- what we should expect as far as the status during '24?"", 'Phil Frost -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""The products involved are made by our Irish company and -- I'm sorry, by our Spanish company, and are primarily nutritional products for animals, for which there appears to be a large market in China, and it is just beginning. So there's not much else to say about it."", 'Jeff Cohen -- Ladenburg Thalmann and Company -- Analyst', ""OK. Got it. And then, lastly for us, could you provide any commentary on NGENLA and daily going to weekly and what you've learned or what Pfizer's learned perhaps versus what's anticipated as far as costs and transference of patients from one to the other, new patients and how that may look over the coming year?"", 'Adam Logal -- Chief Financial Officer', ""I'll start off, Jeff. So I think, what we've seen in the markets that are the most mature from Pfizer where they launched initially is good, steady growth in the conversion is happening. Broadly, I think with one of the competitors launching a bit earlier in the U.S. market, we've seen that conversion happen, similar to what we've seen globally."", 'We expect that to continue and accelerate as Pfizer enters the market, as well as if Novo eventually enters the market with their long-acting products. So the conversions are happening, and we expect those to accelerate over the next 18 to 24 months.', 'Jeff Cohen -- Ladenburg Thalmann and Company -- Analyst', ""OK. Perfect. And then, lastly, on RAYALDEE. It sounds like you're expecting growth, and it looked like Q4 had some strong growth."", 'Could you identify for us where that may be coming from, either demographically or geographically or pricing-wise and what we should expect for that?', 'Adam Logal -- Chief Financial Officer', ""So Charlie's here, do you want to go ahead and take that one?"", 'Charlie Bishop -- Chief Executive Officer, Renal Division', ""Yes, happy to do that. So we're seeing growth for a number of reasons with the RAYALDEE brand. First is the obvious passing of the adverse effects of the pandemic, which slowed the ability of our sales force to get into clinics and promote the brand, and it also slowed the ability of patients to get into the clinics to get prescriptions. That seems to have abated as of the beginning of Q2 of last year."", 'In addition, our sales force is much more adept now at moving the product into areas of business that have low co-pays. This would include the Medicaid sector. This includes the low-income subsidy Medicare Part D patients. And it also includes the commercial patients who have zero co-pay.', 'So these are the main drivers of the growth in the business.', 'Jeff Cohen -- Ladenburg Thalmann and Company -- Analyst', ""OK. Got it. It seems like it's on a nice trajectory, post COVID currently. OK."", 'I think that does it for us.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Maury Raycroft of Jefferies.', 'Maury Raycroft -- Jefferies -- Analyst', 'I was wondering if you can talk more about timing and next steps for NGENLA label expansions for the adult setting and additional pediatric indications?', 'Elias Zerhouni -- Vice Chairman and President', ""Yes, quickly. The adult indication, basically, we're in the process with Pfizer, obviously, to put our application to the FDA. And as I mentioned in my comments, we're now toward the end of Phase 3 for the pediatric indication. So timing-wise, probably the end of the year, beginning of next year for the adult and probably early next year for the pediatrics if everything goes well."", 'Maury Raycroft -- Jefferies -- Analyst', 'Got it. OK. And then, for profit share with Pfizer, I just wanted to make sure I heard this correctly, that the guidance for 2024 is $40 million to $50 million. Is that right? And wondering if there are more details you can provide on the profit share currently and how that will change as NGENLA takes more market share from GENOTROPIN.', 'And what would a peak profit share percent look like?', 'Adam Logal -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Sure. So Maury, the way -- so the $40 million to $50 million, you're correct, is the full year guide based on the information we know today, right? So Pfizer doesn't separately forecast out NGENLA or GENOTROPIN sales. So we're using our internal models to calculate what we anticipate the franchise revenues to be globally. And then, we apply the various tables that we have to come up with our estimated calculation."", ""So we've got some conservatism built into that with some uncertainty on the daily portion for GENOTROPIN and modest growth rates that we would expect for NGENLA. So you've got the $40 million to $50 million right. So in the fourth quarter, if you take out the third quarter catch-up, we had about $9 million in gross profit share payments. So when you think about that modest growth that we're forecasting in, in the gross profit share, you can see what that math kind of looks like overall."", ""When we look out at peak, when you look at the growth hormone franchise as a whole, so the combination of NGENLA and GENOTROPIN, when the product is at its peak, where we think the peak could be, and I think Pfizer has stated what they think the total market potential is for NGENLA, it's a substantial revenue stream. We have estimated an effective royalty rate to be in the mid-20s on that franchise. So at peak, it's a pretty substantial cash flow. We would expect to see the growth from now until we hit that peak."", 'Maury Raycroft -- Jefferies -- Analyst', ""Got it. That's helpful. And maybe last question, just on oxyntomodulin. If you could talk about time lines for the new formulation and what would a clinical development path look like there? And is this something you're going to keep in-house or partner out? And does LeaderMed have any rights to this program?"", 'Phil Frost -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""I think, with respect to both of those questions, it's early. We'll get back to you as soon as we have something more definitive to talk about."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Edward Tenthoff of Piper Sandler.', 'Edward Tenthoff -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst', ""Two quick questions, if I may. Firstly, just at a high level with respect to NGENLA versus GENOTROPIN. What are the differences that Pfizer is pushing in terms of marketing? Or is it really just a land grab at this point where they're going to the GENOTROPIN clients and converting them over and basically trying to get into as many other accounts as possible? And then, the second question really for Phil. High level, as BioReference in the Diagnostic business returns to breakeven, is the plan here still to keep that as part of OPKO or potentially to monetize it, how you have for some of the other Diagnostic segment/products? Do you ultimately see this business being Pharma and Diagnostics going forward?"", 'Phil Frost -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Well, for those of you who know me, you realize that, first and foremost, we will always do what's in the best interests of the shareholders in terms of creating value. So at a particular point in time, if one approach seems advisable, we'll certainly consider it seriously. I don't want to be more specific than that right now. But it's clear that we have an asset on our books that is, at the moment, losing money, although we're very optimistic about turning that around that has inherent value as an asset."", ""And so, we're very mindful of that. Be assured."", 'Edward Tenthoff -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst', 'Yes. And then, on the competition and sort of a little bit more on the marketing and the long-acting or weekly [Inaudible].', 'Adam Logal -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes. So obviously, Pfizer is leading the charge on the commercial efforts. So where we think that they are gonna be very successful is in the near term is where they're alone in the market, right? So when you think about the Japanese market, which is a substantial market for the growth hormone space where they're by themselves currently, they've had meaningful market share penetration and continued growth. And there's a number of other countries where they by themselves."", ""They've done a great job marketing throughout Europe as well and forcing the conversion or suggesting the conversion there as well. On the U.S. market, they've got access commercially to a strong number of plans. We think they're well-positioned with their team to go ahead and take substantial share in the U.S."", ""as well. As far as how they're going to go about that, I think that's a question for Pfizer to answer."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Yi Chen of H.C. Wainright & Co.', 'Yi Chen -- H.C. Wainwright and Company -- Analyst', 'Hello?', 'Adam Logal -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Hey, Yi. We can hear you now.', 'Yi Chen -- H.C. Wainwright and Company -- Analyst', 'Sorry about that. So regarding the storefront and Alibaba. Can you talk about the potential market size that OPKO can target? And what is the potential revenue contribution in 2024? And how is the current economic environment could affect your market prospects in pet?', 'Phil Frost -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""This is a product line that is very successful and is sold by our Spanish unit. They manufacture the products, develop the products and have done so well that they're beginning to expand into France, as a matter of fact, and have every intention to continue to expand geographically. We were approached by a company that has a partnership with Alibaba. And thinking that because of the tremendous interest in pet animals now in China and because such products as we have are successful, that we might be willing to let them distribute them through Alibaba in China."", ""And we said, why not? And that's where we are now. It's just getting launched. So it's too early to say much more about the market size for our products that is sold by Alibaba. It's a wait-and-see situation."", 'Yi Chen -- H.C. Wainwright and Company -- Analyst', 'So strictly animal health products, right? There are no human products offered on this storefront?', 'Adam Logal -- Chief Financial Officer', ""So there's a combination of human health and veterinary products that will eventually go on the platform."", 'Yi Chen -- H.C. Wainwright and Company -- Analyst', 'Right. All right.', 'Operator', 'This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Dr. Phillip Frost for any closing remarks.', 'Phil Frost -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Well, we'd like to certainly thank you for participating in today's session.

To skip our detailed analysis of the financial sector, you can go directly to see 5 Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.', 'The financial sector went through a good amount of volatility last year, and many are now beginning to wonder whether the volatility will continue in 2024. No one can fully predict the likelihood of this happening, and yet for some, it may not be an unlikely development. However, this January, CEOs from major big banks made statements highlighting their hopes for the financial sector in 2024, particularly for big banks, in the event of a Federal Reserve ""pivot"" on their interest rate hikes.', 'On January 20, CNBC\'s ""Power Lunch"" highlighted some statements made by several big bank CEOs on this matter. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\'s (NYSE:GS) CEO, David Solomon, made the following comments:', '""It\'s hard for me to see the market\'s view of seven cuts this year. I do think there\'s a reasonable possibility of some interest rate cuts and some easing. But it\'s really gonna be dependent on what the data says and how the economy transmits through the year.""', ""Morgan Stanley's (NYSE:MS) CEO, Ted Pick, also made a few comments on the subject:"", '""I do think we are probably past peak inflation. What\'s interesting though is that it is not inconceivable that we have to go faster, i.e., 50 basis points, if you sort of price that as 5% or 10%.""', 'Huntington Bancshares CEO, Steve Steinour, joined CNBC\'s ""Power Lunch"" on January 20 to discuss the above as well. On the impact of rate cuts on the financial sector, Steinour made the following comments:', '""If it\'s three or four cuts, it\'s helpful. If it\'s six or seven, that might imply a soft economy and that would not be helpful to us or anyone else. But we model it both ways, and in either direction, we\'ve got a very tight net interest margin - part of that through hedging.""', ""These observations brought Steinour to several conclusions, the most important one being that in the light of a Fed pivot, big banks will gain confidence in loaning to the general public. Generally speaking, Steinour believes that business is good in the banking sector so far this year. He noted that on multiple indicator fronts, including housing prices, things are continuing to look good, the consumer is still seen to be reasonably strong, and businesses are continuing to have a good year. The Federal Reserve's rate pivot in this atmosphere is thus considered to be helpful."", 'Considering these observations, investors in the financial sector can expect financial stocks, including big bank stocks, to have a strong start to the year.

AMZN.', 'The restructuring was initiated after the retail giant Walmart Inc. (WMT) decided on a 3-to-1 stock split. Unlike the other two major stock indexes — the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — the Dow is a price-weighted index and not a market-capital-weighted index.', 'The Dow, which started its journey in May 1896, is always inclined toward old-economy cyclical sectors like industrials, financials and oil-energy.

In 2023, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 43.4%. The broad-market S&P 500 Index also saw an impressive rally of 23.9%. However, the Dow was up just 13.7%. Year to date, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are up 3.3%, 7.1%, and 8.6%, respectively.', 'Inclusion of Amazon is seen as a strategic move to increase the blue-chip index’s exposure to new-economy stocks.

Already, deepfakes are being used to spread election disinformation, capitalize on unsanctioned imitations of musicians, and create nonconsensual pornography of minors, private citizens, and celebrities alike. And as AI capabilities continue to improve, these challenges will become even more pernicious.', ""What this moment requires is both technical and legal solutions. That's why IBM (NYSE: IBM) signed the\xa0Tech Accord to Combat Deceptive Use of AI in 2024 Elections (Munich Tech Accord), pledging to help mitigate the risks of AI being used to deceive the public and undermine elections. It's also why IBM has long advocated for regulations that precisely target harmful applications of technology."", 'We outline below three key priorities for policymakers to mitigate the harms of deepfakes:', 'Protecting elections,', 'Protecting creators, and', ""Protecting people's privacy"", 'Protecting elections ', ""Democracy depends on a population's ability to participate in free and fair elections. Unfortunately, bad actors can use deepfakes to impersonate public officials and candidates to deceive voters in a variety of ways that would undermine this key principle. For example, deepfakes could mislead voters about where, when, and how they can vote, or falsely portray a candidate making controversial statements or participating in scandalous activity."", 'Policymakers should prohibit the distribution of materially deceptive deepfake content related to elections. For example, the Protect Elections from Deceptive AI Act, introduced by Senators Klobuchar, Hawley, Coons, and Collins, would curtail the use of AI to generate deceptive content falsely depicting federal candidates in political advertisements with the intent of influencing an election. Other policy approaches could enable candidates targeted by materially deceptive AI-generated content used in political advertisements or fundraising campaigns to seek damages or remove deceptive content, while preserving protections for free speech.', 'In the EU, IBM has been supportive of the Digital Services Act, which imposes on large internet platforms certain obligations regarding the moderation of online content. Recent guidelines published by the European Commission have also proposed additional requirements for consumer-facing platforms to mitigate against ""systemic risks for electoral processes.""', 'Protecting creators', ""Musicians, artists, actors, and creators of all kinds use their talents and likeness to help shape culture, inspire, entertain, and make a living. Deepfakes can enable bad actors to exploit creators' likenesses to push deceptive advertising, scam and mislead consumers, improperly reduce a creator's ability to profit from their talents, and more."", 'Policymakers should hold people accountable for producing unauthorized deepfakes of creator performances and hold platforms accountable if they knowingly disseminate such unauthorized content. Some jurisdictions already have what are known as ""likeness laws"" that prohibit the unauthorized use of a person\'s likeness for commercial exploitation, but these can be inconsistent, and few explicitly cover digital replicas or the rights to use a person\'s likeness after they die. Given these jurisdictional inconsistencies, IBM supports the NO FAKES Act in the U.S., which would create federal protections for individuals whose voices and/or likenesses are generated by third parties without their consent.', ""Protecting people's privacy"", 'Everyday people are already being harmed by deepfakes in profoundly concerning ways, particularly by bad actors using their likeness to create nonconsensual pornography. This abuse primarily targets women, victims have included minors, and could potentially enable further abuse and extortion by bad actors. Nonconsensual sharing of intimate imagery, also known as revenge porn, is expanding with the use of deepfakes but ultimately is not a new problem. But few existing laws adequately hold bad actors accountable for sharing or threatening to share this material, or necessarily cover AI-generated content.', 'Policymakers should create strong criminal and civil liability for people that distribute nonconsensual intimate audiovisual content, including AI-generated content, as well as for people that threaten to do so. Penalties should be particularly severe when the victim is a minor. Legislators can act on this recommendation now by supporting and passing the bipartisan Preventing Deepfakes of Intimate Images Act in the U.S. This bill would create liability for individuals who disclose, or threaten to disclose, a nonconsensual intimate digital depiction of someone, including AI-generated content, and allow affected parties to pursue damages. This legislation would create a much-needed federal baseline of accountability that is inconsistently addressed in various revenge porn laws at the state level, providing greater protections for victims and individuals across the United States.', ""The EU AI Act – which IBM has long-supported – already addresses many of these types of issues, covering deepfakes more generally and imposing transparency requirements that clarify when particular content is not authentic. As policymakers look towards the Act's implementation in the coming months, particular attention should be paid to ensuring individuals are protected from non-consensual intimate audiovisual content."", 'Conclusion', ""Solving the problems posed by deepfakes will require thoughtful, whole-of-society approaches leveraging both changes in law and technology. Technology companies have a responsibility to pursue technical and governance solutions that address AI-generated content, such as those articulated in the Munich Accord, the White House Voluntary AI Commitments, and Canada's Voluntary Code of Conduct on the Responsible Development and Management of Advanced Generative AI Systems."", 'IBM encourages policymakers to seize this opportunity to swiftly target three of the most significant harmful applications of deepfakes to ensure that AI remains a positive force for the global economy and society.', 'Media Contact:Ashley Brightbrighta@us.ibm.com', 'View original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ibm-heres-what-policymakers-can-do-about-deepfakes-302073471.html', 'SOURCE IBM', 'View original content to download multimedia: http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/February2024/28/c0925.html']"

GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with WAT.', ""On February 27, 2024, Waters Corporation (NYSE:WAT), a global leader in analytical instruments and software, filed its annual 10-K report with the SEC. This SWOT analysis delves into the financials and strategic positioning of Waters Corp, as disclosed in the filing. The company, renowned for its high-performance liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, and thermal analysis tools, serves a diverse clientele, including pharmaceutical, industrial, and academic sectors. In 2023, Waters Corp invested $175 million in research and development, underscoring its commitment to innovation. Despite a competitive landscape, the company's strategic focus on organic growth and talent development positions it well for future success. This analysis aims to provide investors with a comprehensive understanding of Waters Corp's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as it navigates the dynamic market environment."", ""Market Leadership and Innovation: Waters Corp's long-standing reputation as a pioneer in analytical instruments is a testament to its market leadership. The company's significant investment in research and development, amounting to $175 million in 2023, has fueled continuous innovation. With a robust product pipeline and a new research laboratory in Cambridge, MA, Waters Corp is well-positioned to maintain its technological edge. Its commitment to innovation is further evidenced by its global workforce, with approximately 1,200 employees dedicated to research and development efforts."", ""Strong Customer Base: Waters Corp's financial stability is anchored by a diverse and loyal customer base. In 2022, the company generated 59% of its sales from pharmaceutical customers, reflecting its strong foothold in the industry. The acquisition of Wyatt Technology has expanded Waters Corp's portfolio, particularly in large molecule applications, which is expected to further solidify its market position. The company's ability to retain and grow its customer base, especially in the pharmaceutical sector, is a key strength that supports its revenue streams."", ""Geopolitical and Economic Sensitivity: With approximately 69% of its net sales generated outside the United States in 2023, Waters Corp is susceptible to geopolitical and economic disruptions. The company's significant exposure to international markets, including China, where sales declined by 22% in 2023, highlights the risks associated with global operations. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of trade policies can adversely affect Waters Corp's financial performance."", 'Workforce Reduction: In July 2023, Waters Corp underwent organizational changes that resulted in a workforce reduction of approximately 5%. While intended to align resources with growth and innovation strategies, such reductions can temporarily disrupt operations and potentially affect employee morale. The challenge for Waters Corp is to manage these changes effectively to minimize any negative impact on productivity and corporate culture.', ""Expansion into Emerging Markets: Waters Corp's strategic acquisitions, such as Wyatt Technology, provide opportunities to tap into new markets and applications. The company's focus on large molecule applications is timely, given the growing importance of biologics in the pharmaceutical industry. By leveraging its expanded product portfolio, Waters Corp can capture a larger share of the emerging markets and drive revenue growth."", ""Advancements in Health and Safety: The company's commitment to health and safety, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, positions it as a responsible and forward-thinking organization. Waters Corp's emphasis on creating a safe workplace and its role in manufacturing products essential to critical infrastructure can enhance its brand reputation and open doors to new business opportunities."", 'Intense Competition: The analytical instrument market is highly competitive, with several global suppliers vying for market share. Waters Corp faces competition from companies like Agilent Technologies, Shimadzu Corporation, and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., which continuously introduce new products. The company must innovate and differentiate its offerings to maintain its competitive position.', 'Regulatory and Environmental Challenges: Waters Corp operates in a heavily regulated industry, where changes in governmental regulations can impact its business. Additionally, the growing global debate on climate change and environmental sustainability presents challenges. The company must navigate these regulatory landscapes and adapt its operations to meet evolving standards, which could incur additional costs and affect its profitability.', ""In conclusion, Waters Corp (NYSE:WAT) exhibits a robust set of strengths, including market leadership and a strong customer base, which are foundational to its success. However, it must navigate weaknesses such as sensitivity to geopolitical and economic factors and manage workforce changes effectively. The company's opportunities lie in expanding into emerging markets and capitalizing on advancements in health and safety. Nevertheless, threats from intense competition and regulatory challenges must be addressed strategically. Overall, Waters Corp's forward-looking strategies and commitment to innovation position it well to leverage its strengths and opportunities while mitigating its weaknesses and threats in the dynamic market landscape."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

With that, I will turn the call over to Andres.', 'Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert', ""Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial review call. Today, I will discuss our 2023 strategic and financial performance. Stephen Coughlin, our CFO, will discuss our financial results and outlook in more detail shortly. Beginning on Slide 3. 2023 was our best year ever, as we met or exceeded all of our strategic and financial objectives, including signing a record of 5.6 gigawatts of new PPAs, putting us well on track to achieve 14 to 17 gigawatts of new signings through 2025. Completing 3.5 gigawatts of construction, exceeding the target we laid out and doubling our additions compared to 2022. Delivering adjusted EBITDA of $2.8 billion in the top end of our guidance range and adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes of $3.4 billion. Achieving adjusted EPS of $1.76 and parent free cash flow of just over $1 billion, both beyond the top end of our guidance ranges, and realizing asset sales proceeds of $1.1 billion, significantly above our target of $400 million to $600 million. Turning to Slide 4. Despite the backdrop of rising interest rates and supply chain challenges across the sector, we demonstrated that our business model is strong, resilient and well positioned. Demand across the sector has never been stronger. And in this context, I'm pleased to announce that we are raising our expected annual growth rate for adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. We now expect our adjusted EBITDA to grow at an annual rate of 5% to 7% and adjusted EPS to grow at 7% to 9%, both through 2027. We are also reaffirming all of our other existing guidance. I can definitely say that I have never felt better about the outlook for this business. Turning to power purchase agreement signings on Slide 5. We signed 5.6 gigawatts of new PPAs in 2023, more than any other year in our company's 43-year history, putting us well on track to sign 14 to 17 gigawatts of new renewable contracts from 2023 through 2025. Today, our backlog of projects with signed PPAs is 12.3 gigawatts, the vast majority of which will be commissioned over the next 3 years. It is worthwhile to note that all of the projects in our contracted backlog remain on track for timely completion, consistent with our historical performance. Moving to Slide 6. I'd like to highlight that the largest segment of our new business is with corporate customers. In fact, in 2023, nearly 60% of the 3.5 gigawatts of projects we brought online were to serve corporate customers and large technology companies, in particular. Bloomberg New Energy Finance has consistently named AES as 1 of the top 2 providers of renewable energy to corporations worldwide, and our business continues to expand, particularly, given our focus on serving the power needs from data centers, which are powering the rapid growth of AI. We are well positioned to serve this customer segment for a number of reasons. First, we have been on the forefront of working directly with these technology companies to provide innovative solutions to achieve specific renewable energy profile. Back in 2021, we were the first company to introduce hourly match renewable energy. And today, we are working with all of the hyperscale data center companies to provide solutions that are tailored for their renewable energy and sustainability goals. Second, we have a strong track record of delivering our projects on time, on budget, while meeting the unique needs of our customers, which I will cover in more detail momentarily. Our record of reliability is something that is increasingly recognized and valued by our customers. And third, we have the scale and the pipeline to address growing demand from data centers, which is estimated to more than double by 2030. With over 50 gigawatts of projects in our development pipeline and advanced interconnection queue positions in the most relevant markets in the U.S., we are particularly well positioned to meet the energy demand of technology customers. Turning to Slide 7. Our success with corporate customers combined with our improved efficiency in development and construction, have increased the returns that we have seen across our renewable portfolio. As a result, we're upping our U.S. return ranges by 200 basis points to 12% to 15% on a levered after-tax cash basis. We are seeing even higher returns internationally. With strong market demand in AES' leading position, we are able to be increasingly selective about the projects we built, with a focus on those with the best overall financial benefits. Next, turning to construction on Slide 8. Our ability to complete projects on time and on budget has become a major differentiator for AES. Not only is this something that our customers highly value, but it is also a pillar of our business model, and ensures that our realized financial returns are on average, equal to or better than our projections. At the time of PPA signing, we lock in contractual arrangements for all major equipment, EPC and long-term financing, which we hedge to ensure no interest rate exposure. At the same time, we systematically embed flexibility in our supply chain to safeguard against a variety of scenarios. We also have a multiyear strategic arrangement with top suppliers, including Fluence, who we see as having the most competitive product in the industry. More than half of our solar projects in recent years have co-located storage components, and our relationship with Fluence helped us to have the best on-time project completion rate in the industry. In 2024, we feel very confident in our ability to add 3.6 gigawatts of new projects, including 2.2 gigawatts in the U.S. We currently have 100% of the major equipment for these projects contractually secured and nearly 80% already on site. Now turning to our utilities, beginning on Slide 9. In 2023, we achieved important milestones at our U.S. utilities that will drive future growth, continued decarbonization and improvement in customer service. At AES, Ohio, we put in place a new regulatory framework. And at AES Indiana, we reached a unanimous settlement for our first rate case since 2018. As a result, investments are on track for the rate base growth in the high teens at both utilities, and we now have close to 70% of our planned investments through 2027 already approved in regulatory orders. Turning to Slide 10. At AES, Ohio, we are embarking on the largest investment program that this utility has ever seen, which includes the expansion and enhancement in our transmission assets. With over 25% rate base growth per year, this is one of the fastest transmission growth rates in the country. We also recently filed for regulatory approval of the second phase of our smart grid plant, which upgrades our grid to improve service quality and customer experience. Turning to Slide 11. At AES, Indiana, we continue to invest to improve service quality and greener generation mix. I am happy to say that we now have regulatory approval for the build-out of all named renewable projects at AES Indiana, encompassing 106 megawatts of wind, 445 megawatts of solar and 245 megawatts of energy storage. As we continue to invest in our customer experience, service quality and sustainability at both of our U.S. utilities, 2 core principles have guided our growth plans. First is customer affordability as we address much needed investments. We currently have the lowest residential rates in both states, which we expect to maintain throughout this period of growth. And second is to prioritize the timely recovery of our investments through existing mechanisms and programs. Across both utilities, we now anticipate approximately 75% of the growth capital to be deployed under such mechanisms, which substantially reduces regulatory lag. Finally, turning to Slide 12. Last year, we set an asset sale proceeds target of $400 million to $600 million. We greatly exceeded this range, with $1.1 billion of gross proceeds. These transactions not only put a high valuation marker on our businesses, but also put us well on our way towards achieving our asset sales goal of $2 billion through 2025 and $3.5 billion through 2027. Our success this past year provides us with a cushion, and we expect 2024 to be another strong year. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our CFO, Stephen Coughlin."", 'Stephen Coughlin', ""Thank you, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our 2023 results and capital allocation, our 2024 guidance and our updated expectations through 2027. As Andres mentioned, 2023 was AES' best year on record, as we met or exceeded all of our strategic and financial targets. We beat our adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.65 to $1.75 and our parent free cash flow guidance range of $950 million to $1 billion. We also recorded strong adjusted EBITDA, well above the midpoint of our inaugural guidance range of $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion. Turning to Slide 14. Full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes was $3.4 billion versus $3.2 billion in 2022, driven primarily by contributions from new renewables projects as well as the recovery of prior year's purchase power costs at AES Ohio, included as part of the ESP 4 settlement. These drivers were partially offset by lower contributions from the energy infrastructure SBU. Turning to Slide 15. Adjusted EPS was $1.76 in 2023 versus $1.67 in 2022. Drivers were similar to those for adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes. In addition, there was a $0.06 headwind from parent interest on higher debt balances, primarily used to fund new renewables projects. I'll cover our results in more detail over the next 4 slides, beginning with the renewable strategic business unit, or SBU, on Slide 16. Higher adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes at our Renewables SBU was primarily driven by contributions from the 3.5 gigawatts of new projects that came online in 2023 as well as higher margins in Colombia, but partially offset by the sell-down of select U.S. renewable operating assets. At our Utilities SBU, higher adjusted PTC was primarily driven by the recovery of prior year's purchase power costs at AES Ohio included as part of the ESP 4 settlement as well as rate base growth in the U.S. Lower adjusted EBITDA at our energy infrastructure SBU reflects significant LNG transaction margins in 2022, lower margins in Chile and the sale of a minority interest in our Southland combined-cycle assets. These drivers were partially offset by the higher revenues recognized from the accelerated monetization of the PPA at our Warrior Run coal plant. Finally, at our New Energy Technologies SBU, higher adjusted EBITDA reflects improved results at Fluence, which achieved positive adjusted EBITDA in their fiscal fourth quarter of 2023. Fluence also guided to positive adjusted EBITDA for their full fiscal year 2024. Now let's turn to how we allocated our capital last year on Slide 20. Beginning on the left-hand side, sources reflect $3 billion of total discretionary cash. This includes parent free cash flow of just over $1 billion, which increased nearly 11% from the prior year, to just above the top end of our guidance. We also significantly surpassed our asset sales target, with $750 million in net asset sales proceeds to the AES parent after subsidiary-level debt repayment, reinvestment and taxes. And we issued $900 million of parent debt in May of last year. Moving to uses on the right-hand side. We invested more than $2.1 billion in growth at our subsidiaries, of which approximately 2/3 was in the U.S. We also allocated more than $500 million of discretionary cash to our dividend. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with our financial performance throughout 2023. Now let's turn to our guidance and expectations, beginning on Slide 21. Today, we're initiating 2024 adjusted EBITDA with tax attributes guidance of $3.6 billion to $4 billion, driven by over $500 million in contributions from new renewables projects and from rate base growth at our U.S. utilities. We have also incorporated a $200 million partially offsetting impact from asset sales we either closed in 2023 or planned to close this year. Excluding the $1 billion in tax attributes, we expect to recognize in 2024, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion. The increase in tax attributes versus the prior year is partially due to our continued use of tax credit transfers, which results in earlier recognition of tax credits than typical tax equity structures. In addition, last year's increase in new project completions will drive higher tax attribute recognition in 2024. As a reminder, we will recognize approximately 1/3 of tax attributes generated on 2023 projects in the 2024 fiscal year. Looking beyond this year, our head start on asset sales gives us greater visibility toward our longer-term growth and puts downward pressure on our capital budget. We expect EBITDA to increase each year through the remainder of our long-term guidance period. Turning to Slide 22. We expect 2024 adjusted EPS of $1.87 to $1.97, which represents a 9% increase year-over-year and puts us on track to achieve our 7% to 9% long-term growth target through 2025. Growth will be primarily driven by our renewables and utilities businesses and will be partially offset by higher parent interest. We also expect an $0.08 headwind from asset sales. Our construction program this year is more evenly spread than in recent years. As a result, we expect approximately 40% of our earnings to be recognized in the first half of the year and 60% in the second half, and we will have greater visibility throughout the year into our expected construction completion. Turning to Slide 23. As Andres mentioned, our very strong market position in providing tailored solutions to corporate clients, including large data centers, has allowed us to realize higher returns on our renewables projects. In addition, as our renewals business continues to scale, we anticipate further realization of productivity and scale benefits. Based on these factors and our 2023 results, we now expect AES' U.S. renewables returns to be in the 12% to 15% range. These higher returns in the U.S., along with productivity benefits, are directly accretive to our earnings and cash flow. And as a result, we are increasing our expected long-term adjusted EBITDA growth rate to 5% to 7% and our long-term adjusted EPS growth rate to 7% to 9% through 2027, off a base of our 2023 guidance midpoint. Now turning to our 2024 parent capital allocation plan on Slide 24, beginning with approximately $3.1 billion of sources on the left-hand side. Parent free cash flow for 2024 is expected to be around $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion. We expect to generate $900 million to $1.1 billion of net asset sale proceeds this year. By the end of this year, we expect to be more than halfway toward the $3.5 billion gross asset sales target we announced on our third quarter earnings call. Although we expect an increase of approximately $1 billion of parent debt this year, our business is well insulated from changes in interest rates. Our new projects are funded primarily with fixed rate or long-term hedged, self-amortizing debt, with tenors similar to the length of our PPAs, and more than 80% of our outstanding debt is nonrecourse to AES Corp. Our exposure from floating rates and future issuances is managed with nearly $8 billion in outstanding hedges. Looking at the impact of a 100 basis point shift in rates on our future issuances, refinancings and outstanding U.S. floating rate debt, we have only $0.01 of EPS exposure from interest rates in 2024. Now to the uses on the right-hand side. We plan to invest approximately $2.6 billion in new growth, of which about 85% will be allocated to growing our renewables portfolio and utility rate base. More than 90% of this will be directed into the U.S., with the remainder going to growth projects in Chile and Panama. We expect to allocate approximately $500 million to our shareholder dividend, which reflects the previously announced 4% increase. Turning to Slide 25. Our long-term sources of parent capital through 2027 reflect the accelerated asset sales target we introduced on our third quarter call. We also expect higher organic cash generation as a result of our increased long-term growth rates. As a reminder, we will not issue any new equity until 2026 at the earliest, and will only do so in a way that creates value on a per share basis. Now to Slide 26. Uses through 2027 reflect more than $7 billion of investment in our subsidiaries, primarily to grow our renewables and utilities businesses. We also expect to allocate more than $2 billion to our dividend. Given our surplus of attractive investment opportunities and our desire to minimize equity issuance as a source of capital, we now expect to grow our dividend at 2% to 3% annually beyond 2024. We believe this provides an optimal balance between an already attractive dividend yield and strong earnings and cash flow growth throughout our plan period. In summary, 2023 was an extraordinary year for AES. We demonstrated our ability to adapt to the current market and execute on our growth commitments, while we further advanced our competitive position. As we continue to perfect and scale our renewables machine, we expect to have another record year in 2024 and to deliver on our now higher long-term growth target. We have positioned AES to achieve our strategic priorities and grow our business in a way that's highly value accretive to our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andres."", 'Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert', 'Thank you, Steve. In summary, 2023 was our best year ever, as we met or exceeded all of our strategic and financial objectives across our guidance metrics, PPA signings, construction completions and asset sales. We are seeing strong demand for renewables across the sector, particularly due to the unprecedented demand from data centers. As a result, we are not only upping our U.S. project return rates increasing our expected average annual growth rate for adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share through 2027. Finally, our significant success with asset sales to date as well as the outlook for the near future, gives us great comfort in our long-term funding plan. With that, I would like to open the call for questions.', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Nick Campanella with Barclays.', 'Nicholas Joseph Campanella', ""I appreciate all the updates. So I guess you originally had a 3% to 5% EBITDA target when you kind of put out that Analyst Day range? And then I guess the EBITDA guidance that you gave today for fiscal '24 does seem to just be a bit flat versus that growth outlook. Is that just from the timing of asset sales? Could you just help kind of clarify what's driving that?"", 'Stephen Coughlin', ""Yes. Nick, it's Steve. That's right. I mean it's primarily because we're ahead on the asset sale target significantly from 2023. You had the $1.1 billion versus the $400 million to $600 million guidance. So that's why the asset sale drag as there's a lag when we redeploy the capital and it's yielding again, is about 200 this year. So a little higher than what we would have anticipated a year ago. So overall, good news for the -- But it is offsetting the growth that's coming from the rate base and the utilities and in the renewables projects. That's right."", 'Nicholas Joseph Campanella', ""That's helpful. And then just on asset sales, to the extent that you're continuing to be successful here, and doing more versus what you kind of have in this plan? Just -- is there room to kind of offset that $1 billion of parent debt issuance? Does that change at all? Where exactly is there flexibility in this plan today from your perspective? And then could you just also kind of update us on where your leverage targets are in your minimums in this new plan?"", 'Stephen Coughlin', ""Yes. Yes. No. So definitely. So we have -- the investment grade is a top priority. So we are -- we designed the plan to meet the investment-grade targets that we have. And keep in mind -- and we built cushion into the metrics themselves. But also keep in mind that the quality and the duration of the cash flows in the business is transitioning dramatically. So we're going to a much longer duration, average duration of contracts as -- there's 20-year contracts. This is clean energy, no carbon risk. These are U.S. dollar contracts with large corporates, many of which are data center customers, big tech companies, very high-quality credit. So it's both the solid credit metrics as well as the quality and profile of the cash flows that's evolving. We don't count on that when sizing the new debt, we count just the metrics, but the quality is improving as well. So in terms of levers, look, I mean the asset sale target is, as it's always been, has multiple ways that it can be achieved. There's some conservatism built in over the total. We have fully anticipated any temporal dilutive impacts in the numbers that we've given, as I said, but there is some flex there as needed. But on the debt side, the investment grade is a top priority."", 'Nicholas Joseph Campanella', ""All right. I'll leave it there. I really appreciate it."", 'Operator', 'We now turn to David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.', 'David Keith Arcaro', ""I wanted to dig in a little bit on the higher return levels that you're projecting. On the higher return levels that you're projecting here, was there something that sparked it? Any kind of catalyst that has pushed you up in terms of the higher return levels in the renewables business? We've been in a higher interest rate environment for -- obviously, for a while, higher PPA price environment for a while. Is it more the mix of end customers that you're selling to now?"", 'Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert', ""Dave, I'd say it's a combination of things. So first and foremost is the returns that we are -- on prior PPAs that we signed. So that's the first. We are seeing that we're getting higher returns. Second, what's driving these higher returns? You may recall -- for some time, maybe like 3 years ago, starting 3, 4 years ago, I started saying that in select markets, there would be really a shortage of good renewable projects. And these are markets like California, like PJM, New York. So what we started to do is position ourselves and actually enter the queue, buy land rights, et cetera, to have projects to be able to fulfill this. So I think that part of it is the select markets, you are starting to see the shortage of renewables that we had been say, see. And I think this is something that will spread sort of market to market. It's not going to be true for all markets. Out West, there's a lot of land. There's not that much demand, but in select markets, you will be seeing that. So I think that's also part of the result is that we are positioned in the right markets. The third thing I would say is that we're becoming more efficient in our construction, in our development process and stay tuned, I think that will continue to improve. Realize that '20, '21, you had a lot of supply chain disruptions. Those are well past us, and we're really getting to optimize that. So based on our greater efficiency, what we're seeing is that, yes, we are getting higher returns. And we've also positioned ourselves, this is about our fourth year, fifth year of really positioning ourselves with large corporate customers. And those corporate customers have very strong demand growing very quickly. So if you ask me from a sector point of view, I think the real question is, can we meet the demand that they have for lean energy in all of these markets? And by the way, I would add Chile as a similar market to California, where there's a real shortage of projects. This is a very strong demand from our customers and that we're very well placed. So this is not like a catalyst. This is -- we had several thesis, which have played out as we expected them to play out."", 'Stephen Coughlin', 'Yes. And the only thing I would add, David, is that looking at 2023, what we signed up was well within to that new updated range.', 'David Keith Arcaro', ""Okay. That's good to hear. And then in terms of the higher growth rates that you've outlined today, wondering if we could just unpack that a little bit. Is that all coming from the renewables segment in terms of the higher returns that you're seeing? Or is some of the -- is the utilities business or energy infrastructure also experiencing higher EBITDA growth outlook here?"", 'Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert', 'Well, what you have is both, I think, our 2 key segments, one is the utilities. We have some of the fastest growing utilities in the U.S. And second, yes, we are also seeing better returns in the renewable sector. So the combination of those 2 is resulting in a faster growth rate.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.', 'Cameron James Lochridge', 'This is actually Cameron Lochridge on for Julien. I wanted to start just on the raised growth expectations. And kind of piggybacking on the last question, if I look at what you had planned for your EBITDA contributions across the different businesses, 45% renewables, 32% utilities, 23% energy infrastructure in 2027, how has that mix shifted as a reflection of this -- these raised expectations for growth?', 'Stephen Coughlin', ""Yes. So I would say, I think the mix roughly be maybe a little bit more on the renewable side, we're seeing the higher returns. So maybe that's above the 45, 50-ish. So it's going to be higher on the renewables. I think the utilities, as Andres said, it will be a little bit more of a share. On the energy infrastructure, we did communicate that, that was going to shrink as we execute on the coal exit plan. Although for just a handful of assets, we extended that to 2027. So that dilution from those coal exits, this is the smaller portion, will be spread out over more time, which overall, I think, is a good thing in terms of the -- in the financials as well. So a little more renewables, a little more utilities and then the energy infrastructure is shrinking a little bit less, but it's still in that same range."", 'Cameron James Lochridge', ""Got it. And then just digging in on the renewables, just the cumulative capacity additions you guys have communicated, tripling the bag to 25 to 30 gigawatts of cumulative additions, is that still the case through '27? Or is that bumped higher? Or is this purely just a function of returns improving? And then on that returns improving piece, how do we think about the bifurcation between, perhaps more ability to capitalize on IRA credits versus just true economic improvement vis-a-vis PPAs, pricing increasing? Just kind of help us unpack that a little bit."", 'Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert', ""Let me sort of give a big picture, and then I'll pass it off to Steve. Look, what we're going after, really, as I said in my script, is really going after those projects, which provide the best financial benefits. You've known me for a while, I've never gone for growth for growth's sake. So really, what we want to do is maximize shareholder value on a per share basis. So really, this is an upgrading of the quality of the growth, more than a greater numeric growth.Now I do think that it's very important to understand sort of what market segments we're in. We're in the corporate segment, but we're also very heavily into the data center segment. And this is something, again, we've been working on for many years. We have really very good relationships with key clients, and that is a demand that's growing very quickly. And certainly that we don't mention in our speech, quite frankly, because it's very early times. But we're really going to go after artificial intelligence as an efficiency improvement in the company. And we have a big kickoff meeting that we're going to have in the next couple of months. But this is something I think we've taken in a very sort of strategic line.Inderpal Bhandari, who was the global Chief Data Officer for IBM until 2023 has just joined our Board, and he is somebody who is very knowledgeable in the area. We also have Janet Davidson, who's also a PhD in computer science. It's interesting. I mean, right now, with Inderpal, we have 5 PhDs on our Board, which has got to be one of the highest percentages in things that run from computer science to finance to economics of business. So that's what I wanted to put it in. What we're pursuing is returns. We're pursuing value per share. And I think we've been very systematic now for many years in positioning ourselves in a given sector and learning about and preparing ourselves for the new technologies which are coming. So there's a lot of buzzwords of AI. Well, what's behind this is 5, 6 years of getting ourselves in a position to really utilize the data and have the understanding of the company. So with that, I'll pass it off to Steve to answer the other parts of your question."", 'Stephen Coughlin', ""Yes. No, I agree wholeheartedly that we're focused on cash returns, and that's primarily where the higher growth coming from. You'll notice that it was really the EBITDA growth rate that ticked up the most. And so not really from tax credits. So we had already talked about that about 40% of our pipeline was in energy communities that continues to be roughly the case. So it's really from the cash generation of the assets that the increase in rates is coming up.And we're less focused on megawatts. So it's roughly a similar amount of capital, maybe even a little bit lower. But if that means less megawatts, that's okay. We're focused on what are the best returns that we can get for our capital that's deployed. And that's cash based and not based on the credit."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.', 'Durgesh Chopra', ""I just wanted to ask about the -- I want to ask you about the new projects, the 3.6 gigawatts to be added in 2024. I mean, obviously, you've done pretty well versus your own stated 5 gigawatt target, the renewable signing. You're doing 5.6, materially higher than 5 gigawatts. But why only like the level of gigawatts actually entering commercial operation is kind of flat to 2023? So just wondering if that's just related to project timing. Because I would have expected materially tick up, just the new projects going here."", 'Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert', ""Yes. That's a good question. Look, 2023 was a dramatic year where we increased construction, 100%. And we've been saying, look, we're not going to grow it at 100% per year. Now we've been signing over 5 gigawatts a year of new PPAs. So eventually, these 2 have to somewhat converge. I mean, at some point, we have to be cutting the ribbon on around 5 gigawatts. But that's not going to happen likely next year, just because of the timing of some of the projects.We also have a developing transfer project as well, and that's not part of our backlog, but it's part of the signing. So that also is part of the reason for that. So this is not a signal of anything. It just has to be the particular timing of the projects that we have. And again, we feel this year, very good about commissioning them all on time and on budget. We have 100% of the major equipment, already secured and 80% of it is on site, which is we've never been that good this early in the process. And I think another thing important that Steve said, this is going to be reflected in our earnings profile, whereas we were very back-end loaded last year because of this very rapid growth. As growth enters a more steady state, we're going to have 40% of our earnings in the first half and only 60% in the second half. So this is something we also worked very hard to achieve. So qualitatively, we feel -- years '24, '25, you're going to have a catch up to the amount of PPAs that we're signing."", 'Durgesh Chopra', ""Got it. And then maybe, Steve, can I just go back to Nick's question earlier on credit metrics? Can you just help us with where you ended 2023 on CFO, FFO debt versus your downgrade thresholds and where are you expecting 2024 to be?"", 'Stephen Coughlin', '(technical difficulty) and that ratio is actually improving over time in the planned period. So I would expect it to be at least at that level for the (technical difficulty)', 'Operator', 'Ladies and gentlemen, we have lost connection with our speaker. Thank you for your patience as we reconnect them.', 'Unidentified Company Representative', 'Yes. Hello?', 'Operator', 'Ladies and gentlemen, we now have our speakers reconnected. Durgesh, if you could resume with your question?', 'Durgesh Chopra', ""I'm not sure if the issue was at mine or yours, but Steve, what I wanted to go back to was -- and Andres, we heard the response to my first question on the addition.Steve, in terms of credit metrics, I wanted to follow up on Nick's question earlier. Can you remind us where you're ending FFO to debt in 2023? And then where are you projecting 2024 to be versus your credit downgrade thresholds?"", 'Stephen Coughlin', ""Yes, no problem, Durgesh. Sorry, everyone about the disconnection. So hopefully, everyone can hear us well now.Yes, so we had a solid year-end on the credit metrics. So our thresholds are at 20% FFO to debt, and we were roughly at 22% approximately. We do keep at least a very strong cushion. That's very healthy. And going forward, that ratio is actually improving in our plan. So for the end of 2024, I would expect it to be at least 22%, if not a little bit higher than that. So the leverage of the company overall -- we do get a lot of questions about it, but it is important to keep in mind we have the recourse, nonrecourse structure. And particularly in the nonrecourse debt, this is amortizing debt. I think not everyone is doing it that way. And so our project debt is really amortizing and it's served by the cash flows from the projects. The parent debt level is actually going to be -- it will come up a little bit over the planned period, but not a lot. So it's $4.5 billion now. And as I said in my comments on the slides, maybe another 1 to 1.5 over the 4-year period, but it's going to be pretty stable."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Agnieszka Storozynski with Seaport Research Partners.', 'Agnieszka Anna Storozynski', ""So I was just wondering, are you guys seeing any degradation in either EBITDA or cash flow generation of existing assets? I mean, we're seeing examples of -- especially on the wind side -- that wind assets are having some issues with both OpEx and CapEx, hence repowering. But just wondering if there's obviously this positive momentum on the new build side, but is there any offset from existing assets?"", 'Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert', ""No, none whatsoever. In fact, as I said, we continue to operate better. And we are seeing that our older projects are giving the returns that we are actually giving better returns than we had forecast. So we're not seeing that. I mean, we don't have perhaps that many older wins. We do have awful low gap, but we have not seen any degradation in performance."", 'Agnieszka Anna Storozynski', 'Okay. And then the second question. So I remember in the past, you were mentioning that the slightly delayed coal plant retirements could be a lever for actually both earnings and cash flow. So is there an update there?', 'Stephen Coughlin', ""Yes. So Agnie, as I was mentioning, the -- so there's just a handful of assets that we've extended through 2027, primarily due to the short remaining duration of the contracts, and it's making both operational sense as well as financial sense for us to remain the owner through the end of life.So there is some upside to that -- 2 upsides really. It smooths out the $750 million of EBITDA reduction from the coal exit plans throughout the '25, '26, '27, '28 period, so there's no real cliff. And then it does add to the EBITDA over the time frame. But it's one of the -- it's the smaller driver. The biggest driver of the EBITDA uplift is the higher returns we're realizing on the renewable projects, given the market dynamics that Andres discussed as well as the productivity and scale benefits we've realized in the portfolio and expect to continue to realize as we scale up."", 'Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert', ""Yes. And I'd like to add that we still plan to be out of coal by the end of 2027, and that we -- after 2025, we'll have somewhere about 1 gigawatt plant. And part of this is driven by the fact that these plants are still needed for stability of the system, so we are not allowed to shut them down in part. I just wanted to clarify. So the strategic objective remains the same, it's just slightly delayed in time."", 'Agnieszka Anna Storozynski', ""Okay. And then lastly, and again, it's a bigger picture question, right? We -- it's very topical for today, given a lot of discussion about nuclear power. So we're all getting excited about the colocation of data centers and nuclear plants, and there is argument about spatial limitations for renewable power, given how much land it actually needs to offer similar amounts of computing capacity and especially in Virginia, where those land shortages, I think are most pronounced. So do you actually see that there is some disadvantage to your pursuit of tech clients, if that's nuclear angle were to take off?"", 'Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert', ""Well, I think, look, a rising tide lifts all boats. So I don't think this is a situation where there's just going to be like one technology that solves all the needs. So I don't see that any future where there's not, quite frankly, a shortage of renewable projects in the key markets. You know, I know it takes a long time to permit nuclear plants. To my knowledge, excuse me, no new nuclear plants have been built, maybe even in the last decade, anywhere near budget. So on the one hand, I do think nuclear is part of the long-run solution, because I do agree. There's only so much land, so much interconnection. On the other hand, I think that the nuclear renaissance has yet to prove itself and it has yet to build out. So the demand from these clients is so strong. I mean, they are taking second best. Sometimes they can't get -- they want to require additionality because they really want to be part of the solution to climate change. Well, there are circumstances where they will take no additionality and basically have recontract nuclear power today, at least 0 carbon. But the truth is that squeezing the balloon. That's taking 0 carbon energy off the grid. So I don't think -- I'll put it this way, I feel it's extraordinarily unlikely that the growth in renewables will stop and be replaced with nuclear power. And it's certainly in the next 5 years, I don't see it, and I see it very difficult in the next 10 years."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) We now turn to Ryan Levine with Citi.', 'Ryan Michael Levine', 'Given the scarcity of data center projects, how are returns for these projects compared to the projects for other customers?', 'Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert', ""The scarcity -- look, we don't talk about individual projects, but we do talk about our averages. And so the return on the project will depend, obviously, if you have the suitable location, if it's providing something other than a plain vanilla. So all put together, what I can say is, again, on average, we're seeing an increase in our returns, looking backwards and looking forward, and corporate customers are our most important segment. But yes, we will not comment on sort of specific client areas."", 'Ryan Michael Levine', 'Okay. And then how did you arrive at the 2% to 3% long-term dividend growth is the right growth rate from a financial policy standpoint? And what are factors that could cause that policy to continue to evolve?', 'Stephen Coughlin', ""Ryan. So look, I mean AES has established itself as a dividend payer a long time ago. We've been consistently growing the dividend at that [4 to 6] range for quite a long time. Obviously, the company's success in the renewable space and now our utilities position for significant growth, has put us in front of a huge amount of growth opportunity, and we want to manage our capital sources appropriately. And so we are committed to our dividend. We want to continue to grow, but we felt on balance given the capital opportunities in front of us and the higher returns that growing the dividend at a little bit of a lower rate made sense at this point, particularly as we've seen higher returns coming from our growth investments."", 'Ryan Michael Levine', ""Okay. And why start that in '25 as opposed to another year from a timing standpoint?"", 'Stephen Coughlin', ""Well, we look at this -- so I'm not sure that you were pointing out, so we did grow at 4% this year. This is a policy that we take very seriously and thoughtfully. And so we weren't prepared -- we made that decision for this year, towards the end of last year. We weren't prepared to make this decision until we had thoroughly analyzed it and recently made that decision as we locked down our final plan here. And we think, therefore, it makes sense once we've made the decision to go ahead and implement it as soon as we're able, which will be in 2025."", 'Operator', 'Our final question today comes from Gregg Orrill with UBS.', 'Gregg Gillander Orrill', ""Congratulations. Just a detail-oriented question. The '24 tax credit guidance of $1 billion. Is there anything in there that is timing related or you might describe as more onetime in nature? Or is that -- would you grow that from that level as you add renewables projects?"", 'Stephen Coughlin', ""Yes. So it will grow. And it's not timing so much as it's just the success of the business. As Andres said, we doubled our construction last year. And keep in mind that not all of the credits are recognized in year 1, in tax equity structures. It's roughly 1/3 get recognized in the second year. So that's boosting the credit this year as well as all of the projects that will come online this year, the new projects on top of that.The other thing that's driving it is the transfer of credit does get recognized earlier, essentially almost all in the first year. And so there's a greater mix of credits transferred in this vintage this year as we -- that grows as a component of how we monetize the credits. So that's driving it higher. But I don't expect this to have dipped, I think it will continue to rise as we head into the years ahead, as the growth program continues. And then keep in mind that we are benefiting from the energy community adder at a significant portion, which increases the credit. And our wind projects are all qualifying for domestic content also going forward. So that all else being equal, is driving the credit value up. And what's important for everyone to understand is the credit is cash and earnings. And the great thing about these -- particularly the investment credits, which is the lion's share of our mix of tax attributes is upfront. So you're getting a return on your capital investment of a significant portion, at least 30%, in some cases, up to 50% right away, which is a fantastic cash profile as well as an earnings profile."", 'Operator', ""This concludes our Q&A. I'll now hand back to Susan Harcourt, Vice President of Investor Relations, for final remarks."", 'Susan Pasley Keppelman Harcourt', ""We thank everybody for joining us on today's call.

It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the book value per share.', 'In value investing, it is a common practice to pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally strong. There are a number of investment styles for finding great stocks at attractive values.', 'While considering valuation metrics, though price-to-earnings and price-to-sales are the first choices, the P/B ratio is also emerging as a convenient tool for identifying low-priced stocks that have high-growth prospects.', 'Here’s the formula for P/B ratio:', 'P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equity.', 'The P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks with high growth prospects. General Motors Company GM, Unum Group UNM, Compañía Cervecerías Unidas S. A. CCU, Owens Corning OC and Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft DB are some such stocks.', 'Now, let us understand the concept of book value.', 'There are several ways by which book value can be defined.\xa0Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.', 'It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.', 'By comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.', 'A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value or the stock is undervalued and, therefore, a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.', 'For example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.', 'But there is a warning. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.', 'Moreover, the P/B ratio is not without limitations. It is useful for businesses like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.', 'In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.', 'Screening Parameters', 'Price to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.', 'Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.', 'Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share — a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.', 'PEG less than 1: PEG links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects.', 'Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.', 'Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.', 'Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.', 'Value Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.', 'Here are five of the 10 picks that qualified the screening:', 'Headquartered in Detroit,\xa0General Motors is one of the world’s largest automakers.

Despite this raise, the dividend yield of 1.2% is only a modest boost to shareholder returns."", ' View our latest analysis for General Motors ', ""If it is predictable over a long period, even low dividend yields can be attractive. However, General Motors' earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business."", 'Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 22.4%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 3.3% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.', ""While the company has been paying a dividend for a long time, it has cut the dividend at least once in the last 10 years. Since 2014, the dividend has gone from $1.20 total annually to $0.48. The dividend has shrunk at around 8.8% a year during that period. Declining dividends isn't generally what we look for as they can indicate that the company is running into some challenges."", ""Given that dividend payments have been shrinking like a glacier in a warming world, we need to check if there are some bright spots on the horizon. General Motors has impressed us by growing EPS at 8.9% per year over the past five years. With a decent amount of growth and a low payout ratio, we think this bodes well for General Motors' prospects of growing its dividend payments in the future."", 'In summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow.

Cox Automotive expects new vehicle inventory to return to pre-pandemic levels in 2024, reaching almost 3 million units, tripling the quantity during the chip shortage. Ample inventory will result in enhanced incentives and discounts for consumers, helping to stabilize vehicle prices and reduce affordability concerns.', 'E-Mobility Growth Amid Challenges: The outlook for the EV industry remains promising but nuanced. While demand for EVs is on the rise, achieving higher sales will require concerted efforts from dealers and manufacturers. Despite initial optimism, the shift from lofty expectations to realistic projections reflects the slower-than-anticipated pace of customer acceptance. Consequently, some major automakers are revising their ambitious EV plans. However, the industry is poised for expansion in 2024, with an increasing variety of EV models, higher incentives, discounts, advertising and sales initiatives.

We want to take a look at shares of Delta, United, American Airlines all gaining year-to-date. You can see, though, not much of an uplift here since the start of the year. Now as we approach the very busy spring travel season of the year, what stocks are best positioned? Joining us now is part of Yahoo Finance's Travel Guide 2024 Industry Insights. We have Helane Becker, TD Cowen managing director, and Steve Trent, Citi managing director."", 'Steve, let me start with you. In terms of how airlines are positioned ahead of the rest of the year, from your view, are we going to see more of that recovery take place and who do you think has that lead position?', 'STEVE TRENT: Yeah, absolutely. And thank you for having me. So I do think that the network airlines look better-positioned. We continue to have generally to very good demand trends not only talking about ticket revenue but all the ancillary stuff they do-- co-branded card, loyalty program revenue. International capillarity is still a very good place to be.', ""The discount airlines that are mostly US-based, we're a little less sanguine on those in terms of what opportunities we see. But overall, the picture looks good from a capacity perspective. So 2019, we had $23 of US economic activity per available seat mile. We, last year, finished around $28. So the pie itself looks very good. We think the distribution of the economics could be tilted toward the network airlines."", ""BRAD SMITH: Helane, I want to bring you into this as well. I mean, when you think about the international exposure that airlines need to have in order to be among your top picks, how important is that international demand into this year's performance that trickles through to what investors are going to be watching in the stock price action?"", ""HELANE BECKER: Well, I think, in terms of international received a pretty strong demand. The airlines, though, have adjusted capacity lower since we initially cautioned back in December that we thought airfares, internationally, would come down this summer because capacity was rushing into the market-- and not so much from US carriers but from international carriers that didn't have the ability to add capacity last summer."", 'So for example, Lufthansa is up 16% this summer versus last year, while United is just reinstating seasonal service and their capacity is actually up low single digits.', 'SEANA SMITH: Steve, what do you think the pricing power looks like from these airlines, and how much higher some of those airfares could potentially go?', ""STEVE TRENT: Yeah. So I think, relative to last year or the year before-- relative to 2019-- it's possible that we won't see them as high as they have been over the last year and a half. But a fair bit of that is coming down to oil prices. So we did, of course, have a lot of pressure from jet fuel prices 2022 and into 2023. So some of that moderation should be related to fuel."", ""But when we think about this from an Xfuel perspective, we do think there should be stability. To even some upside in fares. As Helane mentioned, we do have some capacity constraints. We have the powder metal alloy contamination on GTF engines. Boeing has had some issues. So it's possible that elements of the market won't have as much equipment at the end of the year that they're expecting to have today, and that could support pricing."", 'BRAD SMITH: Just to follow on that-- does that mean any material reduction in route schedules that the airline operators are flying right now?', 'STEVE TRENT: Yeah, it could be depending on which ones. I think regional airlines come to mind in terms of where we could continue to see some scarcity of equipment. So yeah. I think, in pockets, yes. And then you also have markets that, over the last three years, have been hot like South Florida where everybody put metal into that market during the pandemic. Now probably, you see some rotation out of those regions.', ""BRAD SMITH: Helane, one of the things that we've continued to hear from airline CEOs is just when they expect to take delivery of some of these new aircraft and add that into the fleet, how would you be evaluating that and when that could actually be a pass through a boon for some of these businesses as well?"", ""HELANE BECKER: Yeah. The way we think about it is everything slides to the right. So if an airline tells us they're looking to take delivery of 50 or 60 aircraft this year, we probably think we'll be closer to 40 aircraft because the delivery delays, the supply chain issues. And we think that we'll probably see some lease extensions into 2025 to cover some of the gaps because of all the delivery issues that we're seeing in the OEM problems."", ""And so that's how we think about it. We push everything off to the right, which is really helpful. Our hope is that the government doesn't shut down because the FAA Reauthorization expires March 8. It was punted to early March, which is just two weeks away. And we need-- or next Friday. I guess March 8."", ""And we just need to have continuity in that regard because if we don't, air travel is going to get worse than it already is. I don't think anybody would give airlines really high marks for the service that they deliver."", ""And without the support network of the government, air traffic control, even the OEM, the suppliers for maintenance-- without their support, air ticket prices are going a lot higher over time because demand isn't going down and yet, the supply, the number of seats available, is going down or at least is not keeping pace. So we view that as concerning because it will-- eventually, if fares get too high, people will opt out, especially in the domestic market."", ""SEANA SMITH: I see, we're also getting some developments on the JetBlue-Spirit saga that's playing out yesterday, urging the US appeals court to allow the merger to go forward. What's your assessment of that risk? Or, I guess, is it more of a short-term risk? And how do you see this ultimately impacting the industry at large?"", ""STEVE TRENT: Yeah. Certainly, I think, right now, it's a very difficult time in the aviation industry for any M&A to get done at least over the short term. So we know there's some other stuff out there that's cooking that might be less controversial than what JetBlue is trying to do. But when we look at this particular case-- the business model differences and the government's desire to preserve Maverick pricing carriers for example-- it looks like it's going to be a difficult road."", ""And possibly, the airline industry could use a little bit of consolidation. So does that come through M&A? Does it come through carriers doing filings or what have you? I hope it's not going to be the latter. But we think, one way or the other, we could see on some level capacity continue to come out of the industry at least over the short term, whether that's M&A, or as Helene mentioned, we get ongoing delays from the OEMs.""]"

I will first cover our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results before handing it to Jeff, who will discuss our recent rate case outcome, growth outlook and strategy. Afterwards, I will finish up with our 2024 guidance and long-term financial outlook. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we achieved a $0.21 increase in earnings per share compared to the same quarter in 2022. This year-over-year improvement was largely driven by a $0.41 uplift in gross margin attributable to increased sales and usage as well as higher transmission revenue and contributions from the LFCR and 2019 rate case appeal. The lack of certain prior period items from Q4 2022 contributed to a $0.21 benefit to other income and expense on a year-over-year basis. These increases versus the prior year were partially offset by higher O&M expense, depreciation and amortization, interest expense and benefit costs. For the full year 2023 we earned $4.41 per share, a $0.15 increase over 2022, surpassing our guidance range of $4.10 to $4.30 per share. A significant factor in this result was a $0.22 year-over-year weather benefit driven by an unprecedented summer heat wave during the third quarter. Overall, weather contributed $0.48 in 2023 compared to normal weather. Revenues from adjustor mechanisms, transmission and increased sales and usage were also positive drivers for the year. In addition, other income and expense was $0.33 higher year-over-year, driven by the lack of certain prior expense items from 2022 and the sale of (inaudible) assets in the third quarter of 2023. These increases versus 2022 were partially offset by higher O&M expense, depreciation and amortization, interest expense and benefit costs. Overall, we ended 2023 with 2% customer growth maintaining the year's long upward trajectory of consistent growth in our service territory. Weather-normalized sales growth was within the expected guidance range at 1.5% in 2023 driven by 3.3% growth in our C&I customer segment. I'll now pass the discussion to Jeff to talk about our rate case outcome, growth outlook and strategy before I continue with our 2024 guidance and long-term financial outlook."", 'Jeffrey B. Guldner', ""Great. Thank you, Andrew, and thank you all for joining us today. As you all know, just a few days ago, the commission voted to approve our 2022 rate case. I'm pleased to say that this rate case decision was ultimately reasonable and constructive. I'll highlight a few of the main outcomes, including an improved authorized return on equity, the approval of a new generation rider, and a balanced revenue requirement increase among other items. I'll also discuss our growth outlook and future strategy coming out of this case. Lastly, as Andrew mentioned, he'll provide our 2024 guidance and our long-term financial outlook. After the unconstructive outcome of our 2019 rate case, we designed a comprehensive strategy and plan, and I'm pleased to share that we have accomplished the goals that we set out 2 years ago. We executed on a strategy centered on creating shareholder value by creating customer value, and we've seen significant improvements in our J.D. Power survey results. Not only have we been successful in moving from fourth quartile in 2021 to second quartile at the end of 2023 for both our residential and our business customers. We finished the year second amongst all large investor-owned utilities in phone customer care and in perfect power. Reliability has continued to be a top priority, and we're once again top quartile meeting this milestone 10 years out of the last 11. This reliability was put on full display during the summer of 2023 when Arizona broke numerous heat records yet our team delivered outstanding performance for our customers. Another important goal that we set was to build more collaborative relationships with stakeholders in the regulatory process, and we succeeded in achieving supportive regulatory decisions, and that includes both the efficient implementation of our successful 2019 rate case appeal as well as the most recent rate case. And finally, we focused on shareholder value by deferring any equity issuances and continuing to grow our dividend during this challenging period. Now I'll walk through some of the major highlights of the rate case. The commission adopted a net revenue increase of $253.4 million. From the very beginning, we focused this rate case on improving the authorized ROE to recognize the risk and the investment needed to serve our rapidly growing service territory and the commission did that. The commission voted to adopt an authorized return on equity of 9.55% with a 0.25% fair value increment and a combination of those two is equivalent to a 9.85% return on equity. With this decision, the commission has adopted an authorized return that's more in line with national averages and it recognizes that we're one of the fastest-growing states in the nation and we need to attract capital in order to fund the investments necessary to reliably serve our customers. In addition, the commission voted to approve our request for a system reliability benefit surcharge. This is an important surcharge that will allow us to invest in much needed generation resources to continue to serve our customers reliably and affordably while reducing regulatory lag. Importantly, the SRB will allow for the most cost-effective generation resources to be built for the benefit of our customers and to promote a healthier balance of PPAs and utility owned assets. Later on, Andrew will discuss how the SRB provides future opportunities for CapEx growth. It's also noteworthy that the commissioners made positive amendments to the revised recommended opinion and order at the open meeting that increased the net revenue requirement and addressed some items that would have created additional regulatory lag. This highlights the improved regulatory environment and our ability to achieve constructive outcomes. However, even at the final net revenue requirement, the outcome underscores the continued challenge from lagging historical costs. We look forward to working with the commission on addressing these lagging costs in the near future through both the regulatory lag docket, which will have a workshop on March 19 as well as through future rate case filings. Now I'll share our next step and strategies as we look to the future. We're focused on solid execution and continue to remain optimistic about our future for many reasons, and I'll discuss each of these reasons in more detail. First, I'm optimistic about our attractive service territory and consistent customer growth. Arizona remains among the fastest-growing states in the nation where other states have been experiencing little or negative customer growth, we've been benefiting from steady and consistent retail customer growth of 2% for the last few years and project that growth to continue in the range of 1.5% to 2.5% in 2024. We believe that the constructive business environment with ample job growth, a competitive cost of living and a desirable climate will continue to grow the Metro Phoenix market and benefit the local economy. Focusing on our service territory specifically, we continue to see development from a variety of sectors, which is helping to diversify our local economy more than ever. The availability of a skilled workforce and our state's business-friendly policies and regulations, coupled with our low propensity for natural disasters and our clean energy development potential make us uniquely situated for growth. The tremendous demand that we see from large commercial and industrial customers will help spread fixed costs over increasing sales and has a positive multiplier impact for jobs and surrounding communities. We'll continue to focus our economic development approach on helping to attract and expand businesses and job creators. As you can see from this graphic from the Arizona Commerce Authority the diversity of the commercial and industrial growth in Arizona presents exciting opportunities. Our state is seeing growth in a wide range of sectors, driven by manufacturing, reshoring, the clean economy and digital infrastructure needs, which will help reduce the risk of any potential downturns in a particular industry to keep our economy and growth stable. Turning to regulatory environment. We've seen meaningful improvement through the last couple of years. The Arizona Corporation Commission has established a record of balanced and constructive decisions, including our most recent rate case. And importantly, beyond those decisions, the commission has also recognized the need to address regulatory lag in a holistic manner and has opened a docket to review and discuss various solutions going forward. And as I mentioned, will kick off next month. We look forward to working with the commission on addressing this important issue. In addition, the commission reaffirmed its policy on settlements. Historically, outcomes achieved through settlement have delivered new and innovative customer programs and other results that benefit a broad and diverse range of stakeholder interest in our state energy future. We believe the nature of the settlement process itself yields more informed constructive and mutually beneficial results. The third reason that we're confident is the clear path that we are on in our transition to clean energy. We came out with our clean energy commitment in early 2020, and I'm proud that we've made significant progress. We plan on retiring our remaining [Cholla] units by next year and to completely exit coal by 2031. Since our clean energy commitment, we've procured nearly 5,000 megawatts of additional clean energy and storage and issued another all-source RFP for an additional 1,000 megawatts of reliable capacity, including at least 700 megawatts of renewable energy. With the approval of the SRB mechanism in this rate case, we're even better positioned to establish ownership in these new clean energy assets for our customers' benefit. The fourth reason I'm optimistic about the future is because of the tremendous amount of growth and opportunities we have in our FERC jurisdictional transmission business. We've increased our FERC transmission spend for the next 3 years and expect to have a much greater need for transmission capital spend over the next decade. We recently filed our 10-year transmission system plan with the Corporation Commission showing five critical transmission projects that are needed to strengthen resiliency to support the growing energy needs of our customers and allow for greater access to diversity of resources in markets across the region. The total investment for APS's portion of these projects is estimated to total over $5 billion over the next 10 years. We look forward to developing this critical infrastructure that's necessary to continue to provide safe and reliable service to our customers. And finally, I'm optimistic about the future because my entire management team and I have been committed to executing a customer-centric strategy that will allow us to deliver exceptional customer service. As I mentioned earlier, we've made significant progress in our J.D. Power survey results and have moved from fourth quartile in 2021 to second quartile at the end of 2023. Additionally, we're focused on delivering on our goal to provide reliable energy to our customers in the most affordable manner. Increases in our rates remain well below the rate of inflation, even with the latest rate case decision. We remain focused on customer affordability and keeping it central to our plans to provide long-term sustainable growth. That focus, coupled with continued cost management creates rate headroom for the future. I'll now turn the call back over to Andrew to provide guidance and share our long-term financial outlook."", 'Andrew D. Cooper', ""Thanks, Jeff. I'll now discuss our 2024 guidance and future financial outlook. For our 2024 outlook, we are establishing an EPS guidance range of $4.60 to $4.80 per share, reflecting the additional revenues from our recent rate case outcome, with new rates effective March 8. This revenue is partially offset by continued drag from increased expenses not captured in our historical test year. As Jeff mentioned, this rate case was balanced and constructive and this decision will create a solid foundation from which we will grow. However, it is important to highlight that we continue to face significant regulatory lag due to the timing of our historical test year, which ended June 30, 2022. This lag is mainly due to higher interest rates on borrowed capital, higher depreciation due to increased rate base growth, lower contributions from pension nonservice credits and increased O&M expense due to planned generation outages. We are encouraged by the commission's focus on holistically addressing regulatory lag through the newly created regulatory lag docket. We are committed to addressing these current costs in our next rate case and working with the commission to find solutions to reduce these impacts on our current comp stop. Our commitment to mitigating regulatory lag is a priority, aiming to preserve our financial stability and build shareholder value between rate cases. Diving a bit deeper into 2024. The largest positive driver of our guidance will be new revenues from the implementation of the rate case decision. Other positive drivers are expected to include increased revenues from sales growth, the LFCR and the full year impact of the 2019 rate case appeal outcome. The most significant year-over-year negative driver is expected to be weather due to the record-breaking heat wave we saw in 2023 as we plan for normal weather. Other negative drivers are expected to be higher depreciation and amortization expense, increased financing costs and higher O&M primarily due to planned outages. Turning to customer growth. As Jeff mentioned, we once again expect our customer growth to be within the range of 1.5% to 2.5%, which continues to highlight the attractiveness of our state and service territory for customer in migration. For 2024 sales growth, we expect 2% to 4% growth, of which 2.5% to 3.5% is driven by extra high load factor, C&I customers. These sales create operating leverage and ultimately rate headroom for all customers. We have seen a steady ramping of these customers and anticipate it will continue to ramp through 2024. Longer term, we expect our weather-normalized sales growth to be within the range of 4% to 6% through 2026 with 3% to 5% of this growth driven by our large C&I customers. Turning now to what we strive to provide investors going forward, I will discuss our financial outlook and goals. We are rebasing our long-term EPS growth guidance of 5% to 7% off the midpoint of our 2024 guidance range of $4.60 to $4.80 per share. While our financial plan supports this growth rate for the long term, our goal is to work towards a more consistent and timely cost recovery profile. We have already made solid progress toward reducing regulatory lag with the commission approving the system reliability benefit surcharge. While this mechanism will enable more timely cost recovery for utility-owned generation, we must first develop these projects before the mechanism begins recovering costs. Therefore, this mechanism has the potential to create strong value in the future. but we must first work through the natural development cycle and get projects in service. In addition, the commission has reiterated its policy on settlements, which may streamline future rate case filings while creating even more collaboration between parties. Finally, we will engage with regulators to holistically address regulatory lag through the newly created docket and commit our cadence of future rate cases to ensure we are recovering our material costs. We are allocating $6 billion for investment through 2026, contributing to a 14% increase in our capital investment profile compared to this time last year. This plan incorporates additional capital investment generation that will qualify for the new SRB mechanism. In addition, an increasing portion of our capital plan is directed towards bolstering our FERC jurisdictional transmission infrastructure. Average annual spend is now more than double what it was as recently as 5 years ago. We have designed a well-balanced capital allocation strategy that optimizes our ability to receive timely recovery for investments while providing reliable service across our rapidly growing service territory. Importantly, the SRB will expand our capacity to self-build generation to meet customer needs while reducing lag. Projects that meet the requirements of the outsource RFP and compete from a cost and reliability perspective would qualify for recovery through the SRB. We expect approved projects to be included in rates with an approximately 180 days of in-service significantly shortening the time between investment and recovery on those assets compared to a traditional rate case. Recovery will be at the prevailing weighted average cost of capital, less 100 basis points until a future rate case. This discount will provide customers an immediate benefit while achieving rate gradualism and reducing lag. We have highlighted five potential near-term opportunities to secure project cost recovery through the SRB with final outcomes dependent on ongoing procurement processes. Additional opportunities are also expected to arise based on future RFP outcomes and projects aligning with this mechanism. The expansion of our capital investment plan is poised to drive substantial rate base growth. Consequently, we are revising our rate base growth guidance to an annual CAGR of 6% to 8% and -- in addition, with the adoption of the SRB, we now expect an increase in tracked capital, which will reduce regulatory lag in the future. By increasing our transmission spend and generation investment that qualifies for the SRB, we expect to double the amount of tracked capital, which will improve our ability to receive timely cost recovery and reduce the amount to be recovered in future rate cases. To fortify our capital structure and support our robust capital expenditure plan, we are planning to issue a mix of debt and equity securities over the 2024 through 2026 period. Our principal goal is to have a healthy capital structure at the utility with no less than 50% equity. We have noted since 2021, the need for up to $500 million of equity to support a balanced utility capital structure. You'll recall this was deferred over the past 2-plus years as we sought to insulate shareholders as we work to improve the regulatory environment in Arizona. The capital structure need has grown by an additional $100 million to $200 million over that time and will be required to true up our equity ratio. At the same time, our CapEx profile has grown by almost 15%, nearly $1 billion over a 4-year window. While we will pursue a blend of financing solutions across APS and Pinnacle West to address our investment objectives, sources of incremental capital may include up to $400 million of additional equity or equity-like securities over the period, size to approximately 40% of this incremental CapEx. The financing options for this incremental CapEx may potentially include at-the-market issuances, though we will continue to evaluate alternatives to common equity. As we advance into 2024, our dedication to cost management continues to guide our operations. Core O&M is declining year-over-year despite continued inflation, which supports our long-term goal of reduced O&M per megawatt hour. Notably, planned major outages are scheduled for Four Corners, Unit 5, Red Hawk and West Phoenix with refueling outages at Palo Verde, marking a critical phase in our maintenance strategy. The Four Corners outage at Unit 5 specifically is the last major planned outage at the unit before its retirement with the last major planned outage at Unit 4 scheduled for spring of 2025. Despite these necessary planned outages, our commitment to operational efficiency and lean practices remains intact for the long term. Our goal of declining O&M per megawatt hour is strongly established and underscores our effective cost management with rapid growth in our service territory. The second chart on this slide highlights our success in maintaining O&M cost increases below the rate of inflation since 2017 outperforming both national CPI trends and more specifically, local inflation rates in Phoenix. This achievement is a testament to our unwavering focus on optimizing operations and fostering a culture of efficiency, across our organization. We continue to provide an attractive dividend yield as part of our total shareholder return and maintain a goal of managing our payout ratio into a sustained range of 65% to 75% in the future. With a solid track record of annual dividend growth, we understand the importance of returning value to our investors. We are committed to working diligently to ensure our dividend remains competitive. Turning to our credit ratings. Following our recent rate case resolution and other developments in the Arizona regulatory climate, we are working with the rating agencies as they evaluate our credit. Healthy investment-grade credit ratings are pivotal to our financial profile as they contribute to reducing borrowing costs, thereby directly benefiting our customers through more favorable financial conditions. We are adjusting our FFO to debt target range to 14% to 16% to properly balance the financing needs of the company and solid credit metrics. Our balance sheet remains strong, reinforcing our financial foundation. This balance sheet strength provides us flexibility to navigate the current interest rate environment and strategically address our near-term maturities as well as ongoing and future investment needs. Looking back at the last few years and the strides we've made, we are enthusiastic about our future and the potential of the company. Overcoming the setbacks of the private rate case, we achieved the goal set forth during the preceding 2 years, and we've aligned closely with the commission and stakeholders to secure a constructive outcome in this rate case. While challenges such as regulatory lag persist, our commitment to seek collaborative solutions with stakeholders, ACC staff and the commission remains firm. Our dedication to keeping customer costs affordable is evident through our efficient O&M practices, seeking to ensure that rates and costs stay below inflation during this period of unprecedented growth in our service territory. With a more constructive regulatory environment and a continued focus on affordability, we look forward to approaching the future with a clear vision and optimism for our customers and investors. This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."", 'Operator', ""Certainly. Everyone at this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Your first question is coming from Shahr Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners."", 'Jamieson Alexander Ward', ""It's Jamieson Ward here for Shahr. So just a couple of quick questions here. After your upcoming presumably '24 equity issuance, what would you expect your typical funding cadence to look like? And obviously, over the next couple of years, but kind of going forward beyond that, it's been a special situation waiting for the ROE to come back up in this last rate case. So we just want to get a sense, especially now that you have the SRB and as rate base growth is picking up. You'd mentioned both ATM and hybrids. How would you characterize your preference between implementing a regular ATM, annual ATM and then continuing to space out equity issuances."", 'Andrew D. Cooper', ""Thanks for the question. Fundamentally, if you think about the financing plan, you have the equity need that we've identified, which we've talked about for a long time, is up to $500 million. And we have now trued that up to an additional $100 million to $200 million that we need to make sure that the equity ratio at the utility is strong. And that 51.9% equity ratio that was approved in the most recent rate case is a good example of a solid, consistent with the market type equity ratio. And so that's kind of that need. And I think what you're focused on is what is the cadence for some of the -- that up to $400 million that I mentioned earlier to support future CapEx. And really, the way we think about it is what is the structure or type of issuance that would allow us to meet the needs of that CapEx as it's incurred. And certainly, an ATM program is one option that would allow us to draw equity periodically and have proceeds that match up with our capital. The capital is relatively consistent across the period. And I just want to be clear that up to $400 million, that is future capital spending as you work through the next 3 years of our plan. And so we're very flexible in terms of thinking about what the options available are to us. whether an ATM or some sort of equity like security. We'll look at all those options. We don't have a strong preference. I think we wanted to make clear that as we think about our capital structure, and we think about our CapEx plan, something that has -- there will be external financing needs for the company to support that CapEx and they could include equity type products. I think we'll continue to evaluate over the next few years. what product matches the best and what market is most available to us. But I do cite the ATM as an example because of the way it allows that periodicity to match up against CapEx, which is ultimately what we're solving for over the longer term, both from the increases in transmission spend on the FERC side and then generation spend that we expect would be eligible for SRB."", 'Jamieson Alexander Ward', 'Got it. That makes a lot of sense. The second question, last one I had is turning to your SRB. How should we think about the 42% figure you call out on Slide 25? This is just a high-level question. Is that just projects which could potentially be eligible for the SRB if you were to win them in an all-source RFP or are you expressing any sort of probability of these projects ending up in plan?', 'Andrew D. Cooper', ""Yes. So the projects that we've listed out are examples of the opportunities. When you think about -- we're currently in our 2023 RFP where we ask for outsourced resources. And so the five projects listed there cover that span of time. And we're still negotiating with third-party developers around PPAs. These projects are still in that very early stage of development. they are examples of the potential that we have within the existing window that we're in for this RFP. There will be future RFPs and future time span that match up. But one of the things we wanted to emphasize here is a long time, we've been talking about feeling hamstrong for bringing competitive projects forward because of capital limitations and uncertainty around recovery. With the SRB you have here a list of opportunities that demonstrate that, that 10% to 15% of megawatts that we've been developing historically, has that upside into a range much closer to kind of that 35% to 50% that we thought was potential based on looking at our own pipeline. So within the window of the existing RFP and the time period we're talking about, you take the megawatts that we expect need to be built from a utility scale perspective over that window and what megawatts are available to us as potential opportunities. That's the 42% you see there. Will all these projects be built, we're still in that development time line. We'll make that termination as we go along. The CapEx in our 3-year plan that we believe is probable includes generation capital related to potential SRB projects, but we're not breaking those -- that capital out granularly. But the 42% is representative of that upside opportunity relative to our prior view of our investment profile on the generation side."", 'Jeffrey B. Guldner', ""And James, this is Jeff. As you know, it's still very specific on the negotiations of the individual projects, and there's really two things we'll be trying to capture with these SRB projects. One is the benefit -- long-term benefit to customers that would be better than if you just did a PPA. And then the second, as was mentioned at the hearing, from a reliability standpoint, when we build the projects, they come in on time. So when we have a critical need for a summer and we're developing the project, we've been good at getting those in timely and you have more risk when you have a PPA and somebody can slide the in-service date and sometimes that makes it suboptimal, but it's a pretty project-specific analysis that you'll have to go. So I think just showing representative projects was what we were trying to get across here, but the details will matter, and those will come up in the negotiations with these projects."", 'Jamieson Alexander Ward', ""Perfect. No, that's exactly what we're looking for in terms of an answer. It looked like an opportunity set to us, but we had a few inbounds and people were asking us to clarify. And so we did. Thank you so much. That's all we have. Appreciate it."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is coming from Nick Campanella from Barclays.', 'Nicholas Joseph Campanella', ""So I guess -- it's good to see that ACC is kind of heading in the right direction here, especially acknowledging the capital investments you're putting in and working on the earned ROE lag. I guess just how would you kind of characterize under-earning this year just as -- on maybe that ACC rate base from a percentage basis? And how much do you think you can kind of get back in the upcoming rate case filing versus what could be addressed in the ROE lag docket."", 'Jeffrey B. Guldner', ""Let me -- I'll start, Nick and -- the challenge with this case in particular was that we came into it with a very inflationary environment that we haven't seen before. So we had a lot of the kind of lag that flat interest rate environment you don't necessarily see as pronounced. I think probably the biggest one that (inaudible) Coop mentioned in the in the narrative was the interest cost because we're actually lowering the embedded interest cost in this case that just was decided, but our interest costs are significantly higher. And so those are hopefully the things that will get picked up in the regulatory lag docket. And so structurally, I think it's kind of open right now as to seeing what they want to focus on. It's good, again, that they're actually focused on this is a real issue, that if you're in a historical test your jurisdiction like Arizona and you don't have trackers or other things to pick up some of that regulatory lag, particularly when you get into an environment like we're in now with the higher inflationary pressures, you can really come out of a case with some significant baked in lag, which then actually then means when you come in for your next case, you've got a higher ask because you're not getting the rate gradualism as you pick it up. And so Coop, do you want to maybe talk -- we do what we can to mediate it. There's some structural stuff that you just can't do and you have to -- you have to come in with the subsequent case and then hopefully, this regulatory lag docket gives us some visibility on mechanisms or structures that you can use that mitigated."", 'Andrew D. Cooper', ""Yes. Nick, we haven't quantified the lag as it varies year-to-year. But the drivers that you should think about, and Jeff mentioned one in the context of interest expense, that's certainly one we have a 3.85% embedded cost of debt in this case. But the two debt issuances we've done since the case are in the mid-5% range to the low 6% range. So substantially above it, we knew going into the case, we really wanted to focus on getting the ROE back up to the right level. We had a good equity capital structure. And so in terms of the elements of WACC, the cost of debt was one that we deemphasized in this case, it would create a lower revenue environment, but we do need to recoup that to be more representative of forward financing costs. O&M is the other one where if you think about the test year, we were in a period of mid-2021 to mid-2022 as our test year. I'd like to say it's -- it was during the time where the Fed was still talking about inflation as transitory. But if you look at it relative to our 2024 O&M guidance, you're talking about somewhere in the neighborhood of $100 million of incremental O&M. And that's what really good from our perspective O&M story, where year-over-year we are bringing O&M down despite having a full year of higher wages at some of our business units and on a -- that's on a core basis. And even with the higher amount of plant outages given the Four Corners outage, you're still talking about a less than 2% O&M increase to the midpoint of our guidance range. So a good story, but a lot of historical O&M to catch up on. Pension, which we've talked about in the past, Fortunately, it's not a story. If you look at the guidance walk to 2024. No further impacts from pension effect, it's a $0.01 positive on the nonservice credit side, but we are carrying with us the 2022 market impacts. Impacts to our pension asset as well as the substantial change in discount rates year-over-year, and so we'll need to recoup that as well. And then the final one, and you'll see that again in our walk this year, increases in depreciation related to plant going to service. a great story from this rate case, that's the one area where we got 12 months of post test year plant, plus one major project that fell outside that 12-month window. But our 2024 projects include some IT investments, which have a shorter depreciation life and will contribute further that lag. So we've -- we're excited to get into the opportunity to have a dialogue with the commission and stakeholders about these issues. And of course, we'll continue to look at the cadence of future rate cases to address them as well."", 'Nicholas Joseph Campanella', ""Thanks for laying all that out there. Really appreciate it. I guess, Andrew, just on this 5% to 7% growth rate, I think in the past, it's been tough to kind of extrapolate that linearly off of the base year just because of the rate filing cadence. Can you just kind of give us a flavor of how you're thinking about it? I guess you have new rates in mid-25. But then as you get past that, you start to ramp this SRB capital potentially. You have some FERC transmission opportunities you highlighted. So do you kind of start to grow linearly in 2016 and beyond? Or how do you kind of think about that?"", 'Andrew D. Cooper', ""Yes. It's a really great question, Nick, because we have the investment profile. We have, fortunately, a customer rate headroom. The IRA is a TBD. We'll see where that goes. But we really have the profile to grow that 5% to 7% over the long term. And much of the conversation we've been having here has been about the regulatory lag kind of embedded in a historical test year. And so if we could address that and go into a more stable price environment, we certainly have the opportunity to create more smooth cost recovery. Over the medium term, the SRB is a significant contributor to that, because as you basically double the amount of track capital that you have that are going through some form of adjustor mechanisms. So between the transmission spend and the SRB eligible generation spend, you're having a much smoother pace of recovery where your customer -- your sales growth is supporting any O&M increases and supporting the needs of growing distribution system and then your transmission and generation spend is tracked. So we view our ability, once we've caught up on these historical lagging cost to be in a place where that cost recovery profile can smooth. We see the past to 5% to 7% either way. but it is really addressing some of these near-term pinch points that come out of the last few years of inflation that we need to address to get to the other side of that. Between the SRB and sales growth because as you look at the long-term sales growth, not only is it providing us some top line, but it's also, as I mentioned earlier, blunting some of the O&M and ensuring that we create operating leverage out of those increased sales."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is coming from Michael Lonegan from Evercore ISI.', 'Michael B. Lonegan', ""So you've talked about your equity issuance plan, balancing your capital and intended to balance your capital structure to greater than 50% equity at the EPS level. Obviously, you lowered your FFO to debt target of 14% to 16%. Just wondering if, ideally, more specifically, if you're looking to target as high as 52% equity at APS structure to match the rate case outcome. And then where you anticipate landing on FFO to debt metric this year and over your plan?"", 'Andrew D. Cooper', ""Yes, Michael, I think there's two pieces to the equity capital structure story. One is we never want to fall too far behind. Because the equity ratio has been an issue that through the last two rate case cycles, for example, with nearly 55% in 2019 and then nearly 52% in this most recent rate case. It's been an issue that's largely not been one that has been subject to a lot of debate is the actual capital structure at the end of the historical past year. And we think that a balanced capital structure of a little bit more than 50% equity at the utility is an appropriate one. It's consistent with national averages. As I mentioned earlier in my remarks, the 51.9% that we got in the last rate case is a solid capital structure. It is consistent with where averages are around the country. And while in any given year, we want to make sure that we're trying to stay above 50, so we're not in a catch-up situation. we are going to look at any time period, what does the overall WACC look like, what's the right rate question from going into a rate case and want to make that the WACC overall is one that's affordable to customers. So it's really a balance. That equity that we talked about earlier, up to 500, which now needs to be trued up a little bit higher. If you look at our 10-K and you calculate the APS equity ratio it's below 50%. And so this is the company that we believe we need to get to the right spot going forward. This is all balanced with credit metrics. The 14% to 16% you mentioned is an opportunity for us to balance the needs of our capital investment plan and having solid investment-grade credit ratings. We're still in conversations with the rating agencies as they've been watching the regulatory environment over the last 2 years and expect to continue to work with them to clarify where they're coming out now the rate case is complete."", 'Michael B. Lonegan', ""Great. And then secondly for me, regarding your sales growth forecast through 2026 guiding to 4% to 6% through that '26 period versus 2% to 4% this year. Obviously, you're expecting large C&I customers to come online. Just wondering how we should think about sales growth in '25 and specifically and also in '26 when we see the spike or is it consistent in those 2 years?"", 'Andrew D. Cooper', ""Yes. And we haven't been granular between the two. Because as we've seen over the last few years, and we've conservatively forecast our sales growth. And I think we learned a lot last year in terms of the ramp rate of some of these larger high load factor customers, both on the advanced manufacturing side and the data centers. And so we forecast conservatively and there can be some variability intra-year as far as you've got a data center box and you've got an anchor in there and you can keep building it out. That happens over time. And so for these large customers, we're not sharing a granular view between '25 and '26. I would say that Taiwan Semiconductor, which is one of the larger new customers that we have coming in. They're committed to full ramp-up of their first fab in the first half of 2025. And the ecosystem of other companies that surrounds them is part of that sales growth rate. And so their timing, reaching that full production and then having a full year impact to that in 2026 kind of gets you to the terminal year there of the growth rate range. It doesn't give you an answer to your question on '25 versus '26 exactly. But the trends that we watch are fundamentally the ramp rates of each of these customers and our team is having regular conversations with each of them and has a pretty close pulse on what the ramp looks like."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is coming from Paul Patterson from Glenrock.', 'Paul Patterson', 'Good morning. Just really quick sort of bookkeeping questions. When -- I apologize if I missed this. What is the timing of your next rate case do you guys expect to file?', 'Jeffrey B. Guldner', ""Yes, Paul, we haven't -- have not picked the timing for that. The regulatory lag docket is starting on March 19. And so that's going to be the first workshop. I expect they're going to -- I expect the commission is going to engage probably most of this year in conversations around that docket. And I think consistent with what we had kind of shared at EEI, we want to see how that docket is evolving. And make sure that if there's opportunities to have a better structure in terms of a different process that picks up regulatory lag, you would want to wait until you see how that docket plays out. So we have to balance that continuing to watch with the progress on that with than just the regulatory lag that Andrew has talked about earlier."", 'Paul Patterson', ""Okay. You anticipated my next question, which to follow up on that, when do you think -- you said you expect them to be engaged with it this year. Always hard to sort of predict when a docket like that would be resolved. But do you have any sense? I know it's really early, but I'm just curious, do you have any idea when you think that might be -- they might -- we might get a conclusion or at least a better idea about where they're headed on that?"", 'Jeffrey B. Guldner', ""Yes. I think if you watched probably the initial dockets, I'm guessing they're probably going to have some conversation around the timing that they look for that. I would not be surprised particularly because I think the start of the docket waited until all the utilities were through their rate cases. So we had a TEP case, UNS case and so I think they're just waiting for our case to get cleared before opening this generic docket up and looking at the utilities. And given the focus that I think the commission has indicated around dealing with regulatory lag. I would not be surprised if you've got a pretty good progress throughout this year. And that the idea would be then in 2025 and beyond, if there's a clarity in terms of a process or an approach to take that. That's when you start seeing utilities begin to adapt the recommendations or whatever comes out of the docket. But you got to watch early on and just see how it begins to develop."", 'Paul Patterson', 'Okay. And then I guess so the answer to the first question sort of is probably not until 2025, would we see an actual filing for a new rate case. Does that make sense when I think about it correctly?', 'Jeffrey B. Guldner', ""Yes. I think -- I mean, a, you've got -- you want to put rates in effect. If we put rates in effect in March, you typically want to have at least half year rates in effect. That's been the process that has been used in Arizona. And then if you start lining up calendar versus split years. But obviously, like you said, we want to watch how the docket evolves and decide how we move forward. The other thing, just to -- we've got flagged that, I think, an important driver, and you saw it with the complexity of this case is that continuing to work with stakeholders on the value of settlements. We had a long history prior to the last couple of cases where we were able to reach pretty constructive settlements that had benefits and the real benefit of moving into a settlement is you don't see -- typically, you don't see binary outcomes. There's things where there's benefits to both sides. And so some of the customer-related programs, in particular, you can actually get pretty good results in a settlement when you're crafting things like that. And so I would hope that at the same time as the commission is working through the regulatory lag docket that we continue to work with stakeholders to set up an environment where we could see the next case moving in, and again, maybe taking advantage of whatever comes out of that docket, but moving into more of a settlement structure than a fully litigated case. So still too early to tell on both counts, but those are two areas we'd be focused on."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is coming from Bill [Upcheli] from UBS.', 'Unidentified Analyst', 'Just a question. So on the SRB, practically speaking, would that be deployed in 2026 when some of these assets are coming into service? Or when will we first see that deployed?', 'Andrew D. Cooper', ""Short answer, yes. If you think about the RFP, assuming that our projects clear through the RFP, the earliest in services you have are in advance of summer 2026. There is a filing process around the time the assets go into service, which I mentioned earlier in the remarks, could be in the 6-month range, but that's something that we'll work through at the time. The first kind of slug of projects is ensuring that we have reliability over summer '26. And you'll see the types of projects that are in that list of potential opportunities. a pretty diverse group of technology types. And so that was really the other thing, I think, that I would highlight from that opportunity set as it addresses reliability needs for the summer peak as well as some of the shifts that we're making in our clean energy commitment. So 2026 is the period -- and I talked about earlier, this is a medium-term part of the solution around regulatory lag is increasing the share of track capital, and that will pair nicely with the work that we're doing right now on some of those income statement costs that we want to make sure that we're recovering in a timely way."", 'Unidentified Analyst', ""Okay. And then I guess around that on the cost side, did you guys take advantage of some of the weather and pull forward some of the O&M from '24 into '23? Or I guess, maybe how are you combating some of these inflationary pressures to keep the core O&M declining year-over-year?"", 'Andrew D. Cooper', ""Yes. So as the weather continued to be a positive benefit through the year, we did look at opportunities to take some of the O&M out of 2024. As we were triaging during the summer, we were really just making sure that we are allocating O&Ms to the right spots within '23 to make sure that we're meeting the needs of our generation fleet and keeping reliability through that summer. So there was some modest pull forward. And that's something that we look at every year and look at the opportunity to take costs out. What's really driving the long-term trend is our overall focus on customer affordability and on that lean culture that we've ingrained in the organization. That's a fundamental driver. You also have Cholla. This is the last year of operations. And so some of the O&M from Cholla rolls off. as we move away from some of the heavier fuel, heavier O&M assets into some of the lighter O&M assets. So it's really a combination. All of that is offset by a full year impact of our contracted IBW and some of the other wage pressure that we've seen. But we're -- there's a lot of pride internally on the ability to manage O&M and operator reliable system with a lean mentality underlying it."", 'Unidentified Analyst', ""Okay. All right. And then lastly, just two quick ones on the '24. There's $0.10 in the guidance for the BCE sale, but I just want to clarify that you're still good growing off of the midpoint, right, even though that obviously is a sale, that's not going to repeat. And then secondly, just on the equity, the $600 million to $700 million, that should be sort of block equity that we should expect upfront this year, right? And then the $400 million is more ratable through all the options that you discussed earlier. Is that the way to think about it?"", 'Andrew D. Cooper', ""Yes. Just going back to your first question, yes, the -- our guidance range includes the expected gain on the sale of Bright Canyon this year. And we're very confident that, that 5% to 7% earnings growth is available to us on that rebased level, including that year-over-year $0.10. Going to the equity I wouldn't want to comment on the timing specifically of that $600 million to $700 million. But fundamentally, you're thinking about it the right way, which is that we have a need to true up our capital structure. And that capital structure need goes with the question that was asked earlier around the timing of our rate case, which we're also going to continue to monitor. So we're fortunate our flexibility from the perspective of our capital plan and our financing plan as to when we do that larger equity ratio true-up need common equity is the default kind of base case option for that need. We are flexible in terms of the timing. We'll continue to monitor the market and execute the optimal time for us. The $400 million that comes later is really a longer-term periodic need over the period to make sure that we're supporting our CapEx from right mix of external financing sources."", 'Unidentified Analyst', 'Right. Great. And congrats on getting through a successful rate case.', 'Operator', 'Your next question is coming from Anthony Crowdell from Mizuho. .', 'Anthony Christopher Crowdell', ""Just two quick ones. Where did you end 2023 on an FFO to debt basis at Pinnacle West? And second, to Mike's question earlier on the balance sheet, you talked about a lot of discussions with the rating agencies. I'm just curious if you think the recent balanced outcome in the APS case is enough to remove the negative outlook at the agencies?"", 'Andrew D. Cooper', ""Yes. Thanks, Anthony. The agencies haven't provided their kind of official calculations on FFO to debt at year-end yet. We had -- if you think about the old range that we had said 16% to 18%, if you look at any of the kind of trailing periods before that, we had fallen below that. We were in the 15s -- so I don't have a Q4 number, but from the agencies, it's in the 15s on a trailing basis before that. And so 1 of the things we wanted to do is be realistic about setting a range that made sense to meet our capital needs that we believe allows us to preserve solid investment-grade credit ratings, and that's why we reset that target of 14% to 16%. And S&P was pretty clear in the middle of the year that their downgrade threshold with a constructive rate case outcome is in the 13% range and they're, of course, the one that's one notch lower. And so we feel confident that our ranch allows us to continue to manage around that. The other agencies, which have a one notch higher rating, we're still at a point -- to your second question, where we're waiting to see how they evaluate the credit. But we felt comfortable moving to this 14% to 16% target range over the longer term to match up our capital needs and where we thought we'd be okay from a ratings perspective. So to your second question, we've had quite a bit of conversation with the agencies over the last couple of years. They have -- we've spent a lot of time highlighting with them, and they're certainly mindful of the constructive regulatory outcomes that we've seen. And so we can't really predict when they're going to act, but we are actively going to engage with them now that the rate case is complete, to continue to highlight these factors. As we said all along, the agencies are focused as much qualitatively here on the improvements and derisking of the regulatory construct, which we believe we've seen over the course of the proceedings over the last 2 years. But certainly, we'll be sharing with them numbers and forecasts and that dialogue so that they can -- they don't typically have outlooks not resolved for this period of time. They were clearly waiting for this rate case outcome to complete in order to resolve their outlook. And so again, while I can't anticipate how and when they'll act. Our expectation would be that now that they have all the information in front of them, they can make an evaluation of the ratings."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session. Ladies and gentlemen, this completes today's event. You may disconnect at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.""]"

But you can significantly boost your returns by picking above-average stocks. For example, the WestRock Company (NYSE:WRK) share price is up 40% in the last 1 year, clearly besting the market return of around 26% (not including dividends). So that should have shareholders smiling. Zooming out, the stock is actually down 6.8% in the last three years."", ""With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies."", ' View our latest analysis for WestRock ', 'While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.', ""During the last year WestRock saw its earnings per share (EPS) drop below zero. While some may see this as temporary, we're a skeptical bunch, and so we're a little surprised to see the share price go up. We might get a clue to explain the share price move by looking to other metrics."", ""WestRock's revenue actually dropped 5.7% over last year. So using a snapshot of key business metrics doesn't give us a good picture of why the market is bidding up the stock."", 'The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).', 'You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.', 'As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of WestRock, it has a TSR of 45% for the last 1 year. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.', ""It's good to see that WestRock has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 45% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 7% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand WestRock better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with WestRock (at least 1 which can't be ignored)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process."", 'For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.', 'Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.', 'Have feedback on this article?

While many experts caution against falling into yield traps, historical data suggests that high-yield stocks have performed well. However, combining both dividend growth and high yield can be a powerful strategy to maximize returns. One example is the S&P Sector-Neutral High Yield Dividend Aristocrats (HYDA) index, which aims to blend dividend growth with higher relative yield while maintaining sector weights similar to the S&P Composite 1500. This index is noted for its defensive characteristics. According to a report from S&P Dow Jones Indices, it has historically provided a buffer against market volatility. On average, the index has outperformed the benchmark when the VIX level, a measure of market volatility, was above 20, with the strongest outperformance seen when the VIX level was above 30. The report further noted that from January 31, 2005, to July 31, 2023, the index's overall return was nearly the same as the benchmark. That said, the S&P Sector-Neutral HYDA showed lower volatility throughout the entire period compared to the benchmark, resulting in better risk-adjusted returns. Moreover, the maximum drawdown experienced during that time frame was reduced by around 5%, indicating a more resilient performance during market downturns."", ""Given investors' preference for dividend-paying stocks and their track record of returns, numerous companies are striving to initiate, sustain, and enhance their dividend payouts. In a notable recent development, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has commenced paying a quarterly cash dividend to its shareholders. This move underscores the increasing popularity of dividends in the market. Notably, Morningstar analysts have observed a significant rise in the funds targeting dividend-paying stocks, with the total amount reaching $1 trillion. This figure has been growing at a rate of 10% annually since 2018, indicating a robust and expanding interest in dividend investments."", 'Dividend stocks have consistently gained traction due to their resilience and strong performance during previous periods of inflation. Over time, dividends have been a significant contributor, comprising approximately 40% of the total return of the S&P 500 since 1930. However, during decades characterized by high inflation rates, such as the 1940s, 1970s, and 1980s, where inflation averaged 5% or more, dividends accounted for an even larger portion, generating 54% of the total return. Naveed Rahman, co-manager of the Fidelity Equity-Income Strategy, highlighted this trend. He also emphasized that while seeking the best-performing dividend stocks today, investors may need to look beyond the traditional industries or sectors that have historically dominated such investments. The report further noted that companies that consistently pay dividends that are both sustainable and increasing have the capability to expand their cash flows over time, thereby enabling them to stay aligned with inflationary pressures.', 'Walmart Inc.

Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. It paid out more than half (53%) of its free cash flow in the past year, which is within an average range for most companies.', ""It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. This is why it's a relief to see Analog Devices earnings per share are up 7.0% per annum over the last five years. While earnings have been growing at a credible rate, the company is paying out a majority of its earnings to shareholders. If management lifts the payout ratio further, we'd take this as a tacit signal that the company's growth prospects are slowing."", ""The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Analog Devices has delivered an average of 10% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders."", ""Should investors buy Analog Devices for the upcoming dividend? Earnings per share growth has been unremarkable, and while the company is paying out a majority of its earnings and cash flow in the form of dividends, the dividend payments don't appear excessive. In summary, it's hard to get excited about Analog Devices from a dividend perspective."", 'Ever wonder what the future holds for Analog Devices?

The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website.With that, I will now turn it over to Marc to discuss our fourth quarter results and 2024 outlook."", 'Marc R. Montagner', ""Thank you, Mark. We ended 2023 with another strong quarter. Our fourth quarter results were ahead of our expectations and allowed us to finish at or near the high end of our full year 2023 outlook for site leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share. Consolidated same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the fourth quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 3.6% net year-over-year, including the impact of 3.9% of churn. On a gross basis, same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth was 7.5%. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the fourth quarter of last year was 6.9% on a gross basis and 3.5% on a net basis, including 3.4% of churn. Of that 3.4%, 1.6% was related to Sprint consolidation churn.As expected, domestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the fourth quarter was consistent with the lower levels of activity we saw during the second and third quarter of 2023. Full year organic leasing contribution to domestic site leasing revenue ended up in line with our previously provided outlook. Non-Sprint related domestic annual churn was also in line with our prior expectations and continues to be between 1% and 2% of our domestic site leasing revenue. International same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the fourth quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 4.2% net, including 5.9% of churn or 10.1% on a gross basis.In Brazil, our largest international market, same-tower gross organic growth was 8% on a constant currency basis. Total international churn remained elevated in the fourth quarter due mostly to carrier consolidation. During the fourth quarter, 77.5% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 16.1% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter. During the fourth quarter, we expanded our tower portfolio, acquiring 23 communication sites for a total cash consideration of $21.3 million. We also built 138 new sites. Subsequent to the quarter end, we have purchased or under agreement to acquire 281 sites in all of our existing markets for an aggregate price of $87.8 million. We anticipate closing on this site under contract by the end of the third quarter.Looking ahead, this afternoon earnings press release includes our initial outlook for the full year 2024. Our outlook reflects a continuation of the reduced level of carrier CapEx that began early last year. Despite this, our leasing business will continue to grow organically through contribution from new leases, amendments and contracted escalators. Domestically, our outlook assumes $55 million of customer churn in 2024, of which approximately $30 million related to Sprint-related decommissioning. Our previously provided estimate of aggregate Sprint-related churn over the next several years remain largely unchanged. We anticipate a range of $40 million to $45 million in 2025, $45 million to $55 million in 2026 and $10 million to $20 million in 2027.Internationally, our outlook includes approximately $22 million churn in 2024. During the fourth quarter of '23, we signed a multiyear agreement with Vivo in Brazil. Under this agreement, we expect to incur $4 million Oi wireless consolidation churn in 2024 and an additional $2 million over the next several years. Total anticipated Oi wireless consolidated churn remains at approximately $30 million. Additionally, our full year 2024 outlook reflects a year-over-year decline in service revenue and gross profit due to the lower overall carrier activity in the U.S. However, our outlook is in line with the historical performance, excluding our very strong result in 2022 and '23 due to the initial rollout of 5G network by some of our wireless customers during these years. This outlook does not assume any further acquisitions beyond those under contract and does not assume any share repurchase. However, we are likely to invest in additional assets and/or share repurchase during the year. Our outlook for net cash interest expense and for FFO and FFO per share include the recent refinancing of our Term Loan B debt, the upsize of our credit facility and the future refinancing up -- rerating rate in the future of our $620 million ABS tower securities maturing in October 2024.Our balance sheet remains very strong, and we have ample liquidity. In January of 2024, we refinanced our $2.3 billion credit facility, pushing out the maturity to 2031. We also increased our revolver capacity by $500 million. Our $2 billion revolver is almost fully paid down. Our leverage remains at historical lows and well below our steady target of 7 to 7.5 turns, giving us plenty of dry power for opportunistic acquisition and/or share repurchase. Lastly, we purchased a forward-starting interest rate swap in the fourth quarter. This will give us greater certainty around future interest costs.With that, let me turn the call over to Mark, who will provide additional detail."", 'Mark DeRussy', ""Thank you, Marc. We ended the quarter with $12.4 billion of total debt and $12.1 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.3x, which is below the low end of our target range and near the lowest level we have seen in decades. Our fourth quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was very strong at 5.2x. During the fourth quarter 2023, the company entered into a $1 billion forward-starting interest rate swap, which will swap 1-month SOFR for a fixed rate of 3.83%. The swap has an effective start date of March 31, 2025, which coincides with the expiration of our existing $1.95 billion notional interest rate swap. This forward starting interest rate swap agreement will expire April 11, 2028.Subsequent to the fourth quarter and on January 25, 2024, the company issued a new $2.3 billion secured Term Loan B under its amended and restated senior credit agreement. This matures in January of 2031. The new term loan accrues interest at SOFR plus 200 basis points. The existing $1.95 billion interest rate swap will remain in effect until expiration on March 31, 2025. The term loan was issued at 99.75% of par value. The proceeds were used to retire the company's 2018 term loan and to pay related fees and expenses. Also, subsequent to the quarter, on February 23, 2024, the company further increased the total commitments under the revolving credit facility from $1.75 billion to $2 billion. We continue to use cash on hand to repay amounts under the revolver. And as of today, we have a $70 million outstanding balance under our $2 billion revolver. The current weighted average interest rate of our total outstanding debt is 3% with a weighted average maturity of approximately 4.1 years. The current rate on our outstanding revolver balance is 6.4%. The interest rate on 97% of our current outstanding debt is fixed.During the fourth quarter, as we previously discussed on our third quarter earnings call, we repurchased 234,000 shares of our common stock, $46 million, at an average price of $198.27 per share. We currently have $405 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan. The company's shares outstanding at December 31, 2023, were 108.1 million. In addition, during the fourth quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $91.8 million or $0.85 a share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a first quarter dividend of $0.98 per share payable on March 28, 2024, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 14, 2024. This dividend represents an increase of approximately 15% over the dividend we paid in the fourth quarter.With that, I'll now turn the call over to Brendan."", 'Brendan Thomas Cavanagh', ""Thank you, Mark. Good afternoon. I am pleased for the opportunity to reflect on our 2023 performance and to share our thoughts about 2024 and beyond. 2023 was a year marked by some significant macro headwinds, in particular, the consistently high interest rate environment that not only directly affected SBA's floating rate debt costs and the views around our cost of future refinancing but also impacted our customers and their network spending levels. In spite of these macro headwinds, SBA executed extremely well and produced solid financial results. When compared against the initial outlook for 2023 given in February of last year, our actual results for the year finished materially above the high end of the ranges given for site leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share. Most of the outperformance was organic as we spent very little incremental discretionary CapEx in comparison to our initial outlook. Our excess free cash flow was instead largely spent on paying down our floating rate revolver debt, and we finished the year at a multi-decade low leverage level of 6.3x and today have a current revolver balance of only $70 million.Internally, it was a year of leadership transition for the company. Jeffrey Stoops' retirement, the addition of Marc Montagner to the team and new leaders in our international, legal and IT functions. Everyone has stepped up extremely well into their roles, and I am very happy with how the team is collaborating and performing. The disciplined succession planning and highly capable team members assembled throughout the organization have positioned us well for the future.As we look forward to 2024, we recognize that we are coming off of a period of reduced network investment by our largest domestic customers. However, future network needs for each of these customers remain significant, and we anticipate being a critical partner for our customers in meeting their operational goals and objectives. A significant percentage of our sites still require 5G-related upgrades, which we are confident will take place over the next couple of years. In addition, the success and growth of fixed wireless access as a product offering for our customers will add greater demand for increased network capacity as the average user of this product uses 20x or more broadband data than the typical mobile customer. And the evolution of AI-infused 5G offerings will continue to fuel the demand for improved speeds and lower latency. All of these factors, as well as good old-fashioned service-based competition, are supportive of steady organic leasing activity on our U.S. assets for years to come.Internationally, we also see a dynamic of significant network needs, providing a backdrop for continued solid organic leasing activity throughout many of our markets. Financial pressures have impacted many of our international customers as well but the demand for advanced wireless products and services is significant and, in a number of cases, even greater than that seen in the U.S. We expect this will in turn drive continued demand for incremental space at our tower sites. Nonetheless, there have been customer consolidations in several of our markets. As a result, we have worked closely with our customers to help them achieve necessary efficiencies in their operations but while preserving the breadth of our business relationships and solidifying our contractual commitments for the long term. While this temporarily leads to elevated churn, we believe the long-term strength and stability of our cash flow streams produced as a result of these efforts meaningfully improves our go-forward value proposition. This is a good segue into my views around our forward strategy. Internally, we are highlighting a desire to analyze everything we do or consider doing through the lens of stabilizing our results, growing our core business and shifting our mix more and more to high-quality assets and operations. While this is not materially different than the approach SBA has taken throughout its history, we recognize that not all of our assets or business lines fit well within this goal. As a result, we are doing the work to evaluate our full portfolio and develop action plans around how we improve our position in each business line and in each market. For instance, in our international operations, we have found it to be valuable to be a market leader in the markets we operate in. In places where we hold a more significant position, we have tended to do better than those places where we do not. This ultimately means that we need to find a path to increase scale in certain markets or possibly exit a market. An example of this was our fourth quarter exit from Argentina. Not only was our market position subscale, but the economic instability in that country created operational challenges that were dilutive to the otherwise typically very attractive attributes of the tower business. We will pursue incremental investments to drive continued growth as we always have, but we will prioritize either an overall favorable shift in the quality and stability of our asset mix or an opportunistic investment that improves our standing in existing markets.Financial results always matter. We will be disciplined toward producing the best possible financial results over the long term. We believe high-quality assets ultimately produce that result. We also believe that when opportunities for incremental asset investments are not available, stock repurchases and debt reductions are worthwhile uses of capital. We intend to continually evaluate our optimal capital structure, and we'll look to balance the lowest cost of capital with retaining appropriate investment flexibility.Our attention to optimize capitalization of the company has placed us in what I believe is the best position in the industry. We are the fastest dividend grower, but yet, have the greatest retained AFFO post-dividend to invest in the business. We have maintained an average cost of debt very close to our larger peers but have retained access to up to 2 turns more leverage. We have recently extended and expanded our revolver capacity by $500 million, creating increased liquidity. This structure provides us with significant optionality to move in whichever direction we believe will provide the best return for our shareholders. The strength and stability of our core tower business remains and it provides a tremendous foundation for all future endeavors. As a result, I have great confidence in our ability to create future value for our shareholders. I want to thank our customers for their support and their confidence in SBA. I also want to thank our team members for their contributions to our success.And with that, Eric, we are ready to take questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) First, we will hear from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James.', 'Richard Hamilton Prentiss', 'Brendan, congrats on the new seat. Mark with the K, welcome to the calls.', 'Mark DeRussy', 'Thank you.', 'Richard Hamilton Prentiss', ""First, leverage obviously has been a key focus.

How should we think about 6.3 and where it heads in the future versus stock buyback? And then on the M&A side, update us as far as what you're seeing out there. You mentioned that you like to be the leader in your markets. Are there any deals out there that would give you an industry-leading position? And what would kind of make that an interesting market if there were new markets out there?"", 'Brendan Thomas Cavanagh', ""Yes. So Ric, on the leverage side, we're at 6.3x mostly because we believe that throughout the last year, the best use of our capital was into paying down that floating rate debt that we had with some of the highest cost debt in our structure. And we didn't necessarily see opportunities that we thought were a better use of capital. But we're comfortable at a higher level of leverage if we see the right place to use that capital. That may include some amount of stock buybacks, but it also obviously would include quality acquisitions if we see that opportunity. So really, what we're doing is we're retaining flexibility as it relates to our balance sheet to go in whichever direction we think produces the best result. We don't feel that we have to stay at this level, but if we do, that's fine, too.On the M&A front, yes, it's one of the aspects of what we look for when we're looking at a new market or even at opportunities within some of our existing markets where we're perhaps not a market leader in terms of our position, is to be a leader, if we can, in terms of our size and importance to our customers. We used to just assume that we look at all opportunities that are available throughout the globe, frankly, as they come available, and we consider that among a number of other factors when we're looking at that. I can't really speak to anything specific that we're looking at, but there definitely are opportunities out there."", 'Richard Hamilton Prentiss', ""Obviously, we're sitting here at the end of February. Can you help us understand the pacing of what you think new lease activity in the United States will kind of play out through the year? And is it still kind of 3 months, maybe closer to 6 months, as far as when you get an application into where it actually turns into revenue?"", 'Brendan Thomas Cavanagh', ""Yes. The time frame from signing something to when it actually gets into revenue is still pretty consistent with what it's been in the past. Obviously, it's a little bit longer for a brand-new lease when we sign that. That's usually a good 6 months or more on the amendments. It's typically shorter, closer to 3 months, but it depends on the specific circumstances. So that's pretty consistent with what it's been in the past. In terms of the pacing throughout the year, our projections, if you look at our bridge in terms of what we've put forth as contributions, and I assume you're asking about domestic specifically, but domestically, that number should be a little bit more front-end loaded today because it's based on activity that we've seen throughout last year and that's kind of rolling over. And at this point, we're not necessarily forecasting a material pickup in activity. But to the extent there is that pickup in activity, it's mostly going to impact next year."", 'Operator', 'And next we will hear from Jonathan Atkin with RBC Capital Markets.', 'Jonathan Atkin', 'Two questions. One, you talked about the willingness to examine and exit from markets where you lack scale, does that apply to product areas such as data centers? And then my second question is you called out the Vivo relationship in Brazil. Anything with TIM or Claro along similar lines where you might be renegotiating some of your commercial terms or looking to kind of react to market conditions in Brazil?', 'Brendan Thomas Cavanagh', ""Yes. On your first question, there's no specific plans to exit anything, to exit the data centers or anything else in particular. But I will tell you that we are applying the same lens to everything that we do as we kind of evaluate these various things, whether it's international markets or it's other product lines. And we look at that through a financial lens and what the future can be, opportunities to grow it, what are the synergies with our base core business. I mean, ultimately, we're a tower company, how do things fit in with that. As we go through that analysis, we may come to the conclusion with something that we should exit it, but we may also come to the conclusion that we should grow it, too. So at this stage, it's premature to say that we would make a decision one way or the other, but you should assume that we're looking at each of our holdings through that lens.With regard to Brazil, I don't know if you recall, Jon, but last year, we announced, about a year ago at this time, that we had entered into an agreement with TIM related to the Oi consolidation, and it actually pulled forward some of the churn into 2023 associated with that consolidation, but it dealt with a number of other issues and extended agreements out. So we already have something largely in place with TIM. In the case of Claro, there's currently nothing in place, but we're constantly in discussions with them. And it may or may not lead to something, but we're talking with them about what would be best for them and for us."", 'Operator', ""And next, we'll hear from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson."", 'Nicholas Ralph Del Deo', ""Congratulations to both Brendan and Mark on your new-ish positions. Brendan, I guess to start, you noted that you tend to do better in markets where you have meaningful scale or a leadership position. How do you define a leadership position? Is that share of total assets owned mostly on threshold? Or is it some other measure? And does this general framework that you're embracing, I mean it's less likely that you're going to enter into a new market? Or is that sort of a separate consideration if you think you're on a path to a leadership position in it?"", 'Brendan Thomas Cavanagh', ""Yes. It basically means your relevance in the market to your customers, which generally means the size and scale of your operations, so the percentage of the portfolio that you represent for the larger, most important customers in that market. When you are at a level that is, frankly, immaterial to their network needs, your ability to drive additional business and to negotiate terms on new opportunities is just not as great as when you're a more meaningful partner. So that's really what I mean when I talk about the size and scale.As it relates to new markets, that would be a consideration, obviously, before we go into the new market, what's our position going to look like in that market. So it doesn't mean that we would not go into a new market, but we would consider that factor as one of the factors when we're thinking about it."", 'Nicholas Ralph Del Deo', ""Okay. And then regarding domestic lease in '24 in the U.S., you're guiding to $42 million this year, and you just said it was going to be probably front-end loaded. I think you've previously spoken to sort of the low end of a range of leasing over time as being around $40 million. It seems like the run rate in the second half of the year, if $42 million is front-end loaded, might annualize to a pace below $40 million. I guess do you see a plausible scenario where full year leasing could go below for you in light of current conditions?"", 'Brendan Thomas Cavanagh', ""Well, yes, it could. Obviously, we're just above $40 million now for this year. So if we don't see any pickup as we get to the second half of the year, I do expect that the run rate at the end of the year today that's implied in our guidance would be slightly below $40 million, so that's possible. I think, though, some of this is lumpiness in the way that things come in under our AT&T MLA agreement. So the fact that it's a little higher in the first part of the year and a little lower in the second half of the year could be something we see next year as well."", 'Operator', ""And next, we'll hear from David Barden with Bank of America."", 'David William Barden', ""So I guess the first one, for the guidance, it was clear that you weren't assuming any new portfolio acquisitions or buybacks, but could you be specific about what you are assuming in the guide for the use of cash? Is it putting it in the bank at a 5% interest rate? Or what should we kind of use as a baseline as a comparison to what's going on?I guess a second question, if I could, Brendan, is there a fuse on any of these decisions about whether to pull the trigger on portfolio acquisition versus stock buybacks given that your stock buybacks could be pretty powerful if they happen sooner rather than later?And I apologize, if I could, just one last one for Mark D. This $1 billion hedge on a forward basis that you've put in place, which replaces the existing hedge on the $2 billion term that comes due March '25, I'm assuming that there's an opportunity, if you chose, to do something additional to the [$3.85 billion] that you've locked in, is there a timetable to make that decision?"", 'Mark DeRussy', ""There is the possibility to do that. We have done this in the past. This hedge only represents 50% of what our actual outstanding debt is. So there could be room to increase our hedging along those lines as well. But with respect to any type of timetable, David, no, there is no timetable. We're just going to keep an eye on the market and act appropriately if we decide that that's the thing that we need to do."", 'Brendan Thomas Cavanagh', ""Yes. On that item, David, I mean, really the thinking was that we sort of took half of it and created some level of certainty given that there's some instability, obviously, in what interest rates will look like. And we've all seen, over the last few months, expectations of when interest rate cuts are going to happen, move around quite a bit. So for us, we basically ensured that a portion of that debt we would have some stability and certainty on it. And it locks in basically a much lower rate than exists today. So if we let the other piece float, I think we can have a good natural hedge in that case.On your other questions, on the use of cash in our guidance, because there will be cash that's obviously accumulated, part of it first goes into paying down the revolver, of course, what's left outstanding on that and it covers some of the discretionary spending that is implied in our guidance for deals that are under contract as well as new builds, the items that are basically covered in our discretionary CapEx guidance. Anything excess is assumed to be invested at about a 4% or so interest rate. So that is implied in our net cash interest guidance, some interest income on that.And then I think your other question was the M&A versus buybacks and the timing. I mean, there's a variety of things that we're constantly looking at. And the timing of M&A transactions you don't have as much control over. Obviously, we have complete control over buybacks. And so to some degree, we have to balance the capital that we have available and that we may or may not need. And so sometimes we can jump in earlier, if we have a clear vision as to what's going to happen. And other times, we have to hold back a little bit and see how things play out. So I hear what you're saying, and we obviously believe our stock is a good buy at this level but we've got to balance that against all the different options in front of us."", 'Operator', ""And next, we'll hear from Michael Rollins with Citi."", 'Michael Ian Rollins', ""Two questions, if I could. First, as you look at the business going forward, can you give us an update as to what are your north star metrics that are guiding the decision-making and your measurement of performance? Is it organic leasing, EBITDA, AFFO per share or other metrics that are important to you and the Board? And can you give us some direction of how you see that growth in those metrics, let's say, over the next 3 years? And then just separately, just more of an operational question on the tower portfolio, can you give us an update as to what percent of the sites have been upgraded and touched to bring them to 5G mid-band capabilities? And over what period do you think you get to 100%?"", 'Brendan Thomas Cavanagh', ""So Mike, the numbers that we typically report on, we report on because we think they're the most important. I think the #1 metric in our view here and with our Board, and frankly, with many of our investors, is AFFO per share because it represents that amount of actual free cash flow that is available to be returned to shareholders in some form or fashion. Whether that be reinvested into the business or be paid out as a dividend or be used for stock buybacks, whatever the usage is, it's effectively what's available at the end of the day after everything has been paid for. And so that's the metric that we focus on most of all.Having said that, obviously, the next few years, there are some challenges to our AFFO per share metric, largely because of two things that are not new. Interest rates, we've done an excellent job over the last many years locking in very low-cost debt. But the market is what it is. And at some point, you have to refinance at least some of that debt. And so you're going to see higher interest costs that weighs on that a little bit. And of course, the Sprint churn, in particular, that is kind of out there that we know we have ahead of us, and we've scoped for you as to what that looks like.But outside of that, the real goal, frankly, is to see that number go up over an extended period of time. This is a business that is a very long-term business at its core. We have very long-term contracts. Our relationships are long term. The assets are long term. And so we look at how we're going to maximize that number over an extended period of time. As a public company, it can be challenging because you're reporting every single quarter, and so it gets scrutinized every quarter. But the nature of the business is long term, so we try to take that long-term view on how we're going to grow that number out over a period of 5 to 10 years. And I think we'll be well positioned to do that. The other metrics though are very important as well. Obviously, growing site leasing revenue, growing adjusted EBITDA, shows that we're able to find continued returns on our operations, but really AFFO per share is where I focus most of my energy.And then I guess your second question was about the upgrade percentage for 5G. We're a little bit over halfway in terms of upgrades to our sites for 5G, but that is different among the different carriers. Some are much further along and others are below that number. So we still have a pretty good runway. I think we're looking at the next 2 to 3 years to get to where they've upgraded all the sites they need to."", 'Operator', 'And next, we will hear from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.', 'Simon William Flannery', ""Congrats on your new role, Brendan; and Mark, great to reconnect and good luck in your new role. Two, if I could; first, on the M&A. I think in the past, you've noted that the M&A multiples haven't necessarily come in to reflect the new interest rate environment. It would be great to just get some perspective of if you see a better risk-reward balance there for the growth and the multiples that you're paying. Obviously, you've done some transactions versus buying back your own stock. And secondly, anything you could share with us on DISH and how you think about DISH within your leasing assumptions, especially given they have some specific FCC and DOJ targets to hit in mid-'25?"", 'Brendan Thomas Cavanagh', ""Yes, the M&A market is still quite competitive. In the U.S., in particular, because there's such a limited number of assets available, they're very competitively bid. So we continue to see price points that are very high. Internationally, that is also true. Although I would say we've seen a little more moderation with the increasing cost of capital in terms of international price points. But the interesting thing about that is what it's resulted in is not necessarily deals being done at lower prices in many cases but, frankly, deals not getting done at all where there's sort of a disconnect between where seller expectations are and where buyers are willing to pay. I think you'll start to see some of that shift over the course of the coming year, particularly if the interest rate environment remains elevated.In the case of DISH, yes, they are certainly a component of our assumptions for our leasing growth for this year. They do have the deadlines that you mentioned, and we've had ongoing conversations with them, and we believe that they will be attacking those obligations aggressively. So we do have some amount of growth in our model associated with DISH. But I would say it's a relatively small percentage of the total."", 'Operator', 'And next, we will hear from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank.', 'Matthew Niknam', 'Just a two-parter. First, on the strategic review, Brendan, is this at all a pullback from, I guess, more emerging markets and a pivot of the portfolio towards more developed markets? Is there anything of that sort underpinning the review? And then maybe on a related note, any additional color you could provide on the 281 sites that were acquired subsequent to 4Q just in terms of region? Or any other color you can share?', 'Brendan Thomas Cavanagh', ""Sure. I'll take the second one first. The 281 aren't necessarily all closed at this point. I think a few are closed, but most are just under contract at this point. And about 10% of those are in the U.S., the remaining 90% are located throughout our existing markets, in half a dozen different countries that we're already in. In the case of the way we're thinking about the strategic review, it's not necessarily emerging markets versus developed, although that can be a factor. It's a focus on how we maximize our position in those markets. So we have positions in emerging markets that are very strong because of the strength of our role and our existing relationships with the strongest carriers in those markets. And so if we can enhance that in places where we don't have it, then I think we would be comfortable with the markets regardless of whether they were necessarily developed or emerging markets. However, I think developed markets do offer some aspects of quality that we would find attractive if we can find the right opportunities. Things like strong tower siding, regulatory regimes, certainly strength of the wireless carriers in the market and a relative balance to their market share, stability of the currency, stability of the tax regime, things like that would be things that we would find valuable because at the end of the day, sort of the value proposition of a tower company, when most people look at it, is this expectation that you have a long-term, very stable cash flow stream that is going to grow both steadily over time. And sometimes if you're in places that don't have some of those attributes I just mentioned, you can introduce a certain amount of volatility that we would be looking to obviously try to move out of the mix and focus more on that kind of stable, growing cash flow stream.So I think we're open to shift in the type of market, but I think the markets that we're in have opportunities to improve our positioning and that's what we're looking at."", 'Matthew Niknam', 'Is there a time frame attached to the strategic review?', 'Brendan Thomas Cavanagh', 'It\'s something that I would expect us to be working on throughout this year, but there are also factors that are outside of our control, things that we would like to do. That may take some time to figure out whether the opportunities actually exist. So I think it will be an ongoing effort. But the real point -- and this isn\'t some wholesale change, just to kind of reiterate that. It\'s not like we were doing something totally one way before and we completely shifted. This is more of a refinement of the approach that SBA has historically taken. I think you know us, we have always focused on quality, financial returns. All those things are still the same. What this really is, is kind of digging in a little bit deeper on some of our current holdings and looking at where we\'re underperforming, what are the root causes of that and what can we do to address that. And if we don\'t feel we can address it, then we would look at it like Argentina and say, ""Hey, this we don\'t think we necessarily can fix so we\'ll adjust."" So again, it\'s really just a refinement of what has been our long-standing policy.', 'Operator', ""And next, we'll hear from Richard Choe with JPMorgan."", 'Yong Choe', 'I just wanted to ask about the pacing of the services revenue through the year. And then another question in terms of new activity, how much of it is coming from colocation versus amendments? And do you expect any significant change through the year?', 'Brendan Thomas Cavanagh', ""Yes. The services revenue, we actually, in our outlook, expect it to slightly increase but to be relatively balanced throughout the year. On the colos versus amendments, I don't know if you're asking about the actuals of the fourth quarter where we've seen more of a shift towards new leases. But I would expect as we get into this year, you'll see amendment activity again be the lion's share of what we do."", 'Yong Choe', 'And a final one is in terms of Argentina, can you quantify what the impact would have been to revenue and EBITDA had you kept it?', 'Brendan Thomas Cavanagh', 'Yes. It represented about $1 million of EBITDA and a little over $2 million, about $2.3 million, of revenue on an annual basis.', 'Operator', ""And next, we'll hear from Michael Elias with TD Cowen."", 'Michael Elias', ""My first question for you is, you mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks about the stability of results, I'm curious if on the U.S. side, we should take that to mean you're more open to doing, let's say, holistic MLAs with the carriers that you have with AT&T. That's my first question.And then the second question is, when you talked about the use of cash, you were essentially mentioning that you assume the remainder has reinvested at around 4%. So when I take a look at the AFFO yield of your stock, it's implying over 6%. You talked about earlier how you may hold back if you see some opportunities. I guess what I'm getting at here is, are you holding back on the buyback under the expectation that you're going to go forward and do more M&A? Just trying to get some more color in terms of what you're thinking on the buybacks versus the M&A."", 'Brendan Thomas Cavanagh', ""So on holistic MLAs, I think when we talk about a goal of trying to ensure that we have stabilized our cash flow streams and results, one of the ways you do that is through enhancing and improving customer relationships. And that can be done in part through master agreements. We obviously signed one with AT&T last year. We've signed others in the past with each of our customers along the way. So I would expect we will continue to make use of that, assuming that it's the best structure for what our customers need to get done and SBA is able to achieve a certain amount of certainty and length of commitment as part of those agreements. But each of those will be determined on an individual basis based on the needs of the customer and what we need. Again, the buybacks versus M&A, yes, I mean, we're not necessarily sitting here saying we've got all this cash flow ready to spend on buybacks. In fact, we still have balances out on our revolver. So I don't feel like we've necessarily been in that position. We have historically been very opportunistic around share buybacks. I would expect that to continue to be the case now. But individual acquisition opportunities, particularly of size, may influence our timing on when we would buy back our stock if we otherwise saw it as an attractive investment. So that's where we are, and we'll see as time goes by. But just because you don't see us buy back our stock doesn't necessarily mean that we don't see it as a good value. It means there may be other factors we're considering."", 'Operator', ""Next, we'll hear from Brendan Lynch with Barclays."", 'Brendan James Lynch', ""It's been asked a few ways but maybe to put it in a different term, can you talk a little bit about what is assumed in the $42 million of domestic leasing guidance that relates to kind of the lap-over effective signings in 2023 versus what you need to sign in 2024 itself?"", 'Brendan Thomas Cavanagh', ""Yes. I can't tell you exactly with precision sitting here, but I'm sure we can follow up with you. It is largely based on what's already been signed up to date. I'm sure it's somewhere in the 3/4 range of the number, but maybe even more. So we'll follow up with you, Brendan, separately on that."", 'Brendan James Lynch', ""Okay. That's helpful. And then one other question on international churn. I know you were expecting some churn in some Latin American markets. Maybe you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing there. It did seem to tick up a bit, in the fourth quarter. And give some color on what you anticipate throughout the next year."", 'Brendan Thomas Cavanagh', ""Yes. So I mentioned it briefly in my prepared comments, but there are a number of markets that we're in where we have consolidations taking place, in particular, in Brazil where you had the Oi wireless consolidation with the other big 3 carriers there as we kind of work through that. Last year, that was a big factor. It represented roughly 40%. It was just from TIM, by itself associated with that consolidation as one item. That is probably going to be a continued driver of some level of international churn over the next few years. But we're working through negotiations with each of our customers. And as we do that, we're kind of pricing this long-term relationship, long-term commitment where we've got stability that we can reintroduce into the relationship but allow them to get through the efficiencies that they need to achieve as a result of the combination of customers that's taking place in the market. So it's a mix, but Brazil will probably be the biggest just because it's the biggest market we have with the most revenue."", 'Operator', ""And next, we'll hear from Walter Piecyk with LightShed."", 'Walter Paul Piecyk', 'I guess just a quick follow-on for that one. In your discussions with those customers, is there an opportunity with Movil to maybe take ownership of those towers? Do you think there would be some regulatory issues with that?', 'Brendan Thomas Cavanagh', ""Yes, I probably can't answer that in this forum, Walt. But we do have ongoing conversations with them about all different things that they do, that we do, that might fit together."", 'Walter Paul Piecyk', 'Just looking through history, you go back to Oi and then you look at PG&E and you maxed the balance sheet at like 7.7, is that coincidental? Or is that kind of your threshold of pain in terms of where you would take something for the opportunities that exist out there?', 'Brendan Thomas Cavanagh', ""Well, it's probably coincidental, to some degree. I don't think you'd see us go above 8x at any point in our history. But now that we've got a pretty big cushion given where our leverage has come down to, so I don't really foresee that ever being a number that we approach."", 'Walter Paul Piecyk', ""Okay. Well, that gives us a sense of the size of things that you can consider. And then just lastly, just kind of a touchy-feely question, which is, these operators have a lot of spectrum, which makes it a little different than past capital cycles when there's kind of an ebb and flow. What gives you confidence that when this ebb turns to flow, it's not only going to be in markets where it can be satisfied with rooftops and small cells as opposed to traditional areas where densification is required? I'm talking domestically. Forget about your global markets."", 'Brendan Thomas Cavanagh', ""Yes. Well, I mean, really what gives me confidence, but we'll see how it plays out, is history. I mean, every time we've seen the cycle of activity, it's ultimately gotten to the suburban markets, the rural markets. Those dense urban centers really were never tower markets to begin with. So it's not really been a factor for us. Anything that's getting resolved with rooftops, that's a very limited tower market. So I'm not sure it matters that much to us."", 'Walter Paul Piecyk', ""So are there factors that in suburbia that you could hit? Or not you, but like, let's say, TMS, Verizon, maybe AT&T jumps onboard, they hit enough penetration that the depth of spectrum that they have from C-band and the Sprint spectrum is not enough to serve, whatever, let's call it, 30% penetration that they would require additional identification."", 'Brendan Thomas Cavanagh', 'Sure.', 'Operator', 'And next we will hear from David Guarino with Green Street.', 'David Anthony Guarino', ""Sticking with the U.S. on the $40-ish million in new leasing activity expected in '24, is this level of the new run rate we should expect as we model out over the next few years? Or do you think there's a chance that new leasing levels might reach what we saw in '22 and '23 again? And then the second question was, could you just comment on the discretionary CapEx spend for '24? It looked like it stepped up pretty meaningfully from '23, what drove that increase?"", 'Brendan Thomas Cavanagh', ""So the leasing level into the future, yes, we think it could go up, sure. Obviously, it's all driven by carrier activity. I mean if you go back over the last 3 years, David, you will see, if you go back a few years ago, that we were at a level very similar to where we are now. In fact, I think we reported a number lower than the $42 million that we just put in our outlook for this year, what, 3, 4 years ago. So since that time, obviously, it spiked up much higher than that because of carrier activity. And I think to some degree, the network strain that they may feel and the cost of capital is very impactful to the decisions they're making there. And so yes, we believe there's definitely opportunity to see the number go higher in future years, but we need to see how that moves. I'm sorry, your other question was on CapEx?"", 'David Anthony Guarino', 'Discretionary CapEx.', 'Brendan Thomas Cavanagh', ""Yes. I believe what we guided to was similar to what last year's number was. Yes, where we guided to in the $330 million at the midpoint. And last year, it was $310 million. So sorry, David, what's the core of the question?"", 'David Anthony Guarino', ""No, my apologies, I must have misread that wrong. If it's flat, you can disregard the question."", 'Brendan Thomas Cavanagh', 'Okay. All right. thanks.', 'Operator', ""And next, we'll hear from Batya Levi with UBS."", 'Batya Levi', 'Just a couple of follow-ups. First, AT&T recently signed a new contract with FirstNet. Can you provide color if that will be included within the current MLA you have with them? Or provide some upside. And just another one on M&A. As you think about increasing your portfolio, do you have a preference for carrier-owned towers versus portfolios that are coming out of independent tower operators?', 'Brendan Thomas Cavanagh', ""Sure. With regards to AT&T/FirstNet, for the most part, I would expect, based on my understanding of everything that is expected to happen there, that it would have limited upside for us from an amendment or upgrade standpoint. The opportunity set would be more based on a need to densify where they needed to actually have new lease agreements at existing sites or possibly even new tower builds. So it's really a new site leasing opportunity to the extent that there is an impact, but I do not think there's much of an amendment impact potential for us.With regards to the M&A question, generally speaking, I would say we would prefer independent company towers as opposed to carrier-owned towers. Usually, we find that they've been developed with the mindset of colocation already in there, and they are operated and maintained in a way typically that is better than what you find with a traditional carrier sale leaseback. But having said that, we've done both kinds of deals. And I think what we bring to the table is our expertise that allows us to kind of improve those operations. Sometimes there's greater opportunity for improvement when you buy things that haven't been run quite as well. So I guess it just depends on the individual opportunity."", 'Operator', 'And we have no further questions at this time.', 'Brendan Thomas Cavanagh', 'Well, great. Thank you, everybody, for taking the time, and we look forward to reporting to you next quarter.', 'Operator', 'And that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation.

Skift looked at a five-year pace and a one-year pace as of year-end and if trends continue, Hilton could overtake Marriott’s program in size within roughly the next year.', 'To gain context, Skift caught up Monday with Peggy Roe, executive vice president and chief customer officer of Marriott.', '“My perspective is it’s about quality, not quantity,” Roe said. “That said, having the biggest program in the world is important.”', '“There’s a lot of upside for us to sustain our position because of initiatives we’re launching this year to target new segments and work with new partners. We’re going to give people, especially younger people, reasons other than staying at a hotel to enroll in the program, and we haven’t really come at it that way before.”', '“The TAM, or total addressable market, of travelers we’re after is 1.3 billion,” Roe said. “So, really, we’re after the next 200 million.”', 'A just-launched licensing deal with MGM Resorts will let Marriott Bonvoy members earn and burn points for stays at most MGM Resorts’ properties.

Then we brought it back last year, and we saw, significant increases in our NPS over the year.”', '“Lifetime value and penetration are the really important metrics at the end of the day,” Roe said.', 'Today, Marriott says member penetration represents 61% globally and 67% in the U.S. regarding occupied rooms booked by members. Yet Roe anticipates the days when 70% of its hotels will be filled with members. These members provide details about themselves that can be valuable for future marketing.', '“We’re building our first-party data in a way that will cost us less to be able to talk to you,” Roe said.', '“The value to me is about how big the customer base is but also how well we can fill our hotels with those customers and how much those customers are able to spend,” Roe said.', 'Marriott says the top 1% of loyalty members represent 35% of gross fee revenue. These customers are highly engaged, with 90% using the mobile app, 64% having a co-branded credit card, and 21% using other products like Uber and Homes and Villas by Marriott Bonvoy.', 'But sometimes an anecdote better captures the power of loyalty.', ""“I was talking to an elite Marriott Bonvoy member who has achieved Ambassador status, and he told me, ‘I’ve been traveling with you guys all over the world,'” Roe said. “And so I always ask people, you know, what’s your favorite property? And he said, ‘The J.W. Marriott in Venice. I’ve been there so many times that, when I die, I hope you will spread my ashes all over that property.”"", '“So I think about lifetime value a lot and this person is telling me that he wants to be with us for life,” Roe said. “That speaks to the power of our loyalty program.”', 'What am I looking at?\xa0The performance of hotels and short-term rental sector stocks within the\xa0ST200.

That's Hyatt. So keep close tabs on them. They're up by about 15%."", ""And lastly, let's go to the high seas here, if you will, where you'll find perhaps Captain Jack Sparrow and a few of his other friends.

GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Signs with SWK.', ""On February 27, 2024, Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK), a leading manufacturer of hand and power tools, released its 10-K filing, revealing a year of solid financial performance with consolidated annual revenues of $15.8 billion. The company, with its principal executive office in New Britain, Connecticut, has demonstrated a strong market presence, particularly in the United States, which accounts for approximately 62% of its 2023 revenues. The Tools & Outdoor segment, which includes renowned brands such as DEWALT, CRAFTSMAN, and BLACK+DECKER, remains the primary revenue driver, contributing an impressive 85% to the total revenues. The company's strategic maneuvers through acquisitions and divestitures underscore its commitment to growth and market adaptation. Furthermore, Stanley Black & Decker Inc's dedication to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives reflects its role as a responsible corporate citizen and positions it as a sustainable choice for consumers and investors alike."", ""Brand Portfolio and Market Leadership: Stanley Black & Decker Inc's strength lies in its diverse and powerful brand portfolio, which includes some of the most recognized names in the industry. The company's Tools & Outdoor segment, which generated $13.4 billion in revenue in 2023, is a testament to its market leadership. Brands like DEWALT, CRAFTSMAN, and BLACK+DECKER not only command customer loyalty but also provide a competitive edge in the professional and consumer markets. The company's ability to maintain a strong brand image and innovate continuously has allowed it to sustain its leadership position and capitalize on market opportunities."", ""Financial Performance and Revenue Diversification: Stanley Black & Decker Inc's financial health is robust, with a significant revenue stream from its Tools & Outdoor segment. The company's revenue diversification strategy is evident in its international operations, which contribute to a substantial portion of its total revenues. This geographic spread mitigates the risks associated with market volatility in any single region. Additionally, the company's aggregate market value of $14.4 billion as of June 30, 2023, reflects investor confidence and a strong market position."", ""Dependence on Major Customers: A potential weakness for Stanley Black & Decker Inc is its reliance on major customers. In 2023, the two largest customers accounted for approximately 27% of consolidated net sales. This concentration of sales to a few large customers, such as home centers and major retailers, could pose a risk if these relationships were to change adversely. The bargaining power of these volume purchasers limits the company's ability to recover cost increases through higher selling prices, which could impact profitability."", ""Operational Risks and Supply Chain Vulnerabilities: The company's global sourcing and manufacturing operations expose it to risks such as supply chain disruptions, transportation issues, and geopolitical tensions. For instance, the company sources materials from regions like South Korea, China, and Taiwan, where any future tensions or conflicts could cause significant disruptions. These risks could lead to product shortages, delivery delays, and increased production costs, adversely affecting the company's operational efficiency and financial results."", ""ESG Initiatives and Sustainable Practices: Stanley Black & Decker Inc's commitment to ESG initiatives presents a significant opportunity to differentiate itself in the market. The company's goal to reduce its internal operational greenhouse gas emissions by 42% by 2030 and achieve zero-waste-to-landfill across all its global manufacturing and distribution sites by 2040 resonates with the growing consumer and investor demand for sustainable practices. These initiatives can enhance the company's brand reputation and attract a new segment of environmentally conscious customers."", ""Strategic Acquisitions and Market Expansion: The company's history of strategic acquisitions and divestitures offers opportunities for growth and expansion into new markets and product lines. By continuing to identify and integrate complementary businesses, Stanley Black & Decker Inc can diversify its offerings and enter emerging markets, potentially driving future revenue growth and expanding its global footprint."", ""Intense Competition and Pricing Pressures: Stanley Black & Decker Inc operates in a highly competitive market with both larger and smaller companies offering similar products. Competitors from countries with lower production costs pose a threat to the company's market share and profitability. The need to maintain a competitive cost structure while innovating and responding to competitor actions requires significant investment and strategic focus. Failure to compete effectively could result in reduced sales and profits."", ""Global Economic and Geopolitical Uncertainties: The company's international operations expose it to global economic fluctuations and geopolitical risks. Economic downturns, trade disputes, and geopolitical tensions can impact consumer spending, disrupt supply chains, and affect the company's overall performance. Additionally, changes in regulatory environments and tariffs could increase operational costs and create market barriers."", ""In conclusion, Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) presents a compelling case of a company with strong market leadership and brand portfolio, underpinned by a solid financial foundation. However, it must navigate the challenges of customer concentration and operational risks.

GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NVDA.', 'In other words, over half of all its sales went straight into its checking account after all cash expenses.

If it were to pay out all the $56 billion in dividends, what would happen to NVDA stock?', 'NVDA would likely have at least a 2.0% dividend yield, and more likely a 1.0% dividend yield.', ""In other words, the FCF yield can be used to value Nvidia's market valuation.

But despite the hype, the company's valuation has become uncomfortably high. Let's discuss what the next five years could have in store for this booming stock. "", 'Founded in 1990, the U.K.-based Arm Holdings is a technology company that develops and licenses intellectual property for designing central processing units (CPUs), a core component in computers, smartphones, and other electronics. After an initial public offering (IPO) in late 2023, it enjoyed a surge of interest because investors expect it to benefit from rising hardware spending as businesses scramble to handle increasingly complex AI workloads. ', ""That said, ARM's third-quarter earnings do not show rapid AI-led transformation. Revenue grew by a modest 14% year over year to $824 million. To put that number in context, chipmaker Nvidia saw its revenue soar 265% year over year to $22.1 billion in its most recently reported quarter. These figures are not even in the same ballpark, and there could be several reasons for the discrepancy. "", 'While Arm Holdings and Nvidia are both billed as ""AI companies,"" there are significant differences between their business models. Nvidia specializes in graphics processing units (GPUs). These chips excel at performing multiple tasks simultaneously, making them ideal for computationally demanding workloads like running and training AI algorithms. On the other hand, Arm focuses on CPUs, which are less ideal for this use case. ', ""Furthermore, Arm doesn't manufacture or sell these CPUs directly. Instead, it focuses on developing intellectual property and designs. To be fair, Arm-based IP is popular -- powering 99% of all premium smartphones, according to the company website. But despite the widespread use, Arm may have limited pricing power. If it jacks up licensing fees too much, it could lose market share to rivals like Intel, which develops competing IP."", ""To make matters worse, many of Arm's core markets, such as smartphones, seem to have peaked around 2018 and are now in decline as people delay phone replacement and keep their devices longer. It is unclear if Arm's yet-to-materialize AI boom can make up for this secular decline in what has historically been its biggest growth driver. "", ""After its meteoric rise this year and last year, Arm Holdings stock looks painfully over-valued, especially considering there isn't much evidence of an AI-driven boom in its revenue and earnings. With a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 92, shares are significantly more expensive than Nvidia, which has a P/E of just 33 despite much better operational results."", ""Over the next five years, Arm Holdings stock will probably fall to a more reasonable valuation, because its business isn't growing fast enough to justify its current price tag. Investors who own shares should consider taking some profits off the table. But shorting the stock is extremely risky. The AI hype cycle is still in its early innings, and the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Arm Holdings right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Arm Holdings wasn’t one of them.

Here's how the top performers have done during that stretch."", ""Chipmaker Nvidia is unsurprisingly at the top of this list. Artificial intelligence (AI) and a huge demand for the company's chips made it the hottest tech stock in the past few years. Investing $10,000 into the stock 10 years ago would have made that investment worth close to $1.7 million today."", ""The company's strong top- and bottom-line growth makes this a truly phenomenal stock.

Diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $4.93 rose at an even more incredible rate of 765%. "", ""As AI continues to change industries, it's hard not to like Nvidia for the long run. The only caveat: Investors might want to temper their hopes since expectations could be a bit high for the stock, and at a high valuation, that could make it vulnerable down the road to a correction."", ""Shares of electric-vehicle (EV) maker Tesla have been under pressure of late as the company has been reducing prices and facing greater competition. During the last quarter of 2023, Chinese-based BYD\xa0reported more EV sales than Tesla.

From just $2 billion in revenue in 2013 to $97 billion this past year, the company's growth has been stellar."", ""The company does face some challenges. And here, too, its valuation does make it a bit of a riskier buy -- it's trading at 61 times its estimated future profits. But if you're bullish on the EV market, Tesla could still make for a good long-term hold."", ""At $109,000, Microsoft is another stock that would have been a 10-bagger investment over the past decade.

But heads turn when a company the size and stature of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) does it. This was the case when an Nvidia filing revealed a $3.7 million position in SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN). As you can see, the stock shot up overnight.', ""For perspective, SoundHound has a market cap of around $1 billion, so this investment is well under 1% of its market cap and almost nothing to Nvidia's nearly $2 trillion market cap. But this wasn't the only news. SoftBank Group, which invests in many successful tech companies (like Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM), which you can read about here), purchased 1.1 million shares in fourth-quarter 2023. Neither of these investments breaks the bank, but they have investors asking: What exactly does this SoundHound company do, and is it an excellent investment?"", ""The days of a person taking your order at fast-food restaurants are ending. Sure, humans will still be needed to oversee it, but voice recognition technology will do the heavy lifting. Automobiles are also advancing voice recognition and AI-powered virtual assistants. SoundHound's tech allows people to communicate conversationally to make complex orders or queries. It's incredible stuff."", ""As shown below, SoundHound's software is already deployed by brands like White Castle, Krispy Kreme, and Jersey Mikes, so you may have already used it."", ""SoundHound has plenty of competition from other tech companies, but it claims it has 260 patents that have been granted or are pending. This is tremendously valuable, even though it isn't quantified on the financial statements."", ""The implications for businesses based on cost savings and efficiency are massive. It's important to acknowledge that jobs will be affected. However, technological advancements, from cars to the internet, create more jobs in the long run."", ""SoundHound makes money through royalties and subscriptions that are usage-based. In other words, the more orders, queries, or volume used, the more SoundHound gets paid. This is a terrific model because sales are recurring and increase dramatically from adoption. SoundHound's revenue has grown impressively since it went public in April 2022 to $13 million in third-quarter 2023, as depicted below."", ""More importantly, the company's backlog (revenue to be recognized in future periods) grew from $303 million to $342 million year over year."", ""The company has tremendous potential, but investors should be cautious. SoundHound isn't profitable or cash flow positive. Marketing, research, and development are expensive, and SoundHound generated cash by selling millions of shares. As you can see below, the share count is up 50% since SoundHound went public, ballooning to 242 million as of Q3."", 'This gives the company the cash it needs to grow (over $100 million on hand as of Q3 2023), but dilutes existing shareholders. Hopefully, the aggressive dilution will end soon. The company forecasts $16 million to $20 million in Q4 2023 sales and predicts becoming EBITDA positive.', ""Fast-growing, relatively small companies like SoundHound are difficult to value. The $1 billion market cap is expensive for an unprofitable company generating $20 million in quarterly sales. However, if SoundHound's technology keeps being adopted and sales ramp up, the current price will be a bargain."", ""Here's the bottom line: Nvidia's and SoftBank's investments lend credibility but should be kept in perspective. SoundHound has a tremendous market opportunity but shaky financials. The stock is best for aggressive investors who don't mind risk."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?', 'Before you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SoundHound AI wasn’t one of them.

The extension was aimed at bringing continued efficiency and automation capabilities to McKesson’s finance operations, utilizing automation and AI solutions.', 'Strong Q3 Results: McKesson’s robust third-quarter fiscal 2024 results buoy optimism. The company recorded a robust uptick in its overall top line. The revenue uptick was primarily driven by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, resulting from increased prescription volumes, including higher volumes from specialty products, retail national account customers, and GLP-1 medications.', 'Weak Trends: McKesson distributes generic pharmaceuticals, which are subject to price fluctuation. The Distribution Solutions segment continues to experience weaker generic pharmaceutical pricing trends. Continued volatility, unfavorable pricing trends, reimbursement of generic drugs and significant fluctuations in the nature, frequency and magnitude of generic pharmaceutical launches could have a material adverse impact on McKesson.', 'Stiff Competition: Distribution Solutions faces stiff competition both in terms of price and service from various full-line, short-line and specialty wholesalers, service merchandisers, self-warehousing chains, manufacturers engaged in direct distribution, third-party logistics companies and large-payer organizations.

In 2023, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 43.4%. The broad-market S&P 500 Index also saw an impressive rally of 23.9%. However, the Dow was up just 13.7%. Year to date, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are up 3.3%, 7.1%, and 8.6%, respectively.', 'Inclusion of Amazon is seen as a strategic move to increase the blue-chip index’s exposure to new-economy stocks.

With the rapid advancement of technology, telecom companies not only provide traditional voice and data services but also enable innovations like 5G networks, IoT applications, and cloud computing, fostering digital transformation across various sectors. For this reason, the US telecom industry plays a pivotal role in driving the country's economy forward. According to a report commissioned by the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA) in 2018, the wireless sector in the US contributed a staggering $475 billion to the nation's economy on an annual basis and sustained employment for 4.7 million individuals. The analysis, conducted by Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN), revealed that the U.S. wireless industry represented 2.6 percent of the total GDP of the country in 2016, positioning it as comparable to the 24th largest global economy."", ""Expanding upon these advancements, a report by Deloitte predicts that by 2024, consumers in the United States will have a significantly broader range of choices for broadband connectivity. The report highlighted a growing trend of households in the US adopting wireless solutions for their internet needs. According to Deloitte's 2023 Connected Consumer Survey, there has been a notable increase in the adoption of fixed wireless connections, with 12% of home internet users opting for this option, up from 6% in the previous year's survey. Moreover, the majority of these users (52%) reported that their fixed wireless connection is powered by 5G technology, marking a substantial rise from the previous year's figure of 32%. The report also underscored the rapid growth of 5G Fixed Wireless Access (FWA), which accounted for 90% of net additional broadband internet subscribers in 2022 and is projected to maintain a strong presence, capturing 80% to 90% of market share through 2024."", ""While the telecom sector didn't experience the most significant decline in 2023 compared to other industries, the stocks didn't see remarkable growth throughout the year either. The S&P Telecom Select Industry Index, which monitors the performance of stocks within various telecom-related sub-industries, including alternative carriers, communications equipment, integrated telecom services, and wireless telecom services, dropped by 2.12% in 2023. Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) managed to surpass the performance of the S&P 500 last year, albeit by a small margin. However, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) and Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) fell short and underperformed compared to the index."", ""Unfortunately, the trend hasn't improved in 2024, as the index has already lost around 4.44% since the beginning of the year. However, analysts hold some optimism for the sector this year on certain fronts, according to a report by CNBC. The resolution of actors’ and writers’ strikes is seen as a positive development. Additionally, with the upcoming 2024 U.S. presidential election, there's an expectation for an increase in advertising spending, particularly as global TV ad revenue is projected to decline by 18% this year, as reported by media investment firm GroupM. Companies like Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) have taken significant measures such as job cuts and reducing content costs substantially to enhance free cash flow and address debt concerns. This strategic move might instill confidence in investors regarding their future business prospects. Notably, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has recently reinstated its dividend for early 2024, following a suspension that lasted over three years."", 'Besides these aspects, telecom stocks are recognized for offering dividends to their shareholders.

Yahoo Finance’s Josh Schafer, Alexandra Canal, and Brooke DiPalma detail what consumers may think about this upcoming price hike when making travel plans.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan."", ""ALEXANDRA CANAL: And today we're talking about price hikes because, unfortunately, for our wallets, we don't really need to wait for Thursday's PCE inflation data to know that the price of goods and services. It's going up. And today, I've been looking at Disney, with the company raising the prices of park tickets once again. Disney raised annual park passes and parking fees back in October. But now they're announcing that starting next year, a single-day single-park ticket at Disney World will be going up by at least $10. So it's going to now cost $119."", ""Previously, that was $109. Now this is on the heels of a $60 million theme park investment from Disney. I mentioned those increases that we saw in October. Again, that was for those annual park passes. The highest priced annual pass is just below $1,500. They also, at the time, raised park-hopper add-ons and parking. So now we have this single-day, single-ticket pass increase. Now you might be thinking, oh, $10, not that much. But I think it's just another example of how there's a lot of pressure on the consumer. And a lot of these companies, especially a big legacy media giant like Disney, which is going through its own share of issues with streaming and linear TV declines, they're passing on some of that cost to the. Consumer"", ""JOSH SCHAFER: I mean, I might just be admitting bad math here. But I don't know about you guys. If I look at the difference between something that's $109 and $119, , and I was already willing to pay $109, I don't know how much of a deterrent that is for me, to be honest. I mean, it's not-- it's never exciting as a consumer to see the price for something going up and the price for something exciting like a day pass at Disney, at Disney World, or Disneyland going up. But, I don't know, $10, like really isn't that much in the scale of like how much the pass already costs. So it feels like, from a consumer standpoint, not my favorite news in the world. But if I was planning on going, I'd probably still go. So maybe, a good move by the company."", ""BROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah. And I think, like, $100 each alone, with that $9, with the extra $10, $100 each alone, say a family of four, it's going to be now nearly $500. Exactly, you're good to make the trip out for the experience. You're already probably planning on going. And you know that this is going to be an incurred cost that you have to do in addition to airplanes, or travel, or a hotel stay. And so, this is a cost that you're expecting, of course. It doesn't help that now it's 120 almost, as opposed to maybe where it was a few years ago, which was probably around 100, I assume."", ""Josh Schafer: It feels like a day pass to do anything exciting with your family is so much more expensive. I'm thinking of like sports tickets, right? There's been some great graphs out there about that. Like, just to do-- especially, Brooke just did the math on taking four or five people, it just is a $500 day now, to do a lot of these big ticket things."", 'BROOKE DIPALMA: What happens If you want to go multiple days?', 'JOSH SCHAFER: Right.', ""BROOKE DIPALMA: Yikes, that's a lot of money."", 'JOSH SCHAFER: Like skiing, right? Skiing is $100 now to get a day pass in most mountains. Like everything is just getting more expensive to try and take your family out.', ""ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, I do think Disney, in particular, has the pricing power, which, like, both of you said, if you're a family that's already planning on going, you're planning that trip for 2025, you're not going to back out just because you see the prices go up $10. And I think Disney recognizes that these are hardcore fans of the IP. You have Disney adults, you have the family, so again, I think Disney is in a position where they can raise prices. A big question mark, though, will be, at what point can they not? And where that goes from there?"", 'BROOKE DIPALMA: Will they see traffic drop?', 'ALEXANDRA CANAL: yeah']"

Norton', ""Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. On today's call is Walt Hulse, the Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Executive Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Development; and Sheridan Swords, who is our Executive Vice President, Commercial Liquids and Natural Gas Gathering and Processing. Also available to answer your questions are Chuck Kelley, our Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Pipelines; and Kevin Burdick, who is the Executive Vice President of Chief Enterprise Services.Record volumes, strong financial performance and the closing of the Magellan acquisition solidified 2023 as a year of significant growth and transformation for ONEOK. Momentum from our operations in 2023 is setting the stage for additional growth in 2024. With our earnings release yesterday, we reported double-digit NGL and natural gas processing volume growth year-over-year and continued fee-based earnings growth in all 3 of our legacy business segments. We also provided 2024 guidance along with some insight into 2025 and beyond, including an expectation for double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth in 2024. Walt will provide more detail on our guidance, which is underscored by solid business fundamentals, demand for the products that we deliver and a full year of earnings contribution from our refined products and crude oil segments and the initial realization of acquisition-related synergies.Before I turn the call over to Walt, I want to share a few data points that help sum up the exceptional growth ONEOK has experienced in recent years. While our business continues to transform and to look to the future, it's still important to reflect on what has already been accomplished. I'll share just a handful of highlights, but there are many more. First, 2023 marked ONEOK's tenth consecutive year of adjusted EBITDA growth throughout various commodity cycles. Over the same time period, we've increased dividends paid to $3.82 per share from $1.48 per share, a more than 150% increase. And in January, the Board approved another increase. Our volumes out of the Rocky Mountain region have set numerous records over the last 5 years alone, NGL volumes from the region have grown at a more than 20% annual growth rate and natural gas processing volumes have grown at a 10% annual growth rate. We've continued to expand our asset portfolio, increasing our extensive pipeline network to more than 50,000 miles from approximately 30,000 miles in 2013 and adding nearly 2 Bcf per day of natural gas processing capacity and 3 fractionators. And finally, through all of this growth, both internally and by acquisition, we've continued to prioritize safety, and our sustainability and ESG-related performance, consistently ranking towards the top of our industry peer group, including a AAA rating from MSCI. We've achieved a great deal in recent years and over the course of our company's history and now with a more diversified portfolio of assets, we are even better positioned to make the most of future opportunities. With that, I'll turn the call over to Walt."", 'Walter S. Hulse', ""Thank you, Pierce. Before I get to guidance, I'll start with a brief overview of our fourth quarter and full year financial performance. ONEOK's fourth quarter and full year 2023 net income totaled $688 million and $2.7 billion, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA totaled more than $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter 2023 and more than $5.2 billion for the full year. While there were a number of unique items contributing to the significant year-over-year increase in results such as the Medford settlement and the Magellan acquisition, the strong performance from our legacy business segments continued. Even excluding these unique onetime items, ONEOK's adjusted EBITDA would have increased more than 15% year-over-year. As of December 31, we had no borrowings outstanding under our $2.5 billion credit facility and had more than $335 million of cash on hand. In 2023, ONEOK extinguished $1.3 billion of long-term debt, contributing to a fourth quarter 2023 run rate net debt-to-EBITDA ratio in line with our previously discussed target of 3.5x.In January, we increased our quarterly dividend 3.7% to $0.99 per share or $3.96 per share on an annualized basis. Going forward, ONEOK expects to target an annual dividend growth rate ranging between 3% to 4%. We also announced a $2 billion share repurchase authorization, which we target to largely use over the next 4 years. This program is complementary to the dividend growth rate when thinking about shareholder return in the future. Over the next 4 years, ONEOK's combination of dividends and share repurchases is expected to trend towards a target of approximately 75% to 85% of forecasted cash flow from operations after identified capital expenditures. Our commitment to maintaining our financial flexibility and taking advantage of attractive return, capital growth opportunities that complement our now larger and more diverse operating footprint continues to be the highest priority in our capital allocation strategy. This commitment will continue to create value for our investors and support ONEOK's position as one of the midstream leaders of return on invested capital. Now moving on to 2024 guidance. We provided a net income midpoint of more than $2.8 billion, an EPS midpoint of $4.88 per diluted share and an adjusted EBITDA midpoint of $6.1 billion. We also include in guidance related to the synergies we expect to realize over the next couple of years. This guidance reflects higher earnings from all business segments, excluding the Medford insurance settlement, and a full year contribution of the refined products and crude segment. Sheridan will provide more detail on each of the operating segments in a moment.As for synergies, we've assumed a midpoint of $175 million of total realized annual cost and initial commercial synergies in 2024, followed by an additional $125 million in 2025. We expect additional synergies in 2026 and beyond as capital expenditure projects to connect our NGL to the refined products and crude businesses are completed. As it relates to capital expenditures, we've assumed a total of $1.85 billion, which includes growth and maintenance capital. This guidance reflects the investment necessary to keep up with the expected levels of producer activity and attractive return growth projects, including the MB-6 fractionator and expansions of our West Texas NGL and Elk Creek NGL pipelines, all expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2025. Once these projects are completed in early 2025, we expect to be on a trend of decreasing capital expenditures over the near to medium term.Our expected 2024 capital guidance does not include the Saguaro Connector project or any other projects that have not yet reached financial investment decision. I'll now turn the call over to Sheridan for a commercial update."", 'Sheridan C. Swords', ""Thank you, Walt. We saw strong year-over-year volume growth in 2023 with natural gas processing volumes up 14% and NGL volumes up 10% compared with 2022. Rocky Mountain region volumes were particularly strong with double-digit growth in both NGL and natural gas processing volumes year-over-year. Higher producer activity levels, increased well connects, and continued strong gas-to-oil ratios drove record fourth quarter volumes totaling nearly 400,000 barrels per day of NGLs and nearly 1.6 Bcf per day of processed volume. Mid-Continent process volume increased 15% year-over-year and Permian Basin NGL increased 19% year-over-year, both benefiting from solid producer activity throughout the year in those regions. Well connects across our operations increased more than 50% compared with 2022. We continue to see the benefit of those connections throughout 2024 as volumes ramp.Our natural gas pipeline segment significantly exceeded its 2023 financial guidance range on higher earnings from long-term storage services and higher rates from negotiated fee-based contracts. Our refined products and crude segment adjusted EBITDA totaled more than $420 million in the segment's first full quarter of operations since the acquisition of Magellan. This segment's performance was driven by midyear tariff increases, longer haul refined product shipments and steady crude oil transportation volumes.Our optimization and marketing activities, which includes liquids blending also benefited from strong margins and volumes. Turning to 2024. Key drivers for our higher 2024 guidance includes stable producer activity and continued production efficiency improvements, providing strong natural gas and NGL volumes across our systems. Solid refined products demand, continued strength in fee-based earnings and rates and our first full year of annualized synergies. In our natural gas liquids segment, we expect higher year-over-year adjusted EBITDA and raw feed throughput volumes to be driven primarily by growth out of the Rocky Mountain region. Despite lower assumptions for incentivized ethane recovery in 2024 and a low-margin contract expiration from Overland Pass pipeline in November of 2023, we still expect higher year-over-year NGL volumes. The expired contracts volume is being replaced with higher rate barrels ramping through 2024. Healthy demand for ethane from the petrochemical industry and why gas to oil ratios are setting up a positive backdrop for NGL markets in 2024. On our system, we've assumed high levels of ethane recovery continue in the Permian Basin in 2024 and partial recovery in the Mid-Continent. We also expect to see continued opportunities to incentivize ethane recovery in the Rocky Mountain region. As Walt mentioned, we've officially moving forward with the expanding the Elk Creek pipeline to 435,000 barrels per day, increasing our total NGL capacity out of the Rocky Mountain region to 575,000 barrels per day. This additional capacity will support future growth and increased ethane recovery.Moving on to the natural gas gathering and processing segment. We expect volume growth in the Rocky Mountain and Mid-Continent regions driven by higher-than-anticipated well connections in 2023 and consistent producer activity levels expected in 2024. In the Rocky Mountain region, we expect processing volumes to grow 9% at the midpoint compared with 2023 and an average more than 1.6 Bcf per day in 2024. This outlook includes the impact from the weather we experienced so far this year, including well freeze-offs in mid-January when the wind chills dropped below negative 60 degrees. By the end of January, volumes had recovered to levels achieved prior to the extreme cold. Strong producer activity levels in 2023 and the continued trend of high gas-to-oil ratios drove several months of record North Dakota natural gas production with the latest record of 3.52 Bcf per day set in December. Producer activity has carried over into 2024. Even through the winter months, as we enter March, there are 36 rigs in the Williston Basin with 20 on our dedicated acreage. Through detailed planning sessions with our customers, we expect additional rigs to return as we move into spring. Additionally, we continue to see a trend at producers drilling longer laterals in the basin. 3 miles in length or more as opposed to the historical 2-mile laterals. These longer laterals continue to drive improved production efficiencies and result in fewer well connections needed to grow gathered volumes. As detailed in our earnings presentation, we expect 3-mile laterals to account for approximately 30% of the wells drilled on our acreage in 2024 compared with only 7% 2 years ago. In the mid-continent region, we are currently seeing approximately 45 rigs in Oklahoma with 6 operating on our acreage. We expect processing volumes to grow approximately 3% at our guidance midpoint compared with 2023 and average approximately 770 million cubic feet per day in 2024. Rig activity across the basin will continue to drive additional NGLs to our system. In the natural gas pipelines segment, we continue to expect strong demand for natural gas storage and transportation services in 2024. At the end of 2023, more than 75% of our natural gas storage capacity was contracted under long-term agreements, and our pipeline transportation capacity was nearly 96% contracted. We expect similar levels in 2024. From a natural gas storage perspective, we continue to focus on expansion projects. We are currently working on a project to reactivate 3 Bcf of previously idle storage in Texas and are further expanding our injection capabilities in Oklahoma. In February 2024, the FERC approved the Saguaro Connector Pipeline's Presidential Permit, and we expect the final investment decision on the pipeline by midyear 2024.Moving on to the refined products and crude segment. We continue to expect healthy business fundamentals and the segment's more than 85% fee-based earnings to drive consistent performance. We'll see the full year effect of higher refined products tariff rates, driven by the midyear 2023 increase of 11.5%. And we expect additional mid-single-digit increases in July 2024. We also expect an increase in refined products volumes, including a benefit from the completion of our expansion to El Paso. Additional benefits are expected from higher volumes and margins related to liquids blending in 2024, driven by favorable market conditions and synergy-related opportunities. Walt discussed commercial synergies earlier, which we expect primarily to show up in our refined products and crude segment's earnings. Pierce, that concludes my remarks."", 'Pierce H. Norton', ""Thank you, Sheridan and Walt. I started this call by saying that 2023 was a year of significant growth and transformation. None of this would have been possible without our dedicated employees, with many of those employees actually listening to this call today. So I want to make sure that I thank them publicly for all that they did in 2023.With us now 5 months post closing of the acquisition, our employees have continued to focus on our integration efforts and prioritize the reliable operations of our assets in the high quality of service expected at ONEOK. Everything we have accomplished this past year means nothing if we don't do it safely and responsibly. From an environmental perspective, we've made significant progress toward our greenhouse gas emissions reduction target, achieving reductions that equate to approximately 50% of our total 2030 reduction target. And from a safety perspective, we brought together 2 companies with leading safety cultures and performance. And combined, we will continue to focus on the safety and health of our employees in the communities that we operate. We've created an operational platform that provides increased scale, scope and diversification. It's a platform, which is already providing opportunities and enabling us to generate exceptional value for our stakeholders.Looking ahead, ONEOK is well positioned in 2024 for another year of significant growth and opportunity. With that, operator, we're now ready for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Brian Reynolds with UBS.', 'Brian Patrick Reynolds', ""Maybe to start off on synergies on Slide 10. We've seen the risk-weighted synergies increase to roughly $400 million from the original expectation of $100 million. So perhaps just a 2-part question. First part is, can you provide some concrete commercial examples of what's driving that upward revision? Just anything specific? And then second, based that these risk-adjusted synergies are up roughly $300 million, could you perhaps update us on the initial like $200 million to $800 million synergy range that you provided last quarter? It seems like there's a little bit of upside to that range at this point."", 'Sheridan C. Swords', ""Well, you're right, we do see some upside to our synergies be going forward, as we say in the $700 million. And really, a lot of it is going to be driven by being able to bring our refined product and crude oil and NGL systems together, which we have multiple opportunities in many different areas of our systems. And really, as we continue through '24 and '25, the thought is going to be, as we said before, in prioritization of which ones we're going to work and we can bring forward. We started 24 wells to be driven by -- we've reached a substantial amount of our cost saving synergies already through '23, and we'll see a full year of that in '24."", 'Kevin L. Burdick', ""Brian, this is Kevin Burdick. The other thing, just on the -- if you think about the cost savings, we have realized the vast majority of those already. So we'll see the full impact in '24. A couple of examples to that would be our organizational design and restructuring activities are complete. So that will be factored in. Another example, public company cost have been eliminated for the Magellan company. So that's another example as well as many others. So the cost savings side will play a big role in 2024 as well."", 'Brian Patrick Reynolds', ""Maybe to switch to just the updated return on capital framework. You outlined a 3% to 4% dividend growth, but kind of updated it with the updated payout ratio of 75% to 80% with buybacks and dividends. So looking at the model, it seems like it's pretty clear on 2024 that you can kind of come to that conclusion. But when I look at '25 and '26, leverage trends below 3.5x, you should have some excess cash based on existing projects that are FID-ed at this point with potentially Saguaro going into that bucket. So as we look in '25 or '26, can you maybe update us on how we should think about the return of capital framework. Could we see maybe an increase of buybacks? Or how should we think about maybe interest in M&A or maybe other projects that may come to fruition in '25 and '26, maybe keep kind of that return on capital framework unchanged."", 'Walter S. Hulse', ""Sure. Well, I want to start out by, again, continuing to point out that during 2023, we were able to extinguish over $1.3 billion of debt, including paying off maturities as they came due and making some open market repurchases in the debt market. So we obviously are continuing to produce significant amounts of free cash flow. As we go into 2024, I think you're correct that we expect to begin our share repurchase program. We do expect that to ramp over the 4-year period as we're still getting through our debt-to-EBITDA metrics that we've gone out with the goal of that 3.5x. So we will expect that to ramp over time. But we do have an intention to begin that program here in 2024. So I think we're set up to make those forward capital returns to our shareholders while still retaining in that additional 25 -- 15% to 25% of unallocated cash flow, meaningful free cash flow for high-return capital projects that we have not yet identified."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Neel Mitra with Bank of America.', 'Indraneel Mitra', ""I was wondering what you're assuming for any third-party frac costs in 2024 and the timing of MB-6 and how that would impact those costs?"", 'Sheridan C. Swords', ""Well, in MB-6, as we said in our prepared remarks and in our earnings release, come up in the first quarter of 2025, and it's 125,000 barrel a day frac. So it will have a significant impact to our third-party frac costs. Our third-party frac costs in 2024 will be about $30 million a quarter, so I think, of what we've estimated on that piece. So we'll be needing third-party frac costs through the remainder of that, which most of we've already contracted."", 'Indraneel Mitra', ""Got it. And then the second question, specifically on the butane blending synergies. I think legacy Magellan landed about 2% of butane into the gasoline stream but because you're able to type a lot of the butane and the gasoline together, it seems like you can expand that opportunity. Can you give us a sense of the total opportunity there in terms of how much of butane you can blend into the gasoline as a percentage basis? Or how much you can expand that operations from the legacy Magellan operations?"", 'Sheridan C. Swords', ""For commercial reasons, we won't get into too much of it, but butane blending is driven by regulations of RVP into the gasoline. So there is a limit. But other than that, we don't want to get too much into it due to commercial sensitivities on what we're doing."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global Securities.', 'Sunil K. Sibal', ""So I wanted to start off on the on the consolidation theme. It seems like that's kind of picking up even more, both on the upstream side and some on the midstream side. So I was kind of curious, as you think about that as a growth avenue, should we be thinking about any major guardrails in terms of the assets or corporations that you look at?"", 'Pierce H. Norton', ""Sunil, this is Pierce. That really question kind of falls in the bucket of mergers and acquisitions, I think. I just want to reemphasize that our primary focus is to continue to be integrating the Magellan acquisition and executing on the synergies and opportunities that we see to create the maximum value for our shareholders. So we're going to be -- we're going to continue to be intentional and disciplined in our approach to M&A. But I'd also say that we have and we will continue to look at other mergers and acquisitions in the context of how do they strengthen our competitive position."", 'Sunil K. Sibal', 'Okay. And then I think in your prepared comments, you mentioned that the growth CapEx is likely to come down in 2025 and forward years. I was kind of curious if you could help us think through the growth CapEx needs at combined ONEOK now. And is there a good way to think about the growth CapEx or total CapEx needed to maintain volumes and then to further on grow volumes?', 'Pierce H. Norton', ""So I'll kind of take a high-level cut at that, and then I'll ask either Walt or Sheridan to chime in on this. But one thing that I don't know if you picked up on, but Walt just mentioned that we actually have some excess cash of about 20% to 25%. So there is money out there for these high-return projects that we either -- or potentially working on or even not identified at this point. So as far as the specifics go, I'll kind of turn it over to Walt and Sheridan."", 'Walter S. Hulse', ""Well, I think as we mentioned here in 2024, we've identified a midpoint of $1.85 billion. We have some pretty large projects in there with the MB-6 being the largest and then the completion of the West Texas LPG expansion and then the completion of the Bakken expansion, which we want to make sure is done here in early 2025. Once those projects are done, we don't have any other large identified projects that we've FID-ed for the market. So you can kind of peel those away as they've come into 2025. Our routine growth type of expenditures will continue and we will find more opportunities that probably just going to be more bite-sized and ones that we can do out of free cash flow and will be ones that are really facilitating and accelerating the synergies that we're looking to achieve in '25 and '26."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.', 'Michael Jacob Blum', ""Question on Saguaro. If you FID Saguaro in mid-'24, first of all, would that change the '24 CapEx number much? Or would most of that fall into the '25 and '26? And would that change your expectation that '25 CapEx would come down?"", 'Pierce H. Norton', ""I'm going to let Walt kind of take the CapEx question, but there's a couple of things that I want to make sure that I note on this call that it pertains to Saguaro, Michael. And one is I want to really thank all those employees who worked on getting the permit approved in this process. And as we look at Saguaro, it is the most economic route for LNG to reach the markets or at least multiple markets. And that's actually been indicated by the strong commercial interest and the backing by the major players there. And here's where I want to really kind of make this clear that we said all along that our commitment to this project will involve procuring the Presidential Permit, which as we noted in our script, that is complete, the building of the U.S. portion of the pipe, getting across the border with the pipe and then the operation of the U.S. pipe.And as far as our financial involvement, that's going to be commensurate with the value that it brings to our shareholders versus the risk we see in the project. I'll kind of let Walt fill in some of the details there."", 'Walter S. Hulse', ""Yes, Michael, given the timing, there's not -- if it gets FID midyear, the capital associated with that would not be a material change to 2024. And in 2025 and beyond, I don't think you'll see anything that would change my comment before about seeing a reduction over the 2024 level of CapEx as we go forward. Projects takes a couple of years to construct and we'll fit right in within our capital program."", 'Michael Jacob Blum', 'Great. And then just wanted to ask on the Elk Creek expansion you announced. Maybe you could just help us understand a little bit what the ramp in volumes could look like? Should we expect this to be highly -- highly utilized at start-up, like maybe (inaudible) or will this be kind of more of a gradual ramp?', 'Sheridan C. Swords', ""Well, Michael, (inaudible) as we think about the Elk Creek expansion, we've always said that we're not going to run out of capacity coming out of the Bakken. And that's why we want to make sure this pipeline comes up in the first quarter of 2025. So we are expecting volume increases and we'll need that as we move into 2025. And then there's a lot of things affected on the ramp up. One is how much incentivized ethane we have coming out of there. And if we -- and the other one is the continuing growth in the basin as we've seen gas to oil ratios continue to grow and the drilling activity that we're seeing right now is conducive to increase overall volumes in the basin. So I think we will see quite a bit of growth as we move into 2025 on this pipeline with those 2 backdrops."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Vrathan Reddy with JPMorgan.', 'Vrathan Reddy', ""I appreciate the color you guys provided on producer efficiency in the slides and even in the prepared remarks, it seems like a pretty significant step up there in the share of 3-mile laterals in '24. So just kind of thinking if we should be thinking about the increase in 3-mile laterals, reducing the required CapEx to maintain current volumes at this point? Or any other thoughts you could frame up there would be greatly appreciated."", 'Sheridan C. Swords', 'Yes. This is Sheridan. Absolutely with more efficiency and then growing 3-mile laterals. So each well is going to have more production on that. So we are going to see a drop off from our previous cadence on capital that we need to spend in the area to maintain volume. And also remember that in the Bakken, we are guiding a little bit over 1.6 Bcf of throughput, and we have 1.9 Bcf of processing capacity up there. So we have a lot of working leverage to grow in that area. So we will see our capital come down.', 'Vrathan Reddy', 'Great. And then for the second one, I wanted to hit on Northern Border. And just any thoughts you guys could share on how you see dynamics playing out there throughout the year. Mainly, if we could see any relief on the pipeline once volume starts flowing on Coastal GasLink to service LNG Canada?', 'Charles M. Kelley', ""Well, Vrathan, this is Chuck. As far as Northern Border goes, the volumes that we see coming down there today, I don't think will be appreciably impacted by the Canadian volumes diverted to LNG Canada. There's a stronghold of about 400 million a day that's held by long-term producers that will continue to flow down Northern Border. So the pipe will remain full headed toward Ventura in Chicago. And there's been some relief in our G&P business, working a deal with WBI to move some guests down to Cheyenne Hub, and that's been a nice relief valve. You've probably seen some information about Bison Express, which should be coming on in Q2 of 2026 that will offer upwards of another, call it, 400 million a day of relief. So I think the pipe is positioned well for the next couple of years."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Spiro Dounis with Citi.', 'Spiro Michael Dounis', ""Maybe just go back to a follow-up to Michael's question, but really kind of focused on the 3 major projects you've got coming online in the first quarter of '25. As up to about $1.4 billion of capital kind of starting up that quarter, just curious if you can give us a sense for what the initial return multiple was on those projects and how to think about the EBITDA ramp for all 3 over '25?"", 'Sheridan C. Swords', ""Well, I'll take the first part of that. As we look at each one of those projects, and we think about the ramp-up, MB-6 is going to come up full. We will -- because we're having third-party frac capacity today. So it's going to be at a very high operating rate. So it's going to be a very nice multiple we have on that. As we've said with the West Texas expansion that we are contracting and continue to contract more volume on that to have an acceptable return with a significant amount of upside going forward. So we're continuing to drive that projects multiple down as we grow on that. The Elk Creek expansion is probably going to be the lowest one on that as we don't need a whole lot of volume to be able to have a very low multiple. And if we would get to the point that we're at a high utilization rate, that multiple will be well below 1."", 'Spiro Michael Dounis', ""Okay. That's helpful. And maybe going back to the synergies, it sounds like for 2026 plus, you're going to have to develop some new infrastructure to achieve those synergies. Just curious, can you give us a sense for what that looks like? Are these storage tanks? Are these connections within the systems? Just a sense of what you're building out there."", 'Sheridan C. Swords', ""Yes. I think it's going to be all that kind of stuff. It's going to be small -- relatively small capital. It's going to be some connections here, some tanks here, depending all up and down our system. So it -- some of that will come before '26. But as we continue to look forward to that, we'll be achieving most of it as we head into the '26 time frame."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein.', 'Jean Ann Salisbury', ""Just a follow-up on the discussion about Northern Border earlier. My understanding from looking at the scrapes is that Canada is actually already at the sort of 300 to 400 mmcfd that they have directly contracted. Do you think we've hit a limit here on Bakken gas takeaway until the rest of Bison comes on in 2026? And how do you think it plays out?"", 'Charles M. Kelley', 'Jean Ann, this is Chuck. I stand by what I said. I really think the 400 million a day will continue to come down Northern Border from the legacy Canadian producers. So the growth coming out of the Bakken will be absorbed through Bison Express and the WBI expansion.', 'Pierce H. Norton', ""So Jean Ann, this is Pierce. Based on what I've seen, I mean, I actually look at this as well. There is capacity today. So there's no restrictions today. And if you look at the fact that there's going to be some natural gas-fired generation facilities that are going to be built in the North Dakota area and you also look at the Bison Express and then you also look at WBI, we're not seeing anything in anywhere in the near future if there's going to be any kind of restrictions on gas takeaway."", 'Walter S. Hulse', ""Yes. And while we think that there's plenty of takeaway, do remember that we always have the lever if we need to, that we can extract more ethane and put it on the NGL pipe to create capacity for natural gas."", 'Jean Ann Salisbury', ""That's exactly what I was looking for. And then kind of a follow-up on some of the ethane outlooks that Sheridan was talking about earlier. I think there's not a ton of new ethane demand domestically or exports for a few years from now, but associated gas will likely still grow. And your outlook, does that have the risk of increasing rejection in the Bakken or Mid-Con over the next couple of years? And could that be a drag on EBITDA?"", 'Sheridan C. Swords', ""Potentially, I think when we get out in 2025, we'll see a little bit more of ethane export capability coming online. A lot really depends on how hard the pet chems are running on utilization is a big impact as well. And then as we think about ethane rejection and recovery across our footprint, a lot depends on what the natural gas price in that area is. We feel that we have a very good opportunity to continue to bring incentivized ethane out of the Bakken just from our fully integrated NGL system and G&P system as well. Mid-Continent maybe where we see a little bit of swing, could be a little bit more swing in ethane recovery, but those are at much lower rates than we see coming out of the Bakken.But I think the big thing is going to be is how hard the pet chems are, the utilization rate. And we're seeing, as we move into 2024, they're operating at pretty high levels."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research.', 'Keith T. Stanley', 'I wanted to start and follow up on Saguaro and so if Mexico Pacific declares FID, how are you thinking about DOE risks for that project? I think they need an extension of their in-service deadline for non-FTA exports. How do you mitigate that risk around that issue as it relates to your project and your contracts?', 'Charles M. Kelley', ""Keith, this is Chuck. Yes, as you state, MPL received back in 2019 for the first 2 trains, DOE export approval. And they have adequate time to go ahead and start this project post FID where that approval is for both FTA and non-FTA countries. So I feel pretty good, obviously, about trains 1 and 2, this pause that we're seeing right now impacts their second requested approval, which would be for train 3. And as you know, we don't know exactly how this is going to play out the balance of the year. So trains 1 and 2 post-FID, we feel good about those volumes as we sit here today."", 'Keith T. Stanley', ""Okay. And the second question, just any updated thoughts on potential to enter the LPG export business and how you're weighing the potential to use Magellan sites or other facilities versus I think, there's a greenfield option that you're in the early stages of looking at to at Sabine Pass. Just any updated thoughts there?"", 'Sheridan C. Swords', ""This is Sheridan. On the LP exports, I think we're the same spotter what we can share publicly, where we have been for a period of time as you're right, we continue to look at all alternatives that we have. We have a greenfield site trying to understand if there's some synergies there from a physical standpoint from the Magellan assets, if we could put something on their sites. So we continue to do that. But right now, as I've said, we see the LPG export as we think something that could enhance our integration, but it's not something we absolutely need as we continue to be able to move our barrels through the market today that has the export capabilities at other facilities."", 'Operator', 'Was there a follow-up to that Mr. Stanley?', 'Keith T. Stanley', ""No, that's all."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Theresa Chen with Barclays.', 'Theresa Chen', 'On the refined product side, with the significant swings in Mid-Con versus Gulf Coast product prices, thus far into the year, Mid-Con being heavily discounted earlier in the year, then product price is roughly rising after the widening outage. Has this created opportunities for you to use the Sterling system to ship product software when the (inaudible) was there towards the beginning of the first quarter and also opportunities for more long-haul movements of refined products from the Gulf Coast, Mid-Con on the legacy Magellan assets and incremental earnings as a result?', 'Sheridan C. Swords', ""What I'd say is, right now, we're not going to comment specifically on refined products, movements on any specific pipeline. What I can tell is NGL pipelines have moved refined products here in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. We do see with that movement in the 2 pricing mechanisms between the Gulf and the group. We have seen opportunity for longer haul tariffs on our refined product system."", 'Theresa Chen', 'Okay. And Sheridan, going back to the butane blending synergies and your comment about the RVP requirements. So butane blending getting to come out of the gasoline pool in that mid-April time frame, and just given the comments from some of the downstream customers that have the lack of octane in the gasoline pool after that switch happens, does this lend to some opportunities for your isobutane volumes as a feedstock for alkylate? Or said differently, does the acquired Magellan refined products assets and your exposure to gasoline flows now more than before, can that create some uplift for the even heavier components of your NGL barrels?', 'Sheridan C. Swords', ""Yes, there could be some potential as we look at for the natural gasoline component of the barrel, some blending into the unleaded pool that we've looked at. As in terms of isobutane specifically going into alkylate, we've been servicing those alkylate units for quite a long time in the legacy NGL business. And typically, as you know, alkylate is a very high priced and usually, they run those pretty strong. The big difference in those alkylate unit is whether or not they're going to run some refinery grade propylene through that unit or are they going to stay or how their RGBs, refiner grade butane runs through that as well. So if we see more propylene run through an alkylate unit, we will see a little bit more isobutane being used. But typically, they run pretty steady."", 'Operator', 'Next question comes from Tristan Richardson with Scotiabank.', 'Tristan James Richardson', ""Just maybe a question on the WesTex expansion. You've talked a while now about the optionality that you have once the final deal is complete. And just maybe just a little bit about timing and progress on decision of what service to put the legacy pipe into your crude (inaudible) product or NGLs? And then how readily and quickly you can make that transition?"", 'Sheridan C. Swords', ""Well, right now, we -- it is an option. We haven't decided to exercise that option. We continue to see good growth on the NGL side. So there is a good possibility we want to keep it in NGL service to continue to be able to service our downstream assets in the Mont Belvieu area. If we would decide to shift it to some other product, the big thing is going to have to be determined on which way we run it. Obviously, if we want to run it from Mont Belvieu out to West Texas, it will take us a little bit more time because we'll have to do a little bit of work on header systems on that side. If we want another product moving from West Texas in to Mont Belvieu into the Houston area, it would be quicker because the pumps are already set up going that direction. But as of this moment right now, we're probably leaning more towards the natural gas liquids side of it or the raw feed side of it is we continue to see good growth coming out of the Permian."", 'Tristan James Richardson', ""Appreciate it, Sheridan. And then maybe for Walt, just curious, you talked about this in a couple of questions here. But as thinking about the 3 major projects coming off in '25 and what that implies for future CapEx and certainly what that implies for future free cash flow. Can you talk about -- as we think about '25 and '26, what gets you to maybe the higher end or the lower end of that capital return as a percent, that 75% to 85%."", 'Walter S. Hulse', ""Well, clearly, with what we have identified today from a CapEx standpoint, as I said before, that we would expect that capital return to ramp throughout that period. I think that we will be producing a meaningful amount of free cash flow. Obviously, it will increase when our CapEx number goes down. So we'll still stay in that 75% to 85% availability after CapEx, it's just going to be a bigger number. So it will give us more opportunity for shareholder return."", 'Pierce H. Norton', ""Tristan, this is Pierce. Kind of embedded in your question there is the implication of kind of what drives our EBITDA to the higher end versus the lower end. I think that's probably worth mentioning there. But filling more of our existing capacity across these assets is going to clearly make that movement up. And we've already mentioned that we want to make sure that we get this pipe in by first quarter 2025 out of the Bakken. And then also to continue to prioritize and execute on those additional -- those connectivities between our NGL refined products and crude oil systems across our footprint. And then third, it's those quicker than forecasted recognition of synergies. And of course, the downside would be things that might impact the volume, which is the weather and the user activity. All of those kind of go into how far above or below the midpoint that we might be that impacts what you and Walt just talked about."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities.', 'Neal David Dingmann', ""My first question is on NGL specifically, just wondering where are you all seeing notable demand pure NGL -- the Permian NGL service. Is it mostly in key Midland or Delaware areas? I'm just wondering if there are specific areas that we should be looking at there? And then are you all taking market share from Permian contracts rolling off, other pipes or this is more basic expansion?"", 'Sheridan C. Swords', ""Yes. When we look at the Midland and Delaware, it's more as we look about growth to our system, it's more based on the customers out there and who we're seeing and the ones we have aligned, and we have some that are more Midland specific, some that are more Delaware-specific. So that really depends on who's kind of drilling more or bringing volume to us at that time. We -- in terms of contracts roll off, we've seen a little bit of that. What we've seen a little bit is some taking kind rides coming to us from different customers as we go forward. But overall, we see an opportunity in both of those basins to be able to source NGLs into our system going forward. A lot depends -- it really a lot depends on the customer."", 'Neal David Dingmann', ""Yes, that makes sense. Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on -- like that Slide 10 that shows the synergy opportunities. I'm just wondering on the batching upside that you laid out here on this slide, just wondered timing-wise, how quickly, I'm just wondering are you thinking, and are there key areas that you'd anticipate seeing the majority of that batching upside?"", 'Sheridan C. Swords', ""Well, on that batching, I think we're really going to see a lot of it throughout our system. Some of it is already happening today. Some of it will happen throughout 2024. Those are opportunities that we see where we already have some connectivity between the system and then that will continue to grow through '25 and '26 as we continue to bring these assets together. But we see that opportunity in the central system, we see that opportunity on the Gulf Coast. We see that opportunity even as much as on the lines out to West Texas."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.', 'Craig Kenneth Shere', 'On CapEx opportunities, could you opine on the possibility of meeting another frac by 2026? And does the MMP acquisition increase prospects for accretively rebuilding and/or repurposing legacy Medford frac site?', 'Sheridan C. Swords', ""This is Sheridan. I don't think the MMP affects -- really affects Medford at all what we have there. As we think about increased frac capacity and our needs there, really what we're looking at right now is bottlenecks throughout our system or we can get very low-cost expansions through our existing fracs. And we continue to look at Medford and what type of capacity we could get out of Medford at a very low cost by only bringing portions of that back up. The whole facility wasn't as damaged by the fire in certain parts. So we think there is an opportunity to have a little bit less capacity there at a very low dollar per barrel of capacity. So that's where we see our next really growth in fractionation capacity coming from, and we really don't see the MMP acquisition have a big impact to that."", 'Craig Kenneth Shere', 'Great. And last question on synergies. It sounds like you expect almost the full $100 million or so in G&A benefits in 2024, which would suggest that you might be being conservative on the commercial side. Is that a fair assessment?', 'Kevin L. Burdick', ""Craig, it's Kevin. Like we said, I mean, we feel -- obviously, we feel really good about our progress we've made on the cost savings side. I think just kind of naturally, many of those synergies come quicker than the commercial. We continue to prioritize those. We did add kind of 100 plus to the upside for the cost savings side. So we'll continue to work those. But we're just trying to send the message that, particularly in '24, there is a good chunk of the synergies that are going to be cost savings."", 'Operator', 'And the last question comes from Zack Van Everen with TPH.', 'Zackery Lee Van Everen', 'Just going back up to the Rockies growth, you noted 9% year-over-year in 2024, but it looks like NGL growth is a bit lower than that for the year. Is the majority of that the contract rolls on Overland? Or are you expecting just less overall ethane recovery? Just trying to kind of put those 2 numbers together.', 'Sheridan C. Swords', ""Yes. The -- on the NGL growth, we are expecting less or we have put in our guidance less incentivized ethane coming out of the Bakken. We definitely think there could be some upside there. So that has an impact. And then the contract that we will no longer be getting volume off of Overland Pass is a very low margin, very kind of high-volume contract that has an impact. We've been expecting that contract or we knew we were not going to be moving forward to renewing that contract when it came up. So this is something that's been in our plan for a period of time. So that's what's kind of driving a little bit of the difference when you look at growth on G&P versus the growth on NGLs."", 'Zackery Lee Van Everen', 'Got you. That makes sense. And then shifting over to the rate adjustments in July, you noted mid-single digits. Just looking at the FERC regulated calculation trending towards 1.5% kind of hints at higher market-based adjustments. Curious if you had any pushback from customers on that or just how that conversations going overall?', 'Sheridan C. Swords', ""We haven't decided what we're going to do on market-based rate adjustments, but we do look at it very extensive at each one of our locations and do extensive look at the market and what's appropriate in those locations. And that's why we've kind of just given a mid single digit -- Mid-single-digit rate is what we think it will be. But we have not yet determined exactly what we're going to do. But we do have varied conversation with customers, understand the marketplace, understand the dynamics that are there before we make those adjustments."", 'Operator', 'This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Andrew Ziola for any closing remarks.', 'Andrew J. Ziola', ""All right. Well, perfect timing, everybody. Our quiet period for the first quarter starts when we close our books in April and extends until we release earnings in late April. We'll provide details for that conference call at a later date.

On today's call is Walt Hulse, the chief financial officer, treasurer, and executive vice president, investor relations and corporate development; and Sheridan Swords, who's our executive vice president, commercial liquids and natural gas gathering and processing. Also available to answer your questions are Chuck Kelley, our senior vice president, natural gas pipelines; and Kevin Burdick, who's the executive vice president of chief enterprise services. Record volumes, strong financial performance, and the closing of the Magellan acquisition solidified 2023 as a year of significant growth and transformation for ONEOK."", 'Momentum from our operations in 2023 is setting the stage for additional growth in 2024. With our earnings release yesterday, we reported double-digit NGL and natural gas processing volume growth year over year and continued fee-based earnings growth in all three of our legacy business segments. We also provided 2024 guidance, along with some insight into 2025 and beyond, including an expectation for double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth in 2024. Walt will provide more detail on our guidance, which is underscored by solid business fundamentals, demand for the products that we deliver, and a full year of earnings contribution from our refined products and crude oil segments, and the initial realization of acquisition-related synergies.', ""Before I turn the call over to Walt, I want to share a few data points that helped sum up the exceptional growth ONEOK has experienced in recent years. While our business continues to transform and to look to the future, it's still important to reflect on what has already been accomplished. I'll share just a handful of highlights, but there are many more. First, 2023 marked ONEOK's 10th consecutive year of adjusted EBITDA growth throughout various commodity cycles."", ""Over the same time period, we've increased dividends paid to $3.82 per share from $1.48 per share, a more than 150% increase. And in January, the board approved another increase. Our volumes out of the Rocky Mountain region have set numerous records over the last five years alone, NGL volumes from the region have grown at a more than 20% annual growth rate, and natural gas processing volumes have grown at a 10% annual growth rate. We've continued to expand our asset portfolio, increasing our extensive pipeline network to more than 50,000 miles from approximately 30,000 miles in 2013 and adding nearly two Bcf per day of natural gas processing capacity and three fractionators."", ""And finally, through all of this growth, both internally and by acquisition, we've continued to prioritize safety, and our sustainability and ESG-related performance consistently ranking toward the top of our industry peer group, including a AAA rating from MSCI. We've achieved a great deal in recent years and over the course of our company's history. And now, with a more diversified portfolio of assets, we are even better positioned to make the most of future opportunities. With that, I'll turn the call over to Walt."", 'Walt Hulse -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Thank you, Pierce. Before we get to guidance, I'll start with a brief overview of our fourth quarter and full year financial performance. ONEOK's fourth quarter and full year 2023 net income totaled $688 million and $2.7 billion, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA totaled more than $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023 and more than $5.2 billion for the full year."", ""While there were a number of unique items contributing to the significant year-over-year increase in results such as the Medford settlement and the Magellan acquisition, the strong performance from our legacy business segments continued. Even excluding these unique one-time items, ONEOK's adjusted EBITDA would have increased more than 15% year over year. As of December 31st, we had no borrowings outstanding under our $2.5 billion credit facility and had more than $335 million of cash on hand. In 2023, ONEOK extinguished $1.3 billion of long-term debt, contributing to a fourth quarter 2023 run rate net debt to EBITDA ratio in line with our previously discussed target of 3.5 times."", 'In January, we increased our quarterly dividend 3.7% to $0.99 per share or $3.96 per share on an annualized basis. Going forward, ONEOK expects to target an annual dividend growth rate ranging between 3% to 4%. We also announced a $2 billion share repurchase authorization, which we target to largely use over the next four years. This program is complementary to the dividend growth rate when thinking about shareholder return in the future.', ""Over the next four years, ONEOK's combination of dividends and share repurchases is expected to trend toward a target of approximately 75% to 85% of forecasted cash flow from operations after identified capital expenditures. Our commitment to maintaining our financial flexibility and taking advantage of attractive return capital growth opportunities that complement our now larger and more diverse operating footprint continues to be the highest priority in our capital allocation strategy. This commitment will continue to create value for our investors and support ONEOK's position as one of the midstream leaders of return on invested capital. Now, moving on to 2024 guidance."", 'We provided a net income midpoint of more than $2.8 billion and EPS midpoint of $4.88 per diluted share and an adjusted EBITDA midpoint of $6.1 billion. We also included guidance related to the synergies we expect to realize over the next couple of years. This guidance reflects higher earnings from all business segments, excluding the Medford insurance settlement, and a full year contribution of the refined products and crude segment. Sheridan will provide more detail on each of the operating segments in a moment.', ""As for synergies, we've assumed a midpoint of $175 million of total realized annual cost and initial commercial synergies in 2024, followed by an additional $125 million in 2025. We expect additional synergies in 2026 and beyond as capital expenditure projects to connect our NGL to the refined products and crude businesses are completed. As it relates to capital expenditures, we've assumed a total of $1.85 billion, which includes growth and maintenance capital. This guidance reflects the investment necessary to keep up with the expected levels of producer activity and attractive return growth projects, including the MB-6 fractionator and expansions of our West Texas NGL and Elk Creek NGL pipelines, all expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2025."", ""Once these projects are completed in early 2025, we expect to be on a trend of decreasing capital expenditures over the near to medium term. Our expected 2024 capital guidance does not include the Saguaro Connector project or any other projects that have not yet reached financial investment decision. I'll now turn the call over to Sheridan for a commercial update."", 'Sheridan Swords -- Senior Vice President, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Gathering and Processing', 'Thank you, Walt. We saw strong year-over-year volume growth in 2023 with natural gas processing volumes up 14% and NGL volumes up 10% compared with 2022. Rocky Mountain region volumes were particularly strong with double-digit growth in both NGL and natural gas processing volumes year over year. Higher producer activity levels, increased well connects, and continued strong gas-to-oil ratios drove record fourth quarter volumes, totaling nearly 400,000 barrels per day of NGLs and nearly 1.6 Bcf per day of processed volume.', 'Mid-Continent processed volume increased 15% year over year, and Permian Basin NGL increased 19% year over year, both benefiting from solid producer activity throughout the year in those regions. Well connects across our operations increased more than 50% compared with 2022. We continue to see the benefit of those connections throughout 2024 as volumes ramp. Our natural gas pipeline segment significantly exceeded its 2023 financial guidance range on higher earnings from long-term storage services and higher rates from negotiated fee-based contracts.', ""Our refined products and crude segment adjusted EBITDA totaled more than $420 million in the segment's first full quarter of operation since the acquisition of Magellan. This segment's performance was driven by midyear tariff increases, longer-haul refined product shipments, and steady crude oil transportation volumes. Our optimization and marketing activities, which includes liquids blending, also benefited from strong margins and volumes. Turning to 2024."", 'Key drivers for our higher 2024 guidance includes stable producer activity and continued production efficiency improvements, providing strong natural gas and NGL volumes across our systems; solid refined products demand; continued strength in fee-based earning and rates; and our first full year of annualized synergies. In our natural gas liquids segment, we expect higher year-over-year adjusted EBITDA and raw feed throughput volumes to be driven primarily by growth out of the Rocky Mountain region. Despite lower assumptions for incentivized ethane recovery in 2024 and a low-margin contract expiration from Overland Pass pipeline in November of 2023, we still expect higher year-over-year NGL volumes. The expired contracts volume is being replaced with higher-rate barrels ramping through 2024.', ""Healthy demand for ethane from the petrochemical industry and wide gas-to-oil ratios are setting up a positive backdrop for NGL markets in 2024. On our system, we've assumed high levels of ethane recovery continue in the Permian Basin in 2024 and partial recovery in the Mid-Continent. We also expect to see continued opportunities to incentivize ethane recovery in the Rocky Mountain region. As Walt mentioned, we've officially moving forward with the expanding the Elk Creek pipeline to 435,000 barrels per day, increasing our total NGL capacity out of the Rocky Mountain region to 575,000 barrels per day."", 'This additional capacity will support future growth and increase ethane recovery. Moving on to the natural gas gathering and processing segment. We expect volume growth in the Rocky Mountain and Mid-Continent regions driven by higher-than-anticipated well connections in 2023 and consistent producer activity levels expected in 2024. In the Rocky Mountain region, we expect processing volumes to grow 9% at the midpoint compared with 2023 and have average -- and average more than 1.6 Bcf per day in 2024.', 'This outlook includes the impact from the weather we experienced so far this year, including well freeze-offs in mid-January when the wind chills dropped below negative 60 degrees. By the end of January, volumes had recovered to levels achieved prior to the extreme cold. Strong producer activity levels in 2023 and the continued trend of high gas-to-oil ratios drove several months of record North Dakota natural gas production, with the latest record of 3.52 Bcf per day set in December. Producer activity has carried over into 2024.', 'Even through the winter months, as we enter March, there are 36 rigs in the Williston Basin, with 20 on our dedicated acreage. Through detailed planning sessions with our customers, we expect additional rigs to return as we move into spring. Additionally, we continue to see a trend of producers drilling longer laterals in the basin. Three miles in length or more, as opposed to the historical two-mile laterals.', 'These longer laterals continue to drive improved production efficiencies and result in fewer well connections needed to grow gathered volumes. As detailed in our earnings presentation, we expect three-mile laterals to account for approximately 30% of the wells drilled on our acreage in 2024, compared with only 7% two years ago. In the Mid-Continent region, we are currently seeing approximately 45 rigs in Oklahoma, with six operating on our acreage. We expect processing volumes to grow approximately 3% at our guidance midpoint compared with 2023 and average approximately 770 million cubic feet per day in 2024.', ""Rig activity across the basin will continue to drive additional NGLs to our system. In the natural gas pipeline segment, we continue to expect strong demand for natural gas storage and transportation services in 2024. At the end of '23 -- 2023, more than 75% of our natural gas storage capacity was contracted under long-term agreements and our pipeline transportation capacity was nearly 96% contracted. We expect similar levels in 2024."", ""From a natural gas storage perspective, we continue to focus on expansion projects. We are currently working on a project to reactivate 3 Bcf of previously idled storage in Texas and are further expanding our injection capabilities in Oklahoma. In February 2024, the FERC approved the Saguaro Connector Pipeline's Presidential Permit, and we expect a final investment decision on the pipeline by midyear 2024. Moving on to the refined products and crude segment."", ""We continue to expect healthy business fundamentals and the segment's more than 85% fee-based earnings to drive consistent performance. We'll see the full year effect of higher refined products tariff rates, driven by the midyear 2023 increase of 11.5%, and we expect additional mid-single digit increases in July 2024. We also expect an increase in refined products volumes, including a benefit from the completion of our expansion to El Paso. Additional benefits are expected from higher volumes and margins related to liquids blending in 2024, driven by favorable market conditions and synergy-related opportunities."", ""Walt discussed commercial synergies earlier, which we expect primarily to show up in our refined products and crude segment's earnings. Pierce, that concludes my remarks."", 'Pierce Norton -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you, Sheridan and Walt. I started this call by saying that 2023 was a year of significant growth and transformation. But none of this would have been possible without our dedicated employees, with many of those employees actually listening to this call today. So, I want to make sure that I thank them publicly for all that they did in 2023.', ""With us now five months post-closing of the acquisition, our employees have continued to focus on our integration efforts and prioritize the reliable operations of our assets and the high quality of service expected at ONEOK. Everything we have accomplished this past year means nothing if we don't do it safely and responsibly. From an environmental perspective, we've made significant progress toward our greenhouse gas emissions reduction target, achieving reductions that equate to approximately 50% of our total 2030 reduction targets. And from a safety perspective, we brought together two companies with leading safety cultures and performance."", ""And combined, we will continue to focus on the safety and health of our employees and the communities that we operate. We've created an operational platform that provides increased scale, scope, and diversification. It's a platform which is already providing opportunities and enabling us to generate exceptional value for our stakeholders. Looking ahead, ONEOK is well-positioned in 2024 for another year of significant growth and opportunity."", ""With that, operator, we're now ready for questions."", '', 'Operator', 'We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] The first question comes from Brian Reynolds with UBS. Please go ahead.', 'Brian Reynolds -- UBS -- Analyst', ""Hi. Good morning, everyone. Maybe to start off on synergies on Slide 10, you know, we've seen the risk-weighted synergies increase to roughly 400 million from the original expectation of 100 million. So, perhaps just, you know, a two-part question."", ""First part is can you provide some concrete, you know, commercial examples of what's driving that upwards revision, just anything, you know, specific? And then second, you know, based that these risk-adjusted synergies are up, you know, roughly 300 million, could you perhaps update us on the initial like $200 million to $800 million synergy range that you provided, you know, last quarter? It seems like there's a little bit of upside to that range at this point. Thanks."", 'Sheridan Swords -- Senior Vice President, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Gathering and Processing', ""Well, you're right. We do see some upside to our synergies as we're going forward, as we say, in the 700 million. And really, a lot of it is going to be driven by being able to bring our refined product and crude oil and NGL systems together, which we have multiple opportunities in many different areas of our systems. And really, as we continue through '24 and '25, our thought is going to be, as we said before, in prioritization of which ones we're going to work and we can bring forward."", ""We started '24 wells to be driven by -- we've reached a substantial amount of our cost savings synergies already through '23, and we'll see a full year of that in '24."", 'Kevin Burdick -- Executive Vice President, Chief Enterprise Services', ""Yeah. Brian, this is Kevin Burdick. The other thing, just on the -- if you think about the cost savings, we have realized the vast majority of those already. So, we'll see the full impact in '24."", ""A couple of examples to that would be our organizational design and restructuring activities are complete. So, that will be factored in. Another example, you know, public company costs have been eliminated for the Magellan company. So, that's another example, as well as many others."", 'So, the cost savings side will play a big role in 2024 as well.', 'Brian Reynolds -- UBS -- Analyst', 'Great. Thanks. I appreciate that. Maybe to switch to just the updated return of capital framework, you know, you outlined the 3% to 4% dividend growth, but, you know, kind of updated it with the updated payout ratio of 75% to 80% with buybacks and dividends.', ""So, you know, just looking at the model, it seems like it's pretty clear on 2024, you know, how -- that you can kind of come to that conclusion. But when I look at '25 and '26, you know, leverage trend is below 3.5 times, you should have some excess cash just based on, you know, existing projects that are FID at this point, you know, with potentially Saguaro going into that bucket. So, as we look into '25 or '26, could you maybe update us on how we should think about the return of capital framework? Could we see maybe an increase of buybacks or how should we think about maybe interest in M&A or maybe other projects that may come to fruition in '25 and '26 to maybe keep kind of that return of capital framework, you know, unchanged?"", 'Walt Hulse -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Sure. Well, you know, I want to start out by, again, continuing to point out that during 2023, we were able to extinguish over $1.3 billion of debt, including paying off maturities as they came due and making some open market repurchases in the debt market. So, we obviously are continuing to produce significant amounts of free cash flow. As we go into 2024, I think you're correct that we expect to begin our share repurchase program."", ""We do expect that to ramp over the four-year period as we're still getting through our debt to EBITDA metrics that we've gone out with the goal of that 3.5 times. So, we will expect that to ramp up over time. But we do have an intention to begin that program here in 2024. So, we -- I think we're set up to make those forward capital returns to our shareholders while still retaining in that additional 25 -- 15% to 25% of unallocated cash flow, meaningful free cash flow for high-return capital projects that we have not yet identified."", 'Brian Reynolds -- UBS -- Analyst', 'Great. Makes sense. Super helpful. Enjoy the rest of your morning.', 'Pierce Norton -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Neel Mitra with Bank of America. Please go ahead.', 'Neel Mitra -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""Hi. Good morning. I was wondering what you're assuming for any third-party frac costs in 2024 and the timing of MB-6 and how that would impact those costs."", 'Sheridan Swords -- Senior Vice President, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Gathering and Processing', ""Well, MB-6, as we said in our prepared remarks and in our earnings release, will come up in the first quarter of 2025, and it's 125,000 barrels a day of frac. So, it will have a significant impact to our third-party frac costs. Our third-party frac costs in 2024 will be about 30 million a quarter is I think what we've estimated on that piece. So, we'll be needing third-party frac costs through the remainder of that, which most of, we've already contracted."", 'Neel Mitra -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""Got it. And then the second question, specifically on the butane blending synergies, I think legacy Magellan blended about 2% of butane into the gasoline stream. But because you're able to type a lot of the butane and the gasoline together, it seems like you can expand that opportunity. Can you give us a sense of the total opportunity there in terms of how much of that butane you can blend into the gasoline as a percentage basis or how much you can expand that operations from the legacy Magellan operations?"", 'Sheridan Swords -- Senior Vice President, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Gathering and Processing', ""For commercial reasons, we won't get into too much of it, but butane blending is driven by regulations of RVP into the gasoline. So, there is a limit. But other than that, we don't want to get too much into it due to commercial sensitivities on what we're doing."", 'Neel Mitra -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'OK. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.', 'Sunil Sibal -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst', 'Yeah. Hi. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for all the clarity. So, I wanted to start off on the consolidation theme.', ""It seems like, you know, that's kind of picking up even more, both on the upstream side and some on the midstream side. So, I was kind of curious, you know, as you think about that as a growth avenue, should we be thinking about any major guardrails in terms of the assets or corporations that you look at?"", 'Pierce Norton -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""So, Sunil, this is Pierce. The -- that really question kind of falls in the bucket of mergers and acquisitions, I think. I just want to reemphasize that our primary focus is to continue to be integrating the Magellan acquisition and executing on the synergies and opportunities that we see to create the maximum value for our shareholders. So, we're going to be -- we're going to continue to be intentional and disciplined in our approach to M&A."", ""But I'd also say that we have and we will continue to look at other mergers and acquisitions in the context of how do they strengthen our competitive position."", 'Sunil Sibal -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst', 'OK. Thanks for that. And then I think in your prepared comments, you mentioned that the growth capex is likely to come down in 2025 and forward years. I was kind of curious if you could, you know, help us think through the, you know, growth capex needs at combined ONEOK now and is there a good way to think about the growth capex or total capex needed to maintain volumes and then to, you know, further on grow volumes?', 'Pierce Norton -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""So, I'll kind of take a high-level cut at that, and then I'll ask either Walt or Sheridan to chime in on this. But one thing that I don't know if you've picked up on, but Walt just mentioned that we actually have some excess cash of about 20% to 25%. So, there is money out there for these high-return projects that we either are potentially working on or even not identified at this point. So, as far as the specifics go, I'll kind of turn it over to Walt and Sheridan."", 'Walt Hulse -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Well, I think, you know, as we mentioned here in 2024, we've identified a midpoint of 1.85 billion. You know, we have some pretty large projects in there with the MB-6 being the largest and then the completion of the West Texas LPG expansion and then the completion of the Bakken expansion, which we want to make sure is done here in early 2025. You know, once those projects are done, we don't have any other large identified projects that we've FID for the market. So, you can kind of peel those away as they've come into 2025."", ""Our routine growth type of expenditures will continue, and we will find more opportunities. They're probably just going to be more bite-sized and ones that we can do out of free cash flow and will be ones that are really facilitating and accelerating the synergies that we're looking to achieve in '25 and '26."", 'Sunil Sibal -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.', 'Michael Blum -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', ""Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So, a question on Saguaro. If you FID Saguaro in mid-'24, first of all, would that change the '24 capex number much, or would most of that fall into the '25 and '26, and would that change your expectation that '25 capex would come down?"", 'Pierce Norton -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""I'm going to let Walt kind of take the capex question. But there's a couple of things that I want to make sure that I'd note on this call that pertains to Saguaro, Michael. And one is I want to really thank all those employees who worked on getting the permit approved in this process. And as we look at Saguaro, it is the most economical route for LNG to reach the markets or at least multiple markets."", ""And that's actually been indicated by the strong commercial interest and the backing, you know, by the major players there. And here's where I want to really kind of make this clear is that, you know, we said all along that our commitment to this project will involve procuring the Presidential Permit, which is, as we noted in our script, that is complete; the building of the U.S. portion of the pipe; getting across the border with the pipe; and then the operation of the U.S. pipe."", ""And as far as our financial involvement, that's going to be commensurate with the value that it brings to our shareholders, you know, versus the risk we see in the project. I'll kind of let Walt fill in the some of the details there."", 'Walt Hulse -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yeah. Michael, given the timing, there's not -- if it gets FID midyear, the capital associated with that would not be a material change to 2024. And in 2025 and beyond, I don't think you'll see anything that would change my comment before about seeing a reduction over the 2024 level of capex as we go forward. You know, projects takes a couple of years to construct, and we'll fit right in within our capital program."", 'Michael Blum -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', 'Great. Thanks for that. And then just wanted to ask on the Elk Creek expansion you announced. Maybe you could just help us understand a little bit what the ramp in volumes could look like.', 'Should we expect this to be highly utilized at start-up? You know, like maybe [Technical difficulty] or will this be kind of more of a gradual ramp? Thanks.', 'Sheridan Swords -- Senior Vice President, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Gathering and Processing', ""Well, Michael, and as we think about the Elk Creek expansion, we've always said that we're not going to run out of capacity coming out of the Bakken, and that's why we want to make sure this pipeline comes up in the first quarter of 2025. So, we are expecting volume increases, and we'll need that as we move into 2025. And then there's a lot of things affected on the ramp up. One is how much incentivized ethane we have coming out of there."", ""And if we -- and the other one is the continuing growth in the basin as we've seen gas-to-oil ratios continue to grow, and the drilling activity that we're seeing right now is conducive to increase overall volumes in the basin. So, I think, really, we'll see quite a bit of growth as we move into 2025 on this pipeline with those two backdrops."", 'Michael Blum -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Vrathan Reddy with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.', 'Vrathan Reddy -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', ""Good morning. I appreciate the color you guys provided on producer efficiency in the slides and even in the prepared remarks. It seems like a pretty significant step up there in the share of three-mile laterals in '24. So, just kind of thinking if we should be thinking about the increase in three-mile laterals reducing the required capex to maintain current volumes at this point or any other thoughts you could, you know, frame up there would be greatly appreciated."", 'Sheridan Swords -- Senior Vice President, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Gathering and Processing', 'Yeah. This is Sheridan. Absolutely, with the more efficiency and them drawing three-mile laterals, so each well is going to have more production on that. So, we are going to see a drop off from our previous cadence on capital that we need to spend in the area to maintain volume.', 'And also, remember that in the Bakken, we are guiding a little bit over 1.6 Bcf of throughput and we have 1.9 Bcf of processing capacity up there. So, we have a lot of working leverage to grow in that area. So, we will see our capital come down.', 'Vrathan Reddy -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'Great. And then for the second one, I wanted to hit on Northern Border and just any thoughts you guys could share on how you see dynamics playing out there throughout the year, mainly if we could see any relief on the pipeline once volumes start flowing on Coastal GasLink to service LNG Canada.', 'Chuck Kelley -- Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Pipelines', ""Well, Vrathan, this is Chuck. As far as the Northern Border goes, the volumes that we see coming down there today, I don't think we'll be appreciably impacted come -- with the Canadian volumes diverted to LNG Canada. There's a stronghold of about 400 million a day that's held by long-term producers that will continue to flow down Northern Border. So, the pipe will remain full headed toward Ventura and Chicago."", ""And, you know, there's been some relief in our G&P business. We're working on a deal with WBI to move some gas down to Cheyenne Hub. And that's been a nice relief as well. And you've probably seen some information about Bison Express, which should be coming on in Q2 of 2026."", 'That will offer upwards of another, call it, 400 million a day of relief. So, I think the pipe is positioned well for the next couple of years.', 'Vrathan Reddy -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'Great. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Spiro Dounis with Citi. Please go ahead.', 'Spiro Dounis -- Citi -- Analyst', ""Thanks, operator. Good morning, everybody. Maybe let's go back to a follow-up to Michael's question but really kind of focus on the three major projects you've got coming online in the first quarter of '25. It adds up to about $1.4 billion in capital kind of starting up that quarter."", ""Just curious if you can give us a sense for what the initial return multiple was on those projects and how to think about the EBITDA ramp for all three over '25."", 'Sheridan Swords -- Senior Vice President, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Gathering and Processing', ""Well, I'll take the first part of that. As we look at each one of those projects, as we think about the ramp-up, MB-6 is going to come up full. We will -- because we're having third-party frac capacity today, so it's going to be at a very high operating rate. So, it's going to be a very nice multiple we have on that."", ""As we've said with the West Texas expansion that we are contracting and continue to contract more volume on that to have an acceptable return with a significant amount of upside going forward. So, we're continuing to drive that project's multiple down as we grow on that. The Elk Creek expansion is probably going to be the lowest one on that as we don't need a whole lot of volume to be able to have a very low multiple. And if we would get to the point that we're at a high utilization rate, that multiple will be well below one."", 'Spiro Dounis -- Citi -- Analyst', ""OK. That's helpful. Thanks for that, Sheridan. And maybe going back to the synergies, it sounds like for 2026-plus, you're going to have to develop some new infrastructure to achieve those synergies."", ""Just curious, can you give us a sense for what that looks like? Are these storage tanks? Are these connections within the systems? Just a sense of what you're building out there."", 'Sheridan Swords -- Senior Vice President, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Gathering and Processing', ""Yeah, I think it's going to be all that kind of stuff. It's going to be small -- relatively small capital. It's going to be some connections here, some tanks here, depending all up and down our system. So, it -- some of that will come before '26."", ""But as we continue to look forward to that, we'll be achieving most of it as we head into the '26 time frame."", 'Spiro Dounis -- Citi -- Analyst', ""Great. I'll leave it there. Thanks for the time."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein. Please go ahead.', 'Jean Salisbury -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst', ""Hi. Just a follow-up on the discussion about Northern Border earlier. My understanding from looking at the script is that Canada is actually already at the sort of 300 MMcf/d to 400 MMcf/d that they have directly contracted. Do you think we've hit a limit here on Bakken gas takeaway until the rest of Bison comes on in 2026 and how do you think it plays out?"", 'Chuck Kelley -- Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Pipelines', 'Jean Ann, this is Chuck. I stand by what I said. I really think the 400 million a day will continue to come down Northern Border from the legacy Canadian producers. So, the growth coming out of the Bakken will be absorbed through Bison Express and the WBI expansion.', 'Pierce Norton -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""So, Jean Ann, this is Pierce. Based on what I've seen -- I mean, I actually look at this as well. There is capacity today. So, there's no restrictions today."", ""And if you look at the fact that, you know, there's going to be some natural gas-fired generation facilities that are going to be built in the North Dakota area and you also look at the Bison Express and then you also look at WBI, you know, we're not seeing anything in anywhere in the near future that there's going to be any kind of restrictions on gas takeaway."", 'Walt Hulse -- Chief Financial Officer', ""And while we think that there's plenty of takeaway, do remember that we always have the lever, if we need to, that we can extract more ethane and put it on the NGL pipe to create capacity for natural gas."", 'Jean Salisbury -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst', ""Thank you. That's exactly what I was looking for. And then kind of a follow-up on some of the ethane outlooks that Sheridan was talking about earlier. I think there's not a ton of new ethane demand domestically or exports for a few years from now, but associated gas will likely still grow."", 'In your outlook, does that have the risk of increasing rejection in the Bakken or Mid-Con over the next couple of years and could that be a drag on EBITDA?', 'Sheridan Swords -- Senior Vice President, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Gathering and Processing', ""Potentially, I think when we get out in 2025, we'll see a little bit more of ethane export capability coming online. A lot really depends on how hard the petchems are running on utilization is a big impact on that as well. And then as we think about ethane rejection in recovery across our footprint, a lot depends on what the natural gas price in that area is. We feel that we have a very good opportunity to continue to bring incentivized ethane out of the Bakken just from our fully integrated NGL system and G&P system as well."", ""Mid-Continent may be where we see a little bit of swing, could be a little bit more swing in ethane recovery, but those are at much lower rates than we see coming out of the Bakken. But I think the big thing is going to be is how hard the petchems are -- their utilization rate, and we're seeing, as we move into 2024, they're operating at pretty high levels."", 'Jean Salisbury -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst', ""That's helpful. Thanks for taking my questions."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.', 'Keith Stanley -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst', 'Hi. Good morning. I wanted to start and follow up on Saguaro. And so, if Mexico Pacific declares FID, how are you thinking about DOE risks for that project? I think they need an extension of their in-service deadline for non-FTA exports.', 'How do you mitigate that risk around that issue as it relates to your project and your contracts?', 'Chuck Kelley -- Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Pipelines', ""Keith, this is Chuck. Yeah, as you state, MPL received back in 2019 the first two trains' DOE export approval. And they have adequate time to go ahead and start this project post-FID where that approval is for both FTA and non-FTA countries. So, I feel pretty good, obviously, about Trains 1 and 2."", ""This pause that we're seeing right now impacts their second requested approval, which would be for Train 3. And as you know, we don't know exactly how this is going to play out the balance of the year. So, Trains 1 and 2 post-FID, we feel good about those volumes as we sit here today."", 'Keith Stanley -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst', ""OK. Thank you. And second question, just any updated thoughts on potential to enter the LPG export business and how you're weighing the potential to use Magellan sites or other facilities versus I think there's a greenfield option that you're in the early stages of looking at, too, at Sabine Pass. Just any updated thoughts there?"", 'Sheridan Swords -- Senior Vice President, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Gathering and Processing', ""This is Sheridan. On the LP exports, I think we're in the same spot, or what we can share publicly where we have been for a period of time is you're right, we continue to look at all alternatives that we have. We have a greenfield site, trying to understand if there's a -- some synergies there from a physical standpoint from the Magellan assets, if we could put some on their sites. So, we continue to do that."", ""But right now, as I've said, we see the LPG export as we think something that could enhance our integration, but it's not something we absolutely need as we continue to be able to move our barrels through the market today that has the export capabilities at other facilities."", 'Keith Stanley -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Was there a follow-up to that, Mr. Stanley?', 'Keith Stanley -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst', ""No, that's all. Thank you."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. The next question comes from Theresa Chen with Barclays. Please go ahead.', 'Theresa Chen -- Barclays -- Analyst', 'Good morning. On the refined product side, with the significant swings in Mid-Con versus Gulf Coast product prices thus far into the year, Mid-Con being heavily discounted earlier in the year and then product prices sharply rising after the Whiting outage, has this created opportunities for you to use the Sterling system to ship products southwards when the [Inaudible] was there toward the beginning of the first quarter and also opportunities for more long-haul movements of refined products from the Gulf Coast and Mid-Con on the legacy Magellan assets and incremental earnings as a result.', 'Sheridan Swords -- Senior Vice President, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Gathering and Processing', ""What I'd say is, right now, we're not going to comment specifically on refined products movements on any specific pipeline. What I can say is NGL pipelines have moved refined products here in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. We do see with that movement and the two pricing mechanisms between the Gulf and the group, we have seen opportunity for longer-haul tariffs on our refined products system."", 'Theresa Chen -- Barclays -- Analyst', 'OK. And, Sheridan, going back to the butane blending synergies and your comment about the RVP requirements, so butane blending needing to come out of the gasoline pool in that mid-April time frame. And just given the comments from some of the downstream customers about the lack of octane in the gasoline pool after that switch happens, does this lend to some opportunities for your isobutane volumes as a feedstock for alkylate? Or said differently, does the acquired Magellan refined products assets and your exposure to gasoline floats now more than before, can that create some uplift for the even heavier components of your NGL barrels?', 'Sheridan Swords -- Senior Vice President, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Gathering and Processing', ""Yeah, there could be some potential as we look at, you know, for the natural gasoline component of the barrel, some blending into the unleaded pool that we've looked at. As in terms of isobutane, specifically, going into alkylate, we've been servicing those alkylate units for quite a long time in the legacy NGL business. And typically, as you know, alkylate is very high priced. And usually, they run those pretty strong."", ""The big difference in those alkylate unit is whether or not they're going to run some refinery-grade propylene through that unit or they're going to stay or how they're RGBs, refinery-grade butane, runs through that as well. So, if we see more propylene run through an alkylate unit, we will see a little bit more isobutane being used. But typically, they run pretty steady."", 'Theresa Chen -- Barclays -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Tristan Richardson with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.', 'Tristan Richardson -- Scotiabank -- Analyst', ""Hey. Good morning, guys. Just maybe a question on the West Texas expansion. You've talked a while now about the optionality that you have once the final looping is complete and maybe just a little bit about timing and progress on the decision of what service to put the legacy pipe into."", 'Will that be crude, refined product, or NGLs? And then how readily and quickly you can make that transition?', 'Sheridan Swords -- Senior Vice President, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Gathering and Processing', ""Well, right now, we -- it is an option. We haven't decided to exercise that option. We continue to see good growth on the NGL side. So, there is a good possibility we want to keep it in NGL service to continue to be able to service our downstream assets in the Mont Belvieu area."", ""If we would decide to shift it to some other product, the big thing is going to have to be determined on which way we run it. Obviously, if we want to run it from Mont Belvieu out to West Texas, it will take us a little bit more time because we'll have to do a little bit of work on header systems on that side. If we want another product moving from West Texas into Mont Belvieu, into the Houston area, it would be quicker because the pumps are already set up going that direction. But as of this moment, right now, we're probably leaning more toward the natural gas liquid side of it or the raw feed side of it as we continue to see good growth coming out of the Permian."", 'Tristan Richardson -- Scotiabank -- Analyst', ""Appreciate it, Sheridan. And then maybe for Walt, just curious, you've talked about this in a couple of questions here, but I was thinking about the three major projects coming off in '25 and what that implies for future capex and certainly what that implies for future free cash flow. Can you talk about as we think about '25 and '26, what gets you to maybe the higher end or the lower end of that capital return as a percent, that 75% to 85%?"", 'Walt Hulse -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Well, clearly, with what we have identified today from a capex standpoint, as I said before, that we would expect that capital return to ramp throughout that period. I think that we will be producing a meaningful amount of free cash flow. Obviously, it will increase when our capex number goes down. So, we'll still stay in that 75% to 85% availability after capex."", ""It's just going to be a bigger number. So, it will give us more opportunity for shareholder return."", 'Pierce Norton -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Tristan, this is Pierce. Kind of embedded in your question there is the implication of kind of what drives, you know, our EBITDA, you know, to the higher end, you know, versus the lower end. I think that's probably worth mentioning there. But, you know, filling more of our existing capacity across these assets is going to clearly make that movement up."", ""And we've already mentioned that we want to make sure that we get this piped in by the first quarter of 2025 out of the Bakken and then also to continue to prioritize and execute on those additional -- those connectivities, you know, between our NGL, refined products, and crude oil systems across our footprint. And then third, it's those, you know, quicker-than-forecasted recognition of synergies. And then of course, the downside, you know, would be, you know, things that might impact the volume, which is the weather and the producer activity. All of those kind of go into, you know, how far above or below the midpoint that we might be that impacts what you and Walt just talked about."", 'Tristan Richardson -- Scotiabank -- Analyst', 'Pierce, appreciate it. Thank you all very much.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.', 'Neal Dingmann -- Truist Securities -- Analyst', 'Hi. Morning. Thanks for the time. My first question is on NGL.', ""Specifically, just wondering, where are you all seeing notable demand for your NGL -- the Permian NGL service? Is it mostly in key Midland or Delaware areas? I'm just wondering are there specific areas that we should be looking at there? And then are you all taking market share from Permian contracts rolling off, other pipes, or is this more basin expansion?"", 'Sheridan Swords -- Senior Vice President, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Gathering and Processing', ""Yeah. When we look at the Midland and Delaware, it's more -- as we look about growth to our system, it's more based on the customers out there and who we're seeing and the ones we have lined, and we have some that are more Midland-specific, some that are more Delaware-specific. So, that really depends on who's kind of drilling more, bringing volume to us at the time. We -- in terms of contracts roll off, we've seen a little bit of that."", ""What we've seen a little bit is some taking [Inaudible] coming to us from different customers as we go forward. But overall, we see an opportunity in both of those basins to be able to source NGLs into our system going forward. A lot depends -- and really, a lot depends on the customer."", 'Neal Dingmann -- Truist Securities -- Analyst', ""Got it. Makes sense. OK. And then just a quick follow-up on like that Slide 10 that shows the synergy opportunities, I'm just wondering, on batch -- in the batching upside that you laid out here on this slide, just wondering timing-wise, how quickly, I'm just wondering, are you thinking and are there key areas that you anticipate seeing the majority of that batching upside?"", 'Sheridan Swords -- Senior Vice President, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Gathering and Processing', ""Well, on that batching, I think we're really going to see a lot of it throughout our system. Some of it is already happening today. Some of it will happen throughout 2024. Those are opportunities that we see where we already have some connectivity between the system."", ""And then that will continue to grow through '25 and '26 as we continue to bring these assets together. But we see that opportunity in the central system. We see that opportunity on the Gulf Coast. We see that opportunity even as much as on the lines out to West Texas."", 'Neal Dingmann -- Truist Securities -- Analyst', 'Thank you and look forward to the upside.', 'Operator', 'The next question comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.', 'Craig Shere -- Tuohy Brothers -- Analyst', 'Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. On capex opportunities, could you opine on the possibility of needing another frac by 2026 and does the MMP acquisition increase prospects for accretively rebuilding and/or repurposing the legacy Medford frac site?', 'Sheridan Swords -- Senior Vice President, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Gathering and Processing', ""This is Sheridan. Yeah, I don't think the MMP affects -- really affects Medford at all, what we have there. As we think about increased frac capacity and our needs there, really, what we're looking at right now is bottlenecks throughout our system where we can get very low-cost expansions through our existing fracs. And we continue to look at Medford and what type of capacity we could get out of Medford at a very low cost by only bringing parts of it -- portions of it back up."", ""The whole facility wasn't as damaged by the fire as certain parts. So, we think there is an opportunity to have a little bit less capacity there at a very low dollar per barrel of capacity. So, that's where we see our next, really, growth in fractionation capacity coming from, and we really don't see the MMP acquisition having a big impact to that."", 'Craig Shere -- Tuohy Brothers -- Analyst', 'Great. And last question, on synergies, it sounds like you expect almost the full 100 million or so in G&A benefits in 2024, which would suggest that, you know, you might be being conservative on the commercial side. Is that a fair assessment?', 'Kevin Burdick -- Executive Vice President, Chief Enterprise Services', ""Craig, it's Kevin. Like we said, I mean, we feel -- obviously, we feel really good about our progress we've made on the cost savings side. I think just kind of naturally, many of those synergies come quicker than the commercial. We continue to prioritize those."", ""You know, we did add kind of a hundred-plus to the upside for the cost savings side. So, we'll continue to work on those. But we're just trying to send the message that, particularly in '24, there is a good chunk of the synergies that are going to be cost savings."", 'Craig Shere -- Tuohy Brothers -- Analyst', 'OK. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'And the last question comes from Zack Van Everen with TPH. Please go ahead.', 'Zack Van Everen -- Tudor, Pickering, Holt and Company -- Analyst', 'Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just going back up to the Rockies growth, you noted 9% year over year in 2024, but it looks like NGL growth is a bit lower than that for the year. Is a majority of that the contract rolls on Overland? Are you expecting just less overall ethane recovery? Just trying to kind of put those two numbers together.', 'Sheridan Swords -- Senior Vice President, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Gathering and Processing', 'Yeah. The -- on the NGL growth, we are expecting less or we have put in our guidance less incentivized ethane coming out of the Bakken. We definitely think there could be some upside there. So, that has an impact.', ""And then the contract that we will no longer be getting volume off of Overland Pass is a very low-margin, very kind of high-volume contract that has an impact that we haven't been expecting that contract or we knew we were not going to be moving forward to renewing that contract when it came up. So, this is something that's been in our plan for a period of time. So, that's what's kind of driving a little bit of the difference when you look at the growth on G&P versus the growth on NGLs."", 'Zack Van Everen -- Tudor, Pickering, Holt and Company -- Analyst', 'Gotcha. That makes sense. And then shifting over to the rate adjustments in July, you noted mid-single digits. Just looking at the FERC-regulated calculation trending toward 1.5%, kind of hints at, you know, higher market-based adjustments.', 'Curious if you get any pushback from customers on that or just how that conversation is going overall.', 'Sheridan Swords -- Senior Vice President, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Gathering and Processing', ""We haven't decided what we're going to do on market-based rate adjustments, but we do look at it very extensively at each one of our locations and do an extensive look at the market and what's appropriate in those locations. And that's why we've kind of just given a mid -- you know, a single digit -- mid-single digit rate is what we think it will be. But we have not yet determined exactly what we're going to do.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Performing Dividend Stocks To Invest In Now.\xa0', ""For investors focused on dividends, there's an ongoing struggle to find the right balance between dividend growth and dividend yield. While many experts caution against falling into yield traps, historical data suggests that high-yield stocks have performed well. However, combining both dividend growth and high yield can be a powerful strategy to maximize returns. One example is the S&P Sector-Neutral High Yield Dividend Aristocrats (HYDA) index, which aims to blend dividend growth with higher relative yield while maintaining sector weights similar to the S&P Composite 1500. This index is noted for its defensive characteristics. According to a report from S&P Dow Jones Indices, it has historically provided a buffer against market volatility. On average, the index has outperformed the benchmark when the VIX level, a measure of market volatility, was above 20, with the strongest outperformance seen when the VIX level was above 30. The report further noted that from January 31, 2005, to July 31, 2023, the index's overall return was nearly the same as the benchmark. That said, the S&P Sector-Neutral HYDA showed lower volatility throughout the entire period compared to the benchmark, resulting in better risk-adjusted returns. Moreover, the maximum drawdown experienced during that time frame was reduced by around 5%, indicating a more resilient performance during market downturns."", ""Given investors' preference for dividend-paying stocks and their track record of returns, numerous companies are striving to initiate, sustain, and enhance their dividend payouts. In a notable recent development, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has commenced paying a quarterly cash dividend to its shareholders. This move underscores the increasing popularity of dividends in the market. Notably, Morningstar analysts have observed a significant rise in the funds targeting dividend-paying stocks, with the total amount reaching $1 trillion. This figure has been growing at a rate of 10% annually since 2018, indicating a robust and expanding interest in dividend investments."", 'Dividend stocks have consistently gained traction due to their resilience and strong performance during previous periods of inflation. Over time, dividends have been a significant contributor, comprising approximately 40% of the total return of the S&P 500 since 1930. However, during decades characterized by high inflation rates, such as the 1940s, 1970s, and 1980s, where inflation averaged 5% or more, dividends accounted for an even larger portion, generating 54% of the total return. Naveed Rahman, co-manager of the Fidelity Equity-Income Strategy, highlighted this trend. He also emphasized that while seeking the best-performing dividend stocks today, investors may need to look beyond the traditional industries or sectors that have historically dominated such investments. The report further noted that companies that consistently pay dividends that are both sustainable and increasing have the capability to expand their cash flows over time, thereby enabling them to stay aligned with inflationary pressures.', 'Walmart Inc.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.', 'While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.', ' See our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive ', ""In fact, the recent sale by Noel Wallace was the biggest sale of Colgate-Palmolive shares made by an insider individual in the last twelve months, according to our records. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$86.41, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was just 3.6% of Noel Wallace's stake."", ""In the last year Colgate-Palmolive insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!"", 'If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.', ""The last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Colgate-Palmolive shares. Specifically, Chairman Noel Wallace ditched US$1.2m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all."", ""Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It appears that Colgate-Palmolive insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$75m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders."", ""An insider hasn't bought Colgate-Palmolive stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. On the plus side, Colgate-Palmolive makes money, and is growing profits. While insiders do own shares, they don't own a heap, and they have been selling. So we'd only buy after careful consideration. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. You'd be interested to know, that we found 2 warning signs for Colgate-Palmolive and we suggest you have a look."", 'If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.', 'For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

These are usually conglomerates that make money operating in a number of businesses (think Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway). The purpose of diversification is to reduce risk by spreading investments across different assets, thereby minimizing the impact of any single stock or sector performing poorly. In 2023, global stock markets experienced significant growth, with particular attention on Wall Street's impressive performance. The U.S. stock market, being the largest globally, notably led the way with remarkable gains. The S&P 500 index surged by 24.2% in 2023 and the Nasdaq index witnessed an outstanding increase of 43.4%, achieving its highest annual gain since 2020. Despite initial expectations, the economy managed to evade a recession, and the stock market rally surpassed many predictions. However, analysts hold divergent views on what lies ahead for the stock market in 2024, offering a mixed outlook for the year."", 'Based on the positive trends observed last year, analysts are optimistic about the stock market\'s prospects for the current year, although they anticipate some minor declines along the way. A report from JP Morgan suggested that due to decreasing inflation in the US and the possibility of the Federal Reserve adopting more relaxed policies, there\'s growing discussion of a ""soft landing"" rather than a severe economic downturn or bear market. Leading indicators point to a slowdown in growth but not a complete collapse. Generally, equity markets tend to hit their lowest point well before economic conditions reach their worst, although there have been exceptions such as during the dot-com cycle. While there\'s still a risk of recession in the upcoming year, the key takeaway is that even if it does happen, it\'s likely to be mild, especially considering the support the Fed is providing to the banking system through increased liquidity. The report further mentioned that in 2023, earnings for the S&P 500 remained stagnant overall. However, they saw a significant increase of 33% for the seven largest companies, while the rest of the S&P 500 experienced a decline of 5%. Looking ahead to 2024, it appears to be a year characterized by slowing GDP growth, single-digit increases in earnings, and single-digit returns for the typical S&P 500 stock.', 'According to analysts at JP Morgan, investors should consider a diversified portfolio consisting of cash, long-term government bonds, high-quality corporate bonds, and equities. They also find the industrial and energy sectors appealing, particularly due to the industrial policies in the US. Analysts express positivity towards the energy sector primarily because it continues to offer attractive opportunities for earnings yield, dividends, and stock buybacks.', ""According to Bloomberg's 2024 Outlook report, numerous analysts are favoring dividend stocks as an investment choice for the current year. The strategists at Capital Group made the following statement:"", '“With investors swept up in the artificial intelligence fervor, valuations for dividend-paying stocks have quietly drifted toward multi-decade lows compared to the broader market. With growth expected to moderate in 2024, and the potential for recession lingering, dividends may take a more prominent role in driving total returns for investors.”', ""As previously stated, diversified companies play a crucial role in reducing risk. By investing in a diversified portfolio of dividend-paying companies across various sectors, investors can spread their risk and reduce exposure to any single company or industry's performance. Furthermore, dividend-paying companies tend to be more mature and financially sound, as they prioritize returning profits to shareholders. General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are some of the best diversified dividend stocks among others that are discussed below."", 'Photo by Sharon McCutcheon on Unsplash', 'Our Methodology:', 'For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of Q4 2023 and selected conglomerate firms that specialize in several different businesses and pay regular dividends to shareholders.

In 2022, the Justice Department under President Joe Biden ended Trump’s “China Initiative” after it came under intense criticism for fanning discrimination against Asian-Americans — even while pressing forward with the Fujian Jinhua prosecution.', 'While Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping have generally sought to stabilize relations that had deteriorated over espionage concerns and other issues — including at a November face-to-face summit during an Asia-Pacific conference in San Francisco — the world’s biggest economies continue to vie for tech supremacy.', 'Micron, meanwhile, appears to have attempted to pacify Beijing, including promising to invest another 4.3 billion yuan in its Chinese chip-packaging plant and sending Chief Executive Officer Sanjay Mehrotra to visit China.', 'The December settlement between the Idaho company and Fujian Jinhua came after the Chinese government in May barred Micron’s chips from “critical infrastructure” over cybersecurity concerns. Meanwhile, the US has worked with allies to prevent Beijing from obtaining the most advanced semiconductors and the latest chipmaking technologies.', 'DRAM Chips', 'The chips that were at issue in the Fujian Jinhua trial are dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, not the semiconductors that held up shipments of a wide range of products including cars and smartphones during a global supply shortage.', 'In 2018, Fujian Jinhua’s $6 billion plant was within months of full-scale DRAM production — a critical step toward ending China’s reliance at the time on $380 billion of annual chip imports.', 'That’s when the Commerce Department put Fujian Jinhua on its so-called Entity List for engaging in activities contrary to US interests and filed the criminal case in San Francisco. The move by the Commerce Department blocked the company’s purchases of chipmaking gear, and stirred an exodus of American and European suppliers and engineers from Jinjiang, where Fujian Jinhua is based on the southeastern coast of China.', 'Prosecutors claimed that Fujian Jinhua’s then-president orchestrated an illegal transfer of Micron’s memory design in a deal between his company and UMC. He was accused of conspiring with two other Taiwanese engineers who previously worked for Micron before moving to UMC.', 'While all three were charged as defendants in the case and the US issued warrants for their arrest in 2020, they never appeared for proceedings in the San Francisco court. The US doesn’t have extradition treaties with Taiwan or China.', 'During the years the case was pending, Fujian Jinhua complained that the US prosecution was hobbling China’s aspirations of mass producing memory chips. The company argued its very existence was threatened by the 2018 blacklisting, blocking its ability to buy US chipmaking gear and cratering its production plans.', 'In August, the leading association of global chip companies warned that Huawei Technologies Co. — which landed on the Commerce Department Entity List in 2019 — was building a collection of secret semiconductor-fabrication facilities across China and said that Fujian Jinhua was part of Huawei’s network.', '(Updates with Micron comment.)', 'Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek', 'The Monaco Royals Whose Deals Have Brought Peril to the Palace Doors', 'Chocolate Makers Try a New Recipe: Less Chocolate', 'Top Takeaways From Businessweek’s Investigation Into Monaco’s Royal Family', 'China’s Piano Dreams Are Fading for a Cash-Strapped Middle Class', 'Robotics Startups Hope the AI Era Means Their Time Has Come', '©2024 Bloomberg L.P.']"

To skip our detailed analysis of the financial sector, you can go directly to see 5 Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.', 'The financial sector went through a good amount of volatility last year, and many are now beginning to wonder whether the volatility will continue in 2024. No one can fully predict the likelihood of this happening, and yet for some, it may not be an unlikely development. However, this January, CEOs from major big banks made statements highlighting their hopes for the financial sector in 2024, particularly for big banks, in the event of a Federal Reserve ""pivot"" on their interest rate hikes.', 'On January 20, CNBC\'s ""Power Lunch"" highlighted some statements made by several big bank CEOs on this matter. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\'s (NYSE:GS) CEO, David Solomon, made the following comments:', '""It\'s hard for me to see the market\'s view of seven cuts this year. I do think there\'s a reasonable possibility of some interest rate cuts and some easing. But it\'s really gonna be dependent on what the data says and how the economy transmits through the year.""', ""Morgan Stanley's (NYSE:MS) CEO, Ted Pick, also made a few comments on the subject:"", '""I do think we are probably past peak inflation. What\'s interesting though is that it is not inconceivable that we have to go faster, i.e., 50 basis points, if you sort of price that as 5% or 10%.""', 'Huntington Bancshares CEO, Steve Steinour, joined CNBC\'s ""Power Lunch"" on January 20 to discuss the above as well. On the impact of rate cuts on the financial sector, Steinour made the following comments:', '""If it\'s three or four cuts, it\'s helpful. If it\'s six or seven, that might imply a soft economy and that would not be helpful to us or anyone else. But we model it both ways, and in either direction, we\'ve got a very tight net interest margin - part of that through hedging.""', ""These observations brought Steinour to several conclusions, the most important one being that in the light of a Fed pivot, big banks will gain confidence in loaning to the general public. Generally speaking, Steinour believes that business is good in the banking sector so far this year. He noted that on multiple indicator fronts, including housing prices, things are continuing to look good, the consumer is still seen to be reasonably strong, and businesses are continuing to have a good year. The Federal Reserve's rate pivot in this atmosphere is thus considered to be helpful."", 'Considering these observations, investors in the financial sector can expect financial stocks, including big bank stocks, to have a strong start to the year.

PayPal’s branded checkout remains the largest volume and profit driver for the business, and we expect this to continue to track in-line with e-commerce growth in the near term, and eventually take share as the Company rolls out new features to its over +400 million users and +30 million merchants.

GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with FIS.', ""On February 26, 2024, Fidelity National Information Services Inc (NYSE:FIS) filed its annual 10-K report, providing a detailed overview of its financial performance and strategic direction. As a leading global provider of financial services technology, FIS has expanded its operations through strategic acquisitions, such as Sungard in 2015 and Worldpay in 2019. The company's revenue streams are diverse, with a significant portion generated outside North America. The recent sale of a 55% equity interest in its Worldpay Merchant Solutions business has reshaped its investment profile, retaining a 45% stake in the joint venture. FIS's financial tables reveal a robust business model with recurring revenue streams, particularly from its Banking Solutions segment, which offers integrated solutions characterized by multi-year processing contracts."", ""Brand Recognition and Market Leadership: FIS's brand is synonymous with innovation and thought leadership in the financial services sector. The company's inclusion in the Fortune 500 and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index underscores its market prominence. With a market capitalization of over $32 billion as of June 30, 2023, FIS commands significant investor confidence. Its brand strength is further reinforced by its comprehensive portfolio of financial technology solutions, which cater to a wide array of clients, including financial institutions, businesses, and developers."", ""Diverse and Recurring Revenue Streams: FIS's financial stability is bolstered by its diverse revenue streams, particularly from the Banking Solutions segment. This segment's focus on multi-year processing contracts provides a predictable and stable cash flow, enabling sustained investments in innovation and compliance. The company's ability to bundle services and offer tailored solutions has led to high client retention rates and opportunities for cross-selling, which are critical for long-term growth."", 'Complexity of Integration and Transformation: The integration of acquired companies, such as Sungard and Worldpay, presents challenges in terms of system compatibility and cultural alignment. While FIS has successfully managed these integrations, the complexity of such processes can lead to operational disruptions and increased costs. The ongoing platform modernization efforts, as indicated in the financial statements, require significant investments and carry the risk of execution delays or budget overruns.', 'Regulatory Compliance Burden: FIS operates in a highly regulated environment, with stringent requirements across federal, state, and international jurisdictions. Compliance with a broad range of regulations, including data protection and anti-money laundering laws, necessitates substantial resources and continuous monitoring. Any lapses in compliance could result in reputational damage, financial penalties, and a loss of client trust.', ""Expansion into Emerging Markets: FIS's global distribution and scale position it well to tap into emerging markets, where financial technology adoption is accelerating. The company's extensive domain expertise and portfolio breadth allow it to tailor solutions to the unique needs of these markets, driving potential revenue growth and diversifying its client base further."", ""Innovation in Digital Payments: The shift towards digital payments presents significant growth opportunities for FIS. The company's focus on modern and cloud-based technologies, coupled with its ability to innovate and scale digital payment solutions, positions it to capture a larger share of the growing digital payments market, both in retail and commercial sectors."", ""Intense Competition: The financial technology sector is highly competitive, with numerous players ranging from established firms to emerging innovators. FIS faces competition across its solution offerings, markets, and geographies. Competitors with greater financial, sales, and marketing resources could challenge FIS's market position, particularly in areas such as digital banking and payment solutions."", ""Technological Disruption: Rapid technological advancements pose a threat to FIS's existing solutions and market share.

You can skip our detailed analysis and go directly to the 5 Safest Countries That Give Citizenship by Buying Real Estate.', 'Easier movement across countries and greater acceptance of dual citizenship have opened gateways for people of this time. Unprecedented catastrophes, such as the 2008 financial crisis and the recent pandemic, have emphasized the need for hedging against future losses. And who can understand this concept better than investors? Investing in the safest countries that offer citizenship through real estate investment has emerged as one of the most feasible alternatives. This is particularly true for wealthy individuals who can afford various types of citizenship programs. It has come to notice that about 90% of the world’s millionaires have achieved their current standing by investing in real estate.', 'Not only is investing a great financial opportunity, but it also brings various benefits associated with citizenship in another country. These investment chances can be availed through either a direct citizenship-by-investment option, which does not require a lot of time, or through a residency program that eventually leads to citizenship in a few years. Investment programs and their terms and conditions vary across countries. Many countries have realized the potential for foreign direct investment that can be attracted through this scheme and, therefore, offer multiple types of investment citizenship or residency. The Caribbean Islands, in particular, have been noted as favorites in this category so far.', 'Real estate investment has always been viewed as one of the less risky avenues. Its significance, however, has increased with rising inflation and the availability of a worldwide pool of opportunities. No longer restricted to the boundaries of just one country, real estate investment becomes even more alluring with the citizenship component. Not only can one secure against the time value of money, but the added benefits of another passport or citizenship can greatly enhance overall possibilities. According to research, about 25% to 30% of global property is bought by real estate investors.', 'The global real estate market size in 2022 was recorded at $3,704.02 billion, and with a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 5.32% between 2023 and 2032, it is expected to reach $6,219.88 billion by 2032, per Precedence Research. The Asia-Pacific region accounted for 40% of the revenue in 2022. American Tower Corporation (NYSE: AMT), Prologis, Inc. (NYSE: PLD), and Equinix, Inc.

These datacenters sit on top of the cable infrastructure and house the internet service provider equipment that connects and powers the internet.', 'The company charges tenants rent for colocation space, plus metered power and interconnects utilized. EQIX’s revenue growth is driven by price increases, greater cross-connect utilization, and new data center development.

This process led us to select eight countries. Additionally, we explored residency by real estate programs that eventually lead to citizenship and picked the remaining seven based on their ranking in the Travel Safe-Abroad Safety Index.', 'Note: Antigua and Barbados was not listed on the Travel Safe-Abroad Safety Index, however, we used various other sources to confirm that it is indeed a safe country and also include it in the list.', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

Check out our 30 Safest Countries in the World in 2024, for a detailed outlook on safest countries. The physical presence requirement extends to only 60 days a year in the country, and while the application approval takes about 12-18 months, permanent residency is obtained as soon as the application is approved. The investment amount required is $525,000."", 'As one of the safest countries offering citizenship through real estate investment, Mauritius provides an indirect route through its Permanent Residency Program. Under this plan, an investor can purchase a designated real estate project worth $375,000 and obtain immediate permanent residency. With continuous residence of seven years (or five for Commonwealth citizens), applicants can attain citizenship. Alternatively, a faster scheme involves a higher investment of $500,000, leading to citizenship in two years, though the physical residence requirements are more restrictive in this case. The types of real estate investment include integrated resort schemes, real estate schemes, property development schemes, smart city schemes, invest hotel schemes, and ground plus two apartment schemes. While dual citizenship is recognized, applicants must demonstrate proficiency in either English, French, or a local language.', 'A real estate investment program is available for individuals desiring residency and, ultimately, citizenship in this safe country. Investors can participate in this program in three ways. Firstly, by making a minimum investment of $280,000 and maintaining ownership, one can obtain a three-year residency permit, which is also renewable. Another option is to invest $425,000 and gain a five-year residency permit. In the third scenario, an $850,000 investment would lead to an indefinite residency permit without any renewal requirements. Five years of residency make one eligible for citizenship.', 'South Korea’s Immigrant Investor Scheme for Real Estate (IISRE) is an initiative by the Korean government to attract foreign investors to the country and encourage them to pursue citizenship. Although considered an expensive option, the scheme allows for permanent residency within five years and eligibility for citizenship application. The entire citizenship process takes 5-6 years, and applicants must demonstrate proficiency in the Korean language. The program requires an investment in hospitality real estate, including condominiums, hotels, golf resorts, villas, and similar categories in selected investment areas. The investment entails a minimum purchase of qualifying real estate for KRW 1 billion (approximately $750,000). Investors of any age can acquire this real estate and obtain temporary residency, known as F-2.', 'As one of the safest countries worldwide, Spain offers a Golden Visa Plan for permanent residency through real estate investment. This option requires a €500,000 investment in real estate on the open market. The period for obtaining permanent residency is five years, and for citizenship, it is 10 years. However, for certain nationalities and ethnic groups, the 10-year requirement is reduced to just two years.', 'For individuals aspiring to obtain residency or citizenship in Monaco, there is an investment opportunity in real estate, albeit not a direct citizenship route. However, this path is not only expensive, but the country also does not allow dual citizenship. The option involves a property purchase of €500,000 and an additional €500,000 bank deposit to establish financial independence. This aids in obtaining a permanent residency card (Carte de Sejour). To become eligible for the country’s citizenship, one must reside continuously in Monaco for 10 years and maintain a clean criminal record.', ""Another safe country offering a residency program that leads to citizenship is Bermuda. Through their Economic Investment Certificate Program, which requires a substantial investment of $2.5 million in various forms, including residential or commercial real estate, investors can attain permanent residency in five years. Furthermore, individuals who are not absent for more than 450 days in the five-year period and are present in the country for the last year preceding the application become eligible for British Overseas Territories citizenship. The investor's spouse and children under 18 are automatically included, and those in the 18-25 age bracket may also be included, provided they are studying in a higher education institution."", ""Turkey's citizenship by investment program stands as one of the most popular citizenship routes globally, with over 13,000 applicants and their families seizing this opportunity. Among the various options available, the real estate route requires a minimum purchase of $400,000, with no specification regarding the property type. Following the purchase, a residence permit application is submitted, and after the completion of all relevant paperwork, a review is carried out, which may include an interview. Typically, it takes about 3-4 months for citizenship to be granted. The inclusion of a spouse and children under 18 is automatic, and the property must be held for at least three years after obtaining citizenship."", 'To encourage foreign investment, the government of yet another safe country offers a direct citizenship-by-investment route, which includes real estate as an option. Initiated in 2018, the program allows investors to participate by investing a minimum of $750,000. Additional requirements include passing a background check and providing financial proof. After qualifying for the program, applicants and their families (spouse and children) can also apply for citizenship, typically granted in about six months.', 'While Saint Kitts and Nevis boast the oldest citizenship-by-investment programs in the Caribbean Islands, Saint Lucia is the youngest. Investors can obtain citizenship in this beautiful country in just about 3-6 months by simply investing about $200,000 in a government-approved real estate project.

The firm is positive on the company's economies of scale, early entry into the pizza delivery business and prospects for growth in international and domestic markets."", 'Piper Sandler upgraded Unity (U) to Neutral from Underweight with a price target of $30, down from $35. The firm says the 19% after-hours selloff creates a more balanced risk/reward profile.', ""BofA double upgraded Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) to Buy from Underperform with a price target of $70, up from $30, citing a raised 2025 EPS estimate and a higher multiple to reflect Sprouts' shift to a higher store growth rate and higher sustained gross margin outlook."", 'Wells Fargo upgraded Kroger (KR) to Equal Weight from Underweight with a price target of $50, up from $42.

While sales growth may slow down this year compared to 2023, the overall trajectory remains positive, benefiting industry giants. Additionally, the cost of vehicle financing is projected to decrease. Despite the slower-than-expected adoption of electric vehicles, sales are anticipated to surpass 2023 levels. Overall, industry sentiment is upbeat, with top-ranked stocks such as General Motors GM and PACCAR PCAR positioned as attractive options to capitalize on the industry's strengths."", 'Industry Overview', 'The Zacks\xa0Domestic Auto\xa0industry includes companies that are engaged in designing, manufacturing and retailing vehicles across the globe. These include passenger cars, crossover vehicles, sport utility vehicles, trucks, vans, motorcycles and electric vehicles. The industry — which is highly consumer cyclic and provides employment to a large number of people — is at the forefront of innovation, courtesy of its nature and the transformation that it is going through. The widespread usage of technology and rapid digitization are resulting in the fundamental restructuring of the automotive market. Several companies in the industry have engine and transmission plants and conduct research and development, and testing of electric and autonomous vehicles.', 'Key Investing Themes', 'Sales to Continue Upward Trajectory Albeit at a Slower Pace: New vehicle sales in the United States reached their highest levels in 2023 since 2019 thanks to\xa0pent-up demand, improved inventories, attractive incentives and a rise in fleet sales.\xa0While sales are expected to rise in 2024 as well, the growth rate is expected to decelerate, as much of the pent-up demand was largely absorbed in 2023. With the Fed expected to cut rates thrice this year, the cost of vehicle financing is likely to decline, which might help in fueling sales volumes.', 'Easing Supply Chain Issues: Supply chain snarls, an aftermath of COVID-19, have been considerably alleviated. New vehicle inventory has sharply rebounded. Per J.D. Power and GlobalData estimates, inventory levels were at about 1.6 million vehicles at the end of last month, a 3.3% increase from December and a 38% jump from January 2023. Cox Automotive expects new vehicle inventory to return to pre-pandemic levels in 2024, reaching almost 3 million units, tripling the quantity during the chip shortage. Ample inventory will result in enhanced incentives and discounts for consumers, helping to stabilize vehicle prices and reduce affordability concerns.', 'E-Mobility Growth Amid Challenges: The outlook for the EV industry remains promising but nuanced. While demand for EVs is on the rise, achieving higher sales will require concerted efforts from dealers and manufacturers. Despite initial optimism, the shift from lofty expectations to realistic projections reflects the slower-than-anticipated pace of customer acceptance. Consequently, some major automakers are revising their ambitious EV plans. However, the industry is poised for expansion in 2024, with an increasing variety of EV models, higher incentives, discounts, advertising and sales initiatives. Cox Automotive forecasts EV sales in the United States to surpass the 1 million unit milestone achieved in 2023. This signals a continued momentum toward electrification, albeit with an understanding that overcoming consumer hesitancy remains a key challenge.', 'Encouraging Zacks Industry Rank ', 'The Zacks Automotive – Domestic industry is part of the broader Zacks\xa0Auto-Tires-Trucks\xa0sector.

Target projects revenue will decline again in the fourth quarter by mid-single digits. The adjusted EPS range is $1.90 to $2.60 compared to an adjusted EPS of $1.89 during the same period last year.

He was born in 1930 and bought his first stock at age 11. By 1965, he was running his own investment company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B).', 'Buffett remains at the helm of Berkshire today. It has amassed an expansive portfolio that includes several wholly owned private companies, and 47 publicly traded stocks and securities.', ""Berkshire's largest holding is Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which became the world's first $1 trillion company in 2018. That rare milestone has since been achieved by five other technology giants: Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Nvidia, and Meta Platforms."", ""Berkshire could be the first U.S. company outside the tech sector to join the $1 trillion club. Its stock has delivered a mammoth 4,384,748% gain since 1965, carrying the company to a valuation of almost $900 billion. Here's why it could cross the trillion-dollar milestone as soon as this year."", 'Buffett is all about value investing. He likes to buy great businesses at a fair price -- though the cheaper the better -- with the intention of holding on to them for the long term. He looks for companies generating a steady profit, combined with consistent revenue growth and strong management teams. He especially likes companies that return money to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.', ""Buffett's most powerful weapon is time. He's a big advocate for compound interest, which is responsible for building most of his wealth. For example, Berkshire spent $1.3 billion accumulating shares of Coca-Cola\xa0between 1988 and 1994. Today, that position is worth $24.4 billion -- but it also paid Berkshire $736 million in dividends in 2023."", ""In other words, Berkshire recoups its initial Coca-Cola investment in dividends alone every two years. But that's just one of the conglomerate's many success stories."", 'Berkshire was a textiles company on the brink of failure before Buffett stepped in and bought it in 1965. He quickly realized its core business was no longer viable, so he transformed it into a holding company to house various investments.', 'Berkshire now has a full ownership stake in a number of famous businesses including Dairy Queen, Duracell, and GEICO. Plus, its portfolio of publicly traded stocks and securities is worth $371.9 billion, a sizable portion of which is attributable to one stock: Apple.', ""Berkshire first bought Apple stock in 2016 and it has steadily increased the size of its position over time, spending around $38 billion in total. That single holding is worth $165.3 billion as of this writing, accounting for 44% of the total value of Berkshire's portfolio of publicly traded securities."", ""Bank of America and American Express are Berkshire's second- and third-largest holdings, respectively. Last year, Berkshire received more than $2.1 billion in dividends from its top three positions alone."", ""Berkshire owns smaller positions in energy companies like Chevron and Occidental Petroleum. Plus, if owning American Express wasn't enough, its portfolio also includes the two other major credit card companies, Visa and Mastercard."", 'While Buffett is known to avoid most technology stocks, Berkshire has accumulated small positions in Amazon and cloud computing company Snowflake.', 'As I touched on at the top, Berkshire stock has delivered a whopping 4,384,748% gain since 1965, or 19.8% compounded annually. That trounces the 31,223% gain in the benchmark S&P 500 index over the same period, which translates to just 10.2% compounded annually.', 'The difference is staggering in dollar terms. A mere $1,000 invested in Berkshire stock in 1965 would be worth $48.4 million today. The same investment in the S&P 500 would be worth just $313,230.', ""The conglomerate has the financial results to back up those substantial gains. It generated $49.3 million in revenue in 1965, and in 2023, that number was a record-high $364.4 billion. Over $155.6 billion came from sales and services across the various businesses under Berkshire's umbrella, with a further $83.4 billion coming from its insurance businesses. Its railroad, utility, and energy interests contributed $101.4 billion."", 'Berkshire also delivered a record profit last year, with a net income of $96.2 billion. That compares to just $2.3 million in net income in 1965.', 'With a market capitalization of almost $900 billion as of this writing, Berkshire stock only needs a gain of about 11% from here to cross the $1 trillion milestone. Considering its 58-year track record of delivering 19.8% annual returns, on average, it appears sure to get there in 2024.', ""A number of factors will probably work in the conglomerate's favor as the year progresses. The stock market is at an all-time high right now, and most Wall Street analysts predict it will continue to move higher. Plus, Berkshire could earn record dividends in 2024 because companies like Apple, Coca-Cola, and American Express continue to increase their payouts."", ""In the broader economy, the U.S. Federal Reserve estimates it will cut interest rates three times in 2024, which will serve as a tailwind for Berkshire's consumer-focused businesses. Its transport and logistics businesses would also benefit if rate cuts drive more economic activity."", ""Finally, Buffett continues to believe in the conglomerate's prospects because he authorized the repurchase of almost $9.2 billion worth of Berkshire's shares in 2023. Buffett has overseen $73.6 billion worth of share repurchases during the last five years alone, which is more than he has deployed into any other stock."", 'Buffett recently told investors that Berkshire\'s enormous size will prevent it from generating ""eye-popping performance"" in the future, but based on its share repurchases, it\'s clear he still feels Berkshire stock is the best bet he can make in the world.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

Regardless, the ROE is not expected to change much for the company despite the lower expected payout ratio."", ""In total, we are pretty happy with Pentair's performance.

Despite the deal’s threat to his own company, the longtime finance industry veteran said he was “not worried about it really.”', 'Yet Capital One’s $35 billion acquisition of Discover would allow it to supplant JPMorgan Chase as the largest credit card issuer in the country, and give it access to the lucrative fees Discover’s network charges to facilitate transactions with merchants. It would also allow Capital One to cut costs by shifting some debit and credit transactions to Discover’s payments network.', 'When asked about the implications of JPMorgan being replaced as the top credit card issuer, Dimon said that would only be the case, “for now.”', 'Still, he added that if the deal went through it would give Capital One an unfair advantage when it comes to debit cards.', 'Thanks to an exception in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act created for companies like Discover and American Express that issue credit cards and deal directly with merchants, post-merger, Capital One would be allowed to jack up the fees charged to merchants to use Discover debit cards while banks like JPMorgan are more limited as a result of the law.', '“Of course I have a problem with that,” Dimon said. “Why should they be allowed to price debit different than we price debit just because of a law that was passed?”', 'Showing no fear of competition, Dimon added that regulators shouldn’t stand in the way of more mergers in the financial sector.', '“I think they should allow some of these smaller banks to merge,” he said. “If that’s how they think they can best compete with JPMorgan, you should let them.”', 'But while JPMorgan’s top boss seems fine with the tie-up of Capital One and Discover, lawmakers are fiercely opposed to the proposal. On Sunday, 13 Democrats led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) signed an open letter urging President Biden to block the deal because it would be bad for consumers. On the other side of the aisle, last week Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) also came out against the deal in a letter to Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, who leads the antitrust division.', 'Jamie Dimon’s career', 'The 67-year-old’s long track record of success at the helm of JPMorgan shows why he’s not worried about the threat of Capital One’s tie-up with Discover.', 'Dimon is well versed in financial industry acquisitions. His tenure at JPMorgan itself came about as a result of the bank’s merger with Bank One Corp., where he was chairman and CEO. And before that he helped guide several acquisitions as chief financial officer and later president of Commercial Credit, including its acquisition of Travelers Group in 1993. He served as president of Citigroup after the $70 billion merger between Travelers Group and Citicorp in 1998.', 'After becoming CEO of JPMorgan in 2006, Dimon helped navigate the bank through the 2008 financial crisis, offloading billions of dollars in subprime mortgages that allowed the company to weather the turmoil better than other competitors.', 'More recently, Dimon led JPMorgan to its seventh consecutive quarter of record net interest income and clinched the title for the most profitable year on record for a U.S. bank in 2023.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

Elizabeth Warren, D-MA, called out the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for talking tough with regard to bank mergers and acquisitions but, in her view, failing to follow through.', 'Warren and 12 congressional Democrats wrote Acting Comptroller Michael Hsu and the Federal Reserve’s vice chair for supervision, Michael Barr, urging the regulators to block Capital One’s proposed $35.3 billion acquisition of Discover on the grounds that it would reduce competition — and, with it, take away card issuers’ incentives to offer customers favorable terms.', 'Warren and the co-signers also asked Hsu to strengthen a policy statement the OCC issued last month that aimed to give more transparency into how merger applications are considered and which factors add up to approval.', 'The proposal would do away with a 1996 OCC rule dictating that bank deals are deemed approved by the OCC on the 15th day after the end of the comment period, unless the agency removes the filing from expedited processing.', '“One risk is that we approve too many mergers and therefore we’re approving bad mergers. The other risk is we approve too few mergers and therefore there are good mergers that should happen that aren’t,” Hsu told Reuters last month. “The purpose of being transparent is to encourage more accuracy on both ends.”', 'Warren, however, argued the OCC’s “actions fly in the face of these concerns.”', '“The agency approved almost every merger application it received in the last three years: 43 mergers in 2021, 30 in 2022, and 23 in 2023,” including JPMorgan Chase’s acquisition last year of First Republic, she wrote.', 'The policy statement, she added, “essentially codifies the OCC’s current, permissive approach to bank mergers — the same standard operating procedure that for decades has failed to protect consumer and the financial system.”', 'This is hardly the first eight-figure proposed bank deal against which Warren has spoken out. Warren in June 2022,\xa0urged the OCC to block TD’s proposed $13.4 billion acquisition of First Horizon, citing a Capitol Forum report that alleged TD incentivized employees to enroll customers in new accounts and services like overdraft protection without their consent. TD and First Horizon terminated the deal over “uncertainty” as to whether or when the tie-up would gain U.S. regulators’ approval.', 'The U.S.’s preeminent bank CEO, JPMorgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon, advocated Monday for Capital One to get a fair shake.', '“My view is, let them compete,” Dimon told CNBC. “Let them try, and if we think it’s unfair, we’ll complain about that.”', 'If the acquisition is approved, Capital One would surpass JPMorgan as the nation’s largest credit card lender.', 'Approval, in Dimon’s eyes, would also mean Capital One would have an “unfair advantage versus us” in debit payments because the Durbin Amendment limits debit fees for large banks, but not card companies like Discover.', '“Of course, I have a problem with that,” Dimon told CNBC. “You know, like why should they be allowed to price debit different than we price debit just because of a law that was passed?”', 'Warren, meanwhile, went on to list further objections to a Capital One-Discover tie-up, including each company’s past transgressions. She noted the 2019 breach of Capital One customer data by a former employee of the bank’s cloud provider, Amazon Web Services. Warren also pointed to the October consent agreement Discover reached with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. over shortcomings in the card network’s compliance management system.', 'Warren also noted a report another regulator, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, issued this month that found “[n]early half of the largest credit card issuers” — including Capital One — “offer[ed] cards with a maximum purchase [annual percentage rate] over 30%.” Average fees charged by large card issuers are 70% higher than those charged by small institutions, the bureau also found.', 'Warren sought to ensure the OCC’s stance matched President Joe Biden’s 2021 executive order aiming to provide “more robust scrutiny” of bank mergers. She cited Capital One-Discover as “one of the most important tests” of that effort.', 'Hsu, for his part last month, said “merger applications exist along a spectrum.”', '“Some have significant deficiencies. Others are straightforward because the acquiring bank is a model of safety and soundness and has earned the trust of the community and its supervisors,” he said. “The majority lie somewhere in between and require varying degrees of scrutiny and multiple rounds of inquiry.”', 'The Capital One-Discover proposal, Warren argued Sunday, “has significant deficiencies.”', 'This story was originally published on Banking Dive.

The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$932.0m', 'US$1.06b', 'US$1.16b', 'US$1.20b', 'US$1.22b', 'US$1.24b', 'US$1.27b', 'US$1.29b', 'US$1.32b', 'US$1.35b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x9', 'Analyst x9', 'Analyst x6', 'Analyst x3', 'Analyst x1', 'Est @ 1.75%', 'Est @ 1.91%', 'Est @ 2.03%', 'Est @ 2.10%', 'Est @ 2.16%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.1% ', 'US$878', 'US$939', 'US$973', 'US$947', 'US$907', 'US$870', 'US$836', 'US$804', 'US$773', 'US$745', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$8.7b', ""The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage.

Given that we are looking at Textron as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.828. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

Boychuk and two Ancora-nominated board candidates have experience running PSR systems.', 'PSR is a strategy that involves consolidating rail networks through the use of point-to-point delivery tactics and consistent departure schedules, along with staff reductions and longer trains—ultimately with the goal of boosting service and profit. Norfolk Southern had planted the seeds to run PSR from 2020 to 2022, before reneging on the model.', 'But PSR has been controversial among workers in the field, with Gross noting that it has not been beneficial to intermodal volumes, which have dropped since 2019 nationwide, after most major rail companies adopted the system.', '“A lot of trimming occurred in the industry,” Gross told Sourcing Journal. “What PSR wants are very large trains running from A to B, with minimal work in the interim, minimal switching—a very low cost, very efficient operation. And that’s a noble goal. But domestic freight doesn’t really behave that way. Domestic, truckload freight is an inherently complex market with lots of lots of lanes, lots of volume moving in all different directions, and very robust service requirements.”', 'Gross called PSR a “reasonably short-term outlook” that values near-term profitability at the expense of long-term growth.', 'Aside from any potential operational changes, Miles also called Ancora’s strategy “short-sighted.” The board chair said in a separate statement that Norfolk Southern’s board determined that none of Ancora’s nominees possess skills or experiences “that are not already well represented among our board nominees.”', 'The two new candidates floated by the railroad operator’s board include Richard H. Anderson, former CEO of American transportation giants Amtrak and Delta Air Lines, and former U.S. Senator Mary Kathryn “Heidi” Heitkamp (D-N.D.).', 'The remaining nominees are current board members.', 'All board members serve one-year terms, with the voting taking place at the company’s annual shareholder meeting.

The company also said it completed more than $1 billion in comprehensive infrastructure improvement projects throughout its 22-state network to further enhance safety and efficiency.', 'Ancora’s push for a new board, CEO and COO comes as Norfolk Southern’s financial performance in some metrics has falling behind some Class I railroad contemporaries. The hedge fund identified one major metric, operating ratio, as a profit killer. Total operating expenses represented 67.4 percent of overall revenue in 2023, far off the Class I average of 61.1 percent.', 'Gross called the metric “the holy grail for Wall Street,” but noted that the focus on operating ratio is misplaced.', '“It’s fairly easy to improve your operating ratio in the near term by cutting costs and raising prices faster than the rate of inflation,” Gross said. “But it’s getting to the point where both of those levers are beginning to become constraints. The revenue from a regulatory standpoint, and the cost just because the low-hanging fruit has been harvested, and it’s becoming more difficult to pull costs out without impacts.”']"

His base salary rose $200,000 to $1.1 million, and his stock and option awards rose $2.2 million to $10 million.', 'Last year was Shaw’s first full year as CEO after starting on May 1, 2022, so part of the increase in compensation can be attributed to having worked more months on the job last year than the year earlier. But he was president of the company in the first four months of 2022, and his promotion to that role in late 2021 had already resulted in his compensation more than doubling in 2022 compared to 2021.', 'The accident on February 3, 2023, did not result in any fatalities, but did cause a massive fire fueled by toxic chemicals and the evacuation of much of the small Ohio town.

Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of €20.1b and earnings per share (EPS) of €4.02 in 2024. The analysts seem to have become a little more negative on the business after the latest results, given the small dip in their earnings per share numbers for next year.', 'It might be a surprise to learn that the consensus price target was broadly unchanged at €68.77, with the analysts clearly implying that the forecast decline in earnings is not expected to have much of an impact on valuation. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. The most optimistic Coca-Cola Europacific Partners analyst has a price target of €79.00 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at €54.00. These price targets show that analysts do have some differing views on the business, but the estimates do not vary enough to suggest to us that some are betting on wild success or utter failure.', ""Looking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. We can infer from the latest estimates that forecasts expect a continuation of Coca-Cola Europacific Partners'historical trends, as the 11% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2024 is roughly in line with the 12% annual growth over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to see their revenues grow 4.6% per year. So it's pretty clear that Coca-Cola Europacific Partners is forecast to grow substantially faster than its industry."", 'The most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results. Happily, there were no major changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow faster than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at €68.77, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.', ""Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.

The beverage giant just reported positive operating trends for fiscal 2023, and yet Coke was among the weakest performers on the Dow Jones Industrial Average for the year. Shares have gained just 2% in the last 12 months compared to the Dow's 19% rally."", ""Does that performance gap pave the way for market-beating returns for investors willing to buy Coke stock today? Let's take a closer look."", ""The biggest knock against Coke's business is that growth has been less than sparkling. Sure, organic sales gains were 12% in 2023 on top of a 16% spike in the prior year. Yet this past year's increase came almost entirely from rising prices; Coke's sales volume growth slowed to 2% last year from 5% in 2022. It's not a great sign for future sales trends that shoppers are scaling back on their soda purchases."", ""That soft momentum will likely continue into 2024 as well. Coke is calling for organic sales growth to slow for a second straight year, declining to between 6% and 7% gains in 2024. Investors are hoping that the company can get back to double-digit expansion that includes both rising prices and higher sales volumes. For now, though they'll have to accept market share growth in a sluggish industry. Rival PepsiCo\xa0is calling for just 4% organic sales gains this year."", ""Coke is squeezing the most out of its slower growth profile, though, and that's great news for shareholders. Non-GAAP earnings jumped a healthy 16% in 2023 thanks to a combination of cost cuts, rising prices, and higher demand for non-core beverages like sparkling waters and energy drinks."", 'Those wins helped operating profit margin expand to a blazing 29% of sales, or nearly double PepsiCo\'s result. ""We expect to see margin expansion [in 2024],"" CFO John Murphy said in a recent conference call with investors.', ""Cash returns are another bright spot lifting shareholders' overall returns. Coke generated about $10 billion of free cash flow in 2023 and returned nearly the same amount to investors through stock buybacks and a rising dividend."", ""The dividend payment has increased for over 60 consecutive years, giving Coke one of the longest track records on the market. Cash flow is projected to drop in 2024, but that's mainly because of one-time tax payment issues. The long-term outlook is highly positive for Coke's cash trends, and so investors can count on further steady dividend growth over the coming years (and decades)."", ""Happily, you can pick up Coke's stock at a relative steal today. Yes, its price-to-sales ratio of 6 is about double PepsiCo's comparable metric. Yet investors were paying over 7 times sales for this business at several points in the past three years. The weak performance of the stock in the past 12 months reduces the risk that you'll pay too high of a price for this company."", ""Investors have to balance those positive factors against the likelihood that Coke will report some softer sales trends in the short term. The stock might respond to that sluggishness by staying relatively weak through most of 2024, but that's a small price to pay to gain exposure to one of the strongest consumer staples companies on the planet.

With the growing use of artificial intelligence by software companies, not only can these companies expect to see greater innovation in their work processes, leading to perhaps higher profitability for themselves in the long run, but also, users of their software products can expect to benefit from the integration of artificial intelligence in software tools and products, making these much more accessible to every other user."", 'On February 21, NVIDIA Corporation\'s (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO, Jensen Huang, joined CNBC\'s ""Last Call"" to discuss this possibility.

It's been a couple of years."", 'BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, absolutely. So what was your big message to investors?', ""MARC BITZER: You know, a big message to investors was, we are the critical milestone as a company. We have been on a multi-year business transformation journey where we sold and bought some businesses. And now we're just weeks away from completing our European divesture, where we basically take our European business and combine it with an-- a Turkish company and own 25%."", ""So it's a critical milestone.

I went onto your website. I mean, this is an iconic company. I mean, how do you unwind some of these things that may not be working anymore?', ""MARC BITZER: Yeah, you know, Brian, first of all, I mean, we have an incredible, strong legacy in history. Our company is 113 years old. Our headquarter's literally a mile away from where the company was founded."", ""BRIAN SOZZI: That's wild."", ""MARC BITZER: We had only 70 CEOs in our history. So it's a company with a lot of legacy and history. But we all recognize, you know, just because you have a great past doesn't mean you have a great future."", ""And the [INAUDIBLE] one is not changing the things which work and change the things which might need adjustment. I think with what we define as a portfolio transformation but then also what we call our strategic imperatives, I think we've set the parameters right in terms of where we need more pushes without giving up our great tradition and history."", ""So I think we found a good balance. And-- but, you know, it's-- this is a highly competitive industry where we're the last American large appliance company. And that was very different when I joined the company. So-- but I think we have all the things right to have a great future going forward."", ""BRIAN SOZZI: You want to get me excited during the week, Marc. Send over a slide deck talking about long-term financial targets. But that's what you did at the New York Stock Exchange today. My interpretation was that the first half of the year, because the housing market is still under pressure because of higher rates, it's going to hold Whirlpool back a little bit. Is that the right assessment and things improve in the back half of the year?"", ""MARC BITZER: You know, fundamentally, Brian, it's-- if our business being so overall driven by the North America business-- but North America business in turn is strongly driven, we know, by housing and by product introductions. And we can spend later on talking a little bit of product introduction because there's a really good portfolio."", 'But housing is a big factor, OK? And particularly existing home sales. And of course, we all know last December was a-- there was a 28-year low of existing home sales. So of course, that creates a little bit an overhang. But, you know-- but the housing market has been soft for almost two decades.', 'BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah.', 'MARC BITZER: So the question is not, does it come around? The question is, when does it come around?', 'BRIAN SOZZI: When does it come around?', 'MARC BITZER: When does it come?', 'BRIAN SOZZI: Do you need the rate cuts for it to come around?', ""MARC BITZER: I think-- first of all, the new home starts, they're kind of already recovering. 1.4, 1.46 is getting better. I think we need 1.7, 1.9. I mean, the society-- on existing home sales, I think you need probably not just one cut, but two or three cuts."", ""I think you would have to see below 6% mortgage rates on a sustained base to really kind of unfreeze the market because, again, we sometimes lose perspective of what happened in the course of 24 months. Existing home sales dropped from 6.4 million to 3.8. I mean, I don't think you've ever seen such a kind of drop."", ""So it literally froze to-- so to fall that, I think it takes more than one interest rate reduction. And that's ultimately we're going to see when and how it will happen. And it's kind of-- but that by definition, we're not-- it's more a back-half event when it starts moving."", ""And my first half of the year-- and we guide it towards this morning earnings call. I think we'll still be a little bit softer. But we know that. We're prepared for that. We have our costs and controls. So I think we're in good shape."", 'BRIAN SOZZI: Has inflation become less of a problem for Whirlpool?', ""MARC BITZER: Well, you know, inflation was a two- or three-year massive problem. You know, it's-- overall, it added almost 3 billion, 2 and 1/2 billion to our cost base. And these are unheard number."", ""BRIAN SOZZI: That's astronomical."", ""MARC BITZER: Yeah, that's astronomical. So last year, we were able to get 800 million of that out of the way. This year we take another 500 million out. So we're still operating slightly higher than before."", ""And, you know some of the inflation-- I mean, you have wage inflation. That doesn't go away. It just stays there. I think what we do see is, now, clearly-- I mean, we saw that already last year-- moderation of inflation rate. And right now it's flat."", ""But again, that doesn't mean that you get all the costs back to pre-COVID levels, so. But I think we-- you know, we overall-- we're now tackling where we can-- logistic costs, product costs. We're also questioning and addressing our overall infrastructure costs."", ""We have a simplified business going forward. And as such, we probably don't need the kind of more or less complicated structure which we had before. So we're addressing with costs on multiple levels. But frankly, the inflation, we're not counting on a big deflation. Just a moderation is already fine."", ""BRIAN SOZZI: There's been some reporting within the past two weeks on appliance quality. I'm sure you saw these stories. Y'all finds them write this stuff. But unless I have-- I made a note. I'm like, when I talk to Marc, I have to ask him about this stuff. Because appliance quality seems to have gotten a bad rap. Maybe companies have taken quality out of their products. Or they, break and you have to replace them. Set the record straight."", ""MARC BITZER: Yeah, so I saw the article . It hurt my feelings. I don't think it is a reflection of the actual facts. So let me explain to you why."", ""Appliance life is not driven by calendar years. It's driven by usage. It's like a car. I mean, of course, the more miles you put on a car, that's-- it's not driven by years. And what happened. COVID and post-COVID, people are using it much more intensively. I mean, we see that on replacement market."", 'So yes, people are using it more intensively. And therefore, it gets replaced a little bit earlier there may have been in the past. The actual quality data-- and we have pretty good data because we see every single warranty call-- actually at Whirlpool, I mean, over the last 20 years, every year went down.', ""So we're right now hovering-- and that's a more or less public number. But we're hovering around a 4% failure rate in first year, so. And that compares to more high-single digits a couple of years ago."", 'So we feel very good about quality improvement and particularly in the context of products which get more complicated, have much more technology and electronics. And so we feel very good about the actual quality rate. But the usage is more intensive. So I think people are confusing two trends here.', ""BRIAN SOZZI: And you're also making a big innovation push this year. A lot of focus on small appliances. I think that may have surprised a lot of investors. These are higher margin products?"", ""MARC BITZER: Yeah. Yeah, I mean, so small domestic appliances is a business which historically was embedded from the numbers in our regional report. So in some ways, you could refer to a hidden gem because we-- but it's-- it is one of our best businesses. And small domestic appliances, they also like the majors live from innovation."", 'So small domestic, of course, in our case has a strength in stand mix of heritage business. But, you know, we know from consumer perspective in terms of, if you ask consumers, What is your most preferred brand on espresso makers? we get a high preference. So--', ""BRIAN SOZZI: It's Starbucks, Marc."", ""MARC BITZER: Yeah, well. So in a certain way, consumers give us license to go in other categories. So that's why we're pushing this year heavily into fully automatic espressos and semi-automatics."", ""But it's not only small domestic appliances. We have on a major business, we have a massive new launch. We have a new front loader coming. We just launched Maytag Pet launch dishwasher. So this ultimately comes down to this is an industry, if you stand still on innovation, that's a bad path. And we kept on investing."", 'BRIAN SOZZI: Are you back-- when are you back to growth? My sense from the presentation was not until 2026 in the US.', ""MARC BITZER: You know, part of it comes back to what you asked earlier. So the housing will come around. But keep also in mind, even if housing moves-- for example, new homes, we're at the tail end of a new home. So the new home gets started, gets built. The appliances are pretty much the last thing before the house is complete."", ""So we by definition have a little bit of tail end until we see the full momentum. On the other hand, it's very predictable because we know once a house is being built at one point, the appliances come in. So I think what you see behind this one, yeah, from a broader industry, we're kind of conservative, if you want to say, or moderately conservative for the next 12 to 18 months. But after that, we feel very good at."", ""BRIAN SOZZI: Of course, we're asking all leaders. We're getting ready to head into election season. Now I remember talking to you in the past of how Chinese companies were dumping various products on the US, lowering prices and hurting American manufacturers. Has that started to improve? And what policies have lawmakers put in place that have been helping your business?"", ""MARC BITZER: Yeah, so it's, obviously, always dangerous if a CEO comments on politics. And I will try to be careful around this one. It is ultimately, this is globally a very competitive industry. As I mentioned before, we're the last American large appliance company. Everybody else-- there's two Europeans left. And the rest is Asian. Nothing against Asia, but it's just-- it's Korean, one Japanese, and the Chinese company."", ""So yeah, we're competing, if you want to say, as an American company against a lot of foreign competitors. We are all in favor of if it's a level playing field. We have our confidence. We know how to produce. We know how to cost efficiently with innovation to produce."", ""I think where we in the past, you know, we're concerned if people are selling products in the US below their domestic markets and these kind of things. Has it moderated over the last couple of years? A little bit. And we're still here in some categories where we would have some concerns, you know?"", ""But at the same time, as a company, we are also particularly focused on input costs. So for example, for us, steel cost is a big deal. And steel costs, if I buy today steel in the US, it's about twice as expensive as China steel. So fundamental competitiveness of input cost is for us a really big deal."", ""BRIAN SOZZI: All right, let's leave it there. I say, Marc, it's always good to see you. You always give us some of the best insight in the market. We'll catch up with you soon. Much more ahead on Yahoo Finance. Don't go anywhere."", '[AUDIO LOGO]']"

With that, please turn to Slide 5, and let me hand the call over to Jeff."", 'Jeffrey Walker Martin', ""Thank you, Glen, and thank you all for joining us today. Over the last several months, we spent time with investors and the research community soliciting feedback on ways to make today's call more informative. In response to your feedback, we'll be providing more information today from more executives. I'll start off by summarizing our recent business accomplishments and our corporate strategy and will be followed by the leaders of each of our business platforms who will likewise summarize their accomplishments, business model and expected capital deployment. Karen will close out today's presentation with a review of our Q4 and full year financial results and outline our new 2024 to 2028 capital plan. We'll also be sure to save time at the end to take your questions. Now turning to 2023. It was a strong year of operating and financial performance for our company and in large measures a credit to our corporate strategy and our success in simplifying our business model. At Sempra, we're focused on making disciplined investments in large and growing economic markets that are looking to modernize their energy networks and connect communities to safer, more reliable and cleaner energy. Over the last 5 years, this strategy has allowed us to build significant scale into our business for the benefit of customers and shareholders. As we previewed on our third quarter call in November, I'm excited to announce that our capital plan has increased by 20% to a new company record of $48 billion with more than 90% allocated to regulated transmission and distribution investments. Trevor, Allen and Justin will go into more detail later in today's presentation. But the overall scope and size of our capital plan really speaks to the robust markets we operate in and the magnitude of growth opportunities that are in front of our company. Turning to our 2023 financial results. We delivered adjusted EPS of $4.61 exceeding the high end of our guidance and providing support to narrow our full year 2024 EPS guidance range to $4.60 to $4.90. This morning, we're also announcing full year 2025 EPS guidance range of $4.90 to $5.25, which represents approximately 7% growth from the midpoint of the prior guidance range. Based upon the continued growth we're seeing across our 3 T&D growth platforms, we're affirming our projected long-term EPS growth rate of 6% to 8%. Finally, we're also pleased to announce the Board of Directors approved increasing our dividend for the 14th consecutive year to $2.48 per share. Please turn to the next slide. For the past several years, the United States has experienced significant economic uncertainty due to higher inflation, supplying disruptions and higher interest rates. Against this backdrop, Sempra delivered strong financial performance in 2023 with record adjusted earnings and record adjusted earnings per share. Also, over the last several years, our investment strategy has consistently prioritized making investments in energy networks in California and Texas, and this has allowed us to grow our rate base in those markets at the end of 2023 to just over $50 billion. Looking forward, 1 of the primary benefits of rolling out an expanded capital plan is that it provides unique visibility to the strength of our long-term earnings growth. Also, it's important to note that our equity offering last November was successful in mitigating future equity needs associated with our new plan. On the regulatory front, we've made several advances highlighting the constructive nature of the jurisdictions where we operate and our ability to work effectively with key stakeholders. In California, the cost of capital mechanism triggered. As a result, SDG&E and SoCalGas increased their authorized ROEs last month. We also reached a proposed settlement with certain intervenors for a portion of our pending rate cases, which we view constructively. Turning to Texas. Oncor successfully completed its base rate review last spring, Also, several important pieces of legislation were passed that support new investments in transmission and distribution that benefit customers and the continued growth of the state's economy. Also at Sempra Infrastructure, we declared positive FID on Port Arthur LNG Phase 1, secured financing and began construction. We continue to make steady progress on our development projects. While the pause on non-FTE export permits has impacted the sector, we're confident in the commercial value of our projects, and we'll continue to develop these critical infrastructure assets on a reasonable time in. Justin will address this topic further in his section. Please turn to the next slide. Sempra is building critical new infrastructure designed to support economic and population growth while providing attractive financial returns to our owners. Through 2050, global GDP is expected to more than double, much of which will come from emerging economies, driving the need for incremental energy resources. Going forward, we strongly believe renewables, natural gas and cleaner molecules will be critical in meeting rising energy demand as we transition to an energy future with lower carbon intensity. As an example, United States natural gas production set a record during 2023 for the third consecutive year, fueled by strong domestic demand and record LNG exports all while still achieving lower carbon emissions over the past several decades as renewables and cleaner burning natural gas replace coal as a fuel source and power generation. Please turn to the next slide. As we modernize our energy grids, the IEA estimates that $11 trillion are expected to be spent in the North American energy sector through 2050, with over $5 trillion focused on T&D investments. Please turn to the next slide. As we've outlined in the past, we've been disciplined in maintaining our focus on what we believe is the higher value, lower risk portion of the energy value chain. In the T&D segment, we made disciplined investments with a view toward producing high-quality recurring cash flows from regulated utilities and long-term contracted assets that generally grow with inflation. Please turn to the next slide. As you can see here, our strategy, combined with disciplined capital allocation has allowed us to successfully meet or exceed our EPS guidance range for the last 6 years. Over this same time period, our adjusted EPS has compounded annually at approximately 10% since 2018, which is top decile amongst our peers. Please turn to the next slide. Improving our corporate strategy has allowed us to build significant scale into our business for the benefit of our customers and shareholders, and that's been demonstrated by the consistency of our financial performance. It's also noteworthy that we've accomplished this across different market cycles that have included a global pandemic, supply chain shortages, high inflation, rising interest rates and geopolitical unrest. In short, our disciplined execution has consistently delivered total shareholder returns at levels that are well above our peer group. Please turn to next slide. Before I hand the call to Trevor, I'd like to reiterate our key investment highlights. We own high-quality T&D growth platforms located in California and Texas, some of North America's most attractive economic markets that also benefit from constructive regulation. We exercised a disciplined approach to capital allocation and are excited to launch our new 5-year capital plan of $48 billion. We believe this sets out a clear road map for our future growth and supports our expected long-term EPS growth rate of 6% to 8%. In conclusion, we're proud of our recent accomplishments and the growing strength of our business franchise. Across our management team, there's a lot of excitement about the opportunities that are ahead of us. Now please turn to the next slide where Trevor will walk you through the business updates at Sempra, California."", 'Trevor Ian Mihalik', ""Thanks, Jeff. Let me start by highlighting the financial results at Sempra California. Earnings for the full year 2023 were $1.75 billion, benefiting from $4.6 billion of capital investments, focused on safety, reliability and wildfire mitigation. These investments increased rate base by 11% over 2022. We have long emphasized California's constructive regulatory compact, including forward-looking rate cases, access to the cost of capital mechanism and an established wildfire fund. And this year, we had several positive regulatory outcomes that reinforced our conviction and supports attracting capital to the state. As Jeff mentioned, last fall, the cost of capital mechanism triggered and the CPUC approved increasing our authorized ROE at SDG&E and SoCalGas by 70 basis points. This increase was effective January 1, 2024. In October, we reached settlements for important capital and O&M portions of our rate case requests with certain intervenors. And while these settlements are subject to CPUC approval, we're encouraged by that progress. And we anticipate receiving a proposed decision on our GRC in the second quarter. As a reminder, once finalized, rates will be retroactive to January 1, 2024. Separately, in addition to the recently awarded transmission projects by CAISO, SDG&E has advanced their competitive bid for the Imperial Valley to the North of SONGS transmission line and expect an update in late April. We're also extremely proud of the recent recognition of our electric business. SDG&E was again awarded best in the West for electric reliability for the 18th consecutive year and recognized for their industry leadership in wildfire mitigation predictive modeling technology. The CPUC also recently increased the authorized storage capacity of Aliso Canyon by over 50%. This demonstrates the commission's recognition of the importance of energy infrastructure and the critical role SoCalGas plays in supporting reliability and affordability of both natural gas and electricity in California. And finally, ARCHES, which is one of SoCalGas' strategic partners, was selected to receive DOE funding to help develop a regional hydrogen hub. This is important because Los Angeles is one of the nation's largest manufacturing hubs and cleaner molecules are expected to play a pivotal role in helping hard to electrify sector lower their emissions. Please turn to the next slide. Now let's turn to some of the key trends that are supporting growth at Sempra California. We operate in the largest U.S. market, representing nearly 15% of National GDP. California is also among the top 3 states for job growth, with nearly 1 million jobs created over the past 5 years. We are also well aligned with the state policy that promotes building and economy based on sustainable energy. Earlier this month, the CPUC made further commitments to renewables, mandating the construction of 56 gigawatts of new clean energy by 2035, including over 15 gigawatts of energy storage. California also remains home to the largest source of solar power and the highest penetration rate of electric vehicles of any state in the country. Just in San Diego County, there are now over 140,000 EVs, and that number is expected to increase significantly in the coming years. It is also noteworthy that San Diego County leads the state with 23% of our customers having installed rooftop solar systems. These systems are often accompanied by a battery and as battery storage solutions become more cost effective, the need to reliably integrate these technologies on our network is expected to increase. Turning to Los Angeles. The manufacturing sector generates over $80 billion in annual GDP. For customers that require high heat content molecules, RNG and hydrogen will be increasingly important for affordable, reliable and safe operations. When you pair California's economic growth with its ambitious clean energy goals, the need for significant T&D investment is critical to help ensure reliability and affordability. The key takeaway here is that our investment strategy and the rate case filings are closely aligned with public policy and the direction the state is going. Please turn to the next slide. Sempra California is modernizing the T&D infrastructure necessary to integrate more renewables and clean molecules to serve the growing energy needs of customers while facilitating California's energy transition. As this slide shows, our utilities play a central role in connecting new cleaner sources of energy to a diverse and growing set of customers. We continue to prioritize safety and reliability with a strong focus on maintaining an efficient cost structure. We currently have the lowest bills relative to our peers in the state and are in line with the national average. We will always be focused on providing the best possible service while ensuring customer affordability is a top priority. Please turn to the next slide. Turning to our 5-year capital plan. We're announcing over $24 billion of investments. On the electric side, we are pursuing safe and reliable infrastructure investments, integrating renewable energy, incorporating battery storage, supporting EV infrastructure and hardening the system against event risks. On our natural gas system, we will continue to modernize our gas network, reduce carbon emissions and make investments in energy infrastructure that support the delivery of cleaner molecules. We expect these investments to grow our rate base at an approximate 7% CAGR from 2023 to 2028. We're excited about the growth prospects at Sempra California. And we feel fortunate to have the opportunity to deliver safe and reliable energy in a market with a constructive regulatory environment. Please turn to the next slide, where Allen will discuss Oncor's accomplishments in Texas."", 'E. Allen Nye', ""Thank you, Trevor. Oncor delivered strong financial performance in 2023, deploying $3.8 billion of capital and growing rate base by 12% over the prior year. We were pleased to complete our base rate review at the PUCT and emerge with a constructive outcome, where all prior T&D investments by Oncor were deemed prudent and improved. 2023 also marked one of the most successful Texas legislative sessions for our industry in recent history. Several bills that were passed during the 88th Texas legislative session demonstrate the state's commitment to supporting a safer, smarter, more resilient and more reliable electric grid to power continued growth across the state. Oncor has historically worked closely with the Texas legislature and as many stakeholders to achieve productive outcomes. But this session in particular, was incredibly constructive. First, the legislature increased our allowed distribution cost recovery tracker filings to twice a year reducing Oncor's regulatory lag on critical investments. Additionally, the legislature passed HB 2555, which encourages utilities to make their systems more resilient, and provides expedited recovery for approved capital and O&M expenditures. The PUCT finalized rules to implement HB 2555 last month. We expect to file our first system resiliency plan or SRP, within the next several months. The PUCT has allowed 6 months to review the SRP and if approved, we would expect to begin implementation by year-end. Distribution capital approved in the SRP will be recovered through our DCRF tracker filings. Regulatory lag that normally accrues between the time of in-service and the implementation of rates will be offset by a regulatory asset that will be recovered in our next DCRF. Similarly, O&M expense approved as part of the SRP will be offset by a regulatory asset that will be included for recovery and a subsequent DCRF. Use of this new mechanism should reduce the regulatory lag normally associated with these types of expenditures. We look forward to using the capital and O&M that gets approved under our SRP plan to improve the resiliency of our system, harden the system against storms, extreme weather and wildfire risk and generally improve our customers' experience, while at the same time, improving recovery of the expenditures. From an operational perspective, Oncor continued to execute at a high level. In 2023, we built, rebuilt or upgraded approximately 3,200 miles of T&D lines, while also increasing the number of premises we serve by 73,000. In West Texas alone, we built, rebuilt or upgraded over 650 miles of T&D lines and 8 new switching and substations. The Texas grid performed very well through record demand peaks over the last 12 months. Oncor's reliability performance as measured by our nonstorm SAIDI score, improved by approximately 7% in 2023 compared to the previous year. Finally, in 2023, we set company records for active transmission interconnection requests, and new transmission interconnection requests in the queue. Active generation and retail interconnection requests increased 25% year-over-year. New interconnection requests increased 19% year-over-year. Please turn to the next slide. These interconnection requests are driven by the dynamic economic growth that we continue to see in Texas. The Texas Miracle continues and is demonstrated by the continued strong growth both in population and diverse commercial and industrial businesses moving to the state. Oncor serves some of the country's fastest-growing metro areas, including 4 of the 15 fastest-growing cities. From a sheer scale perspective, Texas GDP is second only to California and continues to grow at a robust pace, growing at approximately 8% during the third quarter. Faster than the nation as a whole for the fifth quarter in a row. Texas continues to see electric vehicle penetration as well. Over a recent 12-month period, the DFW Metroplex had the largest increase in EV registrations out of any major metro area in Texas with 63% growth. Please turn to the next slide. Oncor has also seen significant growth in commercial and industrial customers, representing electric loads that are larger than traditional commercial projects. Data center development continues to be robust across our service territory, including new sites that have the potential to support hyperscale computing and generative artificial intelligence services. These projects represent the potential for thousands of megawatts of new electric load, often hundreds of megawatts for just 1 project. Similarly, electrification of the oil and gas industry in West Texas continues at an impressive pace. A Permian Basin reliability plan update published by ERCOT earlier this month projects that within 15 years, the total demand in West Texas could increase fourfold from its current 6.5 gigawatts to 26 gigawatts. This growth is expected to support oil and gas production as well as general electrification. Oncor will be at the forefront and expanding its system to meet the requirements of these customers. Finally, as the population continues to expand both organically and from relocations, we still expect total premise growth to continue at approximately 2% annually. Each of these developments creates new opportunities to expand the Oncor Energy system. We are positioning ourselves to meet these demands through hiring, supply chain procurement and system planning and looking forward to continuing to serve our customers in the ERCOT market. Please turn to the next slide. On Sempra's Q3 call, we discussed this growth and announced our intention to increase our capital plan. We are pleased to announce that Oncor's 5-year capital plan for 2024 through 2028 is projected to be $24.2 billion which is a 26% increase over our previous 5-year capital plan of $19.2 billion. The vast majority of this capital plan is to serve customer growth, although the maintenance needs of our system continue to grow steadily well. This plan does not include the amount of capital expenditures that we expect to request in the upcoming SRP filing that I mentioned earlier. We expect to file that plan in the first half of this year, and the proposed spend will be subject to PUCT review and approval. With today's updated plan, we anticipate Oncor's rate base to grow at an annual average rate of 11% from 2023 to 2028. While historically, our earnings growth rate fell below our rate base growth due to regulatory lag. The addition of enhanced recovery mechanisms arising from the legislative session should move our long-term earnings growth rate closer to our rate base growth rate. Please turn to the next slide where I'll turn the call to Justin to update you on Sempra Infrastructure."", 'Justin Christopher Bird', ""Thanks, Allen. We're also excited about the opportunities in Texas. Sempra Infrastructure is advancing the approximately $13 billion Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 project in Texas. This investment, along with Oncor's capital plan, certainly makes Sempra among the largest investors in the state. At Sempra Infrastructure, we're advancing construction on 5 projects, all of which are on time and on budget. And our strategy differentiates us from others in the space. We have a dual coast LNG export strategy, a robust energy network portfolio and power transmission infrastructure to move more renewable power across the border, all with the goal of delivering cleaner molecules and cleaner electrons to our customers and partners. We've achieved several noteworthy milestones in 2023, declaring positive FID on Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 was a major success, and we secured all required project level debt and equity contributions. Financially, we executed well relative to 2022's strong results, our ability to maintain momentum through 2023 is another indication of our sustainable business model. Sempra Infrastructure's 2023 adjusted earnings were $764 million. I'd also like to specifically call out the progress at ECA LNG Phase 1 as it approaches its summer 2025 COD. We are excited to bring one of the first North American Pacific Coast export projects to market. At Cameron LNG Phase 1, we've now exceeded 700 cargoes since production began in May of 2019, and we couldn't be more pleased with the high-quality operations from this critical infrastructure asset. On the development and growth pipeline, our priorities remain focused on advancing commercial discussions for offtake volume and equity ownership at Port Arthur Phase 2 and assessing Cameron LNG Phase 2's EPC opportunities. At Cameron LNG Phase 2, we've been working with Bechtel on value engineering. And at this stage, we feel it's best to continue those efforts while evaluating other potential EPC contractors. We're continuing to work closely with Bechtel on Port Arthur Phase 1 and potentially Phase 2, but we and the Cameron partners want to take some additional time to help ensure a cost-effective build plan. and conduct additional value engineering and analysis to improve the overall value of the project to our customers. At Port Arthur LNG Phase 2, we received FERC approval in September. And earlier this month, FERC staff issued an environmental assessment finding no adverse impact as a result of the Port Arthur Louisiana Connector pipeline's amendment. I also want to mention that we continue to make significant progress toward an FID on Cimarron Wind. Recall, this is a 300-megawatt wind project located near our existing ESJ and ESJ 2 wind projects that would directly interconnect with the California market. Finally, I wanted to highlight a hydrogen hub project, we are participating in called High Velocity that is expected to receive $1.2 billion from DOE funding to pursue development. We are also actively engaged with a group of Japanese utilities on a collaboration to produce e-natural gas using renewable hydrogen and CO2 as inputs. Projects like these demonstrate Sempra Infrastructure's innovative and entrepreneurial culture as we seek opportunities to provide cleaner and more secure energy for customers. Please turn to the next slide. Turning to macro trends impacting Sempra Infrastructure. Global energy demand continues to increase. On sustainability, Sempra Infrastructure plays a critical role in providing cleaner alternative solutions to heavier carbon fuels like coal and oil, natural gas and particularly LNG, can effectively replace less sustainable energy sources today. In fact, industry sources estimate that global LNG demand, in particular, will grow approximately 50% by 2045. There is an additional tailwind associated with emerging market growth as their share of global GDP increases relative to advancing economies. This drives overall energy consumption because developing economies tend to be more energy intensive as they modernize and improve quality of life. Sempra Infrastructure also develops renewables and associated infrastructure that provide cleaner sources of energy and contribute to a broader decarbonization efforts in North America. The final macro driver is the need for energy security. Energy dense, reliable and affordable energy is a key ingredient to building advanced economies. The key question is where that incremental energy production will be sourced. Recently, the DOE announced a pause on granting non-FDA LNG export permits to reevaluate the impact granting these permits would have on domestic energy costs and to consider whether climate factors impact the public interest. LNG's climate role is important which is why even before the regulatory development, we started work on several initiatives designed to minimize our environmental impact and help reduce emissions across our portfolio. One example being the conversion of E-drives at Cameron LNG Phase 2. We're also developing carbon capture and sequestration infrastructure associated with our LNG projects. Long term, we are confident in the commercial, economic and environmental value of our export facilities, and we'll continue to work hard on behalf of our customers and investors to advance these projects. With that said, this permitting pause only applies to projects that haven't yet received their non-FDA export permits, such as Port Arthur Phase 2. This pause does not impact on any of our assets in operation or under construction. As a reminder, Cameron Train 4 has a non-FDA export permit and the DOE stated in hearings earlier this month that the pause would not impact in service date extension requests for projects with existing permits. Per Sempra's planning convention development projects such as Port Arthur Phase 2 and Cameron Phase 2 have not reached FID and are not included in our capital plan or guidance. So any potential delay would not impact our current earnings growth visibility or our existing capital plan. We can't speculate on the ultimate outcome of this policy but we'd like to reiterate the compelling environmental value proposition that natural gas and LNG provide. The United States has decreased carbon emissions 17% below 2005 levels despite increasing GDP by more than double in that time. A major reason for that progress is natural gas replacing coal and energy production. We believe a lasting policy of limiting LNG exports would unfortunately hurt the global climate interests because prospective buyers could be forced to rely on more carbon-intensive fuels, including coal and fuel oil. We remain as enthusiastic as ever about the merits of our LNG projects as well as our ability to appropriately navigate the regulatory landscape to advance each one. Further, we are optimistic that normal permitting conditions will resume after all relevant variables have been carefully evaluated by the administration. Please turn to the next slide. On this slide, we highlight some key projects under construction in the Pacific and Gulf Coast. These projects strengthen our competitive advantage as a strategically located supplier to both Asia and Europe. The beauty of greenfield development is that it unlocks highly compelling brownfield expansion opportunities. We have begun procurement and engineering activities at Port Arthur, Louisiana pipeline, a pipeline connecting Port Arthur LNG to feedgas in Gillis. We've also begun procurement and engineering at Louisiana storage, a salt dome natural gas storage facility. These assets will contribute to the larger Port Arthur Energy Hub and demonstrate Sempra Infrastructure's expertise in developing comprehensive energy projects. Meanwhile, construction across the Sempra Infrastructure platforms continues to progress well. At Port Arthur LNG Phase 1, the next milestone will be to structural steel. At ECA LNG Phase 1, we are targeting 90% completion of structural steel. And at the GRO expansion, we have initiated construction and are targeting completion of the construction of the Mexicali segment later this year. To reiterate, Sempra Infrastructure is playing a key role in securing energy needs and contributing to decarbonization efforts for customers around the globe. Please turn to the next slide. Looking further out, we are developing an enviable portfolio of growth projects, and this slide showcases some of our more significant pursuits. For a full list of development assets, please refer to the appendix. I would also note that a number of these projects are brownfield investment opportunities made possible by our initial greenfield investments at Cameron and Port Arthur. Please turn to the next slide. To conclude, we have $4.4 billion of capital deployment opportunities anchored on providing our long-term customers with cleaner and secure energy. And as a reminder, this number only includes projects which have reached a positive FID. Major 2024 investment allocations are slotted for the Port Arthur Energy Hub as Phase 1 construction progresses ECA LNG Phase 1 as we closed in on COD, the GRO pipeline expansion project and the Louisiana storage development. Now please turn to the next slide, and let me turn it over to Karen, who will take us through the financial update."", 'Karen L. Sedgwick', ""Thank you, Justin. I'm excited to share our year-end results and give you more details on our financial plan. Earlier today, Sempra reports fourth quarter 2023 GAAP earnings of $737 million or $1.16 per share. This compares to fourth quarter 2022 GAAP earnings of $438 million or $0.69 per share. On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter 2023 earnings were $719 million or $1.13 per share. This compares to our fourth quarter 2022 earnings of $743 million or $1.17 per share. Full year 2023 GAAP earnings were $3.030 billion, or $4.79 per share. This compares to 2022 GAAP earnings of $2.094 billion or $3.31 per share. On an adjusted basis, full year 2023 earnings were $2.920 billion or $4.61 per share. This compares to our previous full year 2022 adjusted earnings of $2.915 billion or $4.61 per share. This year's results demonstrate the combined strength of our 3 growth performs and sets us up for improved growth in 2024. Please turn to the next slide. Now I will summarize the variance of full year 2023 adjusted earnings compared to the same period for last year. At Sempra, California, we had $69 million of higher net interest expense, partially offset by net tax benefits, offset by $51 million of higher electric transmission and CPUC-based operating margin and $52 million of higher regulatory interest income and regulatory awards. At Sempra Texas, we had $2 million of higher equity earnings attributable to increased invested capital, partially offset by higher interest and operating expenses. I'd note that earnings in 2022 and 2023 were impacted by the lack of capital trackers that can't be filed during the rate case. At Sempra Infrastructure, we had $85 million of higher earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. $10 million of higher taxes, partially offset by lower interest expense given increased capitalized interest, offset by $49 million of higher transportation tariffs, higher asset supply optimization, partially offset by lower equity earnings from Cameron LNG. For Port Arthur, where our ownership stake is approximately 20%, we consolidate the project for accounting purposes, thus capitalizing interest based on the projects in progress construction. As construction advances, you're seeing the impact of higher capitalized interest versus previous years. Ultimately, these capitalized costs will be amortized back as higher depreciation after the plant moves into commercial operations. At Sempra Parent, there were $15 million of higher investment gains, partially offset by higher net interest expense and lower income tax benefits. Please turn to the next slide. Turning to new investments. As Jeff noted earlier, we're announcing a company record $48 billion capital plan with over 90% of the planned investment allocated to our regulated utilities. This represents an impressive 20% increase over the previous plan and will ultimately serve as the foundation for our company's growth over the coming years. About $24.1 billion, roughly half of the capital plan is marked for investment at Sempra California's 2 utilities, which together have a weighted average ROE of approximately 10.5%. At Sempra Texas, $19.5 billion includes our proportionate share of Oncor's planned CapEx, where recent legislative development should help Oncor reduce regulatory lag and improve its ability to help lessen the gap between authorized and actual rates of return. The remaining $4.4 billion are primarily associated with Sempra Infrastructure's LNG projects under construction and their associated infrastructure. Please turn to the next slide. With this record capital plan, I would like to illustrate some of the key sources and uses. As you know, Sempra raised equity in November 2023 to support our future investment needs and mitigate the financing risk associated with the capital plan. As a result, we are in a strong financial position and anticipate our reliable internal operating cash flows and regulatory authorized debt will provide the vast majority of our financing needs. We are a growing business, we'll maintain balance sheet strength, all with a goal of delivering attractive total shareholder returns over the long term. Along those lines, Sempra will continue to target a 50% to 60% dividend payout ratio, providing plenty of reinvestment flexibility. Please turn to the next slide. Moving to the utilities. Our strong earnings trajectory is underpinned by long-term rate base growth. California and Texas rate base is expected to grow at 7% and 11% respectively, from 2023 to 2028. Our rate base is split approximately evenly between California and Texas, where we benefit from constructive regulatory jurisdictions and strong macroeconomic growth. On a combined basis, we anticipate just over 9% annual growth through 2028, and this gives us added confidence in achieving our projected 6% to 8% long-term EPS growth rate. Please turn to the next slide. Given the strength of our 2023 results, we've narrowed our 2024 earnings guidance estimates and are now projecting EPS guidance for the year, ranging from $4.60 to $4.90. Also, we're announcing 2025 earned per share guidance with a range of $4.90 to $5.25. This equates to a projected EPS midpoint that's about 7% higher than 2024 guidance. Now let's break down a few of the assumptions embedded in these figures. At Sempra, California, this already includes the cost of capital trigger. As for the GRC, we're assuming outcomes that are in the range of historical rate case decisions, and continue to work constructively with the CPUC and interveners through the proceeding to achieve an outcome that allows us to continue to deliver safe, reliable and sustainable energy for our customers. Turning to Texas. We said in the prior call, the guidance took into effect Oncor's second DCRF. Subject to PUCT approval, the system resiliency plan will apply to 2025 through 2027. And due to timing differences between filing and construction of projects, we'd expect minimal financial impact in 2025. At Sempra Infrastructure, there are a few things to highlight. 2022 and 2023 benefited from an attractive commodity price environment. And in 2023, we received the cumulative benefit of new tariffs on select Mexico pipelines. Due to the conservative nature of our project development process, we secured rights on the gas pipeline connecting ECA well in advance of COD. This allowed us to better optimize results during this period, but we would expect this impact to moderate as we go forward, particularly with the lower forward curve for natural gas. And now with the magnitude of large projects currently under construction, we have better visibility to certain noncapitalized costs that have now been added to our 2024 plan. And we have ECA LNG Phase 1, expected come online in the summer of '25, with full year operations expected in 2026. And finally, regarding the share count. The main driver of the increase is our recent equity offering. As we've discussed, the green shoot of just over 2 million shares settled immediately in November of 2023. Over the course of this year, we're assuming weighted average diluted shares will increase by $4 million, which reflects the dividend reinvestment program, equity-based plans and the drawdown of our forward settlement, which we now assume will occur in the second half of 2024. Thus 2025 reflects those shares outstanding for the interior year, increasing our share count to approximately 654 million shares. Please turn to the next slide. In addition to our new 5-year plan, we've added this slide in an effort to be more responsive to input from our many investors. Here, it shows the various categories of investments that we're tracking or developing that fall outside of our current plan. It totals over $10 billion, and many of these opportunities could form part of our future capital campaign. Please turn to the next slide. You've heard this from our other executives today, but it is important to note that we're excited by the investment opportunities in front of us. We are owners and operators of top tier T&D utility platforms located in North America's largest economies. Moreover, our utilities benefit from constructive regulation that support significant investment and help ensure safe, reliable, resilient and increasingly sustainable energy for our customers. Over time, our key priorities remain largely the same. We will invest in our high-quality T&D energy infrastructure to improve customer service, maintain a prudent balance sheet and provide compelling returns to shareholders. A record $48 billion capital plan focused on our regulated utilities will be the primary foundation for our increasing rate base, growth in earnings power and gives us confidence in achieving our projected long-term EPS growth rate of 6% to 8%. We thank you for joining us as we continue to build North America's premier energy infrastructure company. And we're as enthusiastic as ever about our opportunity to continue delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns. I've had the opportunity to meet with many of you over the last month, and I'll be out on the road with the IR team in March. And hope to connect with those of you I haven't had a chance to meet yet. With that, I'd now like to open the call for some of your questions."", 'Operator', 'This concludes the prepared remarks. We will now open the line to take your questions. (Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from Constantine Lednev from Guggenheim Partners.', 'Constantine Lednev', ""Congrats on a great quarter. The first 1 would be on the 2025 earnings growth in California, that's pointing to around 5%. How are you currently framing the GRC process into the '24, '25 planning assumptions, especially there's some visibility around partial settlement issues in the process?"", 'Jeffrey Walker Martin', ""Yes, Constantine, here's the way I would think about it is the way we framed our rate case is we always focus on making investments that are aligned with public policy and to directly support our customers. In terms of assumptions, we take the time to look at prior cases we've been through at the CPUC. And then we tend to make reasonable assumptions from a range of potential outcomes. Our challenge is given where we're at in the regulatory process, that's probably all we're prepared to share in terms of assumptions at this time. But you did make a great point, which is just last fall, we've settled with certain intervenors about 1/3 of the rate case for the Southern California Gas Company and about 1/3 of the case for SDG&E. And we view that quite constructively. So we're looking forward to a proposed decision in the second quarter and a final decision in the second half of the year."", 'Constantine Lednev', ""Okay. And does that imply that you're taking into account any of the settlements into your planning parameters? Or is that still the outcome?"", 'Jeffrey Walker Martin', ""No, I wouldn't think about the settlement itself impacting how we think about our assumptions. I just think it views an alignment with some of the intervenors around the way we're thinking about meeting the public policy initiatives for the state."", 'Constantine Lednev', 'Okay. Perfect. And then maybe shifting to your thoughts on cost of capital process at the CPUC, especially with Phase 2 reply comments posted yesterday and benchmark yields are clearly pointing to a sustained increase, but how do you just book and the assumptions on the 5-year total plan?', 'Jeffrey Walker Martin', ""Yes. Here's the way I would think about it. Now we'll also see if Trevor would like to add something. As you'll recall, when this issue was first addressed last year, we had indicated to the investment community that we expected the cost of capital mechanism to trigger and had it included in our EPS guidance. And now with the decision last December, which we think was fairly clear, it allowed us, Constantine, to have a little bit more confidence to narrow our 2024 EPS guidance range. And as you know, that had the benefit of actually raising the midpoint of our guidance for this year. Broadly, I think California continues to be a very constructive regulatory jurisdiction. I always point to the fact that we have forward-looking rate cases here. Reasonable returns on equity to attract the capital that's needed, a strong framework. It's actually quite unique for addressing climate-related event risk. And finally, more and more people are starting to understand and value the cost of capital mechanism that accounts for market conditions. But Trevor, would you like to add anything in terms of the cost of capital?"", 'Trevor Ian Mihalik', ""Yes, Jeff. No, I think you largely covered it. I would just add that I think we are really in good shape here on this. And I think the energy division's disposition letter was pretty clear on this. So again, we feel we're in good shape."", 'Constantine Lednev', 'Just 1 quick follow-up, kind of embedded within kind of that ROE outcome. Do you have any O&M kind of funding or system reinvestment embedded in plan?', 'Jeffrey Walker Martin', 'Help me understand your question again, please?', 'Constantine Lednev', ""Just with the tailwinds from the ROE outcome. Are you embedding any kind of reinvestment in O&M from that tailwind going into '24?"", 'Jeffrey Walker Martin', ""The way I would think about it is when we put our plan together, which was all part of the current rate case, so the 2024 plan would be impacted by how the outcome of the rate case is. And when we think about '24 and '25, we had to take a reasonable set of assumptions based upon prior cases, and that's embedded in our forecast."", 'Operator', 'And our next question will come from Nick Campanella from Barclays.', 'Nicholas Joseph Campanella', ""I hope everyone is doing well. Thanks for everything today. So I guess just you're going to file this SRP. It sounds like CapEx is biased yet again higher on the other side of that. Probably a second half event. But just how are you kind of describing your capital needs and how you would fund increased CapEx, equity debt, et cetera?"", 'Jeffrey Walker Martin', ""Yes. I will start, Nick, by reminding everyone that on our Q3 call last year, we shared our expectation that our capital plan would go up between 10% and 20%. And in that same month, you'll recall that we sized our equity offering of roughly $1.3 billion to support our future financing needs. Slide 33, Nick, goes through kind of the sources and uses and picks up last fall's equity issuance and the ongoing DRIP. I think to your point, the key takeaway for us is we're in great shape. Together with our operating cash flows and net debt, we're in a very strong position to comfortably support our new capital program without the need for any additional equity."", 'Nicholas Joseph Campanella', ""Right. And then I'm sorry, but just on top of -- as you raise CapEx, I think, again, if this SRP filing is not included in the current CapEx plan, is there an incremental funding need on top of that and just how to think about that? Is there capacity, I guess, to raise additional CapEx without equity here? Should we just kind of be doing some equity going forward? Sorry about that."", 'Jeffrey Walker Martin', ""No, when we sized our equity needs last fall, we made sure that we did that with a margin around what we were trying to accomplish in terms of financing our future growth. So we have the capability of funding growth beyond $48 billion without raising additional equity. The challenge you get into is when you look at the slide that we've provided, it shows other opportunities. There's an additional $10 billion out there. So it's not just SRP. We've got other projects which are coming down the pipe. But I think the great news is we've got a record capital plan, that capital plan is roughly $3 billion larger than our current market capitalization, and we were thoughtful last fall to take the equity overhang off of our stock and make sure that we had a margin of error to fully fund our capital plan with additional growth."", 'Nicholas Joseph Campanella', ""Very clear. I appreciate that. And then I guess just turning to the Sempra Infrastructure earnings guidance. Absolutely appreciate there's a step-up 2024 versus -- into '25 because of ECA. Are you assuming just kind of like a midyear COD there? And just I'm just trying to get a sense of what the normalized run rate for ECA is when that kind of comes online if you can isolate that and are there any other kind of drivers to point to in terms of the strength for '25 versus '24?"", 'Jeffrey Walker Martin', ""Yes. I will just give you 2 things to focus on and Karen, you can add if you like to. But what I would mention is you're going to see a little bit higher development expenses not capitalized in 2024. And I would use a half year convention for 2025, and that's the best way to think about your going forward run rate."", 'Karen L. Sedgwick', 'Yes. I would just add that as you would expect, our financial projections include the incremental revenues associated with the SPA contracts. The commissioning volumes recognized after substantial completion facility and the contributions from the GRO pipeline. So bringing on the first phase of the Pacific Coast LNG facility is really an exciting opportunity and differentiates Sempra infrastructure with a dual coast business model that will serve global energy demand.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley.', 'David Keith Arcaro', ""I wonder if you could maybe elaborate a little bit on the value engineering time frame on Cameron. I'm curious if there's any way you could bracket how long you've extended that process for?"", 'Jeffrey Walker Martin', ""Yes. I thought what might be helpful here, David, is if you could, Justin, do 2 things, if you've got a moment, go ahead and talk about, if you would, just a brief update on the construction at both ECA and Port Arthur. And then come back to the development question he's asking specifically how we're trying to create additional value around the Cameron opportunity."", 'Justin Christopher Bird', ""Yes. Thank you, Jeff. We're excited to share that on ECA Phase 1 and Port Arthur Phase 1, we're seeing both projects remain on track for construction, ECA Phase 1 for COD in the summer of 2025. And for Port Arthur Train 1, 2027 and Train 2 in 2028. Moving along to the development projects. You'll recall that as part of our commitment to deliver superior risk-adjusted returns, I always talk about the reverse Field of Dreams model, which is when they come, I'll build it. And along those same lines, I always say that we'll only move forward with our projects when we have the right cost and risk structure and long-term contracted cash flows that support a strong return for our shareholders. So going to the heart of your question, David, on Phase 2, we're seeing significant commercial demand for low-cost brownfield LNG assets, particularly those that have permits in hand. And we believe that Cameron will be one of the most technologically advanced LNG facilities in the world. And have one of the lowest emission profiles as we've shifted to electric drives, we're working on a green power tariff and we'll have carbon sequestration. As you recall, it's fully permitted, and we're working towards an FID. The 4 work streams that I've always talked about continue to make progress, but we still have some work to be done. So to our current efforts with respect to the Cameron partners are focused on optimizing costs, and ensuring maximum value for the project. And for example, we're exploring procurement or reservation of long lead and critical path equipment. We are anticipating taking an FID on Cameron 2 as early as the first half of next year. So that's the first half of 2025. Shifting to Port Arthur. We received our FERC permit last September and are now awaiting the DOE non-FTA export permit. We're continuing to work with Bechtel on an EPC agreement that can optimize efficiencies with the Phase 1 construction schedule. And we're continuing our marketing efforts for offtake in equity and having financing discussions with potential lenders. We also have our other Pacific Coast LNG opportunities, Phase 2 at ECA and Vista Pacifico. Both of these are in the early stages of development, but we see clear opportunities and excitement around these projects. So just as a reminder, per our planning convention, none of these projects have yet received positive FID. They're not included in our plan and represent upside to the plan in future earnings."", 'Jeffrey Walker Martin', ""So David, I would just conclude that with that additional work in terms of securing long lead time items and additional value engineering, we're focusing on trying to take FID on that project in this half of next year."", 'David Keith Arcaro', ""Perfect. Yes, very comprehensive. I'll leave it there and hand it over."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Carly Davenport from Goldman Sachs.', 'Carly S. Davenport', 'Maybe just to start, as we think about the 5-year capital plan increasing by the 20%, you reiterated the long-term growth rate up to 6% to 8%. But just curious, given the magnitude of that increase, how we should think about the rate base and earnings growth relative to that range over the current planning period?', 'Jeffrey Walker Martin', ""Well, it's interesting you asked that the rate base growth across both of our utilities will be approximately 10%, which is a little bit stronger than we forecasted a year ago. At the end of the planning period, those 2 platforms will have $78 billion of rate base. And we really view that really as the focus of the capital plan as we indicated, it captures over 90% of that $48 billion. What is of note is that there's an $8 billion increase over the prior plan and over half of that (inaudible) comes from the growth that we're seeing in Texas, which is really the strongest part of our story. But we continue to think that the most important thing is we have been messaging around a 6% to 8% growth rate for several years now. I think this type of visibility causes us to have additional confidence in that number. And one of the things I think that you and I have discussed before, if you look at Slide 10, at the last 5 or 6 years or go back over 10 years or 15 or 20, Sempra is one of those few companies that's been able to perform earnings per share growth in that 7% to 10% range over long periods of time. Now we're certainly forecasting the 6% to 8% on a go-forward basis. But the key takeaway from this plan is we have a lot of confidence in our ability to deliver that. I think as you've noted in your prior research, I've often indicated that I will be disappointed if we don't outperform the high end of that range."", 'Carly S. Davenport', ""That's super helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up on Texas. I think you mentioned in the slides planning for a 2% annual premise growth. Do you think that could be conservative just based on what you've seen recently and the different growth opportunities that you've seen in Texas?"", 'Jeffrey Walker Martin', ""Yes. I mentioned that over half of our planning increase came from Texas, and I wouldn't mind having Allen kind of walk us through where the system -- where the growth is showing up. The story in Texas, I think, which is quite unique. It's not just -- it's the diversity of the growth in Texas, not just on the premise side, and it's also the amount of it, Carly, that's allocated to transmission. I don't think there's another growth story in the United States that is majority of the CapEx is related to transmission. And the reason that's important is Allen's team has the lowest transmission distribution bills in the state and transmission projects because it benefits all rate payers in the state, gets socialized across all the different jurisdictions. But Allen, to Carly's point, maybe you could talk about premise growth but more broadly, the growth that showed up on the system."", 'E. Allen Nye', ""Yes, sure. Thanks, Jeff. And Carly, really great question given what we're seeing on our system. And as Jeff said and as I said in my opening remarks, we continue to see really very strong record-breaking growth across our system. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, premise growth remains very strong, 73,000 last year, a 14% increase year-over-year. From a transmission perspective, transmission points of interconnection, very large customers, connecting transmission voltage. We set new year-end records for new and active points of interconnection in '23. Total interconnections were up 25% year-over-year. New interconnections are up 19% year-over-year. And then we always break it down into retail and generation. Retail is up 13%, but I want to pause there on the 13%. So we go from 250 at the end of '22 to 282 at the end of '23. But something to Jeff's point, that's significant about our growth is not only the numbers but kind of the magnitude and the diversity of the customers. And so in these retail numbers of the 282 retail point of interconnection requests we presently have, 46 of those are between 300 megawatts and 2,600 megawatts individually in size. We actually have about 28 that are between 300 and 600 megawatts a piece, and we have about 18 that are between 600 and 2.6 gig. So very long -- very strong growth numerically, just in the increase of the numbers, but also what we're seeing is the size of the customers. On the generation interconnection side, we see an increase of 34% year-over-year. West Texas, we always talking about West Texas, continues to be a very strong story for us with the Far West Texas weather zone peak increasing by 16.6% year-over-year. The 2 transmission circuits or rather loops that we used to serve that part of the state. The Culberson Loop saw a peak that was almost 18% above the prior year's peak. And Stanton increased about 20% -- just under 24%. So really, really incredibly strong growth across our system, breakdown of CapEx, yes, breakdown of our $24.2billion. It's on Slide 48 of the appendix. Just to break it down a little further. We've got about $5.1 billion in distribution expansion, about $13.5 billion in transmission expansion, which is a point Jeff made moments ago, about $4.2 billion in maintenance capital and then about $1.4 billion in tech. And I think to Jeff's point, 3 things here just to conclude: one, 70%, a little over 70% actually of all this CapEx is pure growth capital. About 97% of this 5-year plan is subject to recovery through our trackers. And then to Jeff's point specifically, a little over 60% of all this capital we're talking about is transmission which obviously benefits everyone in the state. And therefore, it's spread across state evenly which helps us both to growth capital as well as the fact the heavy emphasis on transmission really allows us to stay where we want to be, which is among the low-cost providers in the state."", 'Operator', 'We now have time for 1 more question and it will be from Ryan Levine from Citi.', 'Ryan Michael Levine', ""Two questions. One on transmission. In the prepared remarks as mentioned, we should expect an update in late April for your -- the project that you're pursuing. Should we expect an outcome there? Or just further update as there's a range of potential scenarios that could play out in the coming weeks?"", 'Jeffrey Walker Martin', ""Thank you for that question, Ryan. I'll let Trevor respond."", 'Trevor Ian Mihalik', ""Sure, Jeff. Ryan, yes, I think we'll get a decision as to who's going to get selected in late April, and then there's 120 days for negotiations to happen for a final outcome. So I would say expect something over the next 4 months."", 'Ryan Michael Levine', ""Okay. And then on LNG, appreciate the clarification around the non-FTA permit extension for new applications. In terms of non-FTA permit extensions, is there a historical time line around how long that typically takes? And does the pause for new applications potentially accelerate the time line for extensions as there's allocation of resource issues?"", 'Jeffrey Walker Martin', ""No. We have used the extension process for different projects in the past. And I would say there's not a standard time line for that. I think we were just pleased to see the DOE confirm that it was a separate process for extensions rather than for new filings. The filing that we've made for Port Arthur Phase 2 is pending. We just have to wait through this process of the pause. But I think one of the points, Ryan, that Justin made in his discussion was we have a whole series of development milestones that we're pursuing for Port Arthur Phase 2. We think it's a very attractive commercially viable project. And I think those milestones we've worked through concurrently with the ultimate permitting process. So whether it ends up being a delay for the project where it's actually completed, consistent with the time line for other milestones remains to be seen."", 'Operator', ""That concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Jeff Martin for any additional closing remarks."", 'Jeffrey Walker Martin', 'I wanted to briefly thank everyone for joining us today. I know there are several competing calls and even conferences this morning. So we appreciate everyone making the time to join us. If there are any follow-up items, please reach out to our IR team with any questions. Thank you again, and this concludes our call.', 'Operator', 'Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.']"

These are usually conglomerates that make money operating in a number of businesses (think Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway). The purpose of diversification is to reduce risk by spreading investments across different assets, thereby minimizing the impact of any single stock or sector performing poorly. In 2023, global stock markets experienced significant growth, with particular attention on Wall Street's impressive performance. The U.S. stock market, being the largest globally, notably led the way with remarkable gains. The S&P 500 index surged by 24.2% in 2023 and the Nasdaq index witnessed an outstanding increase of 43.4%, achieving its highest annual gain since 2020. Despite initial expectations, the economy managed to evade a recession, and the stock market rally surpassed many predictions. However, analysts hold divergent views on what lies ahead for the stock market in 2024, offering a mixed outlook for the year."", 'Based on the positive trends observed last year, analysts are optimistic about the stock market\'s prospects for the current year, although they anticipate some minor declines along the way. A report from JP Morgan suggested that due to decreasing inflation in the US and the possibility of the Federal Reserve adopting more relaxed policies, there\'s growing discussion of a ""soft landing"" rather than a severe economic downturn or bear market. Leading indicators point to a slowdown in growth but not a complete collapse. Generally, equity markets tend to hit their lowest point well before economic conditions reach their worst, although there have been exceptions such as during the dot-com cycle. While there\'s still a risk of recession in the upcoming year, the key takeaway is that even if it does happen, it\'s likely to be mild, especially considering the support the Fed is providing to the banking system through increased liquidity. The report further mentioned that in 2023, earnings for the S&P 500 remained stagnant overall. However, they saw a significant increase of 33% for the seven largest companies, while the rest of the S&P 500 experienced a decline of 5%. Looking ahead to 2024, it appears to be a year characterized by slowing GDP growth, single-digit increases in earnings, and single-digit returns for the typical S&P 500 stock.', 'According to analysts at JP Morgan, investors should consider a diversified portfolio consisting of cash, long-term government bonds, high-quality corporate bonds, and equities. They also find the industrial and energy sectors appealing, particularly due to the industrial policies in the US. Analysts express positivity towards the energy sector primarily because it continues to offer attractive opportunities for earnings yield, dividends, and stock buybacks.', ""According to Bloomberg's 2024 Outlook report, numerous analysts are favoring dividend stocks as an investment choice for the current year. The strategists at Capital Group made the following statement:"", '“With investors swept up in the artificial intelligence fervor, valuations for dividend-paying stocks have quietly drifted toward multi-decade lows compared to the broader market. With growth expected to moderate in 2024, and the potential for recession lingering, dividends may take a more prominent role in driving total returns for investors.”', ""As previously stated, diversified companies play a crucial role in reducing risk. By investing in a diversified portfolio of dividend-paying companies across various sectors, investors can spread their risk and reduce exposure to any single company or industry's performance. Furthermore, dividend-paying companies tend to be more mature and financially sound, as they prioritize returning profits to shareholders. General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are some of the best diversified dividend stocks among others that are discussed below."", 'Photo by Sharon McCutcheon on Unsplash', 'Our Methodology:', 'For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of Q4 2023 and selected conglomerate firms that specialize in several different businesses and pay regular dividends to shareholders.

Revenues were US$62b, approximately in line with expectations, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) performed substantially better. EPS of US$6.58 were also better than expected, beating analyst predictions by 17%. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results."", ' View our latest analysis for Progressive ', ""Taking into account the latest results, the consensus forecast from Progressive's eleven analysts is for revenues of US$69.9b in 2024. This reflects a notable 13% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to soar 33% to US$8.77. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$70.1b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$8.71 in 2024. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results."", ""It will come as no surprise then, to learn that the consensus price target is largely unchanged at US$188. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. The most optimistic Progressive analyst has a price target of US$256 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$114. Note the wide gap in analyst price targets? This implies to us that there is a fairly broad range of possible scenarios for the underlying business."", ""These estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the Progressive's past performance and to peers in the same industry. We can infer from the latest estimates that forecasts expect a continuation of Progressive'shistorical trends, as the 13% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2024 is roughly in line with the 11% annual growth over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to see their revenues grow 5.8% per year. So it's pretty clear that Progressive is forecast to grow substantially faster than its industry."", ""The most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates. Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates."", 'Keeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider.

If you would like to skip our discussion on personal injury statistics, you can go to the 5 Best Personal Injury Lawyers in NYC.', 'Preventable injuries, like motor vehicle accidents, slips and falls, and medical malpractice, result in an alarming number of deaths in the United States. Personal Injury statistics reveal that in 2021, preventable injuries resulted in 200,000 deaths. Meanwhile, there were 6,102,936 reported vehicle accidents, with 38,680 causing serious injuries that proved fatal. This translates to a car crash death rate of 0.7%. The unfortunate trend reveals an increase in fatal car crashes in recent years, with the number rising by over 16% from 36,835 in 2018 to 42,795 in 2022.', 'Additionally, personal injury cases requiring medical treatment are on the rise, with 39.5 million cases reported every year in the USA, approximately 126.3 cases per 1000 individuals. This increase in cases has contributed to the personal injury lawyers market size reaching $59.8 billion as of 2024. The industry is expected to grow further due to factors like the increasing number of vehicle accidents and the aging population. As of 2024, the personal injury law industry in the USA employs over 183,000 individuals. Although there is significant competition among smaller firms, the key players in the industry control a substantial portion, with the top four companies contributing 32% of the market revenue.', ""With the increasing prevalence of personal injury cases, there is a growing demand for more personal injury lawyers in the market. One of the largest personal injury law firms in the US, Morgan & Morgan, has gained prominence, following the once highly popular Celino and Barnes. In the late 1990s, Celino and Barnes established their partnership, acquiring a memorable phone number that played a crucial role in their success. Their advertising strategy, featuring a catchy singsong tone promoting their phone number, resulted in widespread recognition. Celino and Barnes became widely known throughout New York, establishing themselves as the go-to legal team for personal injury cases. However, in May 2017, Ross Cellino Jr. initiated a lawsuit against his partner, Stephen Barnes, seeking to dissolve their firm. Despite the legal proceedings, the firm initially announced its intention to continue normal operations. However, by June 2017, they revealed ongoing conflicts in various business operations, including management, client selection, legal practice, and marketing strategies. Additionally, Barnes sought a restraining order in July 2017, alleging that Cellino attempted to recruit lawyers and cases from Celino & Barnes, contributing to the rift and ultimately leading to the company's downfall."", ""Moving forward, recent personal injury lawyer trends suggest a cautious approach among lawyers regarding national advertising campaigns. Legal professionals are mindful of potential effects on public perception and the overall image of the legal profession. National advertising efforts, especially in sensitive areas like personal injury law, can sometimes lead to public disdain, portraying lawyers as opportunistic or unprofessional. Such advertisements may pose a risk of damaging the reputation of lawyers, influencing potential clients negatively, and even impacting juries' views, thereby raising questions about the integrity of the legal profession. Consequently, personal injury lawyers are increasingly opting for targeted advertising strategies to maintain a positive reputation within the legal community."", 'You can also check out the Best Motorcycle Injury Lawyers in Each of 30 Biggest Cities in the US here.', 'The rise in the number of injury cases has also contributed to the growth of other industries, such as insurance. The increase in car accidents, resulting in approximately 6 million personal injuries annually in the US, has led to the growth of insurance companies. These businesses are responding to the rising demand for coverage and compensation following accidents. Among the leading players in the insurance industry are The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL), Progressive Corp (NYSE:PGR), and Chubb Limited (NYSE:CB).', ""Here's what Artisan Partners said about Progressive Corp (NYSE:PGR) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:"", '“The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) was also a strong performer this quarter. The period started poorly for Progressive as shares were down 13% on July 13. The company reported weak prior-year development in its first-half results as well as high costs for catastrophes. Claims inflation has been an industry problem, and investors feared Progressive would be unable to offset rising claims inflation through pricing, which could hurt policy growth. We added aggressively to our position on weakness given our confidence in Progressive’s low-cost model and excellent underwriting. Claims inflation is not a Progressive-specific issue, and we felt it would be able to pass on the costs and still retain its competitive advantage given its low-cost model. The company recently reported results that showed the business is recovering margin and still growing policies. The share price has more than recovered the July losses.”', 'Pixabay/Public domain', 'To compile our list of the best personal injury lawyers in NYC, we first conducted a comprehensive analysis of various Reddit threads, such as r/AskNYC and r/LawFirm, to gain insights from individuals’ first-hand experiences and shortlist the most well-known personal injury lawyers.

The company will not make detailed statements related to its results in addition to those provided in its annual report on Form 10-K and the letter to shareholders, which have been posted to the company's website.This quarter includes a presentation on a specific portion of our business, followed by a question-and-answer session with members of our leadership team.

These documents can be found via the Investor Relations section of our website at investors.progressive.com.To begin today, I am pleased to introduce our Customer Relationship President, Lori Niederst, who will kick us off with some introductory comments. Lori?"", 'Lori Niederst', ""Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. As Doug said, my name is Lori Niederst needers and I'm excited to be the first to participate in our new format. Traditionally, Tricia provides the opening comments for these presentations. But going forward, members of our leadership team will have the opportunity to speak to topics in our area of responsibility and introduce the talented individuals executing on these initiatives that we highlight during the event. In previous presentations, we've discussed our strategic pillars, which serve as the foundation of our vision.Today, we're focusing on one of those pillars, serving the broad needs of our customers. This pillar is synonymous with our strategy to become a destination company, providing products that meet our customers' changing needs throughout their lifetime. We seek to instill customer confidence in both the products and the prices that we offer. To set the stage for today's presentation, I thought it would be helpful to recap the history of Progressive's evolution as a destination company.Back in 2008, we publicly introduced our now ubiquitous customer segments, Sams, Dianes, Wrights and Robinsons. In 2014, we first spoke of our destination strategy, stating our intention to invest in the products, services and experiences to better serve customers from all 4 segments.Since then, we've had relentless focus on not only maintaining and growing the Sams, Dianes and Wrights who have always been well served by Progressive but significantly increasing our market share with Robinsons, which we estimate represent just under half of the personal insurance direct written premium in the United States. We've been very successful growing Robinsons who in December of 2023, accounted for just under 13% of our direct written premium. Countless efforts have contributed to Robinsons being our fastest-growing segment, but it was two strategic decisions that really drove our success.Even before the introduction of the destination strategy, in 2006, we began offering homeowners insurance from other carriers in our Progressive Advantage Agency, or PAA. What began as a small endeavor has evolved into HomeQuote Explorer, or HQX, where we now offer customers competitive homeowner rates from a lineup of reputable carriers. This success in Direct and our desire to grow Robinsons in the independent agent channel, led Progressive to purchase a stake and eventually fully acquire American Strategic Insurance. ASI, now branded Progressive Home, has enabled us to offer both underwritten home and auto bundles as well as partner bundles to significantly increase our appeal to the rights in Robinsons. We've since leveraged our learnings and success in bundling personal insurance products in the commercial market, where we continue to be an industry leader.In 2018, we first introduced BusinessQuote Explorer, or BQX, which enabled direct customers to purchase a variety of commercial insurance products from other carriers, and bundle with our Commercial Auto and BOP coverages. More recently, we're exploring this winning strategy in Personal Auto with AutoQuote Explorer, or AQX, which enables customers to compare rates and purchase products from other personal auto carriers on progressive.com. This gives us another avenue to serve more customers and cross-sell from our expanding portfolio of products. Customer bundling doesn't end with Home and Personal Auto, our Commercial Auto and BOP. We have a whole suite of offerings, which includes Progressive underwritten Special Lines, Renters and Umbrella products.By expanding our portfolio of products, we have continued to increase our addressable market and capture new business. The result of these efforts has been pretty incredible. We now estimate that 19% of households in the United States have at least one Progressive sold product, an increase of over 80% in the last 10 years. The benefits of these efforts on our business are far reaching. The top line growth from increased sales of Progressive underwritten products and commissions earned from sales of partner products is just the beginning. The more products the customer purchases from Progressive, the stickier the customer becomes leading to higher lifetime profits and lower per policy acquisition costs. Fueling the virtuous cycle that results in greater market share.But it's not just Progressive that benefits. We're making insurance easier for customers by providing options to meet their insurance and other financial needs now and in the future. Additionally, our industry-leading brand and acquisition engine provides growth opportunities for our partners. Making this destination strategy, a win-win-win. It's important to note that today, we're talking about the direct channel. Like many efforts Progressive has undertaken we often leverage the direct channel to test, learn and perfect new ideas. While doing so, we're always looking for ways to deploy our successes in Direct to benefit our independent agents. For decades, the agency channel has been vital to Progressive's growth and independent agents will continue to be the face of Progressive for millions of customers.While we're focusing on Direct today, we fully recognize that Robinsons are the largest segment of consumers served by independent agents in the United States, and we have a number of significant investments underway to continue our leadership in this channel and our partnership with our 40,000-plus independent agents. For a deeper dive into our evolution as a destination company, I'd like to introduce Kathy Lemieux, a 42-year Progressive veteran and our business leader for CRM Sales Experience. Kathy will share more detail on how we're leveraging our HQX, BQX and AQX platforms to provide choice and build customer confidence.Our second speaker is Sean Freeman. Sean is a business leader of our Comparison Rating Experience and Direct Property Quoting, who's been with Progressive for 14 years. He'll demonstrate the benefits of bundling and multi-product households and explain how these efforts will continue to drive Progressive's growth and profitability. Again, thank you for joining us today, and I'll now hand it over to Kathy."", 'Kathy Lemieux', ""Hello. I appreciate the opportunity to deliver some highlights on our progress toward achieving our destination company vision. Today, we'll focus on how the Progressive Advantage Agency is becoming a primary source for insurance products for consumers who prefer the direct channel. We strive to provide access to a broad portfolio of products, so customers begin and then keep their relationship with us without the need to look elsewhere. Let me begin by introducing the journey of Sam and Ashley, two actual Progressive customers. Back in 2009, when Sam first contacted Progressive, he was seeking insurance for his 1999 Saturn. Eventually, he bought a motorcycle, which needed insurance as well. Later, he married Ashley, and together, they acquired Renters Insurance until eventually, they bought a home, which required homeowners insurance.Both our Renters and Homeowners insurance policies were purchased through the Progressive Advantage Agency. In the case of Sam and Ashley, we were able to offer them different products as life events triggered the need for additional and more complex insurance coverage. We would have loved to sell a Progressive manufactured property product to the couple, but that wasn't the right solution for them. So we had other options ready. Let's talk more about that approach.Our multi-carrier marketplace for property and small business insurance products allows us to meet the needs of more and more customers. We are leveraging the Progressive brand, building on our industry-leading digital tools and working with a growing number of reputable carriers to make buying and maintaining insurance easier. This recipe is proving very successful delivering 200% growth in premiums written through our agency in less than a decade.Over the years, we've evolved the comparison shopping experience from Property to Commercial Lines from one carrier to many from the phone to the online channel and from Quote to also buy without agent intervention. While the large majority of our insurance customers start their shopping experience online, using our HomeQuote Explorer or BusinessQuote Explorer digital experiences, which launched after our shop by phone-only models, the majority work with our team of knowledgeable in-house agents to customize their policy before purchasing. As you've come to expect from Progressive, we continue to invest in improving the quote and buy experience, always focusing on the needs of our customers. We introduced a Digital Multi-carrier Quote experience, which we call HomeQuote Explorer in 2017. Over the course of the next several years, we made enhancements and introduce new features to improve the quote experience and the platform's efficiency.These efforts have generated close to a 10% increase in quote completions over early HQX results. One of our most recent changes was the introduction of a Quick Quote Experience, which displays prefilled data from third-party providers upfront so that customers can easily review and edit. Leveraging our proprietary models, we customize prompts and details to assist customers in selecting coverages and qualifying for discounts. This change alone decreased quote time by 20% and reducing the effort for customers and increasing their likelihood to purchase as a result. This is just one example of our work to simplify what has traditionally been a complicated shopping experience for both homeowners and small business owners. Our dedication to continuous improvement is bolstered by a rigorous A/B testing approach aimed at making a fully digital quote and purchase available to more shoppers.However, our in-house agents are always here to provide guidance and instill customer confidence. The investments in our HQX and BQX platforms only produce value when they're backed by a broad portfolio of products underwritten by reputable brands. Both the breadth of carriers in our network and the depth of their product suite have grown over the last decade. Presently, 13 carriers comprise our HomeQuote Explorer portfolio and 9 for BusinessQuote Explorer. There are major benefits to having a large contingent of carriers in the PAA which Sean will get into later, but there is also a risk because we are exposing Progressive customers and thus the Progressive brand to the services of another carrier.To protect our customers and the Progressive brand, we are selective about the carriers we partner with. They must meet our standards for customer care, they must offer a quality product at a fair price, pass our information security assessments and they must have the financial strength and standing to uphold the promise we make to customers that will be there when they need us most.Additionally, we'll consider a carrier's technological capabilities so that we can provide a seamless integrated digital customer experience for quoting and servicing. Also worthy of note is that our carrier networks include a number of companies that provide both property and small business insurance offers in HQX and BQX. We take pride in this fact as it demonstrates the strength of our mutually beneficial relationships. The benefits of our multi-carrier model extend far beyond quote and buy and are evident throughout the customer insurance journey for significant life changes, such as Sam and Ashley getting married and buying a house, perhaps experiencing a future job relocation or if they eventually need to ensure their teenage driver. Our agencies ready with the products they need and the customer service to help them navigate these events.Recall that Sam and Ashley added a home policy underwritten by one of our network carriers several years after acquiring their Progressive Auto Insurance and built a bundle, becoming one of the more than 1 million Robinsons we ensure through the PAA. The portfolio of products and carriers who underwrite them that are available to our customers allows us to grow more bundles over time.But even when the event isn't life changing, for example, a policy renewal accompanied by a steep rate increase, we are presented with an opportunity to support our customers by offering options, which gives us the chance to retain the customer. Often, we are able to anticipate customer shopping by leveraging our proprietary data models and proactively reach out to offer assistance. Even subtle nudges such as the e-mail presented here, reinforce the value our in-house agency offers. That leaves our longest running product comparison experience, Auto Insurance. More than 30 years ago, we introduced auto comparison rating as a fee-based service in California. Insurance products were much simpler in those days, so at the time, rates were manually calculated by a team of Progressive people who reverse engineered them from public filings. This industry altering idea proved to be a winner with customers, prompting us to make the service available countrywide and to build our brand on comparison rates.Our early marketing messages combine the ease and savings from one-stop rate comparison with a message of transparency. If our rate isn't the lowest, we'll tell you whose is? And challenging the status-quo not what you'd expect from an insurance company as early brand differentiators as Progressive and competitors advance their products, adding credit, underwriting and tiering, our precision in providing comparison rates declined. Consumers saw decreasing value in the range of rates we provided to adjust to these conditions.The next evolution of comparison rates came in 2016 when we began purchasing discrete auto rates from a third party. This model has proven to be a lower-cost way to provide a service that is to this day, valuable to our customers. Over the past 5 years, we've conducted dozens of tests leveraging comparison rates to improve customer experiences, increase Progressive conversion and monetize click referrals. Our decades of experience led us to take the next step in the auto rate comparison journey. AutoQuote Explorer. Bringing our CRE, HQX and consumer insights together, we've been piloting a multi-carrier auto quoting experience since the third quarter of 2022. We launched a Quote and Buy experience over the phone first and have refined the delivery with our in-house agents through several iterations.We're ready to introduce the AQX Experience online soon. The screens that you see on this page were developed using focus group and agent feedback when testing with prototypes. Early results give us confidence that the comparison quote and purchase experience with a reputable set of carriers will give us the opportunity to better meet consumer needs, starting new customer relationships in those cases where insurance shoppers would not purchase a Progressive policy, getting their auto insurance needs met elsewhere. Progressive continues to be known for providing comparison rates but our launch of AQX provides an opportunity to refine our brand positioning. The key is to generate interest by conveying that we've taken the hassle out of shopping for car insurance, while giving customers confidence in the products, prices and providers that we offer.But just like HQX and BQX, the customer value of AQX extends beyond the purchase and we continue to refine the benefit statements, taking advantage of our market research. Thank you again for the opportunity to speak today. I'll now hand it over to Sean. Sean?"", 'Sean Freeman', ""Thank you, Kathy. Following that overview of the operations of the Progressive Advantage Agency and the many unique shopping experiences we have deployed as part of it. I will now be walking you through the robust benefits of this Destination Era strategy. As Lori referenced earlier, any discussion about the benefits of the Progressive Advantage Agency should be viewed through the lens of a win-win-win strategy as we look to implement programs where all participants stand to benefit. As with everything we do at Progressive, our customers really come first. The PAA was created to ensure we had a full suite of insurance products within our direct channel that can meet consumer needs throughout their lifetime.But beyond just offering a broad collection of types of insurance, we look to ensure that our customers are confident in their purchases through education and choice. Being able to provide quotes for other insurance companies in addition to our own underwritten policies ensures that customers feel empowered in their decision and are confident with their price and coverage. Additionally, our customers benefit from the ease of the shopping experiences, with our best-in-class quoting capabilities, saving them time and frustration. When thinking about the benefits enjoyed by our participating network of carriers the list really starts with the access they gain to millions of qualified customers that were generated through Progressive's marketing and media efforts.Given the strength of the Progressive brand and our advertising experience, this can frequently be greater consideration or at bats than many of these participating brands would experience on their own. Progressive also understands what is critical to writing profitable business. So we allow the carriers on our network to apply any of their proprietary acceptance and pricing rules in addition to our strong adherence to any provided procedures as of their appointed agencies.Furthermore, Progressive has been a leader in innovative customer experiences, both off-line and online for many years. Being a part of our carrier network allows for leveraging these experiences to efficiently and effectively quote and bind customers which presumably leads to positive brand association for our participating carriers. Finally, the creation of the Progressive Advantage Agency creates a multitude of benefits for Progressive and our shareholders. I will be highlighting many of these in more details in the upcoming slides. But in general, this Destination Era Strategy allows us to achieve greater top line growth, better efficiency in our media spend, extends household retention and serves as a stable source of revenues complementary to our underwriting profits.As we have covered in past IR calls, Progressive has been focused for several years on expanding our addressable market and improving our penetration into multi-product households or Robinsons as well as increasing our product offerings outside of those traditionally underwritten by Progressive. In doing so, we have seen a steady trend up in our multi-product households on both an absolute and relative basis. Through our Progressive Advantage Agency, we are able to offer complementary products within a unified bundle experience. For example, in Personal Lines, we can offer renters and/or home insurance to go along with the customer's auto policy. Or in Commercial Lines where we are able to offer general liability or business owner policies to complement their commercial auto coverage. These are prime examples of how the internal agency is able to help us provide a full suite of insurance solutions to meet customer needs and in turn, help us grow.Another important component to our overall growth strategy is understanding how consumers view comparison quoting experiences. We know through our research that there are many key drivers of consumer consideration and ultimately, how they decide what insurance carriers they're going to receive a quote or purchase a policy from. Several of these considerations align nicely with the solutions that we are delivering as part of the Progressive Advantage Agency. This includes consumer confidence that they're getting the right coverage or rates, making the entire insurance process easy to navigate, feeling in control of their insurance decisions, getting good value and demonstrating an understanding of what is important to the consumers. Each of these drivers is met in some way through our comparison quoting experiences and agency operation, and will serve as guiding principles as we expand and refine our consumer messages and experiences.Along with the previous slide, these top of funnel benefits are foundational to the win-win-win dynamic that I started with. As these expand the total volume shopping with Progressive and thus leads to a greater pie to be shared by Progressive and our network of carriers. This offsets any minimal cannibalization risk that may be present through the providing of comparison quotes. With that said, we monitor very closely these trade-offs to ensure we achieve the most optimal outcomes. As highlighted in the last 2 slides, the Progressive Advantage Agency operation allows us to attract more customers at the top of the funnel and drive them to progressive.com or to our call centers.The next critical step is to get the most out of these interactions. Our multi-carrier model allows for a greater likelihood of returning competitive rates that meet consumers' needs. As the chart on the left indicates, by having more carrier appointments in a geography, we increase the likelihood that we can return at least 1 rate for our consumer. This is not surprising, but still critical in the face of greater underwriting restrictions for specific products such as homeowners.As a result of our carrier coverage, we were able to successfully provide a home or condo rate to more than 80% of all shoppers seeking these coverages on progressive.com in 2023. Additionally, we know that offering multiple comparison rates increases the chance we return a competitive rate to the customer. The chart on the right indicates that our conversion relativity is directly correlated with the number of rates we return. While there is diminishing return with every addition, we have seen more than a doubling of our conversion rate due to our portfolio of carriers as compared to a single carrier platform. This means more people finding a policy that works for them and more households having a relationship with Progressive.Transitioning from getting more customers in the door, I would like to highlight the value of the internal agency and maintaining these relationships through increased retention. As mentioned earlier, our goal is to meet customer needs throughout their lifetime. We hope that the policy we initially sell to a customer does just that. However, if this initial policy is no longer the best match, we have the ability to offer alternative carriers and coverage that may be a better fit. In doing so, we maintain a relationship with that customer and household longer. In the current environment, while rates are rising and underwriting is more restrictive, the ability to shop several carriers across the same product produces significant value to the customer and in turn Progressive.Within our homeowners portfolio, we see that we extend this household relationship 9 months longer on average as a result of this multi-carrier safe practice. The other form of retention benefits comes as a result of increasing the number of policies that exist within a household. Not only does selling an additional policy lead to increased sales and profit from those other policies, but the expected retention of the original policy also dramatically improves.Across all products within our portfolio, the policy life expectancy grows meaningfully as you add products to the relationship and by a magnitude of up to 2x or more. It is important to note that we see this retention improvement, whether they are Progressive underwritten policies or network carrier policies, leading us to believe that meeting all insurance needs is the driver of customer loyalty even if we leverage other insurance carriers to do so. Many of these benefits come together in what we call a media virtuous cycle. With access to a multicarrier model, we can offer consumers more choice that meets their needs. In doing so, this elevates our sales yield per visitor to progressive.com or into our call centers.Getting a more efficient return on every visitor to Progressive allows us to increase our media spend while still hitting our target economics. This increased spend drives greater awareness of Progressive offerings, driving traffic to progressive.com, our call centers as well as our appointed independent agents. This, in turn, increases the volume available to Progressive and the carriers within our network, incentivizing more carrier participation within our agency, strengthening the multi-carrier model further.This starts the cycle all over again. As we have especially seen in recent years, marketing spend is an important tool to stand out in the crowded insurance marketplace. This virtuous cycle is valuable to ensuring Progressive can rationally be in the top tier of marketing spenders and further widens the financial moat with lesser-known brands. The scaling of the Progressive Advantage Agency and its corresponding revenue expansion has several risk mitigating benefits. Commission revenue is a predictable annuity and has minimal exposure to the loss and cat risks that come along with underwriting insurance policies directly. This includes prominent risks such as weather and natural disasters.As agency compensation is really directly impacted by these risk exposures, this serves as a complementary source of revenue to our standard underwriting operation. Additionally, as previously highlighted, meeting more customer needs strengthens our brand and improves our sales yield, mitigating some of the standard competitive risk that insurance companies face. The many benefits that I've highlighted, stemming from the PAA can be found throughout our income statement. Our top line net premiums earned includes the premiums from our Progressive's underwritten products and is impacted by the agency's brand and consideration lift, the household retention improvements, increased additional protection sales and the increased media spend associated with the PAA operation.Additionally, our success is penetrating the Robinson customer segment roll up within these figures. As we have expanded our PAA operation and product offerings, we have experienced net earned premium growth for Robinsons that has outpaced that of our other customer segments. The service revenue line on the income statement includes the commissions earned from our carrier network. As the chart on the lower right demonstrates this is the most direct way to gauge the trajectory of our internal agency operation as it clearly shows our steady growth throughout the past decade. While all is not lost to me that this is an Investor Relations call, and thus, the financial results are the primary focus, the story of the Progressive Advantage Agency still really comes down to the customer journey and ensuring that we are offering products and services that meet our customers' needs.Kathy previously highlighted the journey of Sam and Ashley as they progress through their lives and the evolution of their insurance needs along the way. Without bringing together a network of insurance carriers who offer complementary products like BOP or Life Insurance, we may not have been in a position to satisfy all of these needs and possibly would have lost the household relationship entirely.Happily, this is not the case as we are pleased to be able to continue to build and grow our Progressive Advantage Agency with a full suite of insurance products and a network of participating carriers. And ultimately, we believe, make good on our win-win-win strategy of delivering value to our direct customers, our network of carriers and to Progressive and our shareholders through the operation of this best-in-class internal agency."", 'Douglas S. Constantine', ""This concludes the previously recorded portion of today's event. We now have members of our management team available live to answer questions, including presenters, Lori Niederst, Kathy Lemieux and Sean Freeman, who can answer questions about the presentation. The Q&A session will be audio only, (Operator Instructions). In order to get to as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up. We will now take our first question."", 'Operator', 'Our first question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski with BMO.', 'Michael David Zaremski', ""The first question regarding some of the commentary regarding kind of going back on the growth offensive given that profits are healed in a good chunk of your of our territories. So I guess on the last earnings call, I recall you alluded to growth likely being a little more subdued versus the beginning of '23 when you last found me offensive. So, I guess is that still the right way to think about things? Or any context around how you're thinking about growth, either by state or direct versus agency channel would be helpful?"", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""Yes. Thanks, Mike. Here's how we're thinking about growth right now, which is somewhat different and some like last year. So we went into 2023 feeling like we had the right rate in the system. Clearly, as the year unfolded, we realized that inflations were still going up, so they hadn't abated, and we needed more rate. So our sole concentration last year was to get the right rate on the street. And we feel like we're in a really great position right now. So if you think about the overarching believe that we have the right rates in the system, and we believe we do now understand there's all the caveats about we don't have every state. We're still working with some states to get rate. But for the most part, we feel really good about our rate. This is how we're thinking about growth, really sort of the trifecta.So we have a continued hard market. Ambient shopping is still up. So we know our competitors are still getting rate. So those customers are shopping and we're able to get that at a really inexpensive acquisition cost. Then we also know that we're unraveling a lot of our nonrate actions, our underwriting actions. We talked about that a little bit in November, but we're going to continue to do that. And then really the third part of that trifecta is our ability to be able to spend a lot on media. So we are really excited about heading into 2024. Obviously, my whole theme for the annual report was uncertainty. So, or the letter I should say, is uncertainty. We feel much more certain and much more confident we will watch as the data unfolds, and we're pretty excited.And the one caveat I would say, Mike, is when we're starting to look at first quarter of this year, versus first quarter of last year, you're going to see some really odd comparisons on new app growth. So we are growing new apps like crazy last year. In fact, on the Direct Side, our new apps were up 93%. Overall, in Auto up, I think, like 83% or 82%. So huge comparisons if you're going to compare it to this quarter. So keep that in mind as this quarter closes we believe it will smooth out over the year, but that's something we should just make a note of."", 'Michael David Zaremski', ""Okay. That's helpful. My last follow-up is regarding your commentary about segmentation and continuous product model delivery is the term you also use in the letter. And I appreciate that it's probably, some of this is your special sauce and you might be, you want to be limited to how much you can say. But I'm curious, if we look at Progressive frequency and severities but especially frequency over time. It tends to be better than the industry. I know there's different definitions. So you reminded us of frequency and severity, too? So we've got to be a little bit careful. But I Progressive still continues to do better than the industry on loss cost trends. Curious if you're willing to add any context about what what's driving the pricing segmentation? And is telematics a material kind of driver of you being able to do that?"", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""Yes. I mean I think our continuous product model is our secret sauce. Over the years, I think we've sort of shared not in a lot of detail, but how, each model sort of adds segmentation and gets us to where we want, especially with the preferred customer. UBI is a big part of it and has been for a long time, and that will continue to be and why we're investing more and more into our latest product model, which is our continuous. I think with the Florida added this year, we're at about 70% continuous, and we're learning a lot from that. And we'll be able to do a lot for our customers as well. So maybe at some time when we do some of the deep dives, we can share a little bit more about how we think about our (inaudible). We're never going to share a secret sauce because that is just that. But we literally have our R&D departments working in both Personal Lines, Commercial Lines and Property, nonstop, thinking about the next model to just get that extra piece of data to understand how it correlates to loss costs."", 'John Peter Sauerland', ""I can also add that you're right. When you look over even decades, you see our frequency being more favorable than the industry and severity being somewhat similar to the industry. And Tricia noted what we believe are some of the key drivers, but we are also continuing to shift the mix of our business to more preferred customers who generally have lower claims frequency. So, it's hard to parse out exactly which piece of those frequency trends are the aforementioned, but we should note that we're also moving more and more to preferred and that will drive the frequency down as well."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Bob Huang with Morgan Stanley.', 'Jian Huang', ""Maybe just a follow-up on one of the comments that you made when you earlier talked about you plan to spend a lot on media to drive growth. Can you maybe help us understand like when you say a lot, like how should we think about it from just a modeling of forecasting perspective because, the way we think about it, obviously, there's going to be a lot of growth potential for Progressive. How should we think about the impact on expense ratio? And as well as what is a ballpark target that you're thinking about when you're normalizing expense back to a more historical level?"", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""Yes, I would say back to more historical levels. We've had a couple, several rough years where we've had to pull back on media I mentioned that in my letter. They've been incredible. We have a media machine, a marketing machine and both are working really well, and we want to leverage that. We're not going to spend if we don't think it's efficient. When I talked about our growth in sort of the trifecta, we're getting a lot of ambient shopping still, and we'll continue to watch that. However, we think there's an opportunity to kind of open up the spigot and get more business in the door. We feel like we're in a really prime time now, especially with our rates.So while we're not going to share our full budget we believe we can spend assuming all things with our pricing is right and we get pricing and some rate in some of the states that we need, I think we'll be able to spend a tremendous amount to really leverage what we think could be a great growth year."", 'Jian Huang', ""Okay. That's very helpful. My second question, I think you addressed some of this in the prepared remarks. I just want to see if we can deep a little bit -- dig a little bit deeper into it is the broader competitive environment, and obviously, it seems like you made it very clear that you want to expand, especially in the off market, the bundled market Robinsons market, so to speak. But is there, can you maybe give us a more in-depth view on what are the competitors that are already in those position? What is the current environment look like for you to take share? Is it going to be, in your view, much more difficult than before? Or is the current environment a much easier competitive dynamic for you to grab market share, especially within the Robinsons market."", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""Yes. I think that has to do a lot with timing. So a lot of our competitors have increased rates as well pretty substantially. So there's a sort of a time frame. I don't know exactly when that is. But right now, we believe, we are able to take market share. Again, there'll be some, at some point, there'll be stable rates throughout the industry and there'll be less shopping. Really, the key for us in terms of market share will be to grab as much new business at or below our target market -- our target profit. And really, the holy grail is retention and keeping those customers. So the key this year for us because we've had so many years of rate after rate is to have some stability for our customers. They deserve that. We want that. Of course, we'll watch the trends, and we'll have to react to those trends. But I'd like some stable rates because I think if we've got the new business coming in the door and then people staying with us, that is a huge win.And then, of course, Robinsons, we've continued to grow. We're excited about continuing to invest in our HomeQuote Explorer and the Progressive Advantage Agency. Working with great partners in that."", 'Jian Huang', ""I think after all these years, we're all looking for some stability. So thank you for that."", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', 'Absolutely. Thanks, Bob.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America.', 'Joshua David Shanker', 'My first question, given the growth the company has had over the last couple of years, can you talk about what economy of scale has done to the other expense ratio?', 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""Well, I think any time you have an economy schedule, you'll be able to push down the expense ratio. We're always trying to balance out our expenses with investments and what the customers want. So digital and other things like that. So the bigger you get, I think the more you can -- whether it's brand or expenses you can push on that, but we have been investing a lot in digital for our customers, and we'll continue to do that. One of our other pillars, and we talked about broad coverage today is competitive prices. And the 2 parts of competitive prices are really what we talked about a little bit earlier with Mike's question, that's segmentation having industry-leading segmentation, understanding rate to risk.And the other is expenses. And we are constantly challenging ourselves to what's that right balance of investing, but getting those economies of scale. We'll continue to work on that for as long as I'm here for sure. And as long as John Sauerland is for sure."", 'John Peter Sauerland', ""Josh, sorry. As I think you know, we focus internally on what we call our nonacquisition expense ratio. So we talked a lot about media. We're always looking to optimize media relative to where we are in terms of rate adequacy and market opportunity on the non-acquisition expense ratio side, we're always looking to optimize costs. And of course, scale is a part of the way to do that. We have been successful in taking, if you look over the longer run, at least 4 points out of our cost structure on our nonacquisition expense ratio. Tricia mentioned, it's always a balance in investing and relative to the longer run, but we continue to expect to find opportunities to drive our non-acquisition expense ratio lower across all 3 of our businesses."", 'Joshua David Shanker', 'My other question at this point in the cycle where Progressive seems to be profitable and most of the competition is not. What does the marketplace look like for commissions right now? Both contingent commissions as well as base rate commissions?', 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""I can let Pat take that. I mean we, our commissions have been pretty stable, and we have different structures depending on if we have a platinum agent and some other programs we have with different agents I think, I don't want to speak too specifically to our competitors because they also ebb and flow."", 'Patrick K. Callahan', ""Yes. We've definitely seen competitors use commission cuts as a profitability or margin restoration lever. And we haven't done that. So we've maintained our commission. We do have a contingent component which self cures when we're not making money, and we think that's a superior design, because you're aligned incentives and when the business performs well, agents get paid well. And when it doesn't, we correct without having to change commission structures and contracts. So we built and deployed that and had that out in market. Now competitors who have pulled back, we know agents have long memories. And we think that will potentially hinder their ability to restore growth when they want to come back in the market later in '24 or beyond."", 'John Peter Sauerland', ""Robinson segment. So just for clarity, we do have different commission structures for our Platinum agencies to incent the bundle. And we think we're very competitive with the marketplace when it comes to compensating our independent agents for bundled business as well as monoline business. Fair to say."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.', 'Jamminder Singh Bhullar', 'So just following up on one of your earlier answers, you mentioned the app comparison, comp comparisons being tough and that will suppress growth in the app count in 1Q. Should we assume a similar trend for PIF growth as well to where it will be weaker in 1Q and improve year after? Or does that not apply to this growth?', 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""I don't think you're going to expect as much of a different trend in PIF than new apps. New apps were up just so much. Like I said, 92% in direct, 83% overall. It was just a tremendous quarter, and we actually tried to slow growth. So you're just going to see a little bit of a negative trend. But I think PIFs, of course, are not just new apps or also our retention. And our preferred year to growth is unit growth because as you've seen over these years where average written premium can go up and down, that's where you want the unit growth to be able to have that stable value company."", 'Jamminder Singh Bhullar', ""And the reason I was asking is PIF growth was good in 1Q, but it wasn't sort of outsized. I think you grew 5% in January, 7% in February and 10% in March in Personal Auto."", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""It's pretty darn good on our book. Yes, I would, anything with -- that begins with 1 and another number, I'm pretty impressed with PIF growth with the book of our size."", 'Jamminder Singh Bhullar', ""And then just following up on sort of competitor behavior. What are, I realize that you guys are not raising prices as much as many of your peers, because you started repricing your book earlier. But in terms of marketing spend, are you seeing competitors pull back on marketing spend as well as they're tying to revise profitability? Or are they continuing to market pretty heavy?"", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""No, I think we're seeing competitors reenter the market, and that's why we believe it's a good time. We're still seeing, like I said, some ambient shopping, but I think it's going to be a really competitive year for everyone, and we're excited about it."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Robert Cox with Goldman Sachs.', 'Robert Cox', ""Maybe start off with a little bit of a longer term question here, but Progressive is a growth company and has certainly been taking share and it seems like you'll be the market leader in personal auto in short order, if you're not already. Is there an internal view on the structural ceiling that Progressive can hold over time? Like is something around the 19% share that State Farm held in the early 2000s aspirational for Progressive? Or do you think you can gain more share than that?"", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""I mean we want to grow as much as we possibly can while we make at least $0.04 of underwriting profit. So we're going to continue -- we're not going to have a ceiling with that. What we will do is understand the addressable market. And kind of go across both -- all of our lines of business to understand where we need to invest, where we need to, where we think we can gain more share. And that's really why we diversify. That's really why we've had the HomeQuote Explorer, BusinessQuote Explorer, AutoQuote Explorer to be able to gather more market share, be transparent for our customers and give them an easy way to shop and save even if it's not with us. That's also one of the reasons why years ago, we set a construct together that -- we used this McKinsey construct that were called the 3 horizons.And the first one is execute. We've been working on that since 2016, 2017, and that is execute the heck out of growing or getting as much on private passenger auto and commercial auto and home business that we can as long as we're making money. And we've done extraordinarily well. They're obviously surpassing $61 billion in premiums for 2023. The second horizon is the exciting part in Commercial Lines where we've been growing our BMTs there, but we also have some expansion coverage that we're excited about. We just entered our 45th state with Florida last week. So very excited about that. We obviously bought Protective to have larger fleets. We're now calling Protective just so you know, Progressive Fleet and Specialty. And of course, our TNC business. So those ancillary products that where we believe we have the right to play and the right to win, and those have been really exciting expansion for Karen and her group.And then horizon 3 is a little bit further afield, but those are some products that we believe will fit unmet customer needs and you think kind of longer term out. So we're constantly in a cycle of 3 years, 5 years, 10 years. And in fact, we have our Board retreat later this week to outline how we intend to continue to grow market share across the board and do so in a profitable manner. So, we're excited about the future. We're excited about the position we're in at this point given the extreme amount of uncertainty in the last 4 years. And if there's any team that can do it, it is the team here in Cleveland, Ohio."", 'Robert Cox', ""Awesome. And maybe just on the first second question, I was just hoping you could walk us through some of the larger states that you're not yet rate adequate and what is the game plan for those states?"", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""Well, we're, it's typical, some of the typical states you've talked about on the coast, think of New Jersey, New York, California on the direct side. We just got a plus 20 on California agency. So that is a good move towards that. We're having continued conversations because this is really about the consumer. We want to have availability for each consumer to be able to get the coverage they need to protect the things that they love. And all we want to do is try to make $0.04 of underwriting profits. So we're going to continue to work with each insurance department to get the rate that we need and then be fully open and available for those consumers."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Forge.', 'Elyse Beth Greenspan', 'My first question, going back to the marketing, and I guess maybe a little bit tying into the PIF discussion. As you guys lay out the marketing budget for this year, Tricia, are you expecting it to be even throughout the 4 quarters? Like how do you think about the cadence of the marketing spend as you think about trying to acquire customers during 2024?', 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""Thanks, Elyse. So some of the marketing spend, we already like pre-buy. So that's sort of out there. And then other that we have like digital and some other areas where we can be more fluid will react to what's happening in the environment. So if we feel like that our [MP6] is down, which is our new prospects, we can increase it. We're always going to do it and try to be efficient around it. That's really the game plan. And again, it has to do with what our customers are doing -- I'm sorry, our competitors are doing. So it's not an easy question. We continually tweak it to make sure we're efficient while bringing as much new business in the door that we can and then we have some that will already be on the books. Do you want to add anything, Pat?"", 'Patrick K. Callahan', ""No, I would say we normally pace heavier in Q1 than we do in Q4 because of customer shopping. So just as Tricia said, we'll fish where the fish are. And when there's a lot of people out there in market, we want to advertise to make sure they know where available and to bring them to Progressive. As we've stated this year, we're opening up maybe a little slower than we did in 2023. So from a pacing perspective, we'll probably be more level between Q1, 2 and 3 than we historically would have been. But we also know that if the hard market prevails and continues, then we will want to continue to spend up to our allowables to capitalize on growth while people are looking for a new provider of auto home or commercial insurance."", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""Yes. I don't forget about our other lever, and that is opening up and unraveling our non-rate actions. So we've got a couple of different things in play, and that's the reason to believe, and our reason to believe that we can capture a lot of market share this year. So that's another avenue that we've continued to do since late last year."", 'Elyse Beth Greenspan', ""And then my follow-up, you guys saw favorable development in January. For the first time in a while, right, typically, that's a month right when you have late reporting claims from the prior year, what drove that development in January? And does that -- was that frequency or severity driven? I'm just wanting to get a sense that there would be some expectations for continuation of that better trend in '24?"", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""Yes. I would say the January decrease. The majority of that was Florida. Most of the other states were pretty tight. Again, it's 1 month, and we will let that year play out. Gary's team looks at a lot of data each and every month just to make sure were adequately reserved, and I'll let his team do that. It's very separate from. And I'd like Gary do the right thing on behalf of the company, but I wouldn't read too much into January. It's obviously, we're pleased to have favorable development, but it was mostly Florida."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.', 'David Kenneth Motemaden', 'So I had a question just on just -- Tricia, just how impactful you think unraveling some of the nonreactions can be on PIF growth? Just wondering relative to ads spend, historically, has there been more impact to PIF growth from bringing up or down marketing spend compared to non-rate actions? Or can you help size the potential for growth from rolling back those non-rate actions?', 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""It's really hard to size because I think I feel like we've never been tighter in our non-rate actions than we were last year. Again, it's hard to quantify because there's a bunch of different actions we'll do, and we'll do some on different products, different states. It could be different in channels. So it's hard to quantify. I think if you want to have a quicker reaction, the media spend to does that. But it's hard to discern exactly what would go into each. What we do know is we were really tight trying to slow growth, making sure we got rate in the system and now we're able to unwind that. But we're not doing it full bore. We're doing it very logically to make sure that we reach our target profit margins."", 'John Peter Sauerland', ""And I'd add, if we're looking towards PIF growth, new business is one driver, but retention is a far stronger driver of PIF growth. And as Tricia mentioned, we are, looking forward to more stable rates this year. We are feeling very adequate in most environments. So we have already enjoyed retention improvements, and we expect to continue to -- retention improvements. Competitors are certainly in a better place, but are continuing to raise rates as well. So on a competitiveness basis when the renewals come through, we think we're going to be in a good place, and that will help drive policy in force growth as well."", 'David Kenneth Motemaden', 'Got it. And that sort of leads into my follow-up is just last quarter, I think, Pat, you had said that PLEs and retentions were improving, but not at historical levels. Where are we at now? And just in -- just thinking about that because I recognize there is a tougher comp on new apps, but I would think the retention comp is also a little bit different as well. So how far away are we from historical retention? Just sort of thinking through some of the drivers of PIF growth.', 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""I don't know historical at the top of my head, David, but we're pretty excited about both the trailing 3 and trailing 12 PLE and where we are from a month. And we sort of have internally, David, here that we talk about the value of 1 month of PLE to our lifetime earned premium. I think we're pretty high."", 'John Peter Sauerland', ""Yes. We are not yet quite back to our all-time high for policy life expectancy. But we're getting there. And our trajectory is certainly indicating that we might be achieving new highs later in the year. We can't project that, obviously. But when you look at the charts, that's what you might conclude. So again, will depend upon the competitive environment. We think we're in a much more stable place, meaning not having to take nearly as much rate as we have historically. The market continues to rise, and we think it's going to play well to policyholder retention."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.', 'Ryan James Tunis', ""Could you just talk a little bit about, Tricia, I guess, across the book, how you're thinking about severity in 2024?"", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""Yes. I mean, I like the fact that severity seemed to moderate a little bit. And so we're hoping that it's a little bit benign. When you look at, last year, we were affected by fixing cars, and that seems to be a little bit calmer. So I think auto parts inflation is nearing 0 and auto services is in the kind of mid-single digits. So we're, that's how we're thinking about it. We'll obviously watch if something changed as they did last year. But I'm thinking -- I think benign and kind of moderate is what I would say from a severity perspective. And I feel the same way with (inaudible) right in the 8% to 10%."", 'Ryan James Tunis', ""Got it. And then I know last year, you kind of shared with us early in the year, I think it was a modest amount of rate that you expected to be taking over the year. You mentioned California, New Jersey, New York. Could you just give us maybe a placeholder for, I guess, what you're thinking in the aggregate, if you're able to get those, the rate in those states kind of yes, in the aggregate, what we'll be looking at in terms of rate increases in '24?"", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""Yes. I really can't share that because it's different with each state. We're in the midst of talking to the departments and showing our verification for needs for those rates. I can say is that we'll get what we need to, to be at our target profit margins, or won't be able to be as open, which is, like I said, unfortunate for consumers. For the rest of the country, we feel good at the rate we have gotten for the last several years. And so that's really what we're focusing on in addition to the conversations and negotiations with our departments."", 'Ryan James Tunis', ""Got it. And then just one more, if I could sneak it in. obviously, progress with the Robinson. Just curious what the geographic diversity of that book looks like versus your broader auto book. Is that still kind of heavily coastal or I guess it doesn't look like the broader agency book does?"", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', 'Are you thinking -- are you, Ryan, are you talking more like the property side of the Robinsons?', 'Ryan James Tunis', ""On the Auto. So yes, because of the property, it had been coastal, I'm wondering if it's starting to look more like the -- how you've historically seen the agency book?"", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""Yes. I think we're trying to make sure that -- well, there's Robinsons everywhere. So there could be a different value of the insurability of homes, et cetera. But yes, I think that, obviously, because Robinsons have a property feature to them, and we are getting into more nonvolatile states growth. You'll see Robinson growth in those states over time. But it will take some time. I mean we were still in the midst of moving our book a little bit away from Florida, as we discussed with our 115,000 nonrenewals that actually we set notices out in January, and those will start to nonrenew into another company that we're working with to take those should they want them in May, of this year. But yes, we're -- if you read all the data of our PIF growth, our premium growth and our new app growth in nonvolatile versus volatile, we are ahead of plan, but still a long way to go. We should grow Robinsons in those areas for sure."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Mike Ward with Citi.', 'Michael Augustus Ward', ""Just following up on Elyse's question, the Florida releases. Was that some of the litigation-related reserves from last year? And I guess, how are you feeling about those reserves in that kind of situation?"", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""It was mostly floor to kind of across the board, a couple of different things. Some were some settlements on glass, some from House Bill. So there was a couple of different inputs to the release, we are feeling positive about the tort reform change in Florida. And we're starting to see a little bit of that. I don't want to get ahead of my skis with that. But we believe, especially the new comp negligence law should be very helpful. But again, we'll watch that really closely because it's still new, and there's a lot of things that can unfold, but we're positive about the changes that have been made in Florida."", 'Michael Augustus Ward', 'Okay. And then on frequency, curious about frequency kind of like year-to-date? Just following the very favorable December.', 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""I don't, if I were looking at frequency, I would look at it more on the trailing 12 over current 12 and about 2% because there's a lot that goes into the data that you saw from this quarter in terms of mix. So John talked about that a little bit. We were really tight with our underwriting. So our mix of business is more preferred which causes less frequency of accidents. You'll hear this a lot. But since we're changing to a Gregorian calendar, a little bit of data in there. And then, of course, weather in December was really benign. So I would think that, and of course, we can't predict frequency or severity. But I would be thinking of frequency as more of reverting back to our normal trend ex all COVID, et cetera, the last 60 years, frequencies continue to decline a couple of points every year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Meyers Shields with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.', 'Meyer Shields', 'Two quick questions. First, Tricia, in the past, you talked about how the last sort of piece of the property puzzle was getting non-cat weather price correctly. Do you think that was the issue that kept you above the 96% in 2023?', 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""There's a lot of things that went to that. I'm trying to think of, I was just thinking of January, too, because some of the weather in January was actually nonvolatile. So there's weather just across the board here and there, nothing big with cats. But I would say a lot of things went into 2023. We didn't have the right rate. We're still working on our segmentation. We really, in earnest, just started to be able to de-risk especially in the really volatile states. And I think all those things together kind of put us where we were at the end of the year."", 'Meyer Shields', 'Okay. The second question is with regards to PAA. Is there any limitation on your -- like contractual locations on your ability to use the data from other companies?', 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""Yes. We are very -- we are -- it's a very important thing for the relationships to make sure that their proprietary data is just that, and we don't share it within other places at Progressive. So as an example, there's a company we've worked with for a long time. They're a great partner, and we actually bifurcate the monthly reports, the data because we think that is really important for everyone to have their algorithms and same with ours."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Jefferies.', 'Yaron Joseph Kinar', ""My first question ties back to Josh's questions on economies of scale and the improving expense ratio. How much room does that leave you guys to maybe increase your ad spend, marketing spend without really compromising on efficiencies and seeing significantly lower incremental returns there?"", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""Well, if you're talking about expense ratio, I would look, I probably look more directly at our direct expense ratio because that's we're going to hit some of the marketing spend. And it's pretty low, especially compared, maybe this isn't the right comparison. Especially compared to January of last year, it was like 4.5 points lower. So there will be pressure on the expense ratio. Even though the marketing spend will be efficient just because it's out there. And you'll see that I would follow the direct spend. If you look at December's direct loss ratio to January. I think December was a little bit over 12%. So you're going to start to see that when we put media our media budget into play."", 'Yaron Joseph Kinar', ""Right. I guess what I'm trying to get at here is if we go back, we'll see an expense ratio of roughly 20%, which is a mix of ad spend and other stuff. Can you essentially fill the ad spend bucket to get back to 20%? Or is the economies of scale so significant today that, that 20% rate is probably kind of not so relevant anymore?"", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""Yes. I mean, I'll let Pat add in. I think too, John talked a little bit about the nonacquisition expense rate. So I'll show acquisition. I'll let Pat weigh in a little bit. We are not going to spend just to spend to get up to the 20%. We're going to be efficient. Now for some reason, it gets up to 20%, and we are bringing great new business and huge amounts, and we feel great about. That could be one thing. And then we'll continue to focus on the pressuring non-acquisition expense ratio as one part of that formula. Do you want to add anything?"", 'Patrick K. Callahan', ""Yes. I think that's your characterization is spot on in that we have a hierarchy of levers that we pull in order to slow the business and in order to grow the business on the other side. So whether it's starting with reducing verification or opening up more favorable bill plans, then spending more then if we're doing all those and unable to drive conversion at a level that we want to grow, we would potentially lower rates at that point. But that's the hierarchy that we're reversing right now. And at this point, what's maybe a little deceiving is average premiums have gone up significantly due to the rate increases, which is driving down that expense ratio.So even if we got spending back to an absolute dollar basis, where we were in the past, you're not going to get your expense ratio back to where it was in the past. But to Tricia's point, our budget is governed by our ability to efficiently acquire customers against what we expect to be the lifetime value of that customer to Progressive and of course, to make sure we can deliver phenomenal claims and customer service and support the growth on that end. So I hope that helps in that we're not swinging back to 20%. What we're doing is unwinding some of the changes that we've made. Some have very little expense costs associated with them. Media, obviously, has a greater cost to it on the other side."", 'John Peter Sauerland', ""Sorry. I just wanted to give a little greater appreciation of how we spend. We do it in an extremely surgical and analytical manner. We have loads in our pricing by customer segment at a very finite level. And so we understand what we can spend to and meet our lifetime combined ratio targets on each customer segment. So, as we go into spend, we are not targeting an expense ratio. To Pat's point, we are being extremely surgical and targeted in going after customer segments where we know we can spend up to that allowable cost that we have priced into the product at the segment level. A little different approach than I think you're thinking."", 'Yaron Joseph Kinar', ""I think you just articulated than the way I was able to ask the questions. So thank you.My other question, if we could switch to the commercial book. I think you had some volatility in the TNC business last year, both in terms of the top line growth and more importantly, there's the loss ratio. Can you maybe give us an update where you are today, how comfortable you are with it? But kind of the trajectory you see there?"", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""Yes. So for the -- let me kind of talk about Commercial overall, and I'll get into the TNC part. So -- for our core commercial business, I feel much more positive where we are from a combined ratio perspective, especially with 16 points yet to earn in this year. And then I talked a little bit about some expansion products that we talked about like in horizon 2. So think of Progressive Fleet, think of TNC, think of our BOP. Those do put a little pressure on our core business, but we think it's important to invest in them. The TNC, we've continued to strengthen reserves, as you saw last year, and we'll have some rate increases that go into play significant ones this quarter. So we feel much better about it. And if you go back we have 20 states total between the 2 companies that we work with.But if you go back to where, we started with our first state in 2016. That knowledge that we've learned in the TNC business has really helped us. So each state is a little bit different depending on the maturity level of that. And a lot of what happened last year with the reserve strengthening, happened to be in 2 states, New Jersey and California and in coverages of UM and UIM. So that's where we're working to get the right rate to make sure we can reach our profit margin."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips with Oppenheimer.', 'Michael Wayne Phillips', ""I think I just have, well, maybe two. Just one. To what extent is the hard market in Personal Auto have any impact on the mix of customers that stay bundled. In other words, if there's more, maybe sticker shock in one versus the other? Are you seeing customers kind of get away from the desire to bundle?"", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""I mean, I think right now, customers are looking for price because it's gone up so much with everything else. So people do you like to bundle because you can also get a discount in most companies. The hard market for me I really equate to more just overall shopping. Just people get their renewals and they shop and can -- have we already got the rate in the system to get them. So we want to get auto, we want to get home and we want to get the bundled regardless of either one. Obviously, we care a lot about the bundle. But it's really, I think, customers dictate the market based on the trends they're seeing in their bills."", 'Michael Wayne Phillips', 'Okay. And then just separate, can you share any thoughts on loss trends in your Protective business that you did a couple of years ago? How is that looking? And any trends there?', 'Susan Patricia Griffith', 'Not really. No.', 'Michael Wayne Phillips', 'Okay. Nothing that stands out versus normal the smaller fleets, the smaller normal commercial business?', 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""No. We continue, we'll continue to grow. We've expanded our own fleet before Protective from 10 power units to 40 power units. We continue to expand. We continue to work on the integration of the acquisition we feel positive about the acquisition. And we have some rate in the system definitely for a Progressive Fleet, but nothing really more than that to share."", 'Operator', 'We have a follow-up question from the line of Meyer Shields with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.', 'Meyer Shields', 'I was just wondering whether the PAA commissions factor into either the 96% combined ratio target somehow? Or if there is a profit goal for that business?', 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""The commissions are just that. There's just commissions that come in the door that we've agreed with the companies and then there, of course, rating their auto or their home based on their rating algorithm."", 'John Peter Sauerland', 'They flow as a contract expense on the area in that combined ratio.', 'Operator', 'We have a follow-up question from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.', 'Elyse Beth Greenspan', 'Are you guys considering making any changes to your reinsurance program as it comes up for renewal this year?', 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""I think well, you saw what was outlined in the K with the Aggregate Program. And then our cat [tower] program is up for renewal in June, and we're working on that. Right now, actually, 2 of the people are in London, talking with our reinsurers, we feel like we'll have some positive results, come the June renewal."", 'John Peter Sauerland', ""Yes. So we don't have anything definitive to offer Elyse, but you can generally think of us targeting retention in generally the same area. I can't guarantee it will be exactly the same. We have, as we derisked the property portfolio been enjoying decreasing PMLs. So that helps us at the top of the tower because we might not have to buy as much. But generally speaking, you can think of the focus and the structure of the cat program at June 1 is very similar to what we have today."", 'Operator', 'We have a follow-up from the line of Michael Zaremski with BMO.', 'Michael David Zaremski', ""Just a quick follow-up. First, I heard you say, I think it was the first time you've said that you feel the recent Florida legislative performs are actually a positive. You gave some context around it. But just curious, are the reforms meaningful enough that it might cause you to change your derisking strategy in the state of Florida, which has been, I think, more home insurance centric?"", 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""No. I think what allows me to think about is being able to continue to grow there and not have so much litigation that puts pressure on the rest of the book. We still had, when we think about the derisking of the Florida property book. Half of those were rental properties, coastal properties. Those are things that I feel like we should have derisked anyway regardless. So I think you would do that anyway, and I wouldn't go back from that. I mean I think the reforms will be good overall just for the structure. And of course, again, I don't want to get out ahead of my skis, I want to kind of see how it pans out. But yes, I think that's what I would say. So we're seeing some small data signs that we believe it's good.Again, I want to give it some time. I want to derisk the book. And right now, we're open for business really in sported with new construction on homes, and that's it."", 'Operator', 'We have a follow-up from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore.', 'David Kenneth Motemaden', 'Just had a question on the 19 points of personal auto rate that you guys got last year. How much of that is still yet to earn in?', 'Susan Patricia Griffith', 'How much of that Pat, I think...', 'Patrick K. Callahan', ""At this point, I think we've probably got, I don't know, 8 to 9 points that are still earning in. I'd have to look at the table for details, but we got some big rate increases later in the year that we'll still earn in because we've got obviously 6 months and the 12-month policy renewals."", 'David Kenneth Motemaden', 'Got it. Understood. And then just on the ambient shopping levels, have you guys seen any changes in ambient shopping over the last several months?', 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""Yes. We've seen the increase in ambient shopping. And so we'll watch and see if that continues. And I think when some of our competitors get their rate in the system, like Pat has said, it depends on the competitor because some have 6-month policies, many have 12-month policies, which obviously takes a lot more time to earn in. I'm sure we'll see that diminish, but that's when we have all the other levers that we have for our growth.Let's wrap up after this."", 'Operator', 'A final question comes from the line of Michael Ward with Citi.', 'Michael Augustus Ward', 'Last but not least. I was just wondering the claims specialist in property, is that the increase in that number? Is that part of the customer value prop? Or is it something else?', 'Susan Patricia Griffith', ""I'm not clear on your question."", 'Michael Augustus Ward', 'The property claims specialist count increased? On the 10-K we noticed.', 'Patrick K. Callahan', 'Operating claims. Is that.', 'Susan Patricia Griffith', 'The growth for the head count growth?', 'Michael Augustus Ward', 'Yes.', 'Susan Patricia Griffith', 'Yes. So we are growing our ability to handle our own claims internally historically, especially when we first bought ASI, the majority of the claims that we handled were through independent adjusters. And while we still use a lot of independent adjusters for our appraisals, wanted to have that talent in-house. So that is the increase. Sorry, I did understand your question to begin with.

Since then, we've had relentless focus on not only maintaining and growing the Sams, Dianes, and Wrights who have always been well served by Progressive but significantly increasing our market share with Robinsons, which we estimate represent just under half of the personal insurance direct written premium in the United States. We've been very successful growing Robinsons who, in December of 2023, accounted for just under 13% of our direct written premium."", 'Countless efforts have contributed to Robinsons being our fastest-growing segment, but it was two strategic decisions that really drove our success. Even before the introduction of the destination strategy, in 2006, we began offering homeowners insurance from other carriers in our Progressive Advantage Agency, or PAA. What began as a small endeavor has evolved into HomeQuote Explorer Home, or HKX, where we now offer customers competitive homeowner rates from a lineup of reputable carriers. This success in direct and our desire to grow Robinsons in the independent agent channel led Progressive to purchase a stake and eventually fully acquire American Strategic Insurance.', ""ASI, now branded Progressive Home, has enabled us to offer both underwritten home and auto bundles, as well as partner bundles, to significantly increase our appeal to the Wrights and Robinsons. We've since leveraged our learnings and success in bundling personal insurance products in the commercial market where we continue to be an industry leader. In 2018, we first introduced BusinessQuote Explorer, or BQX, which enabled direct customers to purchase a variety of commercial insurance products from other carriers and bundle with our commercial auto and BOP coverages. More recently, we're exploring this winning strategy in personal auto with AutoQuote Explorer, or AQX, which enables customers to compare rates and purchase products from other personal auto carriers on progressive.com."", ""This gives us another avenue to serve more customers and cross-sell from our expanding portfolio of products. Customer bundling doesn't end with home and personal auto or commercial auto and BOP. We have a whole suite of offerings, which includes Progressive underwritten, special lines, renters, and umbrella products. By expanding our portfolio of products, we have continued to increase our addressable market and capture new business."", 'The result of these efforts has been pretty incredible. We now estimate that 19% of households in the United States have at least one Progressive-sold product, an increase of over 80% in the last 10 years. The benefits of these efforts on our business are far-reaching. The top-line growth from increased sales of Progressive underwritten products and commissions earned from sales of partner products is just the beginning.', ""The more products a customer purchases from Progressive, the stickier the customer becomes, leading to higher lifetime profits and lower per-policy acquisition costs, fueling the virtuous cycle that results in greater market share. But it's not just Progressive that benefits. We're making insurance easier for customers by providing options to meet their insurance and other financial needs now and in the future. Additionally, our industry-leading brand and acquisition engine provides growth opportunities for our partners, making this destination strategy a win, win, win."", ""It's important to note that today we're talking about the direct channel. Like many efforts, Progressive has undertaken, we often leverage the direct channel to test, learn, and perfect new ideas. While doing so, we're always looking for ways to deploy our successes in direct to benefit our independent agents. For decades, the agency channel has been vital to Progressive's growth, and independent agents will continue to be the face of Progressive for millions of customers."", ""While we're focusing on direct today, we fully recognize that Robinsons are the largest segment of consumers served by independent agents in the United States, and we have a number of significant investments underway to continue our leadership in this channel and our partnership with our 40,000-plus independent agents. For a deeper dive into our evolution as a destination company, I'd like to introduce Kathy Lemieux, a 42-year Progressive veteran and our business leader for CRM sales experience. Kathy will share more detail on how we're leveraging our HQX, BQX, and AQX platforms to provide choice and build customer confidence. Our second speaker is Sean Freeman."", ""Sean is a business leader of our comparison rating experience and direct property quoting who's been with Progressive for 14 years. He'll demonstrate the benefits of bundling and multiproduct households and explain how these efforts will continue to drive Progressive's growth and profitability. Again, thank you for joining us today, and I'll now hand it over to Kathy."", 'Kathy Lemieux -- Business Leader, CRM Sales Experience', ""Hello. I appreciate the opportunity to deliver some highlights on our progress toward achieving our destination company vision. Today, we'll focus on how the Progressive Advantage Agency is becoming a primary source for insurance products for consumers who prefer the direct channel. We strive to provide access to a broad portfolio of products, so customers begin and then keep their relationship with us without the need to look elsewhere."", 'Let me begin by introducing the journey of Sam and Ashley, two actual Progressive customers. Back in 2009, when Sam first contacted Progressive, he was seeking insurance for his 1999 Saturn. Eventually, he bought a motorcycle which needed insurance as well. Later, he married Ashley.', 'And together, they acquired renters insurance. Until eventually, they bought a home, which required homeowners insurance. Both their renters and homeowners insurance policies were purchased through the Progressive Advantage Agency. In the case of Sam and Ashley, we were able to offer them different products as life events triggered the need for additional and more complex insurance coverage.', ""We would have loved to sell a Progressive-manufactured property product to the couple, but that wasn't the right solution for them, so we had other options ready. Let's talk more about that approach. Our multi-carrier marketplace for property and small business insurance products allows us to meet the needs of more and more customers. We are leveraging the Progressive brand, building on our industry-leading digital tools, and working with a growing number of reputable carriers to make buying and maintaining insurance easier."", ""This recipe is proving very successful, delivering 200% growth in premiums written through our agency in less than a decade. Over the years, we've evolved the comparison shopping experience from property to commercial lines, from one carrier to many, from the phone to the online channel, and from quote to also buy without agent intervention. While the large majority of our insurance customers start their shopping experience online using our HomeQuote Explorer or BusinessQuote Explorer digital experiences, which launched after our shop-by-phone-only models, the majority work with our team of knowledgeable in-house agents to customize their policy before purchasing. As you've come to expect from Progressive, we continue to invest in improving the quote-and-buy experience, always focusing on the needs of our customers."", ""We introduced a digital multi-carrier quote experience, which we call HomeQuote Explorer in 2017. Over the course of the next several years, we made enhancements and introduced new features to improve the quoter experience and the platform's efficiency. These efforts have generated close to a 10% increase in quote completions over early HQX results. One of our most recent changes was the introduction of a quick quote experience which displays prefilled data from third-party providers upfront so that customers can easily review and edit."", 'Leveraging our proprietary models, we customized prompts and details to assist customers in selecting coverages and qualifying for discounts. This change alone decreased quote time by 20%, reducing the effort for customers and increasing their likelihood to purchase as a result. This is just one example of our work to simplify what has traditionally been a complicated shopping experience for both homeowners and small business owners. Our dedication to continuous improvement is bolstered by a rigorous A/B testing approach aimed at making a fully digital quote and purchase available to more shoppers.', ""However, our in-house agents are always here to provide guidance and instill customer confidence. The investments in our HQX and BQX platforms only produce value when they're backed by a broad portfolio of products underwritten by reputable brands. Both the breadth of carriers in our network and the depth of their product suite have grown over the last decade. Presently, 13 carriers comprise our HomeQuote Explorer portfolio and nine for BusinessQuote Explorer."", 'There are major benefits to having a large contingent of carriers in the PAA, which Sean will get into later, but there is also a risk because we are exposing Progressive customers and thus the Progressive brand to the services of another carrier. To protect our customers and the Progressive brand, we are selective about the carriers we partner with. They must meet our standards for customer care. They must offer a quality product at fair price, pass our information security assessments, and they must have the financial strength and standing to uphold the promise we make to customers that will be there when they need us most.', ""Additionally, we'll consider a carrier's technological capabilities so that we can provide a seamless, integrated, digital customer experience for quoting and servicing. Also worthy of note is that our carrier networks include a number of companies that provide both property and small business insurance offers in HQX and BQX. We take pride in this fact as it demonstrates the strength of our mutually beneficial relationships. The benefits of our multi-carrier model extend far beyond quote and buy and are evident throughout the customer insurance journey."", ""For significant life changes, such as Sam and Ashley getting married and buying a house, perhaps experiencing a future job relocation, or if they eventually need to insure their teenage driver, our agency is ready with the products they need and the customer service to help them navigate these events. Recall that Sam and Ashley added a home policy underwritten by one of our network carriers several years after acquiring their Progressive auto insurance and built a bundle, becoming one of the more than a million Robinsons we insure through the PAA. The portfolio of products and carriers who underwrite them that are available to our customers allows us to grow more bundles over time. But even when the event isn't life-changing, for example, a policy renewal accompanied by a steep rate increase, we're presented with an opportunity to support our customers by offering options which gives us the chance to retain the customer."", ""Often, we're able to anticipate customer shopping by leveraging our proprietary data models and proactively reach out to offer assistance. Even subtle nudges, such as the email presented here, reinforce the value our in-house agency offers. That leaves our longest-running product comparison experience, auto insurance. More than 30 years ago, we introduced auto comparison rating as a fee-based service in California."", 'Insurance products were much simpler in those days. So at the time, rates were manually calculated by a team of Progressive people who reverse-engineer them from public filings. This industry-altering idea proved to be a winner with customers, prompting us to make the service available countrywide and to build our brand on comparison rates. Our early marketing messages combine the ease and savings from one-stop rate comparison with a message of transparency.', ""If our rate isn't the lowest, we'll tell you whose is and challenging the status quo, not what you'd expect from an insurance company, as early brand differentiators. As Progressive and competitors advance their products, adding credit underwriting and tiering, our precision in providing comparison rates declined. Consumers saw decreasing value in the range of rates we provided to adjust to these conditions. The next evolution of comparison rates came in 2016 when we began purchasing discrete auto rates from a third party."", ""This model has proven to be a lower-cost way to provide a service that is, to this day, valuable to our customers. Over the past five years, we've conducted dozens of tests, leveraging comparison rates to improve customer experiences, increase Progressive's conversion, and monetize click referrals. Our decades of experience led us to take the next step in the auto rate comparison journey, AutoQuote Explorer. Bringing our CRE, HQX, and consumer insights together, we've been piloting a multi-carrier auto quoting experience since the third quarter of 2022."", ""We launched a quote-and-buy experience over the phone first and have refined the delivery with our in-house agents through several iterations. We're ready to introduce the AQX experience online soon. The screens that you see on this page were developed using focus group and agent feedback when testing with prototypes. Early results give us confidence that the comparison, quote, and purchase experience with a reputable set of carriers will give us the opportunity to better meet consumer needs, starting new customer relationships in those cases where insurance shoppers would not purchase a Progressive policy, getting their auto insurance needs met elsewhere."", ""Progressive continues to be known for providing comparison rates, but our launch of AQX provides an opportunity to refine our brand positioning. The key is to generate interest by conveying that we've taken the hassle out of shopping for car insurance while giving customers confidence in the products, prices, and providers that we offer. But just like HQX and BQX, the customer value of AQX extends beyond the purchase, and we continue to refine the benefits statements, taking advantage of our market research. Thank you again for the opportunity to speak today."", ""I'll now hand it over to Sean. Sean?"", 'Sean Freeman -- Business Leader, Direct Progressive Agency Experience', 'Thank you, Kathy. Following that overview of the operations of the Progressive Advantage Agency and the many unique shopping experiences we have deployed as part of it, I will now be walking you through the robust benefits of this destination era strategy. As Lori referenced earlier, any discussion about the benefits of the Progressive Advantage Agency should be viewed through the lens of a win, win, win strategy as we look to implement programs where all participants stand to benefit. As with everything we do at Progressive, our customers really come first.', ""The PAA was created to ensure we had a full suite of insurance products within our direct channel that can meet consumer needs throughout their lifetime. But beyond just offering a broad collection of types of insurance, we look to ensure that our customers are confident in their purchases through education and choice, Being able to provide quotes for other insurance companies, in addition to our own underwritten policies, ensures that customers feel empowered in their decision and are confident with their price and coverage. Additionally, our customers benefit from the ease of these shopping experiences with our best-in-class quoting capabilities, saving them time and frustration. When thinking about the benefits enjoyed by our participating network of carriers, the list really starts with the access they gain to millions of qualified customers that were generated through Progressive's marketing and media efforts."", 'Given the strength of the Progressive brand and our advertising experience, this can frequently be greater consideration or at-bats than many of these participating brands would experience on their own. Progressive also understands what is critical to writing profitable business, so we allow the carriers on our network to apply any of their proprietary acceptance and pricing rules, in addition to our strong adherence, to any provided procedures asked of their appointed agencies. Furthermore, Progressive has been a leader in innovative customer experiences, both off-line and online, for many years. Being a part of our carrier network allows for leveraging these experiences to efficiently and effectively quote and bind customers, which presumably leads to positive brand association for our participating carriers.', 'Finally, the creation of the Progressive Advantage Agency creates a multitude of benefits for Progressive and our shareholders. I will be highlighting many of these in more details in the upcoming slides. But in general, this destination era strategy allows us to achieve greater top-line growth, better efficiency in our media spend, extends household retention, and serves as a stable source of revenues, complementary to our underwriting profits. As we have covered in past IR calls, Progressive has been focused for several years on expanding our addressable market and improving our penetration into multi-product households or Robinsons, as well as increasing our product offerings outside of those traditionally underwritten by Progressive.', ""In doing so, we have seen a steady trend-up in our multi-product households on both an absolute and relative basis. Through our Progressive Advantage Agency, we are able to offer complementary products within a unified bundle experience. For example, in personal lines, we can offer renters and our home insurance to go along with the customer's auto policy or in commercial lines where we are able to offer general liability or business owner policies to complement their commercial auto coverage. These are prime examples of how the internal agency is able to help us provide a full suite of insurance solutions to meet customer needs, and in turn, help us grow."", ""Another important component to our overall growth strategy is understanding how consumers view comparison quoting experiences. We know through our research that there are many key drivers of consumer consideration and ultimately how they decide what insurance carriers they're going to receive a quote or purchase a policy from. Several of these considerations align nicely with the solutions that we are delivering as part of the Progressive Advantage Agency. This includes consumer confidence that they're getting the right coverage or rates, making the entire insurance process easy to navigate, feeling in control of their insurance decisions, getting good value, and demonstrating an understanding of what is important to the consumers."", 'Each of these drivers is met in some way through our comparison quoting experiences and agency operation and will serve as guiding principles as we expand and refine our consumer messages and experiences. Along with the previous slide, these top-of-funnel benefits are foundational to the win, win, win dynamic that I started with as these expand the total volume shopping with Progressive and thus leads to a greater pie to be shared by Progressive and our network of carriers. This offsets any minimal cannibalization risk that may be present through the providing of comparison quotes. With that said, we monitor very closely these trade-offs to ensure we achieve the most optimal outcomes.', ""As highlighted in the last two slides, the Progressive Advantage Agency operation allows us to attract more customers at the top of the funnel and drive them to progressive.com or to our call centers. The next critical step is to get the most out of these interactions. Our multi-carrier model allows for a greater likelihood of returning competitive rates that meet consumers' needs. As the chart on the left indicates, by having more carrier appointments in a geography, we increase the likelihood that we can return at least one rate for a consumer."", 'This is not surprising but still critical in the face of greater underwriting restrictions for specific products, such as homeowners. As a result of our carrier coverage, we were able to successfully provide a home or condo rate to more than 80% of all shoppers seeking these coverages on progressive.com in 2023. Additionally, we know that offering multiple comparison rates increases the chance we return a competitive rate to the customer. The chart on the right indicates that our conversion relativity is directly correlated with the number of rates we return.', 'While there is diminishing return with every addition, we have seen more than a doubling of our conversion rate due to our portfolio of carriers as compared to a single carrier platform. This means more people finding a policy that works for them and more households having a relationship with Progressive. Transitioning from getting more customers in the door, I would like to highlight the value of the internal agency and maintaining these relationships through increased retention. As mentioned earlier, our goal is to meet customer needs throughout their lifetime.', 'We hope that the policy we initially sell to a customer does just that. However, if this initial policy is no longer the best match, we have the ability to offer alternative carriers and coverage that may be a better fit. In doing so, we maintain a relationship with that customer and household longer. In the current environment, while rates are rising and underwriting is more restrictive, the ability to shop several carriers across the same product produces significant value to the customer and in turn Progressive.', 'Within our homeowners portfolio, we see that we extend this household relationship nine months longer, on average, as a result of this multi-carrier-safe practice. The other form of retention benefits comes as a result of increasing the number of policies that exist within a household. Not only does selling an additional policy lead to increased sales and profit from those other policies, but the expected retention of the original policy also dramatically improves. Across all products within our portfolio, the policy life expectancy grows meaningfully as you add products to the relationship and by a magnitude of up to two times or more.', 'It is important to note that we see this retention improvement, whether they are Progressive underwritten policies or network carrier policies, leading us to believe that meeting all insurance needs is the driver of customer loyalty, even if we leverage other insurance carriers to do so. Many of these benefits come together in what we call a media virtuous cycle. With access to a multi-carrier model, we can offer consumers more choice that meets their needs. In doing so, this elevates our sales yield per visitor to progressive.com or into our call centers.', ""Getting a more efficient return on every visitor to Progressive allows us to increase our media spend while still hitting our target economics. This increased spend drives greater awareness of Progressive's offerings, driving traffic to progressive.com, our call centers, as well as our appointed independent agents. This, in turn, increases the volume available to Progressive and the carriers within our network, incentivizing more carrier participation within our agency, strengthening the multi-carrier model further. This starts the cycle all over again."", 'As we have especially seen in recent years, marketing spend is an important tool to stand out in the crowded insurance marketplace. This virtuous cycle is valuable to ensuring Progressive can rationally be in the top tier of marketing spenders and further widens the financial moat with lesser-known brands. The scaling of the Progressive Advantage Agency and its corresponding revenue expansion has several risk-mitigating benefits. Commission revenue is a predictable annuity and has minimal exposure to the loss and cat risks that come along with underwriting insurance policies directly.', ""This includes prominent risks, such as weather and natural disasters. As agency compensation is rarely directly impacted by these risk exposures, this serves as a complementary source of revenue to our standard underwriting operation. Additionally, as previously highlighted, meeting more customer needs strengthens our brand and improves our sales yield, mitigating some of the standard competitive risks that insurance companies face. The many benefits that I've highlighted stemming from the PAA can be found throughout our income statement."", ""Our top-line net premiums earned includes the premiums from our Progressive underwritten products and is impacted by the agency's brand and consideration lift, the household retention improvements, increased additional protection sales, and the increased media spend associated with the PAA operation. Additionally, our successes penetrating the Robinson customer segment roll up within these figures. As we have expanded our PAA operation and product offerings, we have experienced net earned premium growth for Robinsons that has outpaced that of our other customer segments. The service revenue line on the income statement includes the commissions earned from our carrier network."", ""As the chart in the lower right demonstrates, this is the most direct way to gauge the trajectory of our internal agency operation as it clearly shows our steady growth throughout the past decade. While it is not lost on me that this is an investor relations call and thus the financial results are the primary focus, the story of the Progressive Advantage Agency still really comes down to the customer journey and ensuring that we are offering products and services that meet our customers' needs. Kathy previously highlighted the journey of Sam and Ashley as they progressed through their lives and the evolution of their insurance needs along the way. Without bringing together a network of insurance carriers who offer complementary products like BOP or life insurance, we may not have been in a position to satisfy all of these needs and possibly would have lost the household relationship entirely."", 'Happily, this is not the case as we are pleased to be able to continue to build and grow our Progressive Advantage Agency with a full suite of insurance products and a network of participating carriers. And ultimately, we believe make good on our win, win, win strategy of delivering value to our direct customers, our network of carriers, and to Progressive and our shareholders through the operation of this best-in-class internal agency.', 'Doug Constantine', ""This concludes the previously recorded portion of today's event. We now have members of our management team available live to answer questions, including presenters, Lori Niederst, Kathy Lemieux, and Sean Freeman, who can answer questions about the presentation. [Operator instructions]"", '', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski with BMO. Your line is open.', 'Mike Zaremski -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst', 'Hey, great. Good morning. Thanks. The first question is regarding some of the commentary regarding -- kind of going back on the growth offensive, given that profits are healed in a good chunk of your territories.', ""So I guess on the last earnings call, I recall you alluded to growth likely being a little more subdued versus the beginning of '23 when you -- when you last went on the offensive. So I guess is that still the right way to think about things? Or any context around how you're thinking about growth, either by state or direct versus agency channel would be helpful."", 'Tricia Griffith -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. Thanks, Mike. Here's how we're thinking about growth right now, which is somewhat different and somewhat alike last year. So we went into 2023 feeling like we had the right rate in the system."", ""Clearly, as the year unfolded, we realized that inflation was still going up, so that hadn't abated, and we needed more rate. So our sole concentration last year was to get the right rate on The Street, and we feel like we're in a really great position right now. So if you think about the overarching belief that we have the right rates in the system, and we believe we do. Now understand there's all the caveats about we don't have every state."", ""We're still working with some states to get rate. But for the most part, we feel really good about our rate. This is how we're thinking about growth, really sort of the trifecta. So we have a continued hard market."", ""Ambient shopping is still up, so we know our competitors are still getting rate, so those customers are shopping, and we're able to get that at a really inexpensive acquisition cost. Then we also know that we're unraveling a lot of our non-rate actions, our underwriting actions. We talked about that a little bit in November, but we're going to continue to do that. And then really, the third part of that trifecta is our ability to be able to spend a lot on media."", ""So we are really excited about heading into 2024. Obviously, my whole theme for the annual report was uncertainty, so -- the letter, I should say, is uncertainty. We feel much more certain and much more confident we will watch as the data unfolds, and we're pretty excited. The one caveat I would say, Mike, is when we're starting to look at first quarter of this year versus first quarter of last year, you're going to see some really odd comparisons on new app growth."", ""So we were growing new apps like crazy last year. In fact, on the direct side, our new apps were up 93%. Overall, on auto, up I think like 83% or 82%, so huge comparisons if you're going to compare it to this quarter. So keep that in mind, as this quarter closes, we believe it will smooth out over the year, but that's something we should just make a note of."", 'Mike Zaremski -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst', ""OK, that's helpful. My last follow-up is regarding your commentary about segmentation and continuous product model delivery is the term you also use in the letter. And I appreciate that it's probably some of this is your special sauce, and you want to be -- might want to be limited in how much you can say. But curious if we look at Progressive's frequency and severity, especially frequency, over time, it tends to be better than the industry."", ""I know there's different definitions. You reminded us of frequency and severity, too, so we got to be a little bit careful. But I think Progressive still continues to do better than the industry on loss cost trend. Curious if you're willing to add any context about what -- what's driving the pricing segmentation."", 'And is telematics a material kind of driver of you being able to do that. Thanks.', 'Tricia Griffith -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. I mean, I think our continuous product model is our secret sauce. Over the years, I think we've sort of shared, not in a lot of detail, but how each model sort of adds segmentation and gets us to where we want, especially with the preferred customer. UBI is a big part of it and has been for a long time, and that will continue to be and why we're investing more and more into our latest product model, which is our continuous."", ""I think with Florida added, this year, we're at about 70% continuous, and we're learning a lot from that, and we'll be able to do a lot for our customers as well. So -- and maybe at some time when we do some of the deep dives, we can share a little bit more about how we think about our product models. We're never going to share our secret sauce because that is just that, but we literally have our R&D departments working in both personal lines, commercial lines, and property nonstop, thinking about the next model to just get that extra piece of data to understand that and how it correlates to loss costs."", 'John Sauerland -- Chief Financial Officer', ""I'd also add that, you're right, when you look over, even decades, you see our frequency being more favorable than the industry and severity being somewhat similar to the industry. And Tricia noted what we believe are some of the key drivers, but we are also continuing to shift the mix of our business to more preferred customers who generally have lower claims frequency. So it's hard to parse out exactly which piece of those frequency trends are the aforementioned, but we should note that we're also moving more and more to preferred, and that will drive the frequency down as well."", 'Mike Zaremski -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Huang with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.', 'Bob Huang -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', ""Hi. Thank you. Maybe just a follow-up on one of the comments that you made when you earlier talked about you plan to spend a lot on media to drive growth. Can you maybe help us understand when you say a lot, how should we think about it from just a modeling and forecasting perspective? Because the way we think about it, obviously, there's going to be a lot of growth potential for Progressive."", ""How should we think about the impact on expense ratio? And as well as what is a ballpark target that you're thinking about when you're normalizing expense back to a more historical level?"", 'Tricia Griffith -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah, I would say back to more historical levels, we've had a couple -- several rough years we've had to pull back on media. I mentioned that in my letter. They've been incredible. We have a media machine, a marketing machine, and both are working really well."", ""And we want to leverage that. We're not going to spend if we don't think it's efficient. So when I talked about our growth and sort of the trifecta, we're getting a lot of ambient shopping still, and we'll continue to watch that. However, we think there's an opportunity to kind of open up the spigot and get more business in the door."", ""We feel like we're in a really prime time now, especially with our rate. So while we're not going to share our full budget, we believe we can spend, assuming all things with our pricing is right and we get some pricing and some rate and some of the states that we need, I think we'll be able to spend a tremendous amount to really leverage what we think could be a great growth year."", 'Bob Huang -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', ""OK. Thanks, thanks. That's very helpful. My second question, I think you addressed some of this in a prepared remark."", 'I just want to see if we can deep a little bit -- dig a little bit deeper into it is that the broader competitive environment. And obviously, it seems like you made it very clear that you want to expand, especially in the off-market, the bundled market, Robinsons market, so to speak. But is there -- can you maybe give us a more in-depth view on what are the competitors that are already in those position? What does the current environment look like for you to take share? Is it going to be, in your view, much more difficult than before? Or is the current environment a much easier competitive dynamic for you to grab market share, especially within the Robinsons market?', 'Tricia Griffith -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah, I think that has to do a lot with timing. So a lot of our competitors have increased rates as well pretty substantially, so there's a sort of a time frame. I don't know exactly when that is. But right now, we believe we are able to take market share."", ""Again, there'll be some -- at some point, there'll be stable rates throughout the industry, and there'll be less shopping. Really, the key for us in terms of market share will be to grab as much new business at or below our target market -- or target profit. And really, the holy grail is retention then keeping those customers. So the key this year for us because we've had so many years of rate after rate is to have some stability for our customers."", ""They deserve that. We want that. Of course, we'll watch the trends, and we'll have to react to those trends. But I'd like some stable rates because I think if we've got the new business coming in the door and then people staying with us, that is a huge win."", ""And then, of course, Robinsons, we've continued to grow. We're excited about continuing to invest in our HomeQuote Explorer and the Progressive Advantage Agency working with great partners in that."", 'Bob Huang -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', ""OK. Thank you very much. I think after all these years, we're all looking for some stability. So thank you for that."", 'Tricia Griffith -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Absolutely. Thanks, Bob.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Your line is open.', 'Josh Shanker -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Yeah. Hi there. Thank you for taking my question. My first question, given the growth of companies ad over the last couple of years, can you talk about what economies of scale has done to the other expense ratio?', 'Tricia Griffith -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Well, I think anytime you have economies of scale, you'll be able to push down the expense ratio. We're always trying to balance out our expenses with investments and what the customers want, so digital and other things like that. So the bigger you get, I think the more you can -- whether it's brand or expenses, you can push on that. But we have been investing a lot in digital for our customers, and we'll continue to do that."", ""One of our other pillars, we talked about broad coverage today, is competitive price. And the two parts of competitive prices are really what we talked about a little bit earlier with Mike's question. That's segmentation, having industry-leading segmentation, understanding rate to risk, and the other is Expenses. And we are constantly challenging ourselves to what's the right balance of investing but getting those economies of scale."", ""And we'll continue to work on that for as long as I'm here, for sure, and as long as John Sauerland is, for sure."", 'John Sauerland -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Josh, I think -- sorry, as I think you know, we focus internally on what we call our non-acquisition expense ratio. So we talked a lot about media. We're always looking to optimize media relative to where we are in terms of rate adequacy and market opportunity. On the non-acquisition expense ratio side, we're always looking to optimize costs."", ""And of course, scale is a part a way to do that. We have been successful in taking, if you look over the longer run, at least four points out of our cost structure on our non-acquisition expense ratio. Tricia mentioned it's always a balance in investing and relative to the longer run, but we continue to expect to find opportunities to drive our non-acquisition expense ratio lower across all three of our businesses."", 'Josh Shanker -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'My other question. At this point in the cycle where Progressive seems to be profitable and most of the competition is not, what does the marketplace look like for commissions right now, both contingent commissions, as well as base rate commissions?', 'Tricia Griffith -- Chief Executive Officer', ""I can let Pat take that. I mean, we are our commissions have been pretty stable, and we have different structures, depending on if we have a platinum agent and some other programs we have with different agents. I think -- I don't want to speak too specifically to our competitors because they also ebb and flow."", 'Pat Callahan -- President, Personal Lines', ""Yeah. We've definitely seen competitors use commission cuts as a profitability or margin restoration lever, and we haven't done that. So we've maintained our commission. We do have a contingent component which self-cures when we're not making money, and we think that's a superior design because you're aligned incentives."", ""And when the business performs well, agents get paid well. And when it doesn't, we correct without having to change commission structures and contracts. So we've built and deployed that and had that out in market. Now competitors who have pulled back, we know agents have long memories, and we think that will potentially hinder their ability to restore growth when they want to come back in the market later in '24 or beyond."", 'Josh Shanker -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Thank you for the answers.', 'John Sauerland -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Robinsons segments, so just for clarity, we do have different commission structures for our platinum agencies to incent the bundle. And we think we're very competitive with the marketplace when it comes to compensating our independent agents for bundle business, as well as model line business, fair to say."", 'Josh Shanker -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', 'Yeah. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with J.P. Morgan.', 'Your line is open.', 'Jimmy Bhullar -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'Hi. Good morning. So just following up on one of your earlier answers, you mentioned the app comparison, comp comparisons being tough and that will suppress growth in the app count in 1Q. Should we assume a similar trend for PIF growth as well to where it will be weaker in 1Q and improve year after? Or does that not apply to PIF growth?', 'Tricia Griffith -- Chief Executive Officer', ""I don't think you're going to expect as much of a different trend in PIF than new apps. New apps were up just so much. Like I said, 92% in direct, 83% overall. It was just a tremendous quarter and we actually tried to slow growth."", ""So you're just going to see a little bit of a negative trend. But I think PIFs, of course, are not just new apps or also our retention. And our preferred year to growth is unit growth because as you've seen over these years where average written premium can go up and down, that's where you want the unit growth to be able to have that stable value company."", 'Jimmy Bhullar -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', ""And the reason I was asking is PIF growth was good in 1Q, but it wasn't sort of outsized. I think you grew 5% in January, 7% in February, and 10% in March in personal auto. And then just following up --"", 'Tricia Griffith -- Chief Executive Officer', ""It's pretty good on our book. Yes, I would -- anything with -- that begins with one and another number. I'm pretty impressed with PIF growth with the book of our size."", 'Jimmy Bhullar -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', ""OK. And then just following up on sort of competitor behavior. What are -- I realize that you guys are not raising prices as much as many of your peers, because you started repricing your book earlier. But in terms of marketing spend, are you seeing competitors pull back on marketing spend, as well as they're trying to revive profitability? Or are they continuing to market pretty heavy?"", 'Tricia Griffith -- Chief Executive Officer', ""No, I think we're seeing competitors reenter the market, and that's why we believe it's a good time. We're still seeing, like I said, some ambient shopping, but I think it's going to be a really competitive year for everyone, and we're excited about it."", 'Jimmy Bhullar -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Tricia Griffith -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Cox with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.', 'Robert Cox -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', ""Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Maybe start off with a little bit of a longer-term question here, but Progressive is a growth company and has certainly been taking share and it seems like you'll be the market leader in personal auto in short order, if you're not already. Is there an internal view on the structural ceiling that Progressive can hold over time? Like is something around the 19% share that State Farm held in the early 2000s aspirational for Progressive? Or do you think you can gain more share than that?"", 'Tricia Griffith -- Chief Executive Officer', ""I mean, we want to grow as much as we possibly can while we make at least $0.04 of underwriting profit. So we're going to continue, we're not going to have a ceiling with that. What we will do is understand the addressable market. And kind of go across both, all of our lines of business to understand where we need to invest, where we need to, where we think we can gain more share."", ""And that's really why we diversify. That's really why we've had the HomeQuote Explorer, BusinessQuote Explorer, AutoQuote Explorer to be able to gather more market share, be transparent for our customers, and give them an easy way to shop and save even if it's not with us. That's also one of the reasons why years ago, we set a construct together that we used this McKinsey construct that were called the Three Horizons. And the first one is execute."", ""We've been working on that since 2016, 2017, and that is execute the heck out of growing or getting as much on private passenger auto and commercial auto and home business that we can as long as we're making money. And we've done extraordinarily well. They're obviously surpassing $61 billion in premiums for 2023. The second horizon is the exciting part in commercial lines where we've been growing our BMTs there, but we also have some expansion coverage that we're excited about."", ""We just entered our 45th state with Florida last week. So very excited about that. We obviously bought Protective to have larger fleets. We're now calling Protective just so you know, Progressive fleet and specialty."", ""And of course, our TNC business. So those ancillary products that where we believe we have the right to play and the right to win, and those have been really exciting expansion for Karen and her group. And then Horizon 3 is a little bit further afield, but those are some products that we believe will fit unmet customer needs and you think kind of longer-term out. So we're constantly in a cycle of three years, five years, 10 years."", ""And in fact, we have our board retreat later this week to outline how we intend to continue to grow market share across the board and do so in a profitable manner. So we're excited about the future. We're excited about the position we're in at this point given the extreme amount of uncertainty in the last four years. And if there's any team that can do it, it is the team here in Cleveland, Ohio."", 'Robert Cox -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', ""Awesome. Thank you so much for that. And maybe just on the second question, I was just hoping you could walk us through some of the larger states that you're not yet rate adequate and what is the game plan for those states?"", 'Tricia Griffith -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Well, we're, it's typical, some of the typical states you've talked about on the coast, think of New Jersey, New York, California on the direct side. We just got a plus 20 on California agency. So that is a good move toward that. We're having continued conversations because this is really about the consumer."", ""We want to have availability for each consumer to be able to get the coverage they need to protect the things that they love. And all we want to do is try to make $0.04 of underwriting profits. So we're going to continue to work with each insurance department to get the rate that we need and then be fully open and available for those consumers."", 'Robert Cox -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst', 'Thanks.', 'Tricia Griffith -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.', 'Elyse Greenspan -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', 'Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, going back to the marketing, and I guess maybe a little bit tying into the PIF discussion. As you guys lay out the marketing budget for this year, Tricia, are you expecting it to be even throughout the four quarters? Like how do you think about the cadence of the marketing spend as you think about trying to acquire customers during 2024?', 'Tricia Griffith -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Thanks, Elyse. So some of the marketing spend, we already like pre-buy. So that's sort of out there. And then other that we have like digital and some other areas where we can be more fluid will react to what's happening in the environment."", ""So if we feel like that our MP6 is down, which is our new prospects, we can increase it. We're always going to do it and try to be efficient around it. That's really the game plan. And again, it has to do with what our customers are doing -- I'm sorry, our competitors are doing."", ""So it's not an easy question. We continually tweak it to make sure we're efficient while bringing as much new business in the door that we can and then we have some that will already be on the books. Do you want to add anything, Pat?"", 'Pat Callahan -- President, Personal Lines', ""No, I would say we normally pace heavier in Q1 than we do in Q4 because of customer shopping. So just as Tricia said, we'll fish where the fish are. And when there's a lot of people out there in market, we want to advertise to make sure they know where available and to bring them to Progressive. As we've stated this year, we're opening up maybe a little slower than we did in 2023."", ""So from a pacing perspective, we'll probably be more level between Q1, Q2, and Q3 than we historically would have been. But we also know that if the hard market prevails and continues, then we will want to continue to spend up to our allowables to capitalize on growth while people are looking for a new provider of auto home or commercial insurance."", 'Tricia Griffith -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes, I don't forget about our other lever, and that is opening up and unraveling our non-rate actions. So we've got a couple of different things in play, and that's the reason to believe, and our reason to believe that we can capture a lot of market share this year. So that's another avenue that we've continued to do since late last year."", 'Elyse Greenspan -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', ""And then my follow-up, you guys saw favorable development in January. For the first time in a while, right, typically, that's a month right when you have late reporting claims from the prior year, what drove that development in January? And does that, was that frequency or severity driven? I'm just wanting to get a sense that there would be some expectations for continuation of that better trend in '24."", 'Tricia Griffith -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Yes. I would say the January decrease. The majority of that was Florida. Most of the other states were pretty tight.', ""Again, it's one month, and we will let that year play out. Gary's team looks at a lot of data each and every month just to make sure were adequately reserved, and I'll let his team do that. It's very separate from. And I'd like Gary do the right thing on behalf of the company, but I wouldn't read too much into January."", ""It's obviously, we're pleased to have favorable development, but it was mostly Florida."", 'Elyse Greenspan -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.', 'David Motemaden -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', 'Hi, good morning. So I had a question just on just -- Tricia, just how impactful you think unraveling some of the non-reactions can be on PIF growth? Just wondering relative to ad spend, historically, has there been more impact to PIF growth from bringing up or down marketing spend compared to non-rate actions? Or can you help size the potential for growth from rolling back those non-rate actions?', 'Tricia Griffith -- Chief Executive Officer', ""It's really hard to size because I think I feel like we've never been tighter in our non-rate actions than we were last year. Again, it's hard to quantify because there's a bunch of different actions we'll do, and we'll do some on different products, different states. It could be different in channels. So it's hard to quantify."", ""I think if you want to have a quicker reaction, the media spend does that. But it's hard to discern exactly what would go into each. What we do know is we were really tight trying to slow growth, making sure we got rate in the system and now we're able to unwind that. But we're not doing it full bore."", ""We're doing it very logically to make sure that we reach our target profit margins."", 'John Sauerland -- Chief Financial Officer', ""And I'd add, if we're looking toward PIF growth, new business is one driver, but retention is a far stronger driver of PIF growth. And as Tricia mentioned, we are looking forward to more stable rates this year. We are feeling very adequate in most environments. So we have already enjoyed retention improvements, and we expect to continue to enjoy retention improvements."", ""Competitors are certainly in a better place but are continuing to raise rates as well. So on a competitiveness basis when the renewals come through, we think we're going to be in a good place, and that will help drive policy in force growth as well."", 'David Motemaden -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', 'Got it. Thanks for that. And that sort of leads into my follow-up is just last quarter, I think, Pat, you had said that PLEs and retentions were improving, but not at historical levels. Where are we at now? And just in -- just thinking about that because I recognize there is a tougher comp on new Apps, but I would think the retention comp is also a little bit different as well.', 'So how far away are we from historical retention? Just sort of thinking through some of the drivers of PIF growth.', 'Tricia Griffith -- Chief Executive Officer', ""I don't know historical at the top of my head, David, but we're pretty excited about both the trailing three and trailing 12 PLE and where we are from a month. And we sort of have internally, David here that we talk about the value of one month of PLE to our lifetime earned premium. I think we're pretty high."", 'John Sauerland -- Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes. We are not yet quite back to our all-time high for policy life expectancy. But we're getting there. And our trajectory is certainly indicating that we might be achieving new highs later in the year."", ""We can't project that, obviously. But when you look at the charts, that's what you might conclude. So again, will depend upon the competitive environment. We think we're in a much more stable place, meaning not having to take nearly as much rate as we have historically."", ""The market continues to rise, and we think it's going to play well to policyholder retention."", 'David Motemaden -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst', 'Understood. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.', 'Ryan Tunis -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst', ""Hey, thanks. Good morning. Could you just talk a little bit about, Tricia, I guess, across the book, how you're thinking about severity in 2024?"", 'Tricia Griffith -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes. I mean, I like the fact that severity seemed to moderate a little bit. And so we're hoping that it's a little bit benign. When you look at, last year, we were affected by fixing cars, and that seems to be a little bit calmer."", ""So I think auto parts inflation is nearing 0 and auto services is in the kind of mid-single-digits. So we're, that's how we're thinking about it. We'll obviously watch if something changed as they did last year. But I'm thinking, I think benign and kind of moderate is what I would say from a severity perspective."", 'And I feel the same way with buy right in the 8% to 10%.', 'Ryan Tunis -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst', ""Got it. And then I know last year, you kind of shared with us early in the year, I think it was a modest amount of rate that you expected to be taking over the year. You mentioned California, New Jersey, New York. Could you just give us maybe a placeholder for, I guess what you're thinking in the aggregate, if you're able to get those, the rate in those states kind of yes, in the aggregate, what we'll be looking at in terms of rate increases in '24?"", 'Tricia Griffith -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes. I really can't share that because it's different with each state. We're in the midst of talking to the departments and showing our verification for needs for those rates. All I can say is that we'll get what we need to, to be at our target profit margins, or won't be able to be as open, which is like I said, unfortunate for consumers."", ""For the rest of the country, we feel good at the rate we have gotten for the last several years. And so that's really what we're focusing on, in addition to the conversations and negotiations with our departments."", 'Ryan Tunis -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst', 'Got it. And then just one more, if I could sneak it in. obviously, progress with the Robinsons. Just curious what the geographic diversity of that book looks like versus your broader auto book.', ""Is that still kind of heavily coastal or I guess it doesn't look like the broader agency book does?"", 'Tricia Griffith -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Are you thinking, are you, Ryan, are you talking more like the property side of the Robinsons?', 'Ryan Tunis -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst', ""On the auto. So yes, because of the property, it had been coastal. I'm wondering if it's starting to look more like the -- how you've historically seen the agency book."", 'Tricia Griffith -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes. I think we're trying to make sure that -- well, there's Robinsons everywhere. So there could be a different value of the insurability of homes, etc. But yes, I think that, obviously, because Robinsons have a property feature to them and we are getting into more nonvolatile states growth, you'll see Robinsons growth in those states over time, but it will take some time."", ""I mean, we were still in the midst of moving our book a little bit away from Florida, as we discussed, with our 115,000 non-renewals that actually we set notices out in January, and those will start to non-renew into another company that we're working with to take those, should they want them, in May of this year. But yes, we're -- if you read all the data of our PIF growth, our premium growth, and our new app growth in nonvolatile versus volatile, we are ahead of plan but still a long way to go. But we should grow Robinsons in those areas, for sure."", 'Ryan Tunis -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Ward with Citi. Your line is open.', 'Mike Ward -- Citi -- Analyst', ""Thanks. Good morning. Just following up on Elyse's question, the Florida releases, was that some of the litigation-related reserves from last year? And I guess how are you feeling about those reserves in that kind of situation?"", 'Tricia Griffith -- Chief Executive Officer', ""It was mostly floor to kind of across the board, a couple of different things. Some were some settlements on glass, some from House Bill, so there was a couple of different inputs to the release. We are feeling positive about the tort reform change in Florida, and we're starting to see a little bit of that. I don't want to get ahead of my skis with that."", ""But we believe -- especially the new comp negligence law should be very helpful. But again, we'll watch that really closely because it's still new, and there's a lot of things that can unfold, but we're positive about the changes that have been made in Florida."", 'Mike Ward -- Citi -- Analyst', 'OK. Thanks. And then on frequency, curious about frequency kind of like year to date, just following the very favorable December.', 'Tricia Griffith -- Chief Executive Officer', ""I don't -- if I were looking at frequency, I would look at it more on the trailing 12 over current 12 and about 2% because there's a lot that goes into the data that you saw from this quarter in terms of mix. So John talked about that a little bit. We were really tight with our underwriting. So our mix of business is more preferred which causes less frequency of accidents."", ""You'll hear this a lot. But since we're changing to a Gregorian calendar, there is a little bit of data in there. And then, of course, weather in December was really benign. So I would think that, and of course, we can't predict frequency or severity."", 'But I would be thinking of frequency as more of reverting back to our normal trend, ex all COVID, etc. The last 60 years, frequencies continue to decline a couple of points every year.', 'Mike Ward -- Citi -- Analyst', 'Great. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with Keefe, Bruyette and Woods. Your line is open.', 'Meyer Shields -- Keefe, Bruyette and Woods -- Analyst', 'Great. Thank you so much. Two quick questions. First, Tricia, in the past, you talked about how the last sort of piece of the property puzzle was getting non-cat weather price correctly.', 'Do you think that was the issue that kept you above the 96% in 2023?', 'Tricia Griffith -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Well, there's a lot of things that went to that. I'm trying to think of -- I was just thinking of January, too, because some of the weather in January was actually nonvolatile. So there's weather just across the board here and there, nothing big with cats. But I would say a lot of things went into 2023."", ""We didn't have the right rate. We're still working on our segmentation. We really in earnest just started to be able to derisk especially in the really volatile states, and I think all those things together kind of put us where we were at the end of the year."", 'Meyer Shields -- Keefe, Bruyette and Woods -- Analyst', 'OK. The second question is with regards to PAA. Is there any limitation on your like contractual limitations on your ability to use the data from other companies?', 'Tricia Griffith -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes. We are very -- we are -- it's a very important thing for the relationships to make sure that their proprietary data is just that, and we don't share it within other places of Progressive. So as an example, there's a company we've worked with for a long time. They're a great partner, and we actually bifurcate the monthly reports, the data because we think that is really important for everyone to have their algorithms and same with ours."", 'Meyer Shields -- Keefe, Bruyette and Woods -- Analyst', 'OK, perfect. Thank you so much.', 'Tricia Griffith -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Welcome.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. [Operator instructions] Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Your line is open.', 'Yaron Kinar -- Jefferies -- Analyst', ""Thank you. Good morning, everybody. My first question ties back to Josh's questions on economies of scale and the improving expense ratio. How much room does that leave you guys to maybe increase your ad spend, marketing spend without really compromising on efficiencies and seeing significantly lower incremental returns there?"", 'Tricia Griffith -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Well, if you're talking about expense ratio, I would look, I probably look more directly at our direct expense ratio because that's we're going to hit some of the marketing spend. And it's pretty low, especially compared, maybe this isn't the right comparison. Especially compared to January of last year, it was like 4.5 points lower. So there will be pressure on the expense ratio."", ""Even though the marketing spend will be efficient just because it's out there. And you'll see that I would follow the direct spend. If you look at December's direct loss ratio to January. I think December was a little bit over 12%."", ""So you're going to start to see that when we put our media budget into play."", 'Yaron Kinar -- Jefferies -- Analyst', ""Right. I guess what I'm trying to get at here is if we go back, we'll see an expense ratio of roughly 20%, which is a mix of ad spend and other stuff. Can you essentially fill the ad spend bucket to get back to 20%? Or is the economies of scale so significant today that that 20% rate is probably kind of not so relevant anymore?"", 'Tricia Griffith -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes. I mean, I'll let Pat add in. I think to John talked a little bit about the non-acquisition expense rate. So I'll show acquisition."", ""I'll let Pat weigh in a little bit. We are not going to spend just to spend to get up to the 20%. We're going to be efficient. Now for some reason, it gets up to 20%, and we are bringing great new business and huge amounts, and we feel great about."", ""That could be one thing. And then we'll continue to focus on the pressuring non-acquisition expense ratio as one part of that formula. Do you want to add anything?"", 'Pat Callahan -- President, Personal Lines', ""Yes. I think that's your characterization is spot on in that we have a hierarchy of levers that we pull in order to slow the business and in order to grow the business on the other side. So whether it's starting with reducing verification or opening up more favorable bill plans, then spending more than if we're doing all those and unable to drive conversion at a level that we want to grow, we would potentially lower rates at that point. But that's the hierarchy that we're reversing right now."", ""And at this point, what's maybe a little deceiving is average premiums have gone up significantly due to the rate increases, which is driving down that expense ratio. So even if we got spending back to an absolute dollar basis, where we were in the past, you're not going to get your expense ratio back to where it was in the past. But to Tricia's point, our budget is governed by our ability to efficiently acquire customers against what we expect to be the lifetime value of that customer to Progressive and of course, to make sure we can deliver phenomenal claims and customer service and support the growth on that end. So I hope that helps in that we're not swinging back to 20%."", ""What we're doing is unwinding some of the changes that we've made. Some have very little expense costs associated with them. Media, obviously has a greater cost to it on the other side."", 'John Sauerland -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Sorry. I just wanted to give a little greater appreciation of how we spend. We do it in an extremely surgical and analytical manner. We have loads in our pricing by customer segment at a very finite level.', ""And so we understand what we can spend to and meet our lifetime combined ratio targets on each customer segment. So as we go into spend, we are not targeting an expense ratio to Pat's point, we are being extremely surgical and targeted in going after customer segments where we know we can spend up to that allowable cost that we have priced into the product at the segment level. A little different approach than I think you're thinking."", 'Yaron Kinar -- Jefferies -- Analyst', ""I think you just articulated than the way I was able to ask the questions. So thank you, my other question, if we could switch to the commercial book. I think you had some volatility in the TNC business last year, both in terms of the top-line growth and more importantly, there's the loss ratio. Can you maybe give us an update where you are today, how comfortable you are with it? But kind of the trajectory you see there?"", 'Tricia Griffith -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes. So for the, let me kind of talk about Commercial overall, and I'll get into the TNC part. So -- for our core commercial business, I feel much more positive where we are from a combined ratio perspective, especially with 16 points yet to earn in this year. And then I talked a little bit about some expansion products that we talked about like in Horizon 2."", ""So think of Progressive Fleet, think of TNC, think of our BOP. Those do put a little pressure on our core business, but we think it's important to invest in them. The TNC, we've continued to strengthen reserves, as you saw last year, and we'll have some rate increases that go into play significant ones this quarter. So we feel much better about it."", ""And if you go back we have 20 states total between the two companies that we work with. But if you go back to where we started with our first state in 2016, that knowledge that we've learned in the TNC business has really helped us. So each state is a little bit different depending on the maturity level of that. And a lot of what happened last year with the reserve strengthening, happened to be in two states, New Jersey and California, and in coverages of UM and UIM."", ""So that's where we're working to get the right rate to make sure we can reach our profit margin."", 'Yaron Kinar -- Jefferies -- Analyst', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.', 'Mike Phillips -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst', 'Thanks for putting me in. I think I just have, well, maybe two. Just one. To what extent is the hard market in personal auto have any impact on the mix of customers that stay bundled.', ""In other words, if there's more, maybe sticker shock in one versus the other? Are you seeing customers kind of get away from the desire to bundle?"", 'Tricia Griffith -- Chief Executive Officer', ""I mean, I think right now, customers are looking for price because it's gone up so much with everything else. So people do you like to bundle because you can also get a discount in most companies. The hard market, for me, I really equate to more just overall shopping. Just people get their renewals and they shop and can have we already got the rate in the system to get them."", ""So we want to get auto, we want to get home, and we want to get the bundled, regardless of either one. Obviously, we care a lot about the bundle. But it's really -- I think customers dictate the market based on the trends they're seeing in their bills."", 'Mike Phillips -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst', 'OK. And then just separate, can you share any thoughts on loss trends in your Protective business that you did a couple of years ago? How is that looking? And any trends there?', 'Tricia Griffith -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Not really, no.', 'Mike Phillips -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst', 'OK. Nothing that stands out versus normal the smaller fleets, the smaller normal commercial business?', 'Tricia Griffith -- Chief Executive Officer', ""No. We continue, we'll continue to grow. We've expanded our own fleet before Protective from 10 power units to 40 power units. We continue to expand."", 'We continue to work on the integration of the acquisition, we feel positive about the acquisition.

You've worked your entire career for this! Naturally, the stressful part of retiring is protecting your saved money.

You can buy and hold these stalwarts with confidence. And the best part is they can offer a combination of safety and enough that can grow your nest egg safely in a diversified portfolio.', ""Healthcare conglomerate UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) might be the central cog in the U.S. healthcare machine. It's not only an insurance company, but also provides healthcare services, analytics, and solutions throughout different levels of care. If you're looking for an impressive resume, check out the company's smooth upward trajectory of revenue and earnings growth over the past several decades:"", ""The company's financials are rock-solid. UnitedHealth has nearly $30 billion in cash on its balance sheet, and its debt is just 1.8 times its EBITDA, a healthy ratio that signals the company isn't borrowing too much money. Investors also get a solid dividend that yields 1.4% today and comes with a 14-year streak of consecutive increases."", ""UnitedHealth is so large and healthcare is such a fragmented and complex business that the company is poised to continue growing as it uses its size and expertise to provide more services at a lower cost to its hospitals and care providers throughout the industry.

In other words, there is a higher perceived chance that the United States government collapses than Johnson & Johnson defaults on its bills."", ""Johnson & Johnson has a beta of just 0.53, meaning owning the stock should be a pretty smooth ride.

GEHC is the former Healthcare division of GE, spun out in early 2023.

The business has a long and storied history but was trapped inside a larger, underperforming conglomerate, starved of the love and attention it needed to thrive.', 'From a subset of value perspective, we view GEHC as a Low risk turnaround. The underlying business is fundamentally sound but has ceded market share over time, with sales growth lagging the industry. There is significant margin opportunity with core imaging margins (~50% of sales) much lower than its main peer. We see two drivers in restoring performance. Firstly an increase in research and development spending (since 2017 R&D spend is up 70%, far outpacing revenue growth). Secondly an opportunity to improve SG&A cost efficiency.', 'What makes the turnaround low risk? Management and Board quality are critical. GEHC features a few of what we call ‘CI Alumni’; executives we have invested behind at other companies. Top of this list is Chairman Larry Culp, the former CEO of Danaher, an executive we have the highest respect for.', 'GEHC has strong financial characteristics. It is a market leader in an oligopolistic industry where market share changes slowly and gross profit comes largely from aftermarket. The balance sheet is appropriately geared with well structured debt. Our analysis of GEHC’s accounts suggests there may be some conservatism baked into the P&L numbers.

These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>Eli Lilly’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+150.1% vs. +37.0%). The company’s revenue growth is being driven by higher demand for drugs like Mounjaro, Verzenio, Jardiance Taltz and others.Lilly’s new FDA-approved tirzepatide medicines, diabetes drug Mounjaro and newly launched weight loss medicine, Zepbound, are expected to be key top-line drivers. Lilly has also launched some other new products recently like Omvoh and Jaypirca. These new products are expected to drive Lilly’s top line in 2024.Lilly is also making rapid pipeline progress in areas like obesity, diabetes and Alzheimer’s. However, generic competition for some drugs, rising pricing pressure and challenges in meeting strong demand for incretin products like Trulicity are some top-line headwinds.(You can read the full research report on Eli Lilly here >>>)Shares of Procter & Gamble have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+19.4% vs. +15.9%). The company has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix, along with strength across segments.Procter & Gamble has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. This led to the top and bottom lines beating the consensus mark for the fifth consecutive quarter in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Consequently, PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view.However, the company has been witnessing supply-chain issues, higher SG&A costs, higher transportation costs and rising inflation.

The company's new strategic alliance with Mitsubishi UFJ will bolster its presence in Japan. Further, the company’s initiatives to become less dependent on capital-markets-driven revenue sources, inorganic growth efforts and high interest rates will support the top line.However, the ambiguity of the performance of the capital markets is a woe and is expected to hurt the Institutional Securities segment’s prospects.

For purposes of reconciling adjusted diluted earnings per share with respect to taxes period-over-period, the company utilizes a “rate approach” to highlight the impact of the adjusted tax rate. It is computed by multiplying the prior period adjusted rate by the current period adjusted income before taxes to determine the expected tax expense. Such expected tax expense is then compared to actual tax expense. Expected tax in excess of actual tax variance is favorable; actual tax in excess of expected tax variance is unfavorable. The variance divided by diluted shares outstanding at the end of the period yields the impact on earnings per share.

We want to take a look at shares of Delta, United, American Airlines all gaining year-to-date. You can see, though, not much of an uplift here since the start of the year. Now as we approach the very busy spring travel season of the year, what stocks are best positioned? Joining us now is part of Yahoo Finance's Travel Guide 2024 Industry Insights. We have Helane Becker, TD Cowen managing director, and Steve Trent, Citi managing director."", 'Steve, let me start with you. In terms of how airlines are positioned ahead of the rest of the year, from your view, are we going to see more of that recovery take place and who do you think has that lead position?', 'STEVE TRENT: Yeah, absolutely. And thank you for having me. So I do think that the network airlines look better-positioned. We continue to have generally to very good demand trends not only talking about ticket revenue but all the ancillary stuff they do-- co-branded card, loyalty program revenue. International capillarity is still a very good place to be.', ""The discount airlines that are mostly US-based, we're a little less sanguine on those in terms of what opportunities we see. But overall, the picture looks good from a capacity perspective. So 2019, we had $23 of US economic activity per available seat mile. We, last year, finished around $28. So the pie itself looks very good. We think the distribution of the economics could be tilted toward the network airlines."", ""BRAD SMITH: Helane, I want to bring you into this as well. I mean, when you think about the international exposure that airlines need to have in order to be among your top picks, how important is that international demand into this year's performance that trickles through to what investors are going to be watching in the stock price action?"", ""HELANE BECKER: Well, I think, in terms of international received a pretty strong demand. The airlines, though, have adjusted capacity lower since we initially cautioned back in December that we thought airfares, internationally, would come down this summer because capacity was rushing into the market-- and not so much from US carriers but from international carriers that didn't have the ability to add capacity last summer."", 'So for example, Lufthansa is up 16% this summer versus last year, while United is just reinstating seasonal service and their capacity is actually up low single digits.', 'SEANA SMITH: Steve, what do you think the pricing power looks like from these airlines, and how much higher some of those airfares could potentially go?', ""STEVE TRENT: Yeah. So I think, relative to last year or the year before-- relative to 2019-- it's possible that we won't see them as high as they have been over the last year and a half. But a fair bit of that is coming down to oil prices. So we did, of course, have a lot of pressure from jet fuel prices 2022 and into 2023. So some of that moderation should be related to fuel."", ""But when we think about this from an Xfuel perspective, we do think there should be stability. To even some upside in fares. As Helane mentioned, we do have some capacity constraints. We have the powder metal alloy contamination on GTF engines. Boeing has had some issues. So it's possible that elements of the market won't have as much equipment at the end of the year that they're expecting to have today, and that could support pricing."", 'BRAD SMITH: Just to follow on that-- does that mean any material reduction in route schedules that the airline operators are flying right now?', 'STEVE TRENT: Yeah, it could be depending on which ones. I think regional airlines come to mind in terms of where we could continue to see some scarcity of equipment. So yeah. I think, in pockets, yes. And then you also have markets that, over the last three years, have been hot like South Florida where everybody put metal into that market during the pandemic. Now probably, you see some rotation out of those regions.', ""BRAD SMITH: Helane, one of the things that we've continued to hear from airline CEOs is just when they expect to take delivery of some of these new aircraft and add that into the fleet, how would you be evaluating that and when that could actually be a pass through a boon for some of these businesses as well?"", ""HELANE BECKER: Yeah. The way we think about it is everything slides to the right. So if an airline tells us they're looking to take delivery of 50 or 60 aircraft this year, we probably think we'll be closer to 40 aircraft because the delivery delays, the supply chain issues. And we think that we'll probably see some lease extensions into 2025 to cover some of the gaps because of all the delivery issues that we're seeing in the OEM problems."", ""And so that's how we think about it. We push everything off to the right, which is really helpful. Our hope is that the government doesn't shut down because the FAA Reauthorization expires March 8. It was punted to early March, which is just two weeks away. And we need-- or next Friday. I guess March 8."", ""And we just need to have continuity in that regard because if we don't, air travel is going to get worse than it already is. I don't think anybody would give airlines really high marks for the service that they deliver."", ""And without the support network of the government, air traffic control, even the OEM, the suppliers for maintenance-- without their support, air ticket prices are going a lot higher over time because demand isn't going down and yet, the supply, the number of seats available, is going down or at least is not keeping pace. So we view that as concerning because it will-- eventually, if fares get too high, people will opt out, especially in the domestic market."", ""SEANA SMITH: I see, we're also getting some developments on the JetBlue-Spirit saga that's playing out yesterday, urging the US appeals court to allow the merger to go forward. What's your assessment of that risk? Or, I guess, is it more of a short-term risk? And how do you see this ultimately impacting the industry at large?"", ""STEVE TRENT: Yeah. Certainly, I think, right now, it's a very difficult time in the aviation industry for any M&A to get done at least over the short term. So we know there's some other stuff out there that's cooking that might be less controversial than what JetBlue is trying to do. But when we look at this particular case-- the business model differences and the government's desire to preserve Maverick pricing carriers for example-- it looks like it's going to be a difficult road."", ""And possibly, the airline industry could use a little bit of consolidation. So does that come through M&A? Does it come through carriers doing filings or what have you? I hope it's not going to be the latter. But we think, one way or the other, we could see on some level capacity continue to come out of the industry at least over the short term, whether that's M&A, or as Helene mentioned, we get ongoing delays from the OEMs.""]"

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. However, after investigating Eaton (NYSE:ETN), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger."", ""For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Eaton, this is the formula:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.13 = US$3.9b ÷ (US$38b - US$7.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""Therefore, Eaton has an ROCE of 13%.

If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Eaton ."", ""There hasn't been much to report for Eaton's returns and its level of capital employed because both metrics have been steady for the past five years. This tells us the company isn't reinvesting in itself, so it's plausible that it's past the growth phase. With that in mind, unless investment picks up again in the future, we wouldn't expect Eaton to be a multi-bagger going forward."", ""In a nutshell, Eaton has been trudging along with the same returns from the same amount of capital over the last five years. Investors must think there's better things to come because the stock has knocked it out of the park, delivering a 297% gain to shareholders who have held over the last five years. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high."", 'If you want to continue researching Eaton, you might be interested to know about the 1 warning sign that our analysis has discovered.', ""While Eaton may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

As of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, UHS operates 360 inpatient facilities and 48 outpatient and other facilities across the U.S., the U.K., and Puerto Rico. The company's acute care hospitals, outpatient facilities, and behavioral health care facilities have generated a consolidated net revenue of 57% and 43%, respectively, for both 2023 and 2022. The U.K. behavioral health care facilities alone contributed approximately $761 million in net revenues in 2023, showcasing a significant international presence.

This expansion strategy is not just about increasing the company's footprint; it also involves divesting facilities that do not align with UHS's growth or operating strategy. By partnering with non-UHS acute care hospitals to operate their behavioral health services, UHS has been able to extend its reach and capitalize on new market opportunities."", ""Staffing Challenges and Operating Costs: Like many in the healthcare industry, UHS faces the challenge of recruiting and retaining qualified medical personnel. The nationwide staffing shortage has led to increased salaries, wages, and benefits expenses, which could potentially outpace the rate of inflation. This situation not only impacts UHS's operating costs but also its ability to maintain appropriate staffing levels, which is crucial for delivering quality healthcare services."", ""Regulatory Compliance: Operating in a highly regulated industry, UHS must navigate a complex landscape of healthcare laws, regulations, and rules. Compliance with these regulations requires significant resources and can limit operational flexibility. Any failure to comply could result in penalties, legal liabilities, or reputational damage, which could adversely affect the company's financial performance and growth prospects."", 'Outpatient Services Expansion: With the shift towards ambulatory or outpatient care, UHS has the opportunity to expand its outpatient services. This shift is driven by payer demands for cost containment and technological advancements that allow more procedures to be performed on an outpatient basis. By focusing on this trend, UHS can meet the evolving needs of patients and payers, while potentially improving its financial performance through cost-effective service delivery.', 'Technological Integration: The integration of advanced medical technologies and digital health solutions presents a significant opportunity for UHS to enhance the efficiency and quality of its services. By investing in telemedicine, electronic health records, and data analytics, UHS can improve patient outcomes, streamline operations, and stay ahead of the competition in an increasingly digital healthcare landscape.', ""Competitive Pressures: UHS operates in a competitive healthcare market, where it must vie for service contracts with group health care service purchasers. The company's competitive position is influenced by factors such as price, market reputation, geographic location, quality and range of services, and convenience. With the growing influence of managed care organizations and cost-conscious employers, UHS must continually adapt its strategies to maintain and grow its market share."", ""Market and Economic Conditions: General and local economic conditions, market penetration of managed care programs, demographic changes, and reimbursement policies of third-party payers are external factors that can impact hospital utilization and, consequently, UHS's revenues. The company must remain vigilant and responsive to these market dynamics to sustain its operational and financial health."", 'In conclusion, Universal Health Services Inc (NYSE:UHS) exhibits a strong position in the healthcare industry with its comprehensive service offerings and strategic growth initiatives. However, it must navigate staffing challenges, regulatory complexities, and competitive pressures while seizing opportunities for expansion in outpatient services and technological advancements. By addressing these SWOT elements effectively, UHS can continue to provide superior healthcare services and achieve long-term returns for its investors.', 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Why? It’s very simple. With this sector, you’re dealing with permanent relevance.', 'In the connected world we live in, going off grid won’t get you very far. Everything we do depends on power and other critical resources. Further, the top utility stocks are effectively entrenched in their key markets. Protected by significant barriers to entry – including steep regulations – legacy utility companies benefit from natural monopolies.', 'Second, as a direct result of this permanent relevance, utility stocks can be among the most reliable investments. Generally, you’re not going to get rich off the exposure. However, with many companies in the field offering passive income, stakeholders are able to sleep easier at night.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Finally, companies in this space enjoy some protection from inflation. Basically, they’re able to pass on cost increases to their customers. It’s cynical but it works. And with that, below are utility stocks to warm up your holdings this winter.', 'Source: zhao jiankang / Shutterstock.com', 'An integrated retail electricity and power generation company, Vistra (NYSE:VST) is the largest competitive power generator in the U.S., per its public profile. Featuring a diverse portfolio of natural gas, nuclear, and solar power, Vistra can serve its customers through multiple channels. In addition, the company features battery energy storage facilities.', 'Regarding the financial performance, Vistra is a bit of a mixed bag. For example, it doesn’t have the greatest stability in the balance sheet, as evidenced by its lowly Altman Z-Score. Also, its three-year revenue growth rate of 11.2% is slightly worse than the average of its main independent power production industry.', 'However, the company offers a return on equity (ROE) of nearly 27%, beating out almost 88% of its peers. Also, VST trades at a forward earnings multiple of 11.48X, below the sector median of 15.11X.', 'While it’s not the greatest dividend, Vistra offers a forward yield of 1.87%. And the payout ratio sits at 17.7%, indicating high confidence regarding yield sustainability. Therefore, it’s a top idea for utility stocks to buy.', 'Source: Pand P Studio / Shutterstock.com', 'An electricity power generator and wholesale marketing company, TransAlta (NYSE:TAC) operates 76 power plants in Canada, the U.S. and Australia. Its portfolio consists of wind turbines, hydroelectric facilities, natural gas and coal power generation plants. To be fair, TAC hasn’t enjoyed the greatest market performance among utility stocks. However, an argument can be made that the selloff has gone on too far.', 'Financially, TransAlta is again a mixed bag although it enjoys many positives. Yes, the balance sheet could use some work. Also, its three-year revenue growth rate of 9.8% is below average. However, the company enjoys a stellar ROE of 41.62%. Also, its return on invested capital (ROIC) clocks in at 10.5%.', 'Enticingly, TAC stock trades at only 4.36X trailing-year earnings. Also, a price-to-free-cash-flow (FCF) ratio of only 5.9X suggests that TransAlta could be a discount for the contrarian investor. Presently, the utility offers a forward yield of 2.55%.', 'Analysts also view TAC as a unanimous strong buy with an $11.64 price target. With such intense support, it’s one of the utility stocks to buy.', 'Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com', 'Based in Houston, Texas, NRG Energy (NYSE:NRG) is involved in energy generation and retail electricity. Its portfolio includes natural gas, coal, oil, nuclear, wind, and utility-scale power generation. As well, it offers distributed solar generation. Per its public profile, NRG serves over seven million retail customers in 24 states.', 'Unlike some other utility stocks, NRG has been flying over the past one-year period. Some of that enthusiasm may center on NRG benefitting from millennial migration trends. States like Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas offer lower costs of living than many other regions.', 'Unsurprisingly, NRG also prints a robust three-year revenue growth rate of 53.2%, beating out nearly 87% of its peers. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period stands at 24.5%. Even better, NRG stock trades at only 7.7X forward earnings, below the sector median 15.11X.', 'Regarding passive income, NRG carries a forward yield of 3.14%. As well, its payout ratio sits at a very sustainable 22.84%. Thus, it’s a worthy idea for reliable utility stocks to buy.', 'Source: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com', 'One of the top utility stocks firmly entrenched in the renewables space, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) features about 72 gigawatts (GW) of operating capacity, per its website. In addition, the company has earmarked about $85 billion to $95 billion in planned investments in U.S. infrastructure through 2025. As an intriguing food for thought, it claims a 98% reduction in its dependency on foreign oil since 2001.', 'To be fair, NEE stock hasn’t exactly been a great investment over the past 52 weeks. As The Wall Street Journal pointed out last year, investors pummeled NextEra with red ink due to lingering concerns about higher interest rates impacting the renewable energy space. Those questions aren’t completely addressed. However, as the economy slowly recovers, NEE could be an enticing long-term opportunity.', 'No, it’s not a great discount but a trailing-year earnings multiple of 15.8X is relatively low given its recent history. Also, over the past three years, NextEra posted a sales expansion rate of 14.8%. Analysts view shares as a consensus moderate buy with a $69.60 price target. Lastly, the company offers a forward yield of 3.61%.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'A public utility holding company, Alliant Energy (NASDAQ:LNT) provides power services in Iowa and Wisconsin. Fundamentally, Alliant may offer a geographic advantage. According to one report, the cost of living in Iowa comes out to $29,000 a year. That’s about 28% lower than the national average. And while Wisconsin is more expensive, it too is about 2% lower than the national average.', 'With so many people – especially young folks – being priced out of the real estate market, these and similar states offer attractive landing spots. Therefore, Alliant is placed right where the money will be. True, LNT hasn’t enjoyed the best start to the new year. And it’s down on a 52-week basis. But with a little patience, investors could be looking at a solid deal.', 'In full disclosure, Alliant’s financial print isn’t exactly sterling. However, where it does shine is in its strong margins and consistent annual profitability. As a result, it’s able to deliver a forward dividend yield of 3.97%. Also, it’s been consistently boosting its payout over the past 21 years. That makes it one of the top utility stocks to buy.', 'Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com', 'Headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, American Electric Power (NASDAQ:AEP) represents a major investor-owned electric utility in the U.S. Per its public profile, the company delivers electricity to more than five million customers in 11 states. Further, AEP ranks among the nation’s largest generators of electricity, owning nearly 38,000 megawatts of generating capacity.', 'As with other utility stocks, AEP benefits from a geographic advantage. Serving states such as Texas, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio, American Electric should benefit from the mobility of money. In other words, as people become priced out of their coastal metropolitan homes, they may start looking inward. Therefore, booming population trends could help fuel long-term growth.', 'In fairness, the balance sheet for American Electric is shaky. Moreover, its three-year revenue growth rate of 6.8% is somewhat pedestrian. However, it’s consistently profitable which shouldn’t be overlooked. And that fact helps support the forward yield of 4.33%. Also, the payout ratio is sustainable at 59%.', 'Analysts view shares as a moderate buy with an $86.86 price target. Overall, it has potential to be one of the top utility stocks.', 'Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com', 'Last but definitely not least we have Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK). An electric power and natural gas holding company, Duke may offer the best geographic advantage on this list of utility stocks. With a strong presence in the Carolinas, Duke should benefit from millennial migration trends. Consistently, North Carolina in particular sees significant interest among young people looking to escape ridiculous costs of living.', 'And because these are young folks, Duke enjoys a long-term tailwind. With many, many years of working and consuming resources left, the company should see improved financials. Yes, its 6% three-year revenue growth rate isn’t anything to write home about. Indeed, it’s worse than 60% of the competition. However, over time, this metric will likely see significant improvements.', 'In the meantime, investors can bank on the company’s consistent profitability. In turn, the black ink helps support Duke’s forward yield of 4.46%, which is above the utility sector’s average yield of 3.75%. Finally, DUK also commands 19 years of consecutive dividend increases, making it one of the most dependable utility stocks to buy.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Food conglomerates like WK Kellogg and PepsiCo are pushing Frosted Flakes and Dorito casserole as pleasing alternatives.', 'Convenience food brands are asking customers to consider their products beyond their conventional uses, as sales for snack products continue to waver amid inflation-induced price hikes.', 'WK Kellogg cochairman and CEO Gary Pilnick encouraged cash-strapped consumers to have “cereal for dinner,” in a recent CNBC interview.', '“The cereal category has always been quite affordable, and it tends to be a great destination when consumers are under pressure,” he said.', 'PepsiCo is also asking consumers to get creative with their carbs. At an industry conference in Florida last week, CEO Ramon Laguarta said he hoped consumers would use salty snacks, such as Doritos and Rold Gold pretzels, as “side dishes and ingredients” in meals, extending their purpose beyond a midday or late-night munchie.', 'Taco Bell consumers are no stranger to Doritos for dinner, such as Doritos Locos Tacos. PepsiCo wants to take this innovation further. At last week’s Consumer Analyst Group of New York Conference, PepsiCo’s presentation included a nod to the Mexico City street food Dorilocos or “walking taco,” an open bag of tortilla chips topped with cucumbers, lime juice, and chamoy, among other ingredients. Last year, Doritos posted a recipe video on TikTok for Spicy Sweet Chili chocolate chip cookies using the eponymous Doritos flavor.', 'Doritos is PepsiCo’s ground zero to engage with Gen Z, who have turned their backs on sodas to pursue a healthy lifestyle. In December, PepsiCo launched a Doritos-flavored cocktail, which joined the beverage ranks with Starry, PepsiCo’s bid for Gen Z’s preferred soda. WK Kellogg tried to appeal to Gen Z’s healthy sensibilities by launching its Eat Your Mouth Off vegan cereal last month.', 'Gen Z doesn’t mind making meals out of an amalgamation of nibbles, dubbed on TikTok as “girl dinner.” Over half of 2,000 U.S. Zoomers surveyed by Ketchum said they piece together snacks to form a meal on a weekly basis.', 'These pushes for innovation come after shaky fourth-quarter reports from the snack companies: PepsiCo reported a fourth-quarter revenue drop earlier this month—after years of double-digit price hikes—including a 2% drop in volume for Frito Lay North America. Kellogg’s fourth-quarter sales, which saw a 10% volume drop, tell a similar story, as the company continues to increase prices.', 'Fortune 500 executives calling for creative cereal and chip uses come at a tumultuous time for snack companies. WK Kellogg’s “cereal for dinner” strategy has been around for years. In 2022, the company awarded $5,000 to five sweepstakes entrants who posted an Instagram photo of themselves eating cereal for breakfast with the hashtag #KelloggsCerealforDinnerEntry. The strategy has been employed to boost sales after the pandemic’s initial cereal boom cooled. Its cereal sales have declined for decades as consumers go in search of healthier breakfasts or fast food offerings. Weight-loss-aiding drugs like Ozempic have tempered food sales at retail giants like Walmart, pressuring junk food brands to shrink portions.', 'But there’s a reason for these big snack brands to hold out hope. Kellogg’s profits have stayed steady, as price increases counteracted sales dips and as demand for classic products such as Frosted Flakes remain resilient. The U.S. savory snack market is still expected to grow 6% annually from 2022 to 2027.', 'The continued profits of these companies mean that even though they’re acknowledging consumers struggling to keep up with sky-high prices, they’re unlikely to lower them anytime soon.', 'Beyond convenience food brands, all groceries have gotten more expensive. While inflation rose 19% over the past four years, grocery food prices have increased 25%. Gen Z is particularly sensitive to these increases as a cost-conscious generation. Almost two of three Gen Zers buy a store’s private brand always or frequently, according to a 2023 Private Label Manufacturers Association survey of 1,000 U.S. Zoomers.', 'Even after trying to address sales dips, PepsiCo plans to “modestly” increase prices this year. PepsiCo did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment.', 'One of the reasons for price hikes is “greedflation,” or companies choosing to increase prices, even as inflation cools, taking advantage of consumers who were previously willing to pay more when the economy was more volatile. Food giants Kraft Heinz and Bunge were among several corporations to have their profits outpace inflation in 2022, according to a 2023 study by IPPR and Common Wealth.', 'But Braden Douglas, CEO of consumer marketing agency Crew Marketing Partners, told Fortune that food manufacturers aren’t entirely the ones to blame for high prices.', ""“It's easy to try to point fingers” at manufacturers like PepsiCo, Douglas said, but every part of the food chain is being squeezed."", 'Mondelez CEO Dirk Van de Put told YahooFinance on Wednesday that the prices of Oreos and Ritz will likely go up as a result of the increased cost of sugar and cocoa. Grocery stores like Kroger are eager to raise product costs not only to maintain margins, but also grow them by nudging customers towards their own cheaper, private-brand products. Manufacturers want to raise prices because they’re also raising wages to combat labor shortages.', 'No one wants to budge, Douglas said, but there will have to be interventions on multiple dimensions if consumers want to see well-priced products. That means either companies eating costs to counter inflation—Ikea spent $1.1 billion to absorb inflation and lower the price of its goods—or government intervention to subsidize production costs.', '“If people really cared about the consumer—which they always say they do, but if they really did—I think that their profit expectation has to change,” Douglas said.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

While many experts caution against falling into yield traps, historical data suggests that high-yield stocks have performed well. However, combining both dividend growth and high yield can be a powerful strategy to maximize returns. One example is the S&P Sector-Neutral High Yield Dividend Aristocrats (HYDA) index, which aims to blend dividend growth with higher relative yield while maintaining sector weights similar to the S&P Composite 1500. This index is noted for its defensive characteristics. According to a report from S&P Dow Jones Indices, it has historically provided a buffer against market volatility. On average, the index has outperformed the benchmark when the VIX level, a measure of market volatility, was above 20, with the strongest outperformance seen when the VIX level was above 30. The report further noted that from January 31, 2005, to July 31, 2023, the index's overall return was nearly the same as the benchmark. That said, the S&P Sector-Neutral HYDA showed lower volatility throughout the entire period compared to the benchmark, resulting in better risk-adjusted returns. Moreover, the maximum drawdown experienced during that time frame was reduced by around 5%, indicating a more resilient performance during market downturns."", ""Given investors' preference for dividend-paying stocks and their track record of returns, numerous companies are striving to initiate, sustain, and enhance their dividend payouts. In a notable recent development, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has commenced paying a quarterly cash dividend to its shareholders. This move underscores the increasing popularity of dividends in the market. Notably, Morningstar analysts have observed a significant rise in the funds targeting dividend-paying stocks, with the total amount reaching $1 trillion. This figure has been growing at a rate of 10% annually since 2018, indicating a robust and expanding interest in dividend investments."", 'Dividend stocks have consistently gained traction due to their resilience and strong performance during previous periods of inflation. Over time, dividends have been a significant contributor, comprising approximately 40% of the total return of the S&P 500 since 1930. However, during decades characterized by high inflation rates, such as the 1940s, 1970s, and 1980s, where inflation averaged 5% or more, dividends accounted for an even larger portion, generating 54% of the total return. Naveed Rahman, co-manager of the Fidelity Equity-Income Strategy, highlighted this trend. He also emphasized that while seeking the best-performing dividend stocks today, investors may need to look beyond the traditional industries or sectors that have historically dominated such investments. The report further noted that companies that consistently pay dividends that are both sustainable and increasing have the capability to expand their cash flows over time, thereby enabling them to stay aligned with inflationary pressures.', 'Walmart Inc.

Rather, it represents Gap’s return to “championing” originality, self-expression and developing creative, jaunty campaigns that Gap had been known for connecting with customers. He cited the 2003 song and dance duet with Madonna and Missy Elliott, and the 2007 white shirt campaign collaborating with designers. There have been other standout Gap campaigns, like “Individuals of Style” in 1989 utilizing Patrick Demarchelier and Annie Leibovitz to photograph\xa0celebrities such as Lenny Kravitz and Bob Dylan, and the 1993 “Who Wore Khakis”\xa0campaign with vintage photos of Ernest Hemingway, Andy Warhol, Salvador Dalî and other cultural icons.', 'The spring 2024 campaign features 22-year-old Grammy winner Tyla in song and dance demonstrating ease of movement in Gap’s new linen collection, as well as choreography by Shay Latukolan, and direction by J Lloyd and Charlie Di Placido\xa0from the U.K. band Jungle. Gap plans to collaborate with Jungle and Tyla on an in-store playlist that will be available on Spotify.', '“Gap was the original pop brand that did more than sell clothes,” Dickson said. “We are leveraging music to drive relevance and fashion.” The spring 2024 campaign, Dickson said, “tells a story, has inclusivity, diversity, emotion, anticipation. It’s happy and optimistic. It’s a true expression of originality. It will speak to people in a variety of different ways.”', 'Gap already sells linen but, effective Tuesday, “We’ve got a big product story in linen. We’re making this our big idea,” said Mark Breitbard, Gap brand’s president and CEO.', 'Breitbard said Gap’s spring line offers “effortless, everyday essentials” and reinvented “icon” styles like the drawstring cargo, the pleated wide-legged trouser, and woven shirts. “This is part one. You will certainly see a continued roll out of new product. Linen is going to grow into summer,” Breitbard said.', 'Linen is lightweight, comfortable particularly in warmer weather, and has some stretch characteristics for movement, though it has a tendency to wrinkle. It does provide a degree of freedom of movement that today’s on-the-go consumer requires, Breitbard said. “Consumers are busy. Linen is a fabrication that can move with them. It’s versatile. It can look casual but you can quickly change your shoes and throw on a layer and you’re ready for the evening.”', '“Directionally, the collection feels fresh, and elevated,” Dickson added. “Gap definitely had a great linen business before, but we saw the trend get a lot bigger last year.”', 'Asked if since becoming Gap Inc. CEO the Gap brand has been his top priority, Dickson replied, “I’ve been spending a lot of times with our brands, starting to frame up a new architecture that draws from the past and inspires the future. There is a lot going on here, a lot of exciting things, and I’ve definitely been spending time developing what we call the playbook.”', 'While there have been some sparks of life depending on the season’s collection and campaign, Gap’s performance over the last two decades has generally bee lackluster in terms of sales growth and resonating with consumers. As Dickson said, “We lost our edge. We evolved from pop culture brand to a retail brand. We just have not lived up to our potential. But today we are really moving again and we are guided by a new playbook.”', 'Structured around five key tenets applicable to all Gap Inc. banners — Old Navy, Banana Republic, Athleta and Gap — the playbook, Dickson said, is a call for “always championing original, trend-right products and ensuring they’re the season’s canvas for self expression, and linking the product story with popular culture to drive relevance and demand.” It’s about “creating at the speed of culture which is a high performance endeavor,” Dickson said.', 'The playbook also calls for “true influencer strategies to further drive relevance; connecting with customers in experiential ways across digital channels, online and in stores, and executing with higher standards.”', 'Gap’s spring 2024, Dickson said, represents the first expression of the playbook. “This is a new chapter for the brand,” he said. “We are really just getting started.”', 'Actually, turnaround efforts at Gap brand were in motion before Dickson became Gap Inc. CEO and even before his joining the company’s board in November 2022. Prior to becoming Gap Inc. CEO, he was president and chief operating officer of Mattel and was among the executives who helped strategize the craze around the 50th anniversary of Barbie and the blockbuster “Barbie” movie.', '“Over the past few years, there’s been a pretty heavy lift [at the Gap brand],” Breitbard explained, citing an “operational clean-up” involving stores, products and styling, i.e., introducing the “Cashsoft” loungey knitwear line that feels soft like cashmere but isn’t cashmere.', 'In the third quarter of 2023, Gap brand reported net sales of $887 million, down 15 percent compared to the year ago period; comparable sales slipped 1 percent. Excluding the estimated negative impact from the sale of Gap China and the shutdown of the failed Yeezy Gap program, net sales were down about 6 percent.', 'However, Gap stock has been on the rise in recent months, with investors reacting favorably to strategic initiatives, including streamlining Gap and Banana Republic store networks, expense controls, demonstrating greater agility on capturing trends, and the presence of Dickson. Prior to his arrival, Gap Inc. stock ranged from $9 to $10. It’s currently hovering around $20. Dickson is the first merchant to head up Gap Inc. in two decades. The previous four CEOs were not considered merchants or fashion executives, with their expertise largely in non-merchandise areas. The last true merchant running Gap was Millard “Mickey” Drexler, who changed the way Americans dressed by masterminding the retailer’s growth and the launch of Old Navy.', 'With certain building blocks in place, Breitbard said the team is “feeling very good” about the business, and prepared to move forward in a concerted way, he suggested. “We are more responsive and fluid than we’ve ever been. We have plans to deliver product every month and have small drops in between that.” He said Gap will “move with the consumer” and is poised to “chase styles.…We will flow product when we need to be flowing product.”', 'Regarding the marketing for spring, “It’s a comprehensive, 360-degree launch championing originality and serving it up in a very relevant way with outstanding creatives — Jungle and Tyla. We’re using streaming, YouTube, content creators, digital expression, a look book with models that move, and getting that movement across at many stores, which will have video screens. There’s a cast of dancers, each with incredible followings,” Breitbard said. They’re wearing loose-fitting linen items in neutral and tonal styles; Tyla wears a linen cargo pant and crop top.', '“Working with talent who embody the spirit of originality is not just a choice, but a commitment to our brand’s heritage,” said Breitbard, who is now in his fourth year running Gap. “This campaign pays homage to Gap’s iconic musical ads of the past while embracing the diverse voices and talents that shape our present and future. This is progress. We expect this to be a beginning. We will continue to have big statements.”', 'Best of WWD', 'COVID-19 Spikes Elevate Retail Concerns', ""Selfridges' New Owners Bank On a Retail Renaissance in City Centers"", 'Sergio Rossi to Open Milan Boutique']"

The demand for artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) based cybersecurity software in various industries is also fueling market expansion. Moreover, the need for continuous management of cyber breaches due to the rise in social media use and hyper-connectivity is driving the demand for cybersecurity.
