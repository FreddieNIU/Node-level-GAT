SWCAX holds a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 4 (Sell), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance."", 'History of Fund/Manager', ""Schwab Funds is based in San Francisco, CA, and is the manager of SWCAX. Since Schwab California Tax-Free Bond Fund made its debut in February of 1992, SWCAX has garnered more than $399.86 million in assets. The fund's current manager is a team of investment professionals."", 'Performance', 'Of course, investors look for strong performance in funds. This fund in particular has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 1.26%, and it sits in the middle third among its category peers. Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3-year annualized total return of -1.24%, which places it in the bottom third during this time-frame.', ""It is important to note that the product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sale charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower."", ""When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. The standard deviation of SWCAX over the past three years is 5.44% compared to the category average of 4.95%. Looking at the past 5 years, the fund's standard deviation is 4.97% compared to the category average of 4.84%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade."", 'With a beta of 0.73, this fund is less volatile than a broad market index of fixed income securities. Taking this into account, SWCAX has a negative alpha of -0.75, which measures performance on a risk-adjusted basis.', 'Expenses', 'For investors, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is key, since costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing. Competition is heating up in this space, and a lower cost product will likely outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, all things being equal. In terms of fees, SWCAX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.38% compared to the category average of 0.52%. Looking at the fund from a cost perspective, SWCAX is actually cheaper than its peers.', 'Investors should also note that the minimum initial investment for the product is $0 and that each subsequent investment has no minimum amount.', 'Fees charged by investment advisors have not been taken into considiration. Returns would be less if those were included.', 'Bottom Line', 'Overall, Schwab California Tax-Free Bond Fund ( SWCAX ) has a low Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively similar performance, average downside risk, and lower fees, Schwab California Tax-Free Bond Fund ( SWCAX ) looks like a somewhat weak choice for investors right now.', 'For additional information on this product, or to compare it to other mutual funds in the Mutual Fund Bond, make sure to go to www.zacks.com/funds/mutual-funds for additional information.

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.', 'While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.', ' See our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp ', ""The Chief Administration Officer & Vice Chair, Terrance Dolan, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$39.75 each. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$43.28, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 13% of Terrance Dolan's stake."", 'In the last twelve months insiders purchased 82.73k shares for US$2.7m. On the other hand they divested 72.61k shares, for US$3.0m. In total, U.S. Bancorp insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!', 'If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.', ""Over the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at U.S. Bancorp. Specifically, insiders ditched US$1.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain."", 'Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. U.S. Bancorp insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$135m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.', ""Insiders haven't bought U.S. Bancorp stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And our longer term analysis of insider transactions didn't bring confidence, either. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing U.S. Bancorp. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for U.S. Bancorp you should be aware of."", 'If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.', 'For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

On top of that, many companies have turned to layoffs during the busiest time of year as a way to cut costs, including Etsy, Saks and REI.', 'Economic uncertainty also loomed over consumers this holiday season. Higher prices on goods pressured consumers and caused many to pull back on discretionary purchases. To help spark a sense of joy during the season and encourage spending, many retailers leaned on nostalgia in their marketing campaigns — from Amazon’s “Joy Ride” ad, which was soundtracked by The Beatles’ “In my Life,” to Walmart’s “Mean Girls” reunion spot.', 'As the industry sets its sights on the year ahead, here’s a lookback at some of the biggest trends that shaped the holiday season in 2023.', 'To lure in customers this year, many brands sought various marketing strategies with the help of newer tech. From virtual stores like J. Crew’s holiday-themed store to Kohl’s virtual holiday events, companies explored many options for shoppers to discover and visualize products. Just prior to the holiday season, TikTok Shop launched in the U.S., introducing the ability to purchase recommended products in the app. The social media platform\xa0even began to authenticate luxury handbags with the addition of a verification service announced in November.', 'For the holidays, Walmart announced its 23-part shoppable rom-com commercial series for TikTok, Roku, YouTube and social media channels. Over the span of weeks the retailer continuously rolled out episodes of the series “Add to Heart,” a pun on the add-to-cart feature, according to sister publication Marketing Dive. The entire series showcased 330 products.', ""After the pandemic, many marketing tactics have also taken on a hybrid format involving both online and in-person interactions. Pop-up shops and markets have continued on, notably from Shein at Forever 21’s Time Square store and DTC bedding brand Parachute's\xa0first holiday market event."", 'Inflation was already a worry for many U.S. households last year, which became a factor at the holidays. Throughout 2023, the squeeze of higher prices on essentials like groceries and gas continued, which showed up in earnings calls and the government’s monthly retail sales reports.\xa0', 'Many consumers shied away from making large purchases like electronics, appliances and furniture. Those categories saw tepid sales or declines, because they were coming down from pandemic-related peaks, and rising interest rates put some home sales out of reach.\xa0', 'The second half of the year saw prices ease. But uncertainty made earlier and deeper holiday promotions essential, so that customers could stretch their budgets.\xa0', 'By September, retail prospects seemed to dim. But the tactic of pushing early holiday deals seems to have paid off, according to GlobalData research. Black Friday — and November in general — was a surprise win for retail, even if deals remained in focus. The month’s lift was the best pace of growth since February, according to a research note from GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders.', 'The wariness and choosiness remains — 57.9% of consumers surveyed by GlobalData said they bought less on impulse this Black Friday compared to last year. But many were “very receptive to bargains and discounts,” to the point where 61.8% said they bought something on Black Friday that they’d put off earlier in the year.', '“[C]onsumers pushed the override button on their financial challenges and went on a mini spending spree in November,” Saunders said.', '2022 featured plenty of holiday deals that started earlier than ever before, partly driven by an inventory rise throughout the year.\xa0', 'Though inventories somewhat improved this year, plenty of major retailers continued the new tradition of kicking off the holidays far before they began. Amazon began offering pre-Black Friday discounts on Nov. 17, just a few weeks after its second Prime sale that began Oct. 10 (one day earlier than last year’s event).\xa0', 'Walmart also sought to compete with Amazon’s additional Prime sales through its Holiday Kickoff deals from Oct. 10 to Oct. 12, starting a day earlier than its “Rollbacks and More” event in 2022. Target and Macy’s also took part in early deal events, both revealing sales for weeks leading up to the Thanksgiving weekend.\xa0', 'But did shoppers bite? The National Retail Federation’s data released in November following the Thanksgiving holiday weekend showed that 55% of customers took advantage of early holiday sales (down from 56% in 2022). Additionally, a Shopify-Gallup Holiday Shopping Pulse survey of 1,888 consumers from this month found 49% of U.S. shoppers said they planned to most of their holiday shopping in December.\xa0', 'The image of crowds massed at big box retailers’ or shopping mall doors, waiting in the dark and the cold for the best deals on big-ticket items like TVs and the year’s hottest toys has long been a Black Friday hallmark.', 'Data from retail analysts and experts found that more people opted to pick up their phone this year versus heading to stores to shop in person. Nevertheless, Black Friday is likely to remain one of the busiest and most important days for retail all year.', 'During day-of Black Friday store visits in the New York City metro area, Michael Brown, a partner and Americas Retail Leader at Kearney, told Retail Dive that while traffic was strong it wasn’t the “kick-the-doors-down traffic we used to have in years past.”', 'According to data from Adobe Analytics, mobile shopping overtook desktop this year. Online sales through mobile were high throughout Cyber Week — the five days from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday – with smartphones representing nearly 52% of online sales. That’s up from nearly 50% in 2022. Thanksgiving also set a new record for mobile, with 59% of sales that day coming from a smartphone. According to Adobe Analytics increased use of mobile in retail sales likely indicates that “many consumers now find the experience on par with desktop shopping.”', 'However, Adobe Analytics data found that net-new demand, and not just higher prices helped drive consumer spending this season. E-commerce prices have fallen for over a year, down 6% year over year in October, according to Adobe’s Digital Price Index.\xa0Adobe’s price index tracks online prices across 18 product categories. Adobe’s numbers are not adjusted for inflation.', '""The 2023 holiday shopping season began with a lot of uncertainty, as consumers shifted their spending to services, while dealing with rising costs across different facets of their lives,” Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, said in a statement. “The record online spending across Cyber Week however, shows the impact that discounts can have on consumer demand, especially with quality products that drove a lot of impulse shopping.”', 'This story was originally published on Retail Dive.

TTEK benefits from its focus on providing high-end consulting, design and engineering services despite cost inflation and forex woes.Let us discuss the reasons why investors should retain the stock for the time being.', 'Business Strength: Tetra Tech is gaining from its diversified business structure, which helps mitigate the adverse impact of weakness in one end market with strength across the others. Higher U.S. state and local government activities related to digital water and U.S. federal programs are aiding the Government Services Group (GSG) segment. Increased activity on high-performance buildings, clean energy and international infrastructure are aiding the Commercial / International Services Group segment.The company’s revenues increased 29.1%, year over year, in fiscal 2023 (ended Oct 1, 2023), driven by increased activity in the U.S. Federal, U.S. Commercial and International client sectors, and the RPS acquisition. A robust backlog level is also supporting TTEK. Tetra Tech’s backlog at the end of fiscal 2023 was $4,790.4 billion, up 28% year over year.Accretive Acquisition: TTEK has been strengthening its business through acquisitions. The company completed the acquisition of RPS Group plc, an established technology-enabled consultancy firm, in January 2023. The acquisition enhanced Tetra Tech’s consultancy in water, environment and sustainable infrastructure, thus expanding its water practice in the United Kingdom and strengthening its foothold in renewable energy and environmental management.Tetra Tech also acquired Reston, VA-based enterprise technology services, cybersecurity and management consulting firm, Amyx, Inc., in the same month. As a part of the Federal Information Technology division, the Amyx acquisition expands its use of advanced data analytics, cybersecurity, digital transformation and agile software development solutions for its government and commercial customers. Amyx is integrated into the company’s GSG segment. The company spent $854.3 million on acquisitions in fiscal 2023.Rewards to Shareholders: The company continues to increase shareholders’ value through dividend payment & share repurchases. In fiscal 2023, Tetra Tech paid out dividends of $52.1 million. Also, the quarterly dividend rate was hiked 13% in May 2023.In light of the above-mentioned positives, we believe, investors should retain TTEK stock for now, as suggested by its current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Sealed Air Corporation (NYSE:SEE)."", ""Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits."", ' View our latest analysis for Sealed Air ', 'ROE can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Sealed Air is:', '76% = US$309m ÷ US$408m (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.76 in profit."", ""By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Sealed Air has a better ROE than the average (18%) in the Packaging industry."", ""That's clearly a positive. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . You can see the 2 risks we have identified for Sealed Air by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here."", 'Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.', ""It seems that Sealed Air uses a huge volume of debt to fund the business, since it has an extremely high debt to equity ratio of 11.86. While its ROE is no doubt quite impressive, it could give a false impression about the company's returns given that its huge debt could be boosting those returns."", 'Return on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.', 'But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.', 'Of course Sealed Air may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have high ROE and low debt.', 'Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

Well, not exactly. A look at the numbers signals that some of these genuinely magnificent stocks could soon run out of steam. Here are the four stocks in this group worth buying in 2024, and the three to leave behind in 2023."", ""Nvidia's chips, which specialize in demanding, high-compute applications, have become a focal point of the artificial intelligence (AI) breakthrough. The company has quickly established dominance, controlling as much as 90% of the market for AI chips. That's pushed the business to new heights, accelerating revenue growth to 200% year over year in its most recent quarter to $18 billion."", ""AI demand doesn't seem to be going anywhere, which should create plenty of growth for Nvidia moving forward. Analysts believe the company's earnings will grow by 42% annually over the coming years, arguably justifying Nvidia's valuation at 40 times 2023 profits. That's a PEG ratio of just 1, signaling the stock is still attractive despite its massive 250% climb in 2023."", 'Not every ""Magnificent Seven"" company has grown enough to keep up with its stock. Apple\'s revenue has fallen over the past year, and net income is up just 1%. Apple\'s business can be cyclical, gyrating between periods of growth depending on key iPhone releases. That\'s fine, but it can complicate things when share prices and operating results go in different directions.', 'Analysts have lowered their growth expectations for Apple moving forward. At more than 29 times 2023 earnings, that PEG ratio over 3 makes buying Apple here a tough pill to swallow. Investors should wait for the price to make sense again.', ""Wall Street was down on Meta in 2022 when the company was fighting a slowing advertising business, harmful privacy changes to iPhones, and expensive metaverse projects that weren't showing any return on investment. Shares fell to $89 before CEO Mark Zuckerberg righted the ship by cutting costs, working through the iPhone challenges, and getting revenue growth and profits back on track."", 'Astonishingly, the stock is still attractive at just 25 times 2023 earnings, with expected annual growth of 20% on average moving forward. It turns out that Meta is still a great business, and Wall Street forgot that in a big way. The rally in 2023 undid the pessimism, but there is still room for the growth Meta can achieve in 2024 and beyond.', ""ChatGPT was a viral sensation in 2023, and Microsoft swiftly jumped in, tying itself to its creator, OpenAI, with a multibillion-dollar investment and extended partnership. Between enterprise software, cloud computing, gaming, and more, Microsoft is one of the world's largest and most diversified technology companies. Its cloud positioning amid the AI opportunity has seemingly boosted analyst expectations for its earnings growth in the coming years."", 'Mid-teens growth is nothing to dismiss, but it\'s becoming harder to call Microsoft a growth stock at its whopping $2.8 trillion market cap. At a forward P/E over 33, the stock\'s resulting PEG ratio over 2 isn\'t as appealing as some other ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks.', ""It's not abhorrently expensive, but after its 57% single-year gallop, there are better deals out there. It's OK for investors to be picky."", 'Interestingly, e-commerce and cloud leader Amazon trades at a similar PEG ratio to Microsoft of just over 2. So, why should investors consider buying Amazon over similarly valued Microsoft? Amazon is famous for investing its profits into the business, which can understate its true profit potential. The stock trades at 57 times its bottom-line earnings but just 22 times its operating profits, which are earnings from day-to-day business.', ""Over the past decade, that's over 20% below Amazon's average price-to-cash-from-operations ratio. Amazon has tons going on, including investing in developing its AI technology, a critical ingredient to its future. That's not touching on e-commerce, which still has room to grow over the coming decades (e-commerce is just 15% of U.S. retail)."", ""Electric vehicle and energy company Tesla is another example of share price and fundamentals heading in opposite directions. Tesla began cutting prices in 2023 to boost unit sales. The idea is that more units made and sold will let Tesla lower its prices, a cycle that will price competitors out of the market. It's a bold move that has brought short-term consequences to Tesla's operating results. Gross profit margin is down 22% over the past year."", ""Hopefully, unit sales will grow enough for Tesla to realize the cost savings it's striving for soon. Analysts have aggressively lowered their expectations for Tesla's future earnings growth due to the price cuts. If analysts are correct, Tesla's stock has become far more pricey at a PEG ratio over 4. After the stock ran 130% last year, investors might be better off waiting to buy until the numbers prove Tesla right in its price-cutting strategy."", ""Alphabet's dominance with Google and YouTube overshadows its behind-the-scenes AI potential. The company is leaning on AI to help customers maximize their advertising spend on its platforms (how Alphabet makes most of its money). Its massive pile of user data and pole position among the world's most trafficked websites makes Alphabet a boring but effective money-printing machine."", ""The company spends much of that cash flow buying back tons of stock, lowering the number of outstanding shares by 10% in the past five years. That recipe of growth and buybacks has analysts expecting earnings to compound at over 17% annually. The stock's 57% run in 2023 has raised its valuation, but it remains a solid deal for long-term investors at a PEG ratio of 1.4."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. Importantly, Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (NYSE:PEG) does carry debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?"", ""Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together."", ' See our latest analysis for Public Service Enterprise Group ', ""As you can see below, Public Service Enterprise Group had US$19.7b of debt, at September 2023, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. And it doesn't have much cash, so its net debt is about the same."", 'The latest balance sheet data shows that Public Service Enterprise Group had liabilities of US$5.19b due within a year, and liabilities of US$29.2b falling due after that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$57.0m and US$1.59b worth of receivables due within a year. So it has liabilities totalling US$32.7b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.', ""When you consider that this deficiency exceeds the company's huge US$30.5b market capitalization, you might well be inclined to review the balance sheet intently. In the scenario where the company had to clean up its balance sheet quickly, it seems likely shareholders would suffer extensive dilution."", 'We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.', ""Public Service Enterprise Group has a debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.8 and its EBIT covered its interest expense 6.1 times. This suggests that while the debt levels are significant, we'd stop short of calling them problematic. Pleasingly, Public Service Enterprise Group is growing its EBIT faster than former Australian PM Bob Hawke downs a yard glass, boasting a 112% gain in the last twelve months. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Public Service Enterprise Group can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting."", ""Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. During the last three years, Public Service Enterprise Group burned a lot of cash. While investors are no doubt expecting a reversal of that situation in due course, it clearly does mean its use of debt is more risky."", ""We'd go so far as to say Public Service Enterprise Group's conversion of EBIT to free cash flow was disappointing. But at least it's pretty decent at growing its EBIT; that's encouraging. We should also note that Integrated Utilities industry companies like Public Service Enterprise Group commonly do use debt without problems. Once we consider all the factors above, together, it seems to us that Public Service Enterprise Group's debt is making it a bit risky. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but we'd generally feel more comfortable with less leverage. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. To that end, you should learn about the   3 warning signs  we've spotted with Public Service Enterprise Group (including 2 which are potentially serious) ."", ""If, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks without delay."", 'Have feedback on this article?

From there, that piece of virgin metal is processed several different ways to make a wide range of products, from airplanes to trucks to beverage cans to the foil in your kitchen drawer.', 'But there is no aluminum without alumina. With only one remaining domestic alumina refinery, the U.S. is at risk of a single-point failure for this critical material.', 'When examining reindustrialization policies, it is crucial to evaluate supply chains in their entirety. Narratives surrounding aluminum production—both in industry and policy circles—tend to focus on the smelting process. However, the intermediate materials, like alumina, deserve as much attention as final products in conversations about supply chain resilience.', 'In the coming decade, where these minerals come from and how they are produced will have profound consequences on America’s national security and economic competitiveness. Being dependent on unreliable and hostile actors elevates the strategic imperative of avoiding new dependencies for the critical materials needed to power the green transition.', 'There is a tremendous opportunity to re-shore and ally-shore, especially from Canada, so the U.S. and its allies are not dependent on nations who do not share our interests.

Tyson, though, focuses on meat production rather than grocery properties. And, like REG, Tyson Foods is an undervalued dividend stock. The company just increased its quarterly dividend to $0.49 per share, a 2% increase. That results in a 5.7% total yield accounting for stock buybacks, making this undervalued dividend stock competitive with short-term Treasurys.', 'Of course, as a consumer staple, Tyson faces little opportunity to increase sales through increased marketing or other competitive action.

However, the intermediate materials, like alumina, deserve as much attention as final products in conversations about supply chain resilience.', 'In the coming decade, where these minerals come from and how they are produced will have profound consequences on America’s national security and economic competitiveness.

In this calculation we've used 8.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.255. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

Per the terms of the deal, Bell-Boeing will be engaged in the production and delivery of 59 line clearance kits, 18 integrated aircraft survivability equipment (IASE) A-Kits, and the installation of 16 IASE A-Kits for the MV-22 Osprey jets.', 'The aforementioned equipment will allow increased infrared countermeasure as well as radar warning capability and aircraft survivability to support the MV-22 Osprey aircraft sustainment efforts.', 'A rapid increase in terror attacks has compelled nations to strengthen their arsenal and bump up their defense budget. With the United States being the largest exporter of defense equipment across the world, there is a steady flow of contracts for its combat-proven weaponry from both Pentagon and its foreign allies.

In notes to clients at the end of the year, Jefferies analyst Michael Yee predicted rate cuts would push the sector higher in 2024. Similarly, Mizuho Securities analyst Salim Syed speculated a “broader sector rally” could be coming.', '“Though likely unintentional, the Fed’s more recent optimism seems to have preserved the adage that biotech doesn’t have more than two consecutive down years,” Syed wrote.\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 ', 'Macroeconomic forces can only carry the sector so far, though.

Here are 10 to watch:', 'Company:', 'Vertex Pharmaceuticals', 'Disease:', 'Acute pain', 'Treatment type:', 'Small molecule', 'Trial:', 'NCT05558410, NCT05553366', ""Why it's important:"", 'Vertex Pharmaceuticals has spent years trying to branch out from the cystic fibrosis medicines that account for much of its revenue. That strategy started paying off last year with progress across a number of pipeline programs and a stock run that sent company shares to record highs. Vertex could climb even higher if an experimental medication succeeds in studies in acute pain that are set to read out imminently.', 'Vertex’s treatment, known as VX-548, has shown promise in several different settings in both acute and chronic pain. Those results have brought Vertex to the precipice of bringing a new, non-addictive painkiller to market.', 'Yet questions about VX-548’s potential persist. In a recent report, analysts at the investment bank Stifel pointed out flaws in the mid-stage studies Vertex completed, such as the removal of efficacy data from a particular trial site in one study and a lack of evidence that higher doses are more powerful. Pain drug studies are also notoriously difficult, as the trial goals are subjective measures that can be confounded by a placebo response.', '“Basically, pain is really hard,” Stifel analysts wrote.', 'In early 2024, Vertex will release results from a pair of placebo-controlled studies and a third, single-arm trial, in different forms of acute pain. Late-stage studies in chronic pain are following. The financial implications for Vertex are enormous, with some analysts estimating VX-548 could generate more than $10 billion in peak annual sales — more than the company’s cystic fibrosis drugs. — Ben Fidler', 'Company:', 'Alnylam Pharmaceuticals', 'Disease:', 'Transthyretin amyloidosis cardiomyopathy', 'Treatment type:', 'Small interfering RNA', 'Trial:', 'HELIOS-B', ""Why it's important:"", '2023 could’ve been a turning point for Alnylam Pharmaceuticals. Though the pioneering developer of RNA interference medicines has already brought\xa0five\xa0drugs to market, it’s never been profitable. A new approval for one, Onpattro, in a genetic heart condition called transthyretin amyloidosis cardiomyopathy, was expected to finally change that. But the Food and Drug Administration instead criticized Alnylam’s results at a public meeting and later rejected the company’s application, bucking the recommendation of one of its advisory committees.', 'Alnylam has since lost about one-fifth of its market value and abandoned plans to seek approval of Onpattro in TTR cardiomyopathy. But it could rebound if a drug known as vutrisiran succeeds in a study that’s expected to produce results early this year.', 'Like Onpattro, vutrisiran is sold for a rarer form of TTR that affects the nerves. But it’s more convenient, administered through a subcutaneous injection rather than via infusion every few weeks. Patients also don’t need to take steroids to prepare for treatment. Analysts estimate the drug could bring in billions of dollars in yearly sales, assuming it’s approved for use in cardiomyopathy, too.', 'The study it’s being tested in, Helios-B, could lay the groundwork for such an approval. Unlike the trial of Onpattro, it’s gone on for long enough to show whether vutrisiran can extend lives and prevent hospital stays. A positive effect on health outcomes supported approval of the only available medicine for TTR cardiomyopathy, Pfizer’s pill Vyndamax, as well as an application BridgeBio Pharma recently filed for a similar type of drug.', 'Analysts think vutrisiran could prove superior, given it works differently than Pfizer’s and BridgeBio’s drugs. — Ben Fidler', 'Company:', 'Roche', 'Disease:', 'Lung cancer', 'Treatment type:', 'Antibody', 'Trial:', 'Skyscraper-01', ""Why it's important:"", 'Roche’s trial has been among the most closely watched in oncology for some time, and for good reason. The outcome could determine the worth of a class of cancer immunotherapy treatments that home in on a protein called TIGIT, which has become a top target of drugmakers in recent years.', 'The study, Skyscraper-01, is testing Roche’s drug tiragolumab and another immunotherapy, Tecentriq, against Tecentriq alone in patients with advanced lung cancer. Though tiragolumab previously missed one of the study’s two main objectives, failing to significantly affect disease progression, the Swiss drugmaker hopes the medicine can hit its second and more meaningful goal — helping patients live longer.', 'Last year, an interim analysis Roche completed but never disclosed was inadvertently released and discovered by Wall Street analysts. The results suggested tiragolumab may be extending lives, with one analyst, Leerink Partners’ Daina Graybosch, noting at the time the early results “bode well for a maintained clinical benefit.”', 'The surprise reveal kept hope alive for TIGIT-targeting medicines, which have largely disappointed in clinical testing so far. It also heightened anticipation for the final results, which are expected in early 2024. — Ben Fidler', 'Company:', 'Amylyx Pharmaceuticals', 'Disease:', 'ALS', 'Treatment type:', 'Small molecule', 'Trial:', 'Phoenix', ""Why it's important:"", 'Amylyx’s Relyvrio is a blockbuster-to-be according to some Wall Street analysts. Of course, to meet such expectations, the drug has to stay on the market.', 'The FDA cleared Relyvrio last year as a treatment for ALS, based on a roughly 140-patient study that found it offered small, but significant, benefits on disease progression and survival. By the time approval came through, Amylyx had already started another, much larger trial to confirm the earlier results. That trial, codenamed “Phoenix,” should wrap up by early March.', 'Relyvrio received full approval from U.S. regulators, meaning the company isn’t required to do additional testing for it to remain available. Yet the stakes are still high for Amylyx. FDA staff have been critical of the ways the biotech collected and analyzed data in its smaller study, and, last year, a top agency official called on the company to commit to pulling Relyvrio should confirmatory testing fail.', '“To be clear, if [the trial] is not successful, we will do what is right for patients, which includes voluntarily removing the product from the market,” Justin Klee, Amylyx’s co-CEO, said in response.', 'Whether Amylyx would actually withdraw Relyvrio remains a point of debate. G. Caleb Alexander, a professor of epidemiology and medicine at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and an adviser to the FDA, has said that the agency “significantly understates the complexity and likelihood of their pulling a product from the market.” — Jacob Bell', 'Company:', 'Johnson & Johnson', 'Disease:', 'Major depressive disorder', 'Treatment type:', 'Small molecule', 'Trial:', 'NCT05455684', ""Why it's important:"", 'The first big readout for a potentially new type of depression drug could come as early as June, according to a federal database.', 'The late-stage trial, which has enrolled around 540 participants, is testing whether an experimental Johnson & Johnson medication called aticaprant can work as an add-on therapy to improve symptoms in certain adults with major depressive disorder.', 'Aticaprant inhibits what are known as KORs, or kappa opioid receptors, a type of protein involved in a variety of nervous system functions — from stress to pain to mood regulation. J&J has high expectations for the drug, classifying it as a key growth driver during a recent research and development event and predicting peak sales of $1 billion to $5 billion.', 'J&J isn’t the only one seeing an opportunity, however. Neumora Therapeutics, a richly funded biotechnology company, has its own KOR-targeting medicine in late-stage development. AbbVie will also have one in its pipeline should a planned $8.7 billion purchase of Cerevel Therapeutics close.', 'In a December note to clients, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams, who covers Neumora, wrote that the J&J results will be important for validating the KOR drug class.', 'Abrahams estimates Neumora’s candidate is three to six months behind aticaprant. But, given the “high unmet need in depression, the size of the market, and the lack of new treatment options, we believe there is sufficient room in the market for both drugs,” he wrote. — Jacob Bell', 'Company:', 'Gilead Sciences', 'Disease:', 'Lung cancer', 'Treatment type:', 'Antibody-drug conjugate', 'Trial:', 'Evoke-01', ""Why it's important:"", 'A lot has changed since Gilead Sciences paid $21 billion for biotechnology company Immunomedics in 2020.', 'Gilead acquired Immunomedics to get ahold of a breast cancer drug, Trodelvy, it believed would be a key part of a growing oncology business. At the time, one analyst estimated Trodelvy could bring in peak sales of nearly $5 billion in breast tumors alone, and potentially more if successful elsewhere.', 'Trodelvy has a long way to go, with annual sales reaching $764 million through the first nine months of this year. Its progress is also overshadowed by Enhertu, a similar type of medicine from AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo. Enhertu broke the billion-dollar mark in 2022, is marketed for more tumor types, and won a first-of-its-kind approval in breast cancer. Trodelvy, meanwhile, has faced questions about its benefits, as well as whether it can compete with Enhertu and a growing array of rivals.', 'One major opportunity lies just ahead. Gilead will soon reveal data from a study testing Trodelvy against chemotherapy in patients previously treated for a common form of lung cancer — a setting that could unlock a multibillion dollar market in which a top competitor from AstraZeneca and Daiichi delivered mixed results.', 'AstraZeneca and Daiichi’s findings have lowered expectations for Trodelvy. But differences in Gilead’s drug and trial design could lead to a better outcome, Leerink Partners analysts noted in October. — Ben Fidler', 'Company:', 'Sanofi', 'Disease:', 'Multiple sclerosis', 'Treatment type:', 'Small molecule', 'Trial:', 'Gemini-1, Gemini-2', ""Why it's important:"", 'The first big test of whether cancer drugs known as BTK inhibitors can also treat autoimmune diseases ended in disappointment for the German pharmaceutical giant Merck KGaA. The company’s prospect, evobrutinib, fared little better than a standard therapy in a pair of Phase 3 studies in multiple sclerosis, wiping out billions of dollars in share value.', 'The study setback closely followed news the FDA had partially suspended testing of another entrant in the BTK drug race, Roche’s fenebrutinib, due to safety concerns. That wasn’t the first time the FDA had flagged signs of liver damage among BTK blockers: The regulator previously halted a test of Merck KGaA’s medicine as well as a study of Sanofi’s tolebrutinib, the next drug in the group headed for a Phase 3 readout.', 'Sanofi has high hopes for tolebrutinib. The drug, acquired through a multibillion dollar deal in 2020, is one of 12 pipeline prospects it highlighted in December as future blockbusters. Like Roche and Merck KGaA’s drugs, it’s a newer type of BTK inhibitor designed to more easily penetrate the blood-brain barrier, which is meant to make it useful in treating several forms of multiple sclerosis.', 'Still, tolebrutinib faces skepticism in the wake of Merck KGaA’s failure. In that trial, the drug Merck KGaA’s tested its BTK blocker against, Aubagio, performed surprisingly well. In a research note at the time, Jefferies analyst Brian Balchin speculated current multiple sclerosis studies may now be enrolling less sick patients than before, making it more challenging for a newer medicine to show a benefit. That could impact other ongoing studies, “namely Sanofi’s tolebrutinib,” he wrote.', 'Results are expected in the middle of the year. — Ben Fidler', 'Company:', 'Pfizer', 'Disease:', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Treatment type:', 'Gene therapy', 'Trial:', 'NCT04281485', ""Why it's important:"", 'The first gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy arrived last year when the Food and Drug Administration granted an accelerated approval to Sarepta Therapeutics’ Elevidys. But it’s only available to young kids, and a key study meant to confirm its benefits missed its main goal. That’s left an opening for Sarepta’s closest competitor, Pfizer, to catch up.', 'Pfizer is currently running a Phase 3 trial for a similar type of Duchenne gene therapy. Unlike Sarepta, Pfizer decided not to seek a speedy approval before getting the results, arguing the late-stage study would bring clearer answers.', 'Pfizer previously told investors to expect an early look at that study by the end of 2023. But in December, it switched up its plan, deciding instead to wait until the final results are ready in 2024.', 'Pfizer appears to believe it has a better chance to top Sarepta by letting the study run its course, hoping a larger and longer sample size might yield a clear treatment benefit. In a December conference call, CEO Albert Bourla said delaying the readout will give “more opportunity [for] the product to be successful.”', 'If it is, Pfizer would rebound from an earlier setback. Testing of Pfizer’s gene therapy was slowed by safety concerns, including the death of a study participant. Sarepta hasn’t dealt with the same issues, but it also hasn’t definitively proven its treatment can change the trajectory of Duchenne. — Jonathan Gardner', 'Company:', 'Moderna', 'Disease:', 'Influenza, COVID-19', 'Treatment type:', 'mRNA vaccine', 'Trial:', 'NCT04281485', ""Why it's important:"", 'Ever since messenger RNA technology helped create vaccines for COVID-19, investors have been waiting for a second act. Demand for the shots developed by partners Pfizer and BioNTech, as well as Moderna, has cooled, depressing the companies’ share prices and dwindling their revenue.', 'For Pfizer, the fall has been particularly hard, as plummeting sales of its COVID-19 shot and antiviral pill forced revised revenue forecasts, a cost-cutting plan and one of its worst stock market years in recent history. Moderna, too, is reeling, with shares dropping 50% in 2023 and revenue projections dialed down.', ""One area the developers have circled is influenza, arguing the speed and adaptability of mRNA technology can be used to quickly match a new year’s prominent strains. Current flu shots are only about 40% to 60% effective, so there’s room for improvement. But though Pfizer and Moderna succeeded in late-stage trials, some analysts have criticized the results and questioned the shots' sales prospects."", 'Some Wall Street analysts think the two rivals could have better luck with combination vaccines designed to protect against the flu as well as COVID-19. A two-pronged vaccine could make fall immunizations more convenient and spur uptake, which “we see as a more reasonable commercial argument,” wrote Leerink Partners analyst Mani Foroohar, in October.', 'Moderna and Pfizer both reported promising results in early testing last fall and have moved on to late-stage studies.', 'Moderna appears positioned to get to the finish line first. Results from its Phase 3 trial could be coming in the first half of this year, according to a federal database. — Delilah Alvarado', 'Company:', 'Beam Therapeutics', 'Disease:', 'Sickle cell', 'Treatment type:', 'Base editing', 'Trial:', 'Beacon', ""Why it's important:"", ""The world's first CRISPR gene editing medicine has arrived, with the approval of Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics' Casgevy for sickle cell disease in the U.S. and U.K."", ""While Casgevy is a complex treatment that comes with several notable risks, it's considered to be near curative, eliminating in testing the pain crises people with sickle cell experience."", 'But a number of biotech companies still think there\'s room for improvement, Beam Therapeutics among them. A second generation CRISPR company, Beam uses a derivation of the Nobel Prize-winning technology that allows it to change a single ""letter"" in a string of DNA code.', 'Beam has recently begun a study testing this method, known as ""base editing,"" for treatment of sickle cell. It expects to share initial data from the first few patients treated in the study next year.', 'The readout is important for Beam, which, while high-profile and well funded, was recently forced to restructure its research and lay off staff. The data will also be a major checkpoint for base editing, clinical trial results for which have only come from Verve Therapeutics to date.', ""What the initial cut of data won’t prove, at least not yet, is whether Beam's approach can improve on Casgevy.

Investors' interpretation of the idea means a stock won't experience two wildly bullish years in a row."", 'The thing is, lightning actually can and does strike the same place twice. Tall trees and skyscrapers are frequent targets. And in the same sense, a hot ticker can log two big, back-to-back yearly gains. You just have to find the right stock!', ""Although the 280% gain that shares of IonQ (NYSE: IONQ) dished out in 2023 will certainly be a tough act to follow, there's no reason to assume 2024 can't be another bullish year. In fact, there are four specific reasons the coming year could be another winning one for IonQ stock. In no particular order..."", 'Most investors have likely heard the term ""quantum computing."" It\'s not a stretch to say, however, that most investors don\'t truly know what it is or why they should care; the budding business\'s leading players haven\'t exactly made it easy for the average person to understand.', ""This is the year that could change, though, in turn changing investors' view of companies in the business."", 'Ushering in this understanding will be the practical use of quantum computers in powering technologies that investors are more familiar with, like artificial intelligence (AI), and generative AI in particular. And as it turns out, IonQ is setting up shop in this nook of the artificial intelligence market. In August, the company announced an agreement with Zapata AI ""to uncover new potential advantages of quantum computing that could help solve complex real-world business problems,"" expanding on its previously forged generative AI partnership.', ""It remains to be seen exactly what any end product of this collaboration will be or even look like, but the companies are seeking solutions for actual business problems. It's practical, tangible projects like this that will make IonQ's technology a real and practical one for interested investors."", 'The mainstreaming and improved understanding of quantum computing will likely have another beneficial effect on IonQ stock. That is, they will highlight the fact that IonQ is years ahead of many of its peers in terms of practical application with its simpler quantum-computing solution.', ""In layman's terms, quantum computers use subatomic particles like ions, photons, or electrons to handle computations rather than the metallic or silicon circuits used in most modern-day computers. This is how quantum computers are infinitely faster than conventional computers."", ""There's more than one kind of subatomic particle suited to serve as the basis of a quantum computer, however. IonQ's trapped-ion approach is one of the easiest ones to utilize and commercialize. And that's exactly what the company is doing."", ""This is in contrast to most other outfits developing quantum-computing platforms. Take Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google and IBM (NYSE: IBM) as examples. Both are planning to offer utility-scale quantum-computing solutions by 2030, with IBM set to unveil a less powerful quantum-computing platform a bit earlier. The superconducting-based qubits these systems are built around are difficult and expensive to utilize. The same can be said for Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) quantum-computing efforts that rely on relatively rare Marjorana particles."", ""These alternatives may ultimately provide more computing power than IonQ's trapped-ion technology can, solving problems with greater precision. But the technology is years away from being ready for widespread commercial use. IonQ is building functioning, commercialized, trapped-ion quantum computers right now that are more than powerful enough. The fact that the company booked $6.1 million in revenue last quarter and lined up another $26.3 million during the same three-month stretch confirms that enterprises and institutions are ready for higher-level computing solutions even if they may be less than state-of-the-art solutions a decade from now."", 'Speaking of technology, as IonQ continues to refine its trapped-ion quantum-computing systems, the company anticipates another big leap in 2024, setting the stage for a technological ""quantum leap"" in 2025.', 'But first things first.', ""Investors keeping their finger on the pulse of quantum computing have probably heard the term algorithmic qubits, or AQ for short. This is a measure of the number of subatomic particles within a quantum-computing system performing a function at any given time. In more rudimentary terms, it's a measure of computing power, or speed. IonQ's most powerful quantum-computing platform -- Forte -- boasts an #AQ number of 29, although the company expects to produce systems reaching #AQ figures of 35 in 2024."", ""It's what's apt to happen the year after that, however, that could prove game-changing. In 2025, IonQ believes it will be able to offer quantum-computing platforms with #AQ scores of 64."", 'This is no small milestone. As IonQ\'s third-quarter earnings release explains, ""The company believes that in reaching this #AQ milestone, its systems will deliver quantum advantage for certain use cases and classical computers will no longer be able to fully simulate an IonQ system.""', 'Simply reaching an #AQ of 35 is likely to draw attention to the fact that an #AQ score of 64 is within reach.', ""Last but not least, 2024 could be another good one for IonQ stock simply because tech giants and other quantum-computing start-ups are looking for ways to better position themselves to capitalize on what's clearly a big opportunity."", ""That's not a prediction that IonQ will be acquired (which is a lousy sole basis for owning a stock, by the way). But IonQ doesn't have to find a buyer in order to benefit from a widespread rush to enter or further penetrate the market. Demand for other developers' intellectual property alone could be enough to continue pushing IonQ shares up to an even more premium valuation."", 'That\'s not a prediction simply pulled out of a hat either. Germany\'s investment management outfit VC HTGF\'s senior manager (and physicist) Gernot Berger believes bigger tech companies will ""increasingly seek strategic alliances, collaborations, and above all, potential acquisitions to solidify their positions"" within the quantum-computing arena this year. The Quantum Insider\'s Matt Swayne predicts a wave of dealmaking this year simply because ""research results have been promising, which is liable to attract big companies that have sat on the sidelines."" IonQ\'s CEO Peter Chapman expects the quantum-computing industry\'s coming year to look much like last year\'s rush to buy and/or build conversational AI solutions once ChatGPT was made available to the masses.', ""Whatever's in the cards in this regard, it should create a tailwind for IonQ stock."", ""Another guaranteed mega-gain from IonQ shares in 2024? No, there are no guarantees when it comes to stock-picking... even when the story is as compelling as this company's is."", 'While awareness and understanding of quantum computing are starting to swell, institutional funding of these companies and quantum-computing projects is fading, with financial backers becoming pickier about the projects they want to get behind. Practical revenue potential is increasingly a factor behind funding now. As Quantum Insider\'s Swayne notes, quantum start-ups and/or their stocks are just ""really freaking expensive."" That\'s a hurdle to be sure, made even higher by the fact that IonQ remains in the red.', ""It's a dynamic, however, that arguably plays into the hand IonQ is holding rather than working against it. The company's already got practical, tangible solutions to sell to a market that's starting to recognize the potential of quantum computing; generative AI is an especially exciting opportunity right now. In this vein, analysts believe IonQ will report top-line growth of nearly 80% in 2024 following 2023's likely revenue growth of approximately 95%."", ""It's an above-average risk to be sure, and the stock will almost assuredly continue dishing out above-average volatility.

The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, Infrastructure Act and CHIPS Act is providing an unprecedented influx of government funding to spur domestic manufacturing. This is especially true for dual-use minerals and materials needed for the green energy transition and defense applications.', 'However, there is much more at stake than just the lithium, cobalt, and nickel we hear about for EV batteries.\xa0', 'The U.S. needs more copper for energy transmission and storage, more titanium for defense and aerospace applications, and more gallium to produce critical semiconductors. Not surprisingly, the U.S. is a net importer of copper, Russia is a leading producer of titanium, and China produces 98% of global primary gallium. These are just a handful of materials that are essential to the electrification of economies that have been the subject of supply chain coercion.', 'Just look at alumina, the key input for making aluminum.', 'Aluminum has long been critical to U.S. economic and national security, from electrical infrastructure to the aerospace, auto, and defense sectors.

From there, that piece of virgin metal is processed several different ways to make a wide range of products, from airplanes to trucks to beverage cans to the foil in your kitchen drawer.', 'But there is no aluminum without alumina. With only one remaining domestic alumina refinery, the U.S. is at risk of a single-point failure for this critical material.', 'When examining reindustrialization policies, it is crucial to evaluate supply chains in their entirety. Narratives surrounding aluminum production—both in industry and policy circles—tend to focus on the smelting process. However, the intermediate materials, like alumina, deserve as much attention as final products in conversations about supply chain resilience.', 'In the coming decade, where these minerals come from and how they are produced will have profound consequences on America’s national security and economic competitiveness.

Both companies play different roles in the AI ecosystem but are vital to making it run as we know it today. For investors wondering which may be the better AI stock, it comes down to dependence.', ""No other company benefited more from the recent AI hype than Nvidia. The company's stock finished 2023 up over 238% -- almost 10 times the S&P 500's returns. The surge helped it join the coveted trillion-dollar market cap club."", ""Nvidia is one of the world leaders in graphics processing units (GPUs). GPUs' original purpose was to render complex graphics in gaming, but they have since revolutionized AI and machine learning because of their ability to handle processing complex tasks. Training AI models requires complex computations, and GPUs make this process faster and more efficient."", ""There's also the data aspect. The data needed to train AI models is massive, so it can't be stored on traditional hard drives or a cloud network. All the data must be kept in large, sophisticated data centers. GPUs are to these data centers what engines are to sports cars. That's what makes Nvidia crucial to the AI ecosystem."", ""TSMC is the global leader in semiconductor (chip) production. It pioneered the foundry model, where it manufactures chips specifically for its client's needs instead of mass producing them for general sale. You can't buy TSMC chips online like consumer products, but if you're looking for custom high-performing chips, you can contract TSMC to manufacture them for your specific needs."", ""TSMC is a powerhouse whose clients include Apple, Tesla, and, yup, you guessed it: Nvidia. Because of its advanced chipmaking capabilities (many of which other competitors can't replicate because of patents), TSMC has been the go-to choice for companies needing top-of-the-line chips that deliver exceptional performance."", ""Without TSMC's chips, companies that deal with AI would have a hard time finding an alternative that compares to the quality, efficiency, and scale of production TSMC provides. That's what makes the company so vital to the AI ecosystem. If you consider a consumer-facing AI product like ChatGPT the tip of the iceberg, TSMC's chips would be the unseen base under the surface."", ""When I think about whether Nvidia or TSMC is the better AI stock, my mind goes to reliance. TSMC is the primary manufacturer of Nvidia's chips, so its supply relies heavily on TSMC -- and that's putting it very lightly."", ""TSMC has a high production scale, but its production capacity is still fixed nonetheless. That means any shortages (like we witnessed beginning in 2020) or slowdowns in TSMC's chip production will directly affect Nvidia's ability to meet demand for its business."", ""Nvidia is a big client of TSMC, but it's not its only big client. It has a fairly broad customer base that expands many companies and industries. This diversification, in my opinion, gives TSMC a more predictable and stable business compared to Nvidia, especially in the long term."", ""Although it's not new, AI seems to be in the earlier stages of what it could be. The industry will likely undergo rapid changes, and since Nvidia operates closer to the end-use of AI technology, it'll have to adapt and evolve more so than TSMC probably will.

With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price.

The stock is currently priced at US$495 on the market compared to our intrinsic value of $367.26. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Given that NVIDIA’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.', 'Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for NVIDIA. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.', 'Are you a shareholder? NVDA’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe NVDA should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable.

We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company.

Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 22% the company's ROE is quite impressive.

Concerns over slowing economic growth and supply-chain woes are other headwinds.Despite the challenges mentioned above, we believe that the space still has fuel left in the tank, especially for operators that target growth opportunities and operating efficiency initiatives. Even though economies are reopening, consumers’ thirst for online shopping is rampant. Cost-cut efforts to drive the bottom line are commendable as well. In view of these favorable developments surrounding the space, we advise investors to focus on\xa0United Parcel Service UPS and FedEx\xa0FDX.', 'About the Industry', 'The companies housed in the Zacks Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo industry provide air delivery and freight services. Most players in the space are involved in offering specialized transportation and logistics services. Some participants provide a range of supply-chain solutions, such as freight forwarding, customs brokerage, fulfillment, returns, financial transactions and repairs. The companies’ well-being in this industrial cohort is directly proportional to the health of the economy. Leading industry players, including UPS and FDX, transport millions of packages each day across the globe. Apart from operating a ground fleet of multiple vehicles, some of these companies maintain an air fleet. While some players focus on providing air transportation services for passengers and cargo, others offer services to entities that outsource air cargo lifting needs.', '4 Key Trends to Watch in the Transportation-Air Freight & Cargo Industry', 'Weak Demand Scenario: A Grave Concern: Due to the decline in shipping demand, particularly in Asia and Europe, volumes are being hurt. Lackluster volumes are hurting the results of key industry players like FDX. FDX reported lower-than-expected earnings per share (EPS) and revenues in second-quarter fiscal 2024 mainly due to demand woes. Another industry player — Air Transport Services ATSG — is suffering due to weak demand for cargo aircraft. Owing to the soft demand scenario, management trimmed its 2023 EPS guidance. The projection for 2024 capital expenditures has also been slashed due to the airfreight demand softness.\xa0 The conflict in Israel is also expected to hurt performance.E-commerce Still a Force to Reckon With: It is hardly surprising that the growth pace of e-commerce demand has slowed from levels witnessed at the peak of the pandemic with the reopening of economies. However, it remains impressive, driven by the convenience associated with online shopping. The race to digitization also supports the momentum in e-commerce growth.\xa0 E-commerce demand strength should continue to support growth of the industry players.', 'Supply-Chain Disruptions & High Costs: Although economic activities picked up from the pandemic gloom, supply-chain disruptions continue to dent stocks in the industry. Increased operating costs are also limiting bottom-line growth. Costs will likely continue to be steep going forward due to supply chain and labor troubles.\xa0 Also, since fuel expenses represent a key input cost for any transportation player, operating expenses are on the way up, given the rise in fuel cost.', 'Focus on Cost-Cuts to Drive Bottom line: Despite signs of cooling inflation, we are by no means out of the woods. With inflation still above the Fed’s 2% target, more interest rate hikes in the near term cannot be ruled out. We note that the industry has been experiencing significant levels of inflation, including higher prices for labor, freight and fuel. The industry players are focusing on cost-cutting measures and making efforts to improve productivity and efficiency to mitigate high expenses and weaker-than-expected demand scenarios.', 'Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull Prospects', 'The Zacks Air Freight and Cargo industry, housed within the broader Zacks\xa0Transportation\xa0sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #241. This rank places it in the bottom 4% of more than 250 Zacks industries.', 'The group’s\xa0Zacks Industry Rank, the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates dismal near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.', 'The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

108,250fa314-9eaa-34b9-8413-6657916b7289,UPS,2024-01-02,3 Dividend Stocks That Could Soar in 2024,Motley Fool,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/250fa314-9eaa-34b9-8413-6657916b7289/3-dividend-stocks-that-could.html,1704189960,STORY,"['UPS', 'JCI', 'WHR', 'FDX']","[""If you like dividends, then you'll be interested in investing in UPS (NYSE: UPS), building products company Johnson Controls (NYSE: JCI), and home appliances company Whirlpool (NYSE: WHR). Their average dividend yield is 4.1%, and they are attractive stocks to buy. However, they are value stocks for a reason, and it makes sense to explore that reason before buying in."", 'Yielding 4.1%, UPS is coming off of a difficult 2023. Delivery volumes have failed to meet expectations due to a weakening economy and protracted labor negotiations, leading customers to divert traffic to other networks. As a result, UPS will miss the earnings expectations management laid out at the start of the year.', ""It's been a disappointing year, and as FedEx's recent commentary attests, it's still a weak environment, so don't be surprised if there's more pressure on delivery volumes in the first half of 2024."", 'That said, there are three reasons UPS can make a big comeback in 2024. First, management continues to make significant progress in its aims of expanding its small and medium-sized business and healthcare markets, as it focuses on improving the profitability of its deliveries rather than chasing volume growth.', 'Second, UPS is already winning back delivery volumes lost due to the Teamster negotiations. For example, the average daily volume was down 15.2% in August on a year-over-year basis at the high point of friction, but as UPS started to win back volumes, it was only down 7.4% in the last week of September. Third, lower interest rates in 2024 will take the brakes off of the economy, and delivery volumes should pick up accordingly.', 'Finally, UPS continues investing in smart facilities and automation that help reduce cost per piece by, for example, improving misload rates and scanning packages upon pickup.', 'It will take time for UPS to recover, and it faces some near-term risk. But it trades at 16 times trailing earnings, and investors will earn a 4.1% yield while they wait for improving earnings in the second half of 2024.', 'The building products company Johnson Controls is attractive. Its heating, ventilation, air conditioning, fire and security products, digital platforms, and building control solutions help building owners reduce emissions and operate buildings more efficiently to meet their net-zero targets. On its investor day in 2021, management outlined that it had a $250 billion incremental market opportunity ahead of it over the next decade.', ""Indeed, Johnson Controls is growing. It's just not growing as much as management expected. The stock price is down 29% since the start of 2022 after the company missed its initial 2022 earnings per share (EPS) guidance of $3.22-$3.32 in reporting $3 in 2022."", ""Fast-forward to its fiscal 2023, and management's initial guidance was for organic revenue growth of high single digits to low double digits and EPS of $3.20-$3.60. Management delivered on the earnings ($3.50) but organic revenue growth of just 8% (and just 2% in the fourth quarter ) is disappointing."", ""On balance, I think giving management the benefit of the doubt makes sense. The reason behind the sluggish sales comes down to dealers running down inventory built up previously when it was harder to obtain products due to the supply chain crisis. It's not the only company reporting such conditions. In addition, its orders and backlog remain in growth mode."", ""Johnson Controls trades at less than 16 times Wall Street's estimated forward earnings and yields 2.6%."", ""Disappointing trading in Europe and Asia and interest rates pressuring its core North American market have created a problematic 2023 for Whirlpool. When management released its third-quarter earnings in late October, investors didn't take too kindly to it lowering its full-year adjusted EPS guidance to the low end of its previous range of $16-$18."", ""It's never good news when companies cut full-year guidance on their third-quarter earnings calls because it implies deteriorating earnings momentum in the fourth quarter. Moreover, companies with cyclical exposure to the economy, such as FedEx, and others with exposure to consumer discretionary spending, like Nike, have disappointed investors with their growth outlooks."", ""That said, there's little Whirlpool can do about rising interest rates choking off demand, and the headwinds it's currently facing could turn into tailwinds if rates come down in 2024. In addition, management is on track for $800 million in cost-cutting actions. It is also set to position its Europe, Middle East, and Africa business into a new business with Arcelik's European business and create a new stand-alone company with Whirlpool owning a 25% share. The deal will see Whirlpool exit a region where it's found it tough to generate an adequate profit margin."", 'With the turnaround strategy in place and the prospects of lower interest rates, Whirlpool and its 5.8% dividend yield will suit enterprising investors.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in United Parcel Service right now?', 'Before you buy stock in United Parcel Service, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and United Parcel Service wasn't one of them.

But there's a catch. The company finished last September with $126.4 billion in unsecured debt, and interest expenses on those debts rose sharply last year."", 'Plenty of new broadband subscribers are producing the huge profits Verizon needs to meet a rising dividend commitment and service its enormous debt load. The company expects to report $18 billion in free cash flow for 2023, or 28% more than it reported a year earlier.', ""Over the past year, Verizon used 80% of the free cash flow its operations generated to meet its dividend commitment. Cash flows seem sufficient to continue its dividend-raising streak, but there isn't any room for error. Retired investors who can't afford any dividend reductions might want to stay on the sidelines for a few quarters until its debt load appears more easily manageable."", 'Shares of American Express (NYSE: AXP) hit a low point this fall, after its CEO told investors he noticed a consumer spending slowdown in October. A successful Black Friday helped the stock quickly bounce off its lows to finish the year 26.8% higher.', ""At recent prices, American Express offers an unattractive 1.3% yield, but it's not shy about sharing profits with investors. Heaps of share buybacks have lowered its share count by 14% over the past five years."", 'They may start small, but the dividends you receive from this company could be significant by the time you retire.

Right now you can buy the stock for just 7.5 times trailing free cash flow.', ""The credit card business is cyclical, but it doesn't look like we're headed for a trough right now. The charge-off rate on credit card loans held by commercial banks was a mediocre 3.49% in the third quarter. Unlike Visa and Mastercard, American Express keeps loans on its balance sheet and tends to be more discerning about its customers' credit profiles.

The randomized clinical trial will study the safety and effectiveness of the FARAPULSE PFA System as a first-line treatment for persistent AF.', 'This is the only trial to study the use of PFA as frontline therapy in patients with this form of AF. The company also anticipates the FDA’s approval of the FARAPULSE PFA System in the first quarter of 2024.', 'Persistent AF is sustained arrhythmia that lasts for more than a week, unlike paroxysmal AF, which describes symptoms that last for seven days or fewer. The early treatment of persistent AF can reduce the risk of blood clots, stroke and heart failure and may prevent the disease from becoming permanent. Patients are often treated with AADs as frontline therapy for heart rhythm maintenance, though some can experience adverse effects and limited efficacy.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Cardiac ablation is a potential alternative interventional strategy for those living with persistent AF.

Advancing the therapy as an early treatment for persistent AF may lead to enhanced long-term outcomes, establishing the FARAPULSE PFA System as the preferred method for treating the disease.', 'The trial will enroll more than 500 patients diagnosed with persistent AF at up to 75 sites globally. Patients in the study will be randomized to undergo pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) and left atrial posterior wall ablation using the FARAPULSE PFA System or receive AAD treatment (an anti-arrhythmic drug commonly prescribed for patients living with persistent AF) and followed for three years. The trial will evaluate the outcomes of therapy provided with the FARAPULSE PFA System versus AADs, including device-or procedure-related adverse events, the rates of freedom from AF, atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia and AF burden — a measurement of the amount of AF an individual experiences.', 'All patients in the trial will also be inserted with the Boston Scientific LUX-Dx Insertable Cardiac Monitor. This device simplifies the monitoring process for patients by automatically capturing and transmitting arrhythmia episode data and is designed to detect the recurrence of cardiac arrhythmias and assess AF burden by providing continuous rhythm monitoring.

That strategy started paying off last year with progress across a number of pipeline programs and a stock run that sent company shares to record highs. Vertex could climb even higher if an experimental medication succeeds in studies in acute pain that are set to read out imminently.', 'Vertex’s treatment, known as VX-548, has shown promise in several different settings in both acute and chronic pain. Those results have brought Vertex to the precipice of bringing a new, non-addictive painkiller to market.', 'Yet questions about VX-548’s potential persist. In a recent report, analysts at the investment bank Stifel pointed out flaws in the mid-stage studies Vertex completed, such as the removal of efficacy data from a particular trial site in one study and a lack of evidence that higher doses are more powerful. Pain drug studies are also notoriously difficult, as the trial goals are subjective measures that can be confounded by a placebo response.', '“Basically, pain is really hard,” Stifel analysts wrote.', 'In early 2024, Vertex will release results from a pair of placebo-controlled studies and a third, single-arm trial, in different forms of acute pain. Late-stage studies in chronic pain are following. The financial implications for Vertex are enormous, with some analysts estimating VX-548 could generate more than $10 billion in peak annual sales — more than the company’s cystic fibrosis drugs. — Ben Fidler', 'Company:', 'Alnylam Pharmaceuticals', 'Disease:', 'Transthyretin amyloidosis cardiomyopathy', 'Treatment type:', 'Small interfering RNA', 'Trial:', 'HELIOS-B', ""Why it's important:"", '2023 could’ve been a turning point for Alnylam Pharmaceuticals. Though the pioneering developer of RNA interference medicines has already brought\xa0five\xa0drugs to market, it’s never been profitable. A new approval for one, Onpattro, in a genetic heart condition called transthyretin amyloidosis cardiomyopathy, was expected to finally change that. But the Food and Drug Administration instead criticized Alnylam’s results at a public meeting and later rejected the company’s application, bucking the recommendation of one of its advisory committees.', 'Alnylam has since lost about one-fifth of its market value and abandoned plans to seek approval of Onpattro in TTR cardiomyopathy. But it could rebound if a drug known as vutrisiran succeeds in a study that’s expected to produce results early this year.', 'Like Onpattro, vutrisiran is sold for a rarer form of TTR that affects the nerves. But it’s more convenient, administered through a subcutaneous injection rather than via infusion every few weeks. Patients also don’t need to take steroids to prepare for treatment. Analysts estimate the drug could bring in billions of dollars in yearly sales, assuming it’s approved for use in cardiomyopathy, too.', 'The study it’s being tested in, Helios-B, could lay the groundwork for such an approval. Unlike the trial of Onpattro, it’s gone on for long enough to show whether vutrisiran can extend lives and prevent hospital stays. A positive effect on health outcomes supported approval of the only available medicine for TTR cardiomyopathy, Pfizer’s pill Vyndamax, as well as an application BridgeBio Pharma recently filed for a similar type of drug.', 'Analysts think vutrisiran could prove superior, given it works differently than Pfizer’s and BridgeBio’s drugs. — Ben Fidler', 'Company:', 'Roche', 'Disease:', 'Lung cancer', 'Treatment type:', 'Antibody', 'Trial:', 'Skyscraper-01', ""Why it's important:"", 'Roche’s trial has been among the most closely watched in oncology for some time, and for good reason.

Though tiragolumab previously missed one of the study’s two main objectives, failing to significantly affect disease progression, the Swiss drugmaker hopes the medicine can hit its second and more meaningful goal — helping patients live longer.', 'Last year, an interim analysis Roche completed but never disclosed was inadvertently released and discovered by Wall Street analysts. The results suggested tiragolumab may be extending lives, with one analyst, Leerink Partners’ Daina Graybosch, noting at the time the early results “bode well for a maintained clinical benefit.”', 'The surprise reveal kept hope alive for TIGIT-targeting medicines, which have largely disappointed in clinical testing so far.

Of course, to meet such expectations, the drug has to stay on the market.', 'The FDA cleared Relyvrio last year as a treatment for ALS, based on a roughly 140-patient study that found it offered small, but significant, benefits on disease progression and survival. By the time approval came through, Amylyx had already started another, much larger trial to confirm the earlier results. That trial, codenamed “Phoenix,” should wrap up by early March.', 'Relyvrio received full approval from U.S. regulators, meaning the company isn’t required to do additional testing for it to remain available. Yet the stakes are still high for Amylyx. FDA staff have been critical of the ways the biotech collected and analyzed data in its smaller study, and, last year, a top agency official called on the company to commit to pulling Relyvrio should confirmatory testing fail.', '“To be clear, if [the trial] is not successful, we will do what is right for patients, which includes voluntarily removing the product from the market,” Justin Klee, Amylyx’s co-CEO, said in response.', 'Whether Amylyx would actually withdraw Relyvrio remains a point of debate. G.

J&J has high expectations for the drug, classifying it as a key growth driver during a recent research and development event and predicting peak sales of $1 billion to $5 billion.', 'J&J isn’t the only one seeing an opportunity, however.

At the time, one analyst estimated Trodelvy could bring in peak sales of nearly $5 billion in breast tumors alone, and potentially more if successful elsewhere.', 'Trodelvy has a long way to go, with annual sales reaching $764 million through the first nine months of this year. Its progress is also overshadowed by Enhertu, a similar type of medicine from AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo. Enhertu broke the billion-dollar mark in 2022, is marketed for more tumor types, and won a first-of-its-kind approval in breast cancer. Trodelvy, meanwhile, has faced questions about its benefits, as well as whether it can compete with Enhertu and a growing array of rivals.', 'One major opportunity lies just ahead. Gilead will soon reveal data from a study testing Trodelvy against chemotherapy in patients previously treated for a common form of lung cancer — a setting that could unlock a multibillion dollar market in which a top competitor from AstraZeneca and Daiichi delivered mixed results.', 'AstraZeneca and Daiichi’s findings have lowered expectations for Trodelvy.

The company’s prospect, evobrutinib, fared little better than a standard therapy in a pair of Phase 3 studies in multiple sclerosis, wiping out billions of dollars in share value.', 'The study setback closely followed news the FDA had partially suspended testing of another entrant in the BTK drug race, Roche’s fenebrutinib, due to safety concerns. That wasn’t the first time the FDA had flagged signs of liver damage among BTK blockers: The regulator previously halted a test of Merck KGaA’s medicine as well as a study of Sanofi’s tolebrutinib, the next drug in the group headed for a Phase 3 readout.', 'Sanofi has high hopes for tolebrutinib. The drug, acquired through a multibillion dollar deal in 2020, is one of 12 pipeline prospects it highlighted in December as future blockbusters. Like Roche and Merck KGaA’s drugs, it’s a newer type of BTK inhibitor designed to more easily penetrate the blood-brain barrier, which is meant to make it useful in treating several forms of multiple sclerosis.', 'Still, tolebrutinib faces skepticism in the wake of Merck KGaA’s failure. In that trial, the drug Merck KGaA’s tested its BTK blocker against, Aubagio, performed surprisingly well. In a research note at the time, Jefferies analyst Brian Balchin speculated current multiple sclerosis studies may now be enrolling less sick patients than before, making it more challenging for a newer medicine to show a benefit.

That’s left an opening for Sarepta’s closest competitor, Pfizer, to catch up.', 'Pfizer is currently running a Phase 3 trial for a similar type of Duchenne gene therapy. Unlike Sarepta, Pfizer decided not to seek a speedy approval before getting the results, arguing the late-stage study would bring clearer answers.', 'Pfizer previously told investors to expect an early look at that study by the end of 2023. But in December, it switched up its plan, deciding instead to wait until the final results are ready in 2024.', 'Pfizer appears to believe it has a better chance to top Sarepta by letting the study run its course, hoping a larger and longer sample size might yield a clear treatment benefit. In a December conference call, CEO Albert Bourla said delaying the readout will give “more opportunity [for] the product to be successful.”', 'If it is, Pfizer would rebound from an earlier setback.

Moderna, too, is reeling, with shares dropping 50% in 2023 and revenue projections dialed down.', ""One area the developers have circled is influenza, arguing the speed and adaptability of mRNA technology can be used to quickly match a new year’s prominent strains. Current flu shots are only about 40% to 60% effective, so there’s room for improvement. But though Pfizer and Moderna succeeded in late-stage trials, some analysts have criticized the results and questioned the shots' sales prospects."", 'Some Wall Street analysts think the two rivals could have better luck with combination vaccines designed to protect against the flu as well as COVID-19. A two-pronged vaccine could make fall immunizations more convenient and spur uptake, which “we see as a more reasonable commercial argument,” wrote Leerink Partners analyst Mani Foroohar, in October.', 'Moderna and Pfizer both reported promising results in early testing last fall and have moved on to late-stage studies.', 'Moderna appears positioned to get to the finish line first.

Notably, the campaign brings together its portfolio of brands within a single spot for the first time."", '""When we talk portfolio, it is usually more of a register- and sales-driving move. That\'s obviously how people see us at the shelf. But [Coca-Cola Chief of Marketing Shakir Moin] is always pushing us to try to give consumers goosebumps,"" said Alex Ames, director of content and creative excellence at Coca-Cola North America. ""We\'re really looking to tell the story of that perfectly imperfect family, similar to the perfect family of products that we have at Coca-Cola, and once we started unpacking that, that is where the magic happened.""', 'The campaign developed out of conversations with partners at Majority, a diversity-focused creative agency that is part of Coca-Cola\'s OpenX arrangement with global marketing partner WPP (the holding company acquired a 30% stake in Majority last year). The central idea flowed from taking Coca-Cola\'s standing as a sponsor for major properties like the Olympics and the World Cup and bringing it into the home, making the brand the ""proud sponsor"" of moments that matter most.', 'The result is ""New Guy,"" a spot directed by Christopher Storer, creator and showrunner for Hulu’s hit series ""The Bear,"" who has made capturing the chaos of perfectly imperfect families his stock in trade. The ad, in 30- and 90-second versions, recalls ""Fishes,"" a second-season episode of the show that focused on an intense Christmas dinner — perhaps unusual inspiration for an ad from the beverage giant.', 'Majority presented an idea that was part ""The Bear"" and part Homer\'s “Odyssey,”\xa0and through some serendipity, Coca-Cola was able to work with half of that formulation through production partner Smuggler, Ames explained.', '""Homer died over 2000 years ago, so to be able to work with the other inspiration in Chris Storer was just an incredible stroke of luck,"" he said.', '""New Guy"" captures the experience of bringing home a new paramour for the first time. The spot captures the chaos of a family gathering at the holidays,\xa0with food in the oven, kids under foot and sports on TV. The ""new guy"" meets a handful of family members — all of whom mistakenly assumed he would be short — on his way to securing a firm handshake with the family\'s patriarch.', ""In pre-production, one of Coca-Cola's few notes was that the brand's products would be a central part of the cast, and they are organically woven into the narrative, including drinking Sprite to cool down after a bite straight from the oven,\xa0Honest juice boxes for the kids and the weird relative and a Coke Zero Sugar brandished during a sports argument."", '""A lot of brands out there in the world couldn\'t do a story like this, but we\'re lucky where we have these brands that are all so well-defined with their place in the portfolio,"" Ames noted.', 'To create an ad focused on family and a family of products, Storer used as much of the family-like cast and crew from ""The Bear"" as possible. In kind, Ames describes the client-agency side of video village as a family affair, with many relationships across the divide dating back years.', '""It was just this unbelievable family feel, and with family comes trust. We got the script and we got what was boarded, but there was trust that comes with family, and bringing new people into your family, just like the spot,"" Ames explained. ""It gave the freedom of letting Chris Storer do what Chris Storer does so well.""', 'Apart from the TV spot production, the campaign is backed by almost 40,000 individual pieces of creative that will run across programmatic, out-of-home, display and beyond. The assets align consumer insights around product, messages and imagery to let the marketer mix-and-match to find the best incremental opportunities.', 'Despite the high volume of creative assets, the work was primarily done by humans — not generative artificial intelligence, even though Coca-Cola has quickly become a leader in applying the tech in advertising. Instead of AI driving creative ideation or asset creation, Ames says the technology can help automate some of the insight generation on the back end. Plus, the wealth of creative can now be used to help train AI to do more in the future, especially around how the ad is served.', '""There are some things that we\'re not necessarily, as an industry, comfortable with giving AI complete carte blanche,"" Ames said.

In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.', ' See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Consolidated ', 'The formula for return on equity is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Coca-Cola Consolidated is:', '30% = US$451m ÷ US$1.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.30 in profit."", 'Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don\'t have the same features.', ""First thing first, we like that Coca-Cola Consolidated has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 16% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. So, the substantial 54% net income growth seen by Coca-Cola Consolidated over the past five years isn't overly surprising."", ""As a next step, we compared Coca-Cola Consolidated's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 4.4%."", ""Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation.

These 3 valuation measures might help you decide."", ""Coca-Cola Consolidated's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 3.8%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 96% of its profits. So it looks like Coca-Cola Consolidated is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth."", 'Additionally, Coca-Cola Consolidated has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders.', ""On the whole, we feel that Coca-Cola Consolidated's performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. If the company continues to grow its earnings the way it has, that could have a positive impact on its share price given how earnings per share influence long-term share prices. Not to forget, share price outcomes are also dependent on the potential risks a company may face. So it is important for investors to be aware of the risks involved in the business.

This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well.

Their average dividend yield is 4.1%, and they are attractive stocks to buy. However, they are value stocks for a reason, and it makes sense to explore that reason before buying in."", 'Yielding 4.1%, UPS is coming off of a difficult 2023. Delivery volumes have failed to meet expectations due to a weakening economy and protracted labor negotiations, leading customers to divert traffic to other networks. As a result, UPS will miss the earnings expectations management laid out at the start of the year.', ""It's been a disappointing year, and as FedEx's recent commentary attests, it's still a weak environment, so don't be surprised if there's more pressure on delivery volumes in the first half of 2024."", 'That said, there are three reasons UPS can make a big comeback in 2024. First, management continues to make significant progress in its aims of expanding its small and medium-sized business and healthcare markets, as it focuses on improving the profitability of its deliveries rather than chasing volume growth.', 'Second, UPS is already winning back delivery volumes lost due to the Teamster negotiations. For example, the average daily volume was down 15.2% in August on a year-over-year basis at the high point of friction, but as UPS started to win back volumes, it was only down 7.4% in the last week of September. Third, lower interest rates in 2024 will take the brakes off of the economy, and delivery volumes should pick up accordingly.', 'Finally, UPS continues investing in smart facilities and automation that help reduce cost per piece by, for example, improving misload rates and scanning packages upon pickup.', 'It will take time for UPS to recover, and it faces some near-term risk. But it trades at 16 times trailing earnings, and investors will earn a 4.1% yield while they wait for improving earnings in the second half of 2024.', 'The building products company Johnson Controls is attractive. Its heating, ventilation, air conditioning, fire and security products, digital platforms, and building control solutions help building owners reduce emissions and operate buildings more efficiently to meet their net-zero targets. On its investor day in 2021, management outlined that it had a $250 billion incremental market opportunity ahead of it over the next decade.', ""Indeed, Johnson Controls is growing. It's just not growing as much as management expected. The stock price is down 29% since the start of 2022 after the company missed its initial 2022 earnings per share (EPS) guidance of $3.22-$3.32 in reporting $3 in 2022."", ""Fast-forward to its fiscal 2023, and management's initial guidance was for organic revenue growth of high single digits to low double digits and EPS of $3.20-$3.60. Management delivered on the earnings ($3.50) but organic revenue growth of just 8% (and just 2% in the fourth quarter ) is disappointing."", ""On balance, I think giving management the benefit of the doubt makes sense. The reason behind the sluggish sales comes down to dealers running down inventory built up previously when it was harder to obtain products due to the supply chain crisis. It's not the only company reporting such conditions. In addition, its orders and backlog remain in growth mode."", ""Johnson Controls trades at less than 16 times Wall Street's estimated forward earnings and yields 2.6%."", ""Disappointing trading in Europe and Asia and interest rates pressuring its core North American market have created a problematic 2023 for Whirlpool. When management released its third-quarter earnings in late October, investors didn't take too kindly to it lowering its full-year adjusted EPS guidance to the low end of its previous range of $16-$18."", ""It's never good news when companies cut full-year guidance on their third-quarter earnings calls because it implies deteriorating earnings momentum in the fourth quarter. Moreover, companies with cyclical exposure to the economy, such as FedEx, and others with exposure to consumer discretionary spending, like Nike, have disappointed investors with their growth outlooks."", ""That said, there's little Whirlpool can do about rising interest rates choking off demand, and the headwinds it's currently facing could turn into tailwinds if rates come down in 2024. In addition, management is on track for $800 million in cost-cutting actions. It is also set to position its Europe, Middle East, and Africa business into a new business with Arcelik's European business and create a new stand-alone company with Whirlpool owning a 25% share. The deal will see Whirlpool exit a region where it's found it tough to generate an adequate profit margin."", 'With the turnaround strategy in place and the prospects of lower interest rates, Whirlpool and its 5.8% dividend yield will suit enterprising investors.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in United Parcel Service right now?', 'Before you buy stock in United Parcel Service, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and United Parcel Service wasn't one of them.

Operating margins were $298 million, and earnings per share of $1.44. Though full-year earnings guidance was scaled back slightly due to severe storms, analysts still rate DTE as a Strong Buy, with an upside potential of around 13% from current levels.', 'On the other hand, DTE’s energy efficiency programs helped customers save over $400 million on bills, underscoring the company’s customer focus.

All of its top 20 tenants fall into at least one of the following categories: Non-discretionary, low price point, service-oriented, or non-retail. That makes them far more resilient than something like high-end luxury retailers, which may see a downturn in sales amid a recession.', ""As a result, Realty Income's occupancy rate remains consistently high. It managed to fill 98.8% of its units in the third quarter. Its long-term leases also ensure it'll maintain that high occupancy rate. The average lease still has about 10 years left."", ""The downside of Realty Income's strategy is that it means growth is slow and steady. Rents increase just a percentage point or two per year. As such, its main form of growth is through acquisitions. Its most recent one, Spirit Realty, will cost more than $9 billion, but add 2,000 new properties with a similar tenant profile to Realty Income's existing clients."", ""Management expects that Spirit Realty acquisition to help it grow adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) by 4% to 5% next year. That puts its share price around 13.7 times next year's AFFO outlook. That's a more than fair price to pay for a company with consistently growing profits and free cash flow, and with the dividend track record of Realty Income."", 'SL Green is also a REIT and it is the largest owner of office space in Manhattan. It has interest in 59 different buildings totaling 32.5 million square feet of space.', 'That was a great position to be in pre-pandemic. But the rise of remote work amid the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent hike in interest rates all worked against SL Green over the last few years. Occupancy rates fell from 96% at the end of 2019 to below 90% by mid-year 2023.', ""Management worked to reposition itself over the last few years. It sold off several non-core properties, refocusing on increasing tenancy. It's had to accept lower rates, but those rates remain profitable. It's finally starting to see the fruits of its labor, as occupancy rates crept up by a tenth of a percentage point in the third quarter."", ""Unfortunately, those moves haven't been enough to spare SL Green's dividend. Management cut the dividend for the second year in a row in December. It now pays an annual dividend of $3, $0.25 per month."", 'The good news for investors is that the worst is likely over for the company. As mentioned, occupancy rates are starting to improve. Asset sales are helping shore up cash and pay down debt, including the recent sale of 625 Madison Avenue. And expected interest rate cuts in 2024 should help lower its cost of debt and improve its acquisition potential.', 'Management guided for 2024 funds from operations between $4.90 and $5.20 per share. The shares trade for around 9 times that amount, which is a big jump in valuation from where it was just a few months ago.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW), by way of a worked example."", ""Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams ', 'The formula for ROE is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Sherwin-Williams is:', '64% = US$2.4b ÷ US$3.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.64 in profit."", 'One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Sherwin-Williams has a higher ROE than the average (13%) in the Chemicals industry.', ""That's clearly a positive. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk."", 'Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.', ""Sherwin-Williams does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 2.63. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it."", ""Return on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE."", ""Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company."", 'Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.
