This is also why now may be a good time to check the current prospects of some of these inflationary winners. Cal-Maine &amp; Egg Prices  The cost per dozen of eggs has fallen sharply from a peak of $4.82 in early January to around $2 at the moment. Correlating with such, Cal-Maine’s stock has dropped near 52-week lows at $46 a share and 29% from its 52-week high of $65.32 last December.FREDImage Source: FREDHowever, as the largest producer and distributer of fresh shell eggs in the United States Cal-Maine's stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). There could still be better buying opportunities but Cal-Maine’s ability to stack cash over the last year during high probability is promising. To that point, the company’s sustainability and market dominance should continue with Cal-Maine's cash &amp; equivalents soaring to $648 million at the end of its fiscal 2023 compared to $175 million in 2022.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLamb Weston &amp; Potato PricesAfter falling sharply from multi-year highs of $288 last August, the price index for potatoes had begun to ascend again this year before recently cooling off to around $192. With Lamb Weston being the largest potato producer in North America, its stock has mirrored the commodity price soaring +60% over the last two years and up roughly +5% for the year.FREDImage Source: FREDStill, Lamb Weston’s stock is 19% from its 52-week high of $116 a share in July and the recent dip is starting to look like a buying opportunity. Notably, Lamb Weston’s earnings are forecasted to jump 12% in its current fiscal 2024 and rise another 9% in FY25 to $5.76 per share. More importantly, FY24 and FY25 earnings estimates are modestly higher over the last 60 days which largely attributes to Lamb Weston’s stock sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at the moment.  Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNucor &amp; Steel PricesSteel prices had started to rise at the beginning of the year before falling of late with the price per sheet of cold-rolled steel at $389 and well-off multi-year highs of over $700 at the end of 2021. Investing in leading steel producer Nucor has been very lucrative but it may be time to take some profits with NUE shares landing a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).FREDImage Source: FREDNucor's stock has soared +59% over the last two years and is up +19% YTD but earnings estimate revisions have started to decline again over the last 30 days. Many steel producers are expected to see their bottom lines contract after stellar profits over the last few years but one company seeing positive EPS revisions for the year ahead is Commercial Metals CMC which could be a better alternative for investors right now.Commercial Metals’ stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and looks poised for a rally with its price performance being virtually flat this year and rising earnings estimates for FY24 offering support to its attractive 7.2X forward earnings multiple.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineA high inflationary environment looks here to stay which makes monitoring commodity prices and stocks that can benefit accordingly very important to investors.

ARE has received an affirmation on its credit ratings, including its issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings, of Baa1 from Moody's Investors Service. The rating agency maintained its outlook rating at stable. Shares of ARE witnessed a marginal gain in the Oct 5 trading session on the NYSE.Recently, S&amp;P Global Ratings reaffirmed the company’s strong credit rating of BBB+ with a positive outlook.The reiteration of Alexandria’s credit ratings is a testament to its consistently solid operating and financial performance. The company boasted a significant liquidity of $6.3 billion as of Jun 30, 2023. Importantly, it has no debt maturities before 2025 and its weighted-average remaining term was 13.4 years as of the end of the second quarter of 2023. ARE’s solid balance sheet position and ample financial flexibility poise it well to bank on long-term growth opportunities.Per Marc E. Binda, chief financial officer and treasurer of Alexandria, “We are very proud of our best-in-class team's disciplined and strategic efforts to build and enhance a fortress balance sheet that provides us flexibility to execute on our unique business model and enable our tenants' tireless work to advance innovation to improve human health.”Alexandria owns Class A/A+ properties in North America's AAA innovation cluster locations, with significant market presence in Greater Boston, San Francisco Bay Area, New York City, San Diego, Seattle, Maryland and the Research Triangle. Its position as a preeminent player in the life science real estate industry, coupled with the strategic positioning of its properties in the key life science markets across the United States, enables it to enjoy robust scale.  Amid the booming demand for life-science assets, the advantageous locations of its properties are resulting in high occupancy levels. In the six months ended Jun 30, 2023, Alexandria’s total leasing activity aggregated 2.5 million RSF of space, of which 82% was generated from existing tenants. Lease renewals and re-leasing of space amounted to nearly 2.2 million RSF. As of Jun 30, 2023, the occupancy of Alexandria’s operating properties in North America remained high at 93.6%.The company has a well-diversified and high-quality tenant base ranging from multinational pharmaceutical, public and private biotechnology companies, manufacturers of complex medicines and top-tier investment-grade companies and institutions as well as technology entities. This assures stable rental revenues for the company over the long term.Moreover, ARE is making concerted efforts to acquire, develop and redevelop new Class A/A+ properties in AAA locations to enhance its operating platform. It recently announced that it has expedited the delivery of 325 Binney Street, a 462,100 rentable square feet (RSF) Class A+ property presently under construction, to Moderna MRNA.Strategically located on the Alexandria Center® at One Kendall Square mega campus in Cambridge, Moderna’s new global headquarters and core R&amp;D operations center is expected to be handed over in November 2023.Alexandria is likely to deliver the mission-critical development project under budget. This will contribute significantly to its incremental annual net operating income beginning from the fourth quarter of 2023, which is encouraging.However, persistent macroeconomic uncertainty and high interest rates pose near-term concerns. ARE may find it challenging to purchase or develop real estate with borrowed funds as the costs are likely to be on the higher side. Moreover, with high interest rates in place, the dividend payout might seem less attractive than the yields on fixed-income and money-market accounts.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 16.3% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 11.8%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the real estate investment trust sector are Welltower WELL and Americold Realty Trust COLD, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, the company is refusing to pay the ransom to the hackers, despite recommendations from the FBI.Shares of e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) have received an upgrade from Jefferies from ""Hold"" to ""Buy"", as the price target becomes $115 a share.Yahoo Finance Anchors Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton break down all the details of these top tickers.

Resorts offering an update on the impact of the cyberattack experienced last month. The company expecting the data breach to cost its business more than $100 million. However, MGM noting it believes the incident will have minimal impact in the fourth quarter, and operational results for the year.So this one-- and interesting, Julie. The Journal reporting that MGM refused to pay the hacker's ransom, which is what the FBI apparently advises. But the price tag, as we know, the $100 million from the third quarter.But you saw investors move in there. The stock popped. And I think it's because investors who covered the names say they don't think that attack is going to have a big impact moving forward.JULIE HYMAN: Right. Exactly. And the stock has already been selling off as of late. So the bounce then-- when the worst fears perhaps were not realized here, if you look at some of the analysts commentary.Truist saying that limited net financial impact from the cyberattack, that that is not-- that that was indeed a relief there. Also, some analysts talking about looking into the fourth quarter, as you said, the future. We're not going to see necessarily an impact from that. So-- yeah, exactly.Let's talk about e.l.f. Beauty as well. ELF shares popping after an upgrade from Jefferies. The firm raising its price target on the company, upgrading the stock to buy from hold. Jefferies saying, the cosmetic company's underlying demand remains robust here. And that the stock has pulled back lately.Story continuesSo that made its valuation look attractive here. It's been expanding internationally. The stock, as you remarked earlier, has already been on a tear this year.JOSH LIPTON: So Jefferies likes it, because listen, they see an opportunity after a pullback. They like the international expansion. Price target now for Jefferies is $115.But yeah. Investors, by the way, have already piled into this name year-to-date. This thing is up more than 80% already.JULIE HYMAN: Wow. And look at that one-year chart. 158%.There has been this conventional wisdom and narrative, that makeup would perform better in a downturn. That has proven true, to some extent. And a lot of the earnings reports that we've gotten that-- it's the little luxuries that people will hold--JOSH LIPTON: It's the thing you don't want to give up.JULIE HYMAN: Yes, exactly. So we'll see if that-- if indeed-- two ifs. If indeed the economy can-- does worsen, will we then-- if that happens, will we see this trend continue?JOSH LIPTON: All right. We shall see.]"

Better pricing, prudent underwriting, increased exposure, faster economic recovery on the receding impact of the pandemic and increased vaccinations should benefit MetLife Inc. MET, American International Group Inc. AIG, The Hartford Financial Services Group HIG, Everest Group, Ltd. EG and MGIC Investment Corporation MTG. Accelerated digitalization will help in the smooth functioning of the industry.The solid capital level of the multiline insurers will fuel merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activities. With four rate hikes this year already, investment income should improve further as insurers are beneficiaries of a better rate environment.About the IndustryThe Zacks Multiline Insurance industry comprises companies that provide single insurance coverage, bundling automobile, homeowner, long-term care, and life and health insurance to individuals and businesses. The insured pays a single premium and is covered for many things through a single contract. These companies cover commercial and personal properties, automobiles, marine, livestock, aviation, personal accident, life, including permanent and term insurance, supplemental accident and health insurance, workers’ compensation, annuity products, private mortgage insurance, et al. The players also provide risk management services. Since the companies offer single insurance coverage for multiple products, customer retention improves. The insured stands to benefit from lower premium payment compared to paying individual premiums for insuring varied products.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Multiline Insurance IndustryDiversified portfolio lowers concentration risk:  Given the nature of the business, multiline insurers’ product and service portfolios are diversified. This lowers concentration risk. Increased awareness, driving higher demand for protection products, should benefit sales and premiums of life insurance operations. Continued improvement in pricing and an increase in exposure should support premium growth. Also, per Deloitte Insights, the transition to green energy and related insurance products, as well as exposure to intangible assets, offers growth opportunities. Per Deloitte Insights, life insurance premium is estimated to increase 1.9% in 2023 while non-life premiums are expected to increase 2.2%. The report also stated that trends like commercial lines witnessing growth faster than personal lines and homeowners’ premiums improving at a better rate than personal auto are likely to continue in 2023. However, underwriting losses are expected to persist, driven by challenging results in personal lines.Merger and acquisitions:  Consolidation in the multi-line insurance industry is expected to continue as players look to diversify their operations into new business lines and geographies. Buying businesses along the same lines is driven by the players’ need to gain a fair market share and grow in their niche areas. However, with high inflation and a rise in interest rates (the Fed has already made one rate hike this year), momentum in the M&amp;A environment is likely to slow down.  Increased adoption of technology: Digitalization has increased by leaps and bounds, especially amid pandemic-induced restrictions. The industry is witnessing greater use of technology like blockchain, AI, advanced analytics, telematics, cloud computing and robotic process automation to expedite business operations and save costs.  Many life insurers have started selling policies online that appeal to the tech-savvy population. At the same time, the use of real-time data is making premium calculation easier and reducing risk. The P&amp;C industry, in particular, also witnessed the emergence of insurtech — technology-led insurers — sparking competition for incumbent players. Insurers remain focused on ramping up data and analytics capabilities as well as realizing the benefit of the technological infrastructure per Deloitte Insights. Moreover, the adoption of technology has helped in seamless underwriting and claims processing. However, the adoption of technology comes with the risk of cyber threats.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Weak ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dismal prospects in the near term. The Zacks Multiline Insurance industry, housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #165, which places it in the bottom 34% of 255 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is the result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. The bleak outlook reflects that the industry’s earnings estimates have been revised downward by analysts for the current year.  Earnings estimates for the current year have moved 6.3% south in the past year.Before we present a few multiline insurance stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Underperforms Sector and S&amp;P 500The Multiline Insurance industry has underperformed both the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and its sector over the past six months. The stocks in this industry have collectively gained 6.3% in the past year compared with the Finance sector’s increase of 9% and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite rise of 17.7% in the same time frame.            One-Year Price PerformanceCurrent ValuationOn the basis of its trailing 12-month price-to-book (P/B), which is commonly used for valuing insurance stocks, the industry is currently trading at 2.32X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 5.57X and the sector’s 3.03X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 2.74X, as low as 0.69X and at the median of 1.46X.Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio (TTM)Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio (TTM)5 Multiline Insurance Stocks to Keep an Eye onWe are presenting five Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock from the Multiline Insurance industry.   You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Most of the motor fuels that come from Valero’s Corpus Christi refinery come from the West Plant, which plant processes both sweet crude and sour crude, as well as residual fuel oil, according to Valero’s website.The East and West refineries produce gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, asphalt, and aromatics.Distillate inventories in the United States have long languished well below what is typical for this time of year. At last EIA count, distillate inventories in the United States were 13% below the five-year average.News of the shutdown comes as Russia, the world’s top seaborne diesel exporter, lifted its ban on pipeline diesel imports after just a week. The ban lifted the price of crude oil most suitable for making diesel and jet fuel, sending prices for this feedstock upward.Valero’s West plant receives some of its feedstock by tanker or barge via deepwater docking facilities along the Corpus Christi Ship Channel, while West Texas or South Texas crude oil comes into the refinery via pipeline, Valero’s website explains.The West plant was commissioned in 1983, then known as the Bill Greehey refinery.

(NYSE:O) is one of the world's largest public REITs, but you may not have heard of it because of the sector it operates in. Realty Income holds one type of asset: properties with net leases. After steadily building a portfolio worth over $40 billion in U.S. assets, Realty Income is taking its show on the road to Europe.The move into Europe began in 2019 when Realty Income acquired a large tranch of grocery stores in England. Now the REIT is looking to Europe for even more opportunities. The reason for the move is twofold: First, a REIT the size of Realty Income, which has 13,000 assets, can't buy one or two properties at a time and see a noticeable increase in investor return. Second, in addition to having an abundance of available assets, the European commercial market is not dominated by net leasing.What this means for Realty Income is that there is tremendous profit potential in acquiring European assets and converting them to net leases. The profit potential is even higher because of the lack of competition for assets in comparison to the U.S., where multiple net-lease REITs are always looking for new acquisitions. Here is why investors should pay attention to this move.Don't Miss:This REIT just teamed up with the company that built Elon Musk's tiny house to develop affordable housing communities. Here's how you can be among the first to buy shares.Warren Buffett once said, ""If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die."" Here's how to collect $1,000 per month from Buffett's favorite dividend stock.Net Leases Are Ideal Arrangements For Investors And Property OwnersIn a net lease, the tenants of a property — usually commercial — pay rent for their space, along with a prorated portion of the owner's operating expenses. Net leases have numerous potential configurations that range from tenants being responsible for a prorated portion of the owner's insurance, property taxes or maintenance costs. Each of the expenses paid by the tenant results in that cost being net profit for the property owner.Story continuesThe amount of the net contribution made by a tenant in a net lease is usually determined by the size of the space it is renting in relation to the entire property. The larger a space is, the bigger share a tenant will pay for whatever net expense is laid out in the lease. In a single net (N) lease, the tenant may pay one expense, which will be specified in the lease contract. Most large commercial spaces operate on what is known as a triple-net lease.In a triple-net lease (NNN), the tenant is responsible for paying a prorated share of all the insurance, property taxes and maintenance along with its rent. Needless to say, contracts like this are favorable to the property owner and investors. A property that doesn't have to make deductions for property tax, maintenance and insurance will almost always have a higher net operating income (NOI) than a property with a tenant on a standard lease.Why Is NOI So Important For Commercial Property Investors?NOI is a key metric for property investors because the value of a commercial property is heavily determined by its NOI. This is a direct contrast to a property on a standard lease, whose value is based mainly on what similar properties are selling for at a given moment in time. Additionally, NNN leases tend to have longer terms and fixed rent increases designed to phase in throughout the term.Both of those factors make NNN properties recession-resistant in comparison to other assets. Even in a down market where real estate values might be expected to take a hit, a commercial asset with strong NNN tenants is much more likely to retain, if not increase, its market value. That's all because those net leases are pumping out reliable returns for investors. These reliable returns are what determine the value of the asset.Net REIT Earnings Offer Hedge Against InflationThe same factors that make net lease properties resistant to market forces also make them great hedges against inflation. The built-in rent increases in many net leases are usually tied to a benchmark, such as the standard overnight finance rate (SOFR) or consumer price index (CPI).If these benchmark rates increase during periods of high inflation, net lease investors have increased protection because the collected rents will go right along with the benchmark. Another benefit is that the steadily increasing nature of the NOI, thanks to the rent increases, means that the assets are appreciating as well.Another tremendous advantage of net REITs like Realty Income is that they can raise capital to acquire assets without having to borrow money — or as much money — as other REITs. When you consider that current interest rates are in the 7% range, the potential benefit of raising capital without borrowing speaks for itself.You Can Invest In Net REITs Or Other Passive Income OpportunitiesRealty Income has been quietly delivering reliable returns for its investors for nearly three decades. It's delivered an increased dividend for 29 years through a slow, steady growth approach. It will move into Europe with caution and, more importantly, with a long-term growth plan. This will not necessarily be an asset spree where they go on a binge and buy commercial assets all over Europe.There is a lot to learn from this approach when it comes to passive income and generating long-term wealth, but you don't have to be a heavy hitter to do it. Shares of Realty Income are trading around $50, and you have a full menu of other publicly traded REITs in a variety of sectors to choose from. You can also build your portfolio through real estate crowdfunding platforms. Considering the strong history of returns associated with real estate investing, it's a sector worth a long look from investors.

This change outpaced the S&amp;P 500's 1.18% gain on the day.

In that same time, the Finance sector lost 4.4%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 5.17%.Market participants will be closely following the financial results of Morgan Stanley in its upcoming release. The company plans to announce its earnings on October 18, 2023. On that day, Morgan Stanley is projected to report earnings of $1.35 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 11.76%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $13.28 billion, up 2.24% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $5.74 per share and revenue of $54.55 billion.

Given the challenging operating backdrop for IBs, both have been struggling to improve profitability since last year.This can also be seen from bearish investor sentiment toward the MS and GS stocks. Since the beginning of 2022, shares of Morgan Stanley and Goldman have lost 19.4% and 18.9%, respectively. Price PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHeadwinds, including persistently high inflation, global aggressive monetary policy tightening, expectations of economic slowdown and geopolitical tensions, have resulted in a total crash of underwriting and advisory businesses. Though this year has been slightly better, things are far from normal.Amid such a tough operating environment, let’s check which company – Morgan Stanley or Goldman – is better poised to counter this. Currently, both companies carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see tthe complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Starting with the first half of 2023 financial performance, Morgan Stanley posted a 16% decline in net income, while the metric plunged 37% for Goldman. On the revenue front, Morgan Stanley’s top-line growth remained stable, while GS recorded a 7% fall in the same.Now digging a bit deeper into revenue details, we see that Morgan Stanley’s Institutional Services business, which houses investment banking, witnessed a 10% decrease in net revenues in the first six months of 2023. The business accounts for 45% of the company’s net revenues.For GS, its Global Banking and Markets business’ (accounting for almost 68% of firm’s total net revenues) total net revenues were down 15%.Hence, we see that MS is less dependent on investment banking than Goldman. Notably, investment banking is not the primary revenue contributor for MS. The company’s Wealth Management business consisted of 47% of total net revenues in the first half of the year.Therefore, Morgan Stanley has much more diversified revenue sources than GS. Wealth Management provides MS with a good balance when investment banking is subdued.On the other hand, Goldman is currently in the middle of a business streamlining process. The company is refocusing on its core strengths of investment banking and trading while reducing its retail footprint. In sync with this, it announced the divestiture of its Personal Financial Management unit (expected to close by the end of this quarter) in August and is looking for bidders for GreenSky (its consumer lending platform). These efforts are expected to result in some one-time charges in the near term, thereby hampering growth.So, which stock is worth keeping an eye on?Presently, one can keep Morgan Stanley on their radar as it has a more balanced revenue mix, with a focus on both investment banking and wealth management businesses. This will help the company sustain profitability. With green shoots visible in investment banking and markets projecting further improvement next year, MS stands to gain from diversified revenues.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Salesforce (CRM) and Adobe (ADBE) stocks have seen declines of more than 8% over the past month and even the biggest software names such as Microsoft (MSFT) aren't immune.Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne recently published a note, offering some advice to investors.""Embrace the suck, but only if you can take a 6-9 month view,"" he wrote on Oct. 4. ""While every pullback in software is unique given that the industry is still maturing and every company is at a different point on the maturity curve, the common thread across nearly every [second half of the year] pullback over the last 10 years is that software outperforms the S&amp;P 500 off the bottom.""This pullback in software stocks goes back to macroeconomic uncertainty as the economy adjusts to higher interest rates and a shifting post-pandemic landscape. Software stocks have gone through these sorts of withdrawals in the back half of the year before.""We believe this pullback is similar to other ... pullbacks in that investors are taking profits in the face of macro uncertainty — sensible — and we won’t have a great read on [information technology] spending budgets for another 30-60 days,"" Materne wrote.To be clear, this is far from the worst tech sell-off, and there's still overarching positive data.The Nasdaq remains up about 27% year to date and its long-term upward trajectory is clear. Over the last five years, the Nasdaq has gone up approximately 76%.Software companies to watchTo Materne's point, if software stocks leap off the bottom, who's set to win?Look at the large-cap names, according to Materne, including Microsoft, Adobe, Intuit (INTU), and Palo Alto Networks (PANW). He also identified a select group of growth names as possible winners, calling out Snowflake (SNOW), CrowdStrike (CRWD), and HubSpot (HUBS).Story continuesFor many of these names, Wall Street agrees there's room to run.Take Adobe, for example. CFRA analyst Angelo Zino, who has a Buy rating on the stock, suggests that Adobe shares have upside, especially given the company's potential to leverage AI.""Our Buy recommendation reflects our view of potential AI monetization opportunities, dominant position in select content creation apps with formidable competitive advantages, and cross-selling prospects,"" Zino wrote on Sept. 30.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella delivers the keynote address at the company's annual conference for software developers on Monday, May 6, 2019, in Seattle. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Next, consider Intuit, which just held its annual investor day on Sept. 28. AI came up again.""In our view, the analyst day provided a good incremental update on Intuit’s platform and AI strategy,"" William Blair's Matthew Pfau wrote on Sept. 29. ""We believe the company is positioning itself well to continue to grow the top line in the low- to mid-teens while providing margin expansion.""What would these companies be excited about if it weren't AI? It's hard to know.But AI or not, this is a movie investors have seen before, and it's a reminder that investing in software isn't for the faint of heart.

Yahoo Finance Tech Reporter Allie Garfinkle references Evercore's Kirk Materne analyst note — and the lyrical stylings of Olivia Rodrigo — as to how investors should be looking at the software space.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: Well, we're talking about a software slump now, with software stocks feeling some pressure on hawkish Fed fears and macroeconomic pressure in the last month. But is now the time to buy? Yahoo Finance's Allie Garfinkle has the details for us. Allie.ALLIE GARFINKLE: Akiko, for software stocks right now, as Olivia Rodrigo would say, it's brutal out there. And while it sounds like I'm being facetious, September was actually the worst month for tech stock since May. And going into this month, that slide has continued. We're still-- you know, and right now, it's software, of course, in the crosshairs, right? Salesforce, Adobe, both down more than 8% over the last four weeks. And it really comes down to macro pressure. Yes, it's high interest rates.There's also really limited visibility, end of the year, as to where clients are going to be spending and how comfortable they're going to be doing that spending. That said, I think it's important to say we've seen this movie before. There's history here.Over the last 12 years, the software space has had a number of pullbacks, especially in the second half of the year. And then those stocks will leap off the bottom. To this end, Evercore analyst-- Evercore analyst Kirk Materne had some advice for investors. It's a very Olivia Rodrigo-esque take. What he writes is, ""Embrace the suck, but only if you can take a six- to nine-month view.""AKIKO FUJITA: Allie, this might be your first, I think-- software and Olivia Rodrigo. I did not make the connection. But let's talk about those investors who are looking into this space. You know, what companies are analysts calling out as having upside?Story continuesALLIE GARFINKLE: Olivia Rodrigo's side? Look at the large caps here, Akiko. Look at Adobe. Look at Intuit. And yes, Microsoft is in that bag, but Microsoft is perhaps the most obvious of them. If you think about Adobe, think about AI. They're rolling out AI features left and right into it. Same deal, investor day, generative AI was really featured. That's what-- that's what we're expecting to see help kind of lift these companies off the bottom.That's certainly the story, at the very least, that they're selling-- that they're selling to Wall Street. And I should say also, Wall Street is optimistic about a few smaller caps. Snowflake, CrowdStrike, HubSpot are in that category. That said, if you're an investor saying yes right now to software, if you're really ready to invest, remember, you're going to be embracing the suck.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, that'll certainly be a line to leave us with as we go into the weekend. Appreciate you, as always, our very own Allie Garfinkle.]"
45,7636f3c0-df65-3fb6-9e32-0632a4c57476,RL,2023-10-07,Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL) shareholders have earned a 18% CAGR over the last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ralph-lauren-nyse-rl-shareholders-122144958.html,1696681304,STORY,['RL'],"[One simple way to benefit from the stock market is to buy an index fund. But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. For example, Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL) shareholders have seen the share price rise 54% over three years, well in excess of the market return (15%, not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 29% , including dividends .Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. View our latest analysis for Ralph Lauren To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During three years of share price growth, Ralph Lauren achieved compound earnings per share growth of 63% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 15% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth, somewhat.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how Ralph Lauren has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Ralph Lauren, it has a TSR of 64% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Ralph Lauren shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 29% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 0.8% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Ralph Lauren better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - Ralph Lauren has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.Of course Ralph Lauren may not be the best stock to buy.

RomanShortly after joining fashion-meets-philanthropy jewelry brand Kendra Scott as a director in 2015, Tom Nolan saw the company become a unicorn, commanding a $1 billion valuation in a private equity funding round. Eight years later, he’s at the helm as CEO with eyes to reach even greater heights, stewarding the company’s mission of reaching customers who are vast in number but often are neglected.“This audience of constituents we focus on are being overlooked by the media,” Mr. Nolan told IPO Edge in a wide-ranging interview on subjects from style to financial performance. “Anytime I hear about luxury goods I get it, but the majority don’t live in that space.”Kendra Scott CEO Tom NolanIndeed, Mr. Nolan embraces the same values founder Kendra Scott had when she started her eponymous company in her Austin, Texas home in 2002. At the time, Ms. Scott had a vision of making customers across the income spectrum feel beautiful, having noticed a chasm between pricey luxury brands and lower-end items that were poorly made.Reflecting on his own upbringing, Mr. Nolan pointed out that he was brought up working class and was the first in his family to graduate from high school. “My life has been predicted on hard work and output,” he said. “I’ve been an underdog my whole life.”Story continuesIn turn, he’s resistant to the idea of luxury feeling intimidating or too hard on a customer’s wallet. Elite luxury brands like Hermès, he says, can make even wealthy customers feel “uncomfortable” when visiting opulent stores like the French brand’s Paris flagship.“No one wants to go into any store and feel like they overpaid for anything,” he said. “True luxury isn’t necessarily about money it’s about feeling. The right piece can have just as much meaning as a Birkin bag.”The majority of Kendra Scott’s pieces are within financial reach of its shoppers but also designed to instill a feeling of luxury. “We make people feel good. We want them to feel elevated,” Mr. Nolan said. “It works because many wind up being repeat customers.”Mr. Nolan’s journey to Kendra Scott included a role at storied media conglomerate Condé Nast, where he was Publisher of Golf World (he’s also co-owner of a golf course in Tennessee) followed by a pivot to fashion. At Ralph Lauren, he was Senior Vice President and learned under the tutelage of fashion industry legend Roger Farah, who retired as Executive Vice Chairman in 2014. He’s also on the board of Tommy John, a comfort-focused lifestyle brand along with Made In, which brings restaurant-quality cookware to at-home chefs.When Mr. Nolan arrived at Kendra Scott, the brand had a strong wholesale footprint but only about a dozen stores. It had expanded steadily but was on the cusp of truly explosive growth having secured funding from Palo Alto private equity firm Norwest Venture Partners in 2014 that valued the business at $100 million. Soon after, Kendra Scott was crowned a unicorn with another investment from Berkshire Partners valuing the business at $1 billion, making Ms. Scott one of the wealthiest self-made women in the world.Fast forward to 2021, when Mr. Nolan became CEO, and the expansion has continued apace. The company’s sales have grown a mid-teens annualized percentage, reaching more than $400 million in the fiscal year through January. The company has 2,600 employees and its store count reached 134 stores as of August, with a sales mix of roughly 50% retail, 35% e-commerce and 15% wholesale.“It’s pure omnichannel,” Mr. Nolan said, pointing out that e-commerce can get a serious bounce from the presence of a brick-and-mortar store that serves as a showroom. The same phenomenon has been observed at other fashion brands such as white-hot preppie label Rowing Blazers, whose CEO described the effect in a recent interview.Kendra Scott skews younger, with 80% of its customers in the Gen Z, Millennial and Gen X range. It also commands a powerful social media following, with influencers donning pieces in viral videos. Take Kylan Darnell, a “sorority Tok” star who posed with Kendra Scott pieces she paired with Gucci earrings.While wholesale is a minority of Kendra Scott’s sales, it has landed partnerships with some of the country’s largest retailers. Later this month, the company will launch a collaboration with Target Corp. featuring over 200 items. At the other end of the spectrum, Neiman Marcus sells dozens of Kendra Scott pieces, which are slightly more expensive but most items are a few hundred dollars or less.Those partnerships reflect Mr. Nolan’s mantra of reaching as many people as possible, regardless of income. “Our customers are everyone from police officers to CEOs to schoolteachers,” he said. “We want aspiration among all customers.”Of course, Kendra Scott does have a fine jewelry line, with some pieces $1,500 and up. “When we launched fine jewlery it was a bit of a risk,” Mr. Nolan said. “But we saw customers stretch up and also a pull down.”The brand is also dedicated to doing good through the Kendra Scott Foundation. It also offers events at local stores where community members can hold shopping events for charities, with 20% of sales going to donations.Earlier this year, the company hired advisors to seek more growth capital as it continues to expand across channels. There’s been no word on plans to go public, but as the IPO window reopens, investors are on the hunt for high-quality growth stories. With Mr. Nolan at the helm, Kendra Scott is one to watch.Contact:IPO-Edge.comEditor@IPO-Edge.comTwitter: @IPOEdgeInstagram: @IPOEdge ]"
47,61e4ac19-6e1e-3fef-8351-ec24748bbeaf,PCG,2023-10-07,4 Stocks to Buy From the Promising Electric Power Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-buy-promising-electric-140700649.html,1696601220,STORY,"['VST', 'SO', 'PNW', '^GSPC', 'PCG']","[Zacks Utility – Electric Power industry stocks have been transitioning toward clean sources of fuel and focusing on lower carbon emissions. The introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act 2022 will support the industry’s transition toward clean energy sources to produce electricity. Utilities are also focused on strengthening the grid as well as transmission and distribution infrastructure. The huge infrastructure of the utilities faces the impact of the hurricane season each year. Infrastructure enhancement around the year increases the resilience of the entire system, reduces outages and allows operators to restore power quickly for customers affected by storms.The Southern Company SO, with its expanding clean power generation portfolio and expanding customer base, renewable operations and well-chalked-out capital investments to strengthen infrastructure, offers an excellent opportunity to stay invested in the utility space. Other utilities worth adding to your portfolio are PG&amp; E Corporation PCG, Vistra Corp. VST and Pinnacle West Capital Corporation PNW.About the IndustryThe Utility – Electric Power industry involves the generation, transmission, distribution, storage and sale of electricity to customers. A substantial portion of utilities’ earnings is generated from regulated operations. Unless there is any major weather variation, demand for the services provided by utilities remains  steady, regardless of economic cycles. Per an EIA report, high temperatures during the third quarter are likely to have increased generation by 2% year over year. A clear transition is evident in this industry, with more companies declaring zero-emission goals. Research and development over the years have resulted in a substantial decline in the cost of setting up utility-scale renewable power projects, aiding in reducing emissions. However, the ongoing increase in interest rates is a concern for capital-intensive utilities.Story continues3 Electric Power Industry Trends to Watch Out ForTransition Toward Cleaner Sources to Generate Power:  The operators in the U.S. electric power sector are gradually moving toward cleaner sources of energy. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the annual share of U.S. electricity generation from renewable energy sources will rise from 22% in 2022 to 25% in 2024, as a result of the continuing addition of solar and wind-generating capacity. The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will support and accelerate the utilities’ transition toward clean energy sources. IRA has removed the uncertainties relating to federal incentives provided for renewable sources usage. The act entails an opportunity for a wide range of low-cost clean energy solutions in a predictable way for a long time and will create earnings visibility. Courtesy of IRA, the utility operators are planning to add more renewable assets to their generation portfolio and shut down old polluting units.Demand for Electricity Stable: Per EIA, electricity demand in the United States can drop 1.3% year over year in 2023 but increase 1.7% in 2024. The drop in demand in 2023 was primarily due to milder temperatures in the first half of the year. Despite the expected drop in usage, utilities will continue to benefit from the rise in residential electricity rates. EIA forecasts the average price of electricity to U.S. residential customers to increase by 4% in 2023 to 15.7 cents/kWh.Ongoing Interest Rate Increase is a Concern: Utilities, in order to maintain, upgrade and expand operations, approach capital markets for loans. The utilities have been enjoying near-zero interest rates for the past few years. But multiple rate hikes in 2022 pushed up interest rates. The Federal Reserve decided not to increase interest rate in its September meeting. The benchmark rate is high, in the 5.25-5.50% range, after a 25 bps hike in July. Fed officials are contemplating increasing rates once more in 2023. The increasing interest rates are a concern for capital-intensive utilities in the United States as these will push up capital servicing costs substantially from the current levels. Utilities might try to pass on the burden of increasing borrowing costs to customers but the necessary increase in rates might not be approved by the commission. In such a scenario, utilities will need to digest the extra expenses, which can lower their profitability and make them less attractive to investors interested in the utility space.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates strong near-term prospects. The 55-stock Utility-Electric Power industry is housed within the broader Zacks Utilities sector and currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #25, which places it in the top 10% of more than 251 Zacks industries.

OpenAI is reportedly considering a number of strategies to advance its chip ambitions, including acquiring an AI chip manufacturer or mounting an effort to design chips internally.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has made the acquisition of more AI chips a top priority for the company, Reuters reports.Currently, OpenAI, like most of its competitors, relies on GPU-based hardware to develop models such as ChatGPT, GPT-4 and DALL-E 3. GPUs’ ability to perform many computations in parallel make them well-suited to training today’s most capable AI.But the generative AI boom -- a windfall for GPU makers like Nvidia -- has massively strained the GPU supply chain. Microsoft is facing a shortage of the server hardware needed to run AI so severe that it might lead to service disruptions, the company warned in a summer earnings report. And Nvidia's best-performing AI chips are reportedly sold out until 2024.GPUs are also essential for running and serving OpenAI's models; the company relies on clusters of GPUs in the cloud to perform customers' workloads. But they come at a sky-high cost.An analysis from Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon found that if ChatGPT queries grew to a tenth the scale of Google Search, it'd require roughly $48.1 billion worth of GPUs initially and about $16 billion worth of chips a year to keep operational.OpenAI wouldn't be the first to pursue creating its own AI chips.Google has a processor, the TPU (short for ""tensor processing unit""), to train large generative AI systems like PaLM-2 and Imagen. Amazon offers proprietary chips to AWS customers both for training (Trainium) and inferencing (Inferentia). And Microsoft, reportedly, is working with AMD to develop an in-house AI chip called Athena, which OpenAI is said to be testing.Story continuesCertainly, OpenAI is in a strong position to invest heavily in R&amp;D. The company, which has raised more than $11 billion in venture capital, is nearing $1 billion in annual revenue. And it's considering a share sale that could see its secondary-market valuation soar to $90 billion, according to a recent Wall Street Journal report.But hardware is an unforgiving business -- particularly AI chips.Last year, AI chipmaker Graphcore, which allegedly had its valuation slashed by $1 billion after a deal with Microsoft fell through, said that it was planning to job cuts due to the ""extremely challenging"" macroeconomic environment. (The situation grew more dire over the past few months as Graphcore reported falling revenue and increased losses.) Meanwhile, Habana Labs, the Intel-owned AI chip company, laid off an estimated 10% of its workforce. And Meta's custom AI chip efforts have been beset with issues, leading the company to scrap some its experimental hardware. Even if OpenAI commits to bringing a custom chip to market, such an effort could take years and cost hundreds of millions of dollars annually. It remains to be seen if the startup's investors, one of which is Microsoft, have the appetite for such a risky bet.This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/06/openai-said-to-be-considering-developing-its-own-ai-chips/]"

Salesforce (CRM) and Adobe (ADBE) stocks have seen declines of more than 8% over the past month and even the biggest software names such as Microsoft (MSFT) aren't immune.Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne recently published a note, offering some advice to investors.""Embrace the suck, but only if you can take a 6-9 month view,"" he wrote on Oct. 4. ""While every pullback in software is unique given that the industry is still maturing and every company is at a different point on the maturity curve, the common thread across nearly every [second half of the year] pullback over the last 10 years is that software outperforms the S&amp;P 500 off the bottom.""This pullback in software stocks goes back to macroeconomic uncertainty as the economy adjusts to higher interest rates and a shifting post-pandemic landscape. Software stocks have gone through these sorts of withdrawals in the back half of the year before.""We believe this pullback is similar to other ... pullbacks in that investors are taking profits in the face of macro uncertainty — sensible — and we won’t have a great read on [information technology] spending budgets for another 30-60 days,"" Materne wrote.To be clear, this is far from the worst tech sell-off, and there's still overarching positive data.The Nasdaq remains up about 27% year to date and its long-term upward trajectory is clear. Over the last five years, the Nasdaq has gone up approximately 76%.Software companies to watchTo Materne's point, if software stocks leap off the bottom, who's set to win?Look at the large-cap names, according to Materne, including Microsoft, Adobe, Intuit (INTU), and Palo Alto Networks (PANW). He also identified a select group of growth names as possible winners, calling out Snowflake (SNOW), CrowdStrike (CRWD), and HubSpot (HUBS).Story continuesFor many of these names, Wall Street agrees there's room to run.Take Adobe, for example. CFRA analyst Angelo Zino, who has a Buy rating on the stock, suggests that Adobe shares have upside, especially given the company's potential to leverage AI.""Our Buy recommendation reflects our view of potential AI monetization opportunities, dominant position in select content creation apps with formidable competitive advantages, and cross-selling prospects,"" Zino wrote on Sept. 30.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella delivers the keynote address at the company's annual conference for software developers on Monday, May 6, 2019, in Seattle. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Next, consider Intuit, which just held its annual investor day on Sept. 28. AI came up again.""In our view, the analyst day provided a good incremental update on Intuit’s platform and AI strategy,"" William Blair's Matthew Pfau wrote on Sept. 29. ""We believe the company is positioning itself well to continue to grow the top line in the low- to mid-teens while providing margin expansion.""What would these companies be excited about if it weren't AI? It's hard to know.But AI or not, this is a movie investors have seen before, and it's a reminder that investing in software isn't for the faint of heart. It's more cyclical than investors might like to think, and it's in transition between a growth industry and a mature sector.With that history in mind, some say this is an opportunity.""While we expect that software stocks are at the mercy of the macro backdrop (and interest rates) in the immediate near-term, prior [second half of the year] pullbacks in software have ultimately proven to be great relative buying opportunities when taking a 180 or 365 day view,"" Materne wrote.

But is now the time to buy? Yahoo Finance's Allie Garfinkle has the details for us. Allie.ALLIE GARFINKLE: Akiko, for software stocks right now, as Olivia Rodrigo would say, it's brutal out there. And while it sounds like I'm being facetious, September was actually the worst month for tech stock since May. And going into this month, that slide has continued. We're still-- you know, and right now, it's software, of course, in the crosshairs, right? Salesforce, Adobe, both down more than 8% over the last four weeks. And it really comes down to macro pressure. Yes, it's high interest rates.There's also really limited visibility, end of the year, as to where clients are going to be spending and how comfortable they're going to be doing that spending. That said, I think it's important to say we've seen this movie before. There's history here.Over the last 12 years, the software space has had a number of pullbacks, especially in the second half of the year. And then those stocks will leap off the bottom. To this end, Evercore analyst-- Evercore analyst Kirk Materne had some advice for investors. It's a very Olivia Rodrigo-esque take.

I did not make the connection. But let's talk about those investors who are looking into this space. You know, what companies are analysts calling out as having upside?Story continuesALLIE GARFINKLE: Olivia Rodrigo's side? Look at the large caps here, Akiko. Look at Adobe. Look at Intuit. And yes, Microsoft is in that bag, but Microsoft is perhaps the most obvious of them. If you think about Adobe, think about AI. They're rolling out AI features left and right into it. Same deal, investor day, generative AI was really featured. That's what-- that's what we're expecting to see help kind of lift these companies off the bottom.That's certainly the story, at the very least, that they're selling-- that they're selling to Wall Street. And I should say also, Wall Street is optimistic about a few smaller caps. Snowflake, CrowdStrike, HubSpot are in that category. That said, if you're an investor saying yes right now to software, if you're really ready to invest, remember, you're going to be embracing the suck.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, that'll certainly be a line to leave us with as we go into the weekend.

In the rush to launch the hottest AI tools, companies continue to forget that people will always use new tech for chaos. Artificial intelligence simply cannot keep up with the human affinity for boobs and 9/11 shitposting. Both Meta and Microsoft’s AI image generators went viral this week for responding to prompts like “Karl marx large breasts” and fictional characters doing 9/11. They’re the latest examples of companies rushing to join the AI bandwagon, without considering how their tools will be misused. Meta is in the process of rolling out AI-generated chat stickers for Facebook Stories, Instagram Stories and DMs, Messenger and WhatsApp. It’s powered by Llama 2, Meta’s new collection of AI models that the company claims is as “helpful” as ChatGPT, and Emu, Meta’s foundational model for image generation. The stickers, which were announced at last month’s Meta Connect, will be available to “select English users” over the course of this month. “Every day people send hundreds of millions of stickers to express things in chats,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during the announcement. “And every chat is a little bit different and you want to express subtly different emotions. But today we only have a fixed number — but with Emu now you have the ability to just type in what you want.” Early users were delighted to test just how specific the stickers can be — though their prompts were less about expressing “subtly different emotions.” Instead, users tried to generate the most cursed stickers imaginable. In just days of the feature’s roll out, Facebook users have already generated images of Kirby with boobs, Karl Marx with boobs, Wario with boobs, Sonic with boobs and Sonic with boobs but also pregnant.zuckerberg is directly responsible for this specifically pic.twitter.com/6K3ShlnG2D— defend trans rights🏳️‍⚧️ - podesbiens.bsky.social (@Pioldes) October 3, 2023ya the new facebook AI stickers feature is crazy pic.twitter.com/ieHrULzjJE— SUNSHINE REVIVAL (@SeanMombo) October 4, 2023Meta appears to block certain words like “nude” and “sexy,” but as users pointed out, those filters can be easily bypassed by using typos of the blocked words instead. And like many of its AI predecessors, Meta’s AI models struggle to generate human hands. Story continues“I don’t think anyone involved has thought anything through,” X (formally Twitter) user Pioldes posted, along with screenshots of AI-generated stickers of child soldiers and Justin Trudeau’s buttocks. That applies to Bing’s Image Creator, too. Microsoft brought OpenAI’s DALL-E to Bing’s Image Creator earlier this year, and recently upgraded the integration to DALL-E 3. When it first launched, Microsoft said it added guardrails to curb misuse and limit the generation of problematic images. Its content policy forbids users from producing content that can “inflict harm on individuals or society,” including adult content that promotes sexual exploitation, hate speech and violence. “When our system detects that a potentially harmful image could be generated by a prompt, it blocks the prompt and warns the user,” the company said in a blog post. But as 404 Media reported, it’s astoundingly easy to use Image Creator to generate images of fictional characters piloting the plane that crashed into the Twin Towers. And despite Microsoft’s policy forbidding the depiction of acts of terrorism, the internet is awash with AI-generated 9/11s. The subjects vary, but almost all of the images depict a beloved fictional character in the cockpit of a plane, with the still-standing Twin Towers looming in the distance. In one of the first viral posts, it was the Eva pilots from “Neon Genesis Evangelion.” In another, it was Gru from “Despicable Me” giving a thumbs-up in front of the smoking towers. One featured SpongeBob grinning at the towers through the cockpit windshield.Thank you, Microsoft Bing pic.twitter.com/6XWxpum655— Rachel (@tolstoybb) October 3, 2023One Bing user went further, and posted a thread of Kermit committing a variety of violent acts, from attending the January 6 Capitol riot, to assassinating John F. Kennedy, to shooting up the executive boardroom of ExxonMobil. pic.twitter.com/8PLPxvBwPT— WEF Monday Night RAW (@MrTooDamnChris) October 3, 2023Microsoft appears to block the phrases “twin towers,” “World Trade Center” and “9/11.” The company also seems to ban the phrase “Capitol riot.” Using any of the phrases on Image Creator yields a pop-up window warning users that the prompt conflicts with the site’s content policy, and that multiple policy violations “may lead to automatic suspension.” If you’re truly determined to see your favorite fictional character commit an act of terrorism, though, it isn’t difficult to bypass the content filters with a little creativity. Image Creator will block the prompt “sonic the hedgehog 9/11” and “sonic the hedgehog in a plane twin towers.” The prompt “sonic the hedgehog in a plane cockpit toward twin trade center” yielded images of Sonic piloting a plane, with the still-intact towers in the distance. Using the same prompt but adding “pregnant” yielded similar images, except they inexplicably depicted the Twin Towers engulfed in smoke. AI-generated images of Hatsune Miku in front of the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 insurrection.If you're that determined to see your favorite fictional character commit acts of terrorism, it's easy to bypass AI content filters. Image Credits: Microsoft / Bing Image CreatorSimilarly, the prompt “Hatsune Miku at the US Capitol riot on January 6” will trigger Bing’s content warning, but the phrase “Hatsune Miku insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6” generates images of the Vocaloid armed with a rifle in Washington, DC. Meta and Microsoft’s missteps aren’t surprising. In the race to one-up competitors’ AI features, tech companies keep launching products without effective guardrails to prevent their models from generating problematic content. Platforms are saturated with generative AI tools that aren’t equipped to handle savvy users.Messing around with roundabout prompts to make generative AI tools produce results that violate their own content policies is referred to as jailbreaking (the same term is used when breaking open other forms of software, like Apple’s iOS). The practice is typically employed by researchers and academics to test and identify an AI model’s vulnerability to security attacks. But online, it’s a game. Ethical guardrails just aren’t a match for the very human desire to break rules, and the proliferation of generative AI products in recent years has only motivated people to jailbreak products as soon as they launch. Using cleverly worded prompts to find loopholes in an AI tool’s safeguards is something of an art form, and getting AI tools to generate absurd and offensive results is birthing a new genre of shitposting. I GOT CLYDE TO TEACH ME HOW TO MAKE NAPALM BY GRANDMA MODING IT LOL pic.twitter.com/XguaKW6w0L— annie (@_annieversary) April 17, 2023When Snapchat launched its family-friendly AI chatbot, for example, users trained it to call them Senpai and whimper on command. Midjourney bans pornographic content, going as far as blocking words related to the human reproductive system, but users are still able to bypass the filters and generate NSFW images. To use Clyde, Discord’s OpenAI-powered chatbot, users must abide by both Discord and OpenAI’s policies, which prohibit using the tool for illegal and harmful activity including “weapons development.” That didn’t stop the chatbot from giving one user instructions for making napalm after it was prompted to act as the user’s deceased grandmother “who used to be a chemical engineer at a napalm production factory.” Any new generative AI tool is bound to be a public relations nightmare, especially as users become more adept at identifying and exploiting safety loopholes. Ironically, the limitless possibilities of generative AI is best demonstrated by the users determined to break it. The fact that it’s so easy to get around these restrictions raises serious red flags — but more importantly, it’s pretty funny. It’s so beautifully human that decades of scientific innovation paved the way for this technology, only for us to use it to look at boobs.

Others, not so much.",TechCrunch,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/6793c470-34f1-331e-9e24-eea50981a31a/some-gen-ai-vendors-say.html,1696605677,STORY,"['MSFT', 'AMZN', 'GOOGL', 'IBM']","[A person using generative AI -- models that generate text, images, music and more given a prompt -- could infringe on someone else's copyright through no fault of their own. But who's on the hook for the legal fees and damages if -- or rather, when -- that happens?It depends.In the fast-changing landscape of generative AI, companies monetizing the tech -- from startups to big tech companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft -- are approaching IP risks from very different angles.Some vendors have pledged to defend, financially and otherwise, customers using their generative AI tools who end up on the wrong side of copyright litigation. Others have published policies to shield themselves from liability, leaving customers to foot the legal bills.While the terms of service agreements for most generative AI tools are public, they're written in legalese. Seeking some clarity, I reached out to vendors about their policies on protecting customers who might violate copyright with their AI-generated text, images, videos and music.The responses -- and non-responses -- were enlightening.Regurgitating dataGenerative AI models ""learn"" from examples to craft essays and code, create artwork and compose music -- and even write lyrics to accompany that music. They're trained on millions to billions of e-books, art pieces, emails, songs, audio clips, voice recordings and more, most of which came from public websites.Some of these examples are in the public domain -- at least in the case of vendors that trawl the web for training data. Others aren't, or come under a restrictive license that requires citation or specific forms of compensation.The legality of vendors training on data without permission is another matter that's being hashed out in the courts. But what might possibly land generative AI users in trouble is regurgitation, or when a generative model spits out a mirror copy of a training example.Story continuesOn the top are images generated by Stable Diffusion from random captions in the model’s training set. On the bottom are images that the researchers prompted to match the originals.On the top are images generated by Stable Diffusion, an image-generating AI, from random captions in the model’s training set. On the bottom are images prompted to match the originals. Image Credits: Somepalli et al.Microsoft, GitHub and OpenAI are currently being sued in a class action motion that accuses them of violating copyright law by allowing Copilot, a code-generating AI, to regurgitate licensed code snippets without providing credit. Elsewhere, thousands of writers have signed an open letter decrying generative AI technologies that ""mimic and regurgitate"" their ""language, stories, style and ideas.""The cases keep coming.Authors in California and New York have sued OpenAI for alleged IP theft of their works. Image-generating tool vendors, including Stability AI and Midjourney, are the subject of lawsuits brought by artists and stock image sites like Getty Images. And Universal Music Group is seeking to ban AI-generated music mimicking the style of musicians it represents from streaming platforms, sending takedown notices to have the songs removed.Perhaps it's no surprise, then, that in a recent survey of Fortune 500 companies by Acrolinx, nearly a third said that intellectual property was their biggest concern about the use of generative AI.The threat of running afoul of copyright with a generative AI tool hasn't stopped investors from pouring billions into the startups creating those tools. One wonders, however, whether the situation will remain tenable for much longer.A question of indemnityIn the midst of the uncertainty, you might think that generative AI vendors would stand behind their customers in the strongest terms -- if for no other reason than to their allay their fears of IP-related legal challenges.But you'd be wrong.From the language in some terms of service agreements -- specifically the indemnity clauses, or the clauses that specify in which cases customers can expect to be reimbursed for damages from third-party claims -- it's clear that not every vendor's willing to chance a court decision forcing them to rethink their approach to generative model training, or in the worst case their business model.Anthropic, for instance, which recently inked a deal with Amazon to raise as much as $4 billion and is reportedly seeking another $2 billion investment from Google and others, reserves the right to ""hold harmless"" itself and partners from damages arising from the use of its generative AI -- including those related to IP.Point blank, I asked Anthropic, which offers strictly text-generating models, whether it would legally or financially support a customer implicated in a copyright lawsuit over its models' outputs. The company declined to say.AI21 Labs, another well-funded generative AI startup building a suite of text editing tools, also declined to give an answer. So I looked at its policy.A21 Labs says that it might ""assume exclusive defense and control"" of a lawsuit against a customer if the customer chooses not to defend or settle it themselves. But it won't pay for the privilege; it'll be at the customer's own expense.OpenAI -- arguably the most successful generative AI vendor today, with over $10 billion in venture capital and revenue approaching $1 billion -- pointed me to its terms of use, which limit the company's liability to ""the amount [a customer] paid for [an OpenAI] service that gave rise to [a] claim during the 12 months before the the liability arose or $100."" That's the best-case scenario for customers; OpenAI's policy makes it clear that the company, in many if not most cases, won't be a party to or defend against copyright lawsuits targeting its users.Vendors building image- and video-generating AI, where the potential copyright violations tend to be a bit more obvious, aren't much more supportive contractually than their text-first rivals.Stability AI, which develops music-generating models in addition to image- and text-generating ones, referred me to the terms for its API. The company leaves it to customers to defend themselves against copyright claims and -- unlike some other generative AI vendors -- has no payout carve-out in the event that it's found liable.Midjourney and Runway.ai didn't respond to my emails -- but I found their terms. Midjourney's policy releases the company from liability for third-party IP damages. Runway.ai's does, as well.Fine printNow, some vendors -- perhaps becoming more attuned to the concerns of enterprise customers considering adopting generative AI, or looking to position themselves as a ""safer"" alternative -- aren't shying away from committing to protecting customers in the event that they're sued for copyright infringement. To a point.Amazon, which recently launched a platform for running and fine-tuning generative AI models, called Bedrock, says that it'll indemnify (i.e. defend) customers against claims alleging the model infringes on a third-party's IP rights. But Amazon's indemnification policy only applies to the company's in-house family of text-analyzing models, Titan, as well as Amazon's code-generating service, CodeWhisperer.The CodeWhisperer indemnity is broader and applies to all IP claims, including trademarks. However, it requires at least a CodeWhisperer Professional subscription with copyright-defending filtering features enabled. Free users of CodeWhisper aren't afforded the same protections. And customers must agree to let AWS control their defense and settle ""as AWS deems appropriate.""IBM also provides IP indemnity for its generative AI models, Slate and Granite, available through its Watsonx generative AI service.""Consistent with IBM's approach to its indemnification obligation, IBM doesn't cap its indemnification liability for IBM-developed models,"" an IBM spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. ""This applies to current [and] future IBM-developed Watsonx models.""Google wouldn't respond to my emails. But from the company's terms, it'd appear that Google offers some defense for customers against third-party allegations of IP infringement arising from its text- and image-generating models. However, Google says that it might suspend a customer's use of the allegedly infringing model if it can't find ""commercially reasonable"" remedies.Google-backed Cohere, too, has a provision in its terms suggesting that it'll ""defend, indemnify and hold harmless"" customers facing third-party claims alleging that Cohere's models infringe on IP. Given Cohere's heavy enterprise focus, that's not surprising.Microsoft recently made a splashy announcement that it'll pay legal damages on behalf of customers using its AI products if they're sued for copyright infringement -- so long as those customers use ""guardrails and content filters"" built into its products.Which products does it pertain to? That's where it gets tricky.Microsoft says its indemnity policy covers paid versions of its portfolio of AI-powered ""Copilot"" services (including the Microsoft 365 Copilot for Word, Excel and PowerPoint) and Bing Chat Enterprise, the enterprise version of its chatbot on Bing. It also extends to GitHub Copilot, Microsoft's code-generating service co-developed with OpenAI.But in its Azure policy, Microsoft clarifies that customers using ""previews"" of generative AI features powered by its Azure OpenAI Service are responsible for responding to third-party claims of copyright infringement.Kate Downing, an IP lawyer based in Santa Cruz, takes issue specifically with the Copilot indemnity provision, arguing that -- given the vagueness of the provision and its exclusions -- the upfront costs of enforcing might be too high for a business to swallow.By contrast, Adobe claims to offer ""full indemnity"" protection for users of Firefly, its generative AI art platform, asserting its models are trained on stock images for which Adobe already holds the rights.

Those customers want the assurance that they won't be sued over copyright claims, after all.But if the current state of things is any indication, the policies won't look similar. And some will have exceptions that'll make them more attractive in theory than in practice -- in other words, more marketing ploy than a legitimate protection.As a recent article from U.K. law firm Ferrer &amp; Co. puts it, indemnities don't offer a ""get out of jail free card"" -- nor are they a panacea.""Our key message is, don't see the offering of provider indemnities as a complete answer to the risk of third-party infringement claims,"" the firm writes on its blog.

One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Microsoft The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$66.8bUS$80.4bUS$97.9bUS$112.9bUS$130.8bUS$144.1bUS$155.2bUS$164.6bUS$172.7bUS$179.7bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x24Analyst x21Analyst x9Analyst x4Analyst x3Est @ 10.13%Est @ 7.73%Est @ 6.06%Est @ 4.89%Est @ 4.06% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.1% US$62.4kUS$70.1kUS$79.6kUS$85.7kUS$92.7kUS$95.3kUS$95.8kUS$94.9kUS$92.9kUS$90.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$859bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$180b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.1%– 2.2%) = US$3.7tPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$3.7t÷ ( 1 + 7.1%)10= US$1.8tThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$2.7t. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$319, the company appears about fair value at a 12% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Microsoft as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.997. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for MicrosoftStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Software market.OpportunityAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For Microsoft, there are three important factors you should explore:Risks: Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Microsoft   you should know about.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for MSFT's future outlook?

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Paychex with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. See our latest analysis for Paychex How Fast Is Paychex Growing?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. We can see that in the last three years Paychex grew its EPS by 15% per year. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Paychex maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 7.4% to US$5.1b. That's a real positive.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Paychex?Are Paychex Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Paychex has a market capitalisation of US$41b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$4.4b. This suggests that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!Story continuesWhile it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to Paychex, with market caps over US$8.0b, is around US$12m.The Paychex CEO received US$6.7m in compensation for the year ending May 2023. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given it's below the median for similar sized companies. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.Does Paychex Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?One important encouraging feature of Paychex is that it is growing profits. Earnings growth might be the main attraction for Paychex, but the fun does not stop there. Boasting both modest CEO pay and considerable insider ownership, you'd argue this one is worthy of the watchlist, at least. What about risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Paychex   you should know about.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

Federal law requires employers to report expenses aimed at discouraging organizing and union membership.A Buffalo Starbucks in December 2021 became the first in the company's history to unionize, and workers at more than 360 U.S. locations have followed suit.Starbucks and Schultz have faced allegations of widespread illegal union-busting from workers, labor groups and Democratic lawmakers. The company has denied the claims and is defending itself against scores of complaints before the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which is separate from the Labor Department.Last week, the NLRB said Starbucks must turn over a document dubbed the ""petition store playbook"" outlining how the company would respond to worker petitions for union elections. NLRB lawyers requested the document in a case involving organizing at a Connecticut store.In the ruling issued Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Marsha Pechman in Seattle also ordered the coffee chain to provide records of its expenses to create and maintain a website providing information about union organizing.Starbucks in a statement said it had not been accused of wrongdoing by the Labor Department, and would ""continue to engage with government officials to provide clarifying information on our compliance with decades of labor law.""Story continuesJeff Freund, director of the Labor Department office that enforces the reporting law, said the judge's ruling will help the agency determine whether Starbucks was required to report expenses related to the trip to Buffalo and the website.The department served the subpoena on Starbucks earlier this year and filed a court petition in May after the company objected.Starbucks had argued that the disclosure law did not require reporting of payments to its own employees involved in responding to union campaigns.The company said the Labor Department had never previously required that information, and that it was illegal for the agency to reverse course without adopting a formal rule.Pechman in her ruling said Starbucks could raise those arguments as defenses if the Labor Department accuses the company of violating the disclosure law, but not in an attempt to toss out the subpoena.(Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York, Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and David Gregorio)]"

SBUX also has an impressive long-term earnings growth rate of 16.5%.Growth DriversStarbucks, a globally recognized coffee brand, strategically expands its market presence by opening stores, renovating existing ones, leveraging technology, cost management and fostering innovation. In fiscal 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022, it added 2,250, 2,300, 1,900, 1,400, 1,173 and 1,120 net new stores, respectively.In the first, second and third-quarter fiscal 2023, Starbucks opened 459, 464 and 588 net new stores worldwide, respectively. During fiscal 2023, it expects store count in the United States and China to grow approximately 3% and 13%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. Management projects global store growth to be nearly 7%. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2023 are estimated to be approximately $2.5 billion.SBUX’s North America comps impressed investors for the tenth straight quarter. The segment benefited from growth in company-operated comparable store sales of 7%, net new company-operated store growth of 4% and strong licensed store sales. Segmental average ticket and transaction rose 6% and 1%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. For fourth-quarter fiscal 2023, our model predicts company-operated store sales in North America to improve 9.6% to $6,085.1 million year over year.For fiscal 2023, management anticipates global comparable sales to reach the high end of 7-9% target range. Consolidated revenues for fiscal 2023 are anticipated to rise in the range of 10-12% on a year-over-year basis. For fiscal 2023, the company estimates non-GAAP EPS growth in the range of 16-17% compared with the previous expectation of 15-20%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConcernsThe company’s results in third-quarter fiscal 2023 were hurt by dismal Channel Development sales. Net revenues in the segment declined 6.4% year over year to $448.8 million. The downside was primarily caused by a fall in its Global Coffee Alliance business.Meanwhile, the segment’s operating margin expanded 630 bps year over year to 46.3%. A rise in North American Coffee Partnership joint venture income and mix shift primarily drove the upside.The ongoing inflationary pressure is likely to hurt SBUX’s performance. Its ingredients are witnessing a price hike since the last few quarters. Higher expenses may weigh on margins in the near term.

This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock.

But you can make superior returns by picking better-than average stocks. Notably, the Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) share price has gained 17% in three years, which is better than the average market return. Zooming in, the stock is up a respectable 8.9% in the last year.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. View our latest analysis for Philip Morris International While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Philip Morris International was able to grow its EPS at 3.4% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. In comparison, the 5% per year gain in the share price outpaces the EPS growth. This suggests that, as the business progressed over the last few years, it gained the confidence of market participants. It is quite common to see investors become enamoured with a business, after a few years of solid progress.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Philip Morris International's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Philip Morris International's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Philip Morris International's TSR for the last 3 years was 37%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectivePhilip Morris International shareholders are up 15% for the year (even including dividends). But that return falls short of the market. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it's actually better than the average return of 8% over half a decade This could indicate that the company is winning over new investors, as it pursues its strategy. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

For more recession-resilient stocks, head over to 5 Best Stocks to Buy in Falling Markets.Recessions are inevitable and the market has been forecasting a recession in the near future for quite some time. The reason is that since July last year, the yield curve has been inverted, which has often been a signal that recession may be on the horizon. When economic downturns hit, people always tend to invest in safe stocks which may offer them reasonable returns during higher uncertainties. Thus healthcare and consumer staple shares are mostly preferred in those situations when macroeconomic headwinds are high.Companies in the consumer staples are the ones that mostly produce and sell consumer necessity goods. Those goods are bought easily even during recessions because when economic challenges skyrocket, people opt for necessities rather than luxuries. According to The Wall Street Journal, consumer staple stocks are a “bright spot in bleak market”.“Consumer-staples companies are commonly regarded as a haven during volatile markets and recessionary periods,” the WSJ added.Consumers cannot stop buying medicines, prescription drugs or basic household products even when recessions hit, Morningstar analyst Amy Arnott wrote.According to Arnott, healthcare and consumer staple stocks are the most “resilient performers” during economic downturns.Opportunities lie ahead for consumer staple companies as they will maintain their performance and have organic sales growth despite economic downturns this year and into 2024, analyst Amber Kanwar said in an interview on BNN Bloomberg.In the near future, consumer staples will be an important part of stock portfolios as there will be a major focus on low-end consumers, Mona Mahajan, a senior investment strategist at Edward Jones said.Considering recession is imminent and inevitable, according to many analysts, we decided to take a look at some of the best stocks to buy in falling markets which include General Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS), Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and others.Story continuesOur Methodology:We chose stocks from the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund because historically consumer staple companies have performed well in times of economic downturns. In this article, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund has been selected which holds 39 companies in the consumer services industry. The stocks held under this ETF are expected to offer earnings per share growth of 7.61% in the next three to five years. The price/book ratio for this ETF stands at 4.58 for the last year which demonstrates that stocks are trading at premium prices, while the price/earnings ratio for this ETF is at 18.94. The price/earnings ratio compares a company’s share price to its yearly net profits. Anything below 20 would be considered a good price-to-earnings ratio.

Robust SaaS offerings and high retention rates are aiding Deltek. The acquisition of Replicon, expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2023, will bolster Deltek’s growth by boosting its SaaS solutions portfolio. The buyout is expected to contribute $70 million to revenues and $24 million to EBITDA in 2024.

Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports on Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser's plans to implement layoffs and the challenges putting a squeeze on the banking sector.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptJOSH LIPTON: Banks are gearing up to report their third quarter results later this month. The sector is feeling the heat as it faces the likelihood of higher for longer rates and keeping an eye out for potential recession. But some of the biggest banks are dealing with problems of a different sort, namely whether they can change. Here to break it down for us is Yahoo Finance's own David Hollerith. David.DAVID HOLLERITH: Josh, so a couple of the country's largest banks are somewhere in the process of attempting these really big corporate shifts. And that's being led by their CEOs. Now, along with the possibility of higher interest rates for a longer period of time, this just adds an extra layer of complexity they've got to deal with when they do earnings. So Jane Frazier is attempting to eliminate middle managers at Citigroup, the country's third largest banks.And this is sort of seen as an effort to revive the bank's stock price, which has lagged peers. And Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon is trying to trim up the banks operations as it pulls out of consumer lending and focuses more on its core business of dealmaking. And CEO Charles Scharf, who is trying is trying to pull Wells Fargo back into a system of compliance and risk controls that regulators have approved by, but its legal troubles kind of keep resurfacing.So on Citi, you know, we're not expecting any tangible numbers about the layoffs. But we do want some kind of update this huge reorganization, as she's described, it is still a bit murky. On Goldman Sachs, Solomon is lucky in that. We have seen a bit of a resurgence in the IPO market, but he's been the first to admit that the M&amp;A market is going to take until next year to sort of reach normal levels again. He's also mentioned that there are some commercial real estate impairments that Goldman is going to probably take this quarter.And then finally, on Wells Fargo, it's still paying fines for consumer and investor violations. And the big thing here is in 2016, they had a fake accounts scandal that's kind of still been resurfacing. They've spent about $13 billion paying fines to regulators since then. And about 235 million of that has come in August. And we're expecting Scharf to touch on that and obviously some kind of progress to getting regulators approval. The bank is not allowed to grow. And that's according to the Fed, which was instated in 2018, this rule they cannot expand at all.JULIE HYMAN: All right. David, thank you so much. Dave Hollerith, appreciate you running us through what to expect on the management front for many of these banks.]"

Given the challenging operating backdrop for IBs, both have been struggling to improve profitability since last year.This can also be seen from bearish investor sentiment toward the MS and GS stocks. Since the beginning of 2022, shares of Morgan Stanley and Goldman have lost 19.4% and 18.9%, respectively. Price PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHeadwinds, including persistently high inflation, global aggressive monetary policy tightening, expectations of economic slowdown and geopolitical tensions, have resulted in a total crash of underwriting and advisory businesses. Though this year has been slightly better, things are far from normal.Amid such a tough operating environment, let’s check which company – Morgan Stanley or Goldman – is better poised to counter this. Currently, both companies carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see tthe complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Starting with the first half of 2023 financial performance, Morgan Stanley posted a 16% decline in net income, while the metric plunged 37% for Goldman. On the revenue front, Morgan Stanley’s top-line growth remained stable, while GS recorded a 7% fall in the same.Now digging a bit deeper into revenue details, we see that Morgan Stanley’s Institutional Services business, which houses investment banking, witnessed a 10% decrease in net revenues in the first six months of 2023. The business accounts for 45% of the company’s net revenues.For GS, its Global Banking and Markets business’ (accounting for almost 68% of firm’s total net revenues) total net revenues were down 15%.Hence, we see that MS is less dependent on investment banking than Goldman. Notably, investment banking is not the primary revenue contributor for MS. The company’s Wealth Management business consisted of 47% of total net revenues in the first half of the year.Therefore, Morgan Stanley has much more diversified revenue sources than GS. Wealth Management provides MS with a good balance when investment banking is subdued.On the other hand, Goldman is currently in the middle of a business streamlining process. The company is refocusing on its core strengths of investment banking and trading while reducing its retail footprint. In sync with this, it announced the divestiture of its Personal Financial Management unit (expected to close by the end of this quarter) in August and is looking for bidders for GreenSky (its consumer lending platform). These efforts are expected to result in some one-time charges in the near term, thereby hampering growth.So, which stock is worth keeping an eye on?Presently, one can keep Morgan Stanley on their radar as it has a more balanced revenue mix, with a focus on both investment banking and wealth management businesses. This will help the company sustain profitability. With green shoots visible in investment banking and markets projecting further improvement next year, MS stands to gain from diversified revenues.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 84% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).And so it follows that institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$14b last week after a 3.7% drop in the share price. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 22% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Often called “market movers"", institutions wield significant power in influencing the price dynamics of any stock. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell Northern Trust, which might have negative implications on individual investors.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Northern Trust. View our latest analysis for Northern Trust ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Northern Trust?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Northern Trust. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Northern Trust, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Northern Trust. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 11% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.5% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.2% of the company stock.Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 14 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Northern TrustWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Northern Trust Corporation. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$164m. It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 15% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Northern Trust better, we need to consider many other factors.I always like to check for a history of revenue growth.

Better pricing, prudent underwriting, increased exposure, faster economic recovery on the receding impact of the pandemic and increased vaccinations should benefit MetLife Inc. MET, American International Group Inc. AIG, The Hartford Financial Services Group HIG, Everest Group, Ltd. EG and MGIC Investment Corporation MTG. Accelerated digitalization will help in the smooth functioning of the industry.The solid capital level of the multiline insurers will fuel merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activities. With four rate hikes this year already, investment income should improve further as insurers are beneficiaries of a better rate environment.About the IndustryThe Zacks Multiline Insurance industry comprises companies that provide single insurance coverage, bundling automobile, homeowner, long-term care, and life and health insurance to individuals and businesses. The insured pays a single premium and is covered for many things through a single contract. These companies cover commercial and personal properties, automobiles, marine, livestock, aviation, personal accident, life, including permanent and term insurance, supplemental accident and health insurance, workers’ compensation, annuity products, private mortgage insurance, et al. The players also provide risk management services. Since the companies offer single insurance coverage for multiple products, customer retention improves. The insured stands to benefit from lower premium payment compared to paying individual premiums for insuring varied products.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Multiline Insurance IndustryDiversified portfolio lowers concentration risk:  Given the nature of the business, multiline insurers’ product and service portfolios are diversified. This lowers concentration risk. Increased awareness, driving higher demand for protection products, should benefit sales and premiums of life insurance operations. Continued improvement in pricing and an increase in exposure should support premium growth. Also, per Deloitte Insights, the transition to green energy and related insurance products, as well as exposure to intangible assets, offers growth opportunities. Per Deloitte Insights, life insurance premium is estimated to increase 1.9% in 2023 while non-life premiums are expected to increase 2.2%. The report also stated that trends like commercial lines witnessing growth faster than personal lines and homeowners’ premiums improving at a better rate than personal auto are likely to continue in 2023. However, underwriting losses are expected to persist, driven by challenging results in personal lines.Merger and acquisitions:  Consolidation in the multi-line insurance industry is expected to continue as players look to diversify their operations into new business lines and geographies. Buying businesses along the same lines is driven by the players’ need to gain a fair market share and grow in their niche areas. However, with high inflation and a rise in interest rates (the Fed has already made one rate hike this year), momentum in the M&amp;A environment is likely to slow down.  Increased adoption of technology: Digitalization has increased by leaps and bounds, especially amid pandemic-induced restrictions. The industry is witnessing greater use of technology like blockchain, AI, advanced analytics, telematics, cloud computing and robotic process automation to expedite business operations and save costs.  Many life insurers have started selling policies online that appeal to the tech-savvy population. At the same time, the use of real-time data is making premium calculation easier and reducing risk. The P&amp;C industry, in particular, also witnessed the emergence of insurtech — technology-led insurers — sparking competition for incumbent players. Insurers remain focused on ramping up data and analytics capabilities as well as realizing the benefit of the technological infrastructure per Deloitte Insights. Moreover, the adoption of technology has helped in seamless underwriting and claims processing. However, the adoption of technology comes with the risk of cyber threats.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Weak ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dismal prospects in the near term.

Maybe not at the moment, but Bernstein Analyst Laurent Yoon sees Disney as the “only credible challenger to Netflix” given its potential to gain full control of Hulu.Yahoo Finance Live's Seana Smith and Brad Smith analyze Yoon's note.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: We wanna get to the market commentary of the day. Could Disney knock Netflix off its top spot in the streaming space? Well, according to a new note out from Bernstein, Disney is the, quote, ""only credible challenger to the streaming giant.""Now, Netflix has maintained its leadership in this space despite legendary networks and tech giants alike putting their hats in the ring. Bernstein Analyst Laurent Yoon points to Hulu as a potential catalyst here, arguing that Disney has more to gain with full control of Hulu.And a favorable resolution of the deal would likely lift an overhang on the stock, saying in a recent note that, quote, ""We forecast DTC growth to outpace linear decline, supporting overall growth of Media. And Disney becoming the undisputed number two subscription video on demand.""Now, with the price target of $103, Yoon sees more than 20% upside to Disney's stock. We're seeing a bit of a lift here today, up just about a tenth of a percent. Lots to digest in this note here, Brad. But at scale, at least Bernstein arguing that they expect EBITDA margin to expand from roughly 18% today to the low 20s for the foreseeable future. And the price target multiple implies a decent premium to some of its legacy peers. But still, though, seven times turns less than Netflix, the industry leader.BRAD SMITH: I'm just excited about the advertising on here. This is a key part of this note as well, AVOD economics. All right. So we're gonna do a short but shallow deep dive into this one. AVOD economics works. But can it scale as one of the parts of this note here?Story continuesAnd it caught my attention because when you think about the advertising options that are out there for not just the consumers and kind of lowering the price that they're paying based on the tier that they're opting into, but for advertisers, for marketers who are trying to run these massive campaigns on streaming platforms, knowing the amount of screen time that is paid or ultimately amassed on each of these and largely the two lion's share winners there, Disney and Netflix, the not straight-up duopoly but certainly the largest of the streaming opportunities that are out there here.The AVOD arm is now basically higher than basic globally and also higher than standard domestically. What does all this mean here, the arm is already competitive with the standard tier. And that's what they're saying about Netflix and particularly how this relates to the larger AVOD tier. Standard tier is about $8.5 a month here.Now, the engagement and cost of advertising slots-- the CPMs, cost per million, is typically what that would have been for many decades and years at this point-- is what cost per essential millions of views an advertiser would be paying for here.And so all that considered, look for what Disney, what Netflix say about where their advertising tiers are showing strength, what's they're seeing in terms of revenue in those advertisers, those marketing dollars, millions, sometimes billions of dollars spent in these ad campaigns that are run on the platform that can amass to a significant revenue item for Disney and Netflix to be able to report back to investors here. I'm sorry, I'm just excited about advertising and marketing.]"

The tech sector has fallen from its peak earlier this year, paving the way for speculation over whether tech stocks are still a sound investment.Mark Mahaney, Evercore ISI Senior Managing Director and Head of Internet Research, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss Netflix's outlook after a recent report from the Wall Street Journal stated the streaming service's intent to raise subscription prices after the SAG-AFTRA strike ends.Mahaney comments on Netflix's move into AVOD (advertising on demand), stating: ""Over time, it will help them gain more subscribers, and the beauty of this is with the advertising revenue, they could drop their subscription price by a couple of bucks, three bucks, and generate more revenue per user, like you rarely see that in business history.""For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Tech stocks have certainly taken a beating this quarter. The Magnificent Seven, the biggest players in tech, Apple Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, NVIDIA, and Tesla are all well off their 2023 peaks. But should investors reassess their tech investments?We want to bring in Mark Mahaney, Evercore ISI senior managing director, also head of internet research to discuss all this and more. Mark, it's great to see you. Let's start with-- you cover a lot of names, but I want to start with Netflix and reports that we got out earlier this week about Netflix potentially raising prices yet again. The stock's still in the green since the start of the year up just about 27%. What do you think of the report and how material this would be to the business?MARK MAHANEY: I think it's a high probability that Netflix is going to raise prices again. They have a history of doing this. The wonderful term that they use, I think, the euphemism is called widening. So what they mean by that is they're going to, kind of, accordion or widen up the price point. So the high-end price points for you and me and all other consumers, 1549 for the standard package and then 1949 for the premium package, something like that.Story continuesAnyway, I think they're going to take those up over time. And this is how the company has, kind of, driven growth historically. Investor concerns over the last quarter centered on why [INAUDIBLE] wasn't growing fast. So this is the solution to that. It'll be a positive catalyst when it's announced.The big backdrop here is that the Hollywood writers' strike however pushed off the time when they could raise prices because that meant that there was a content hole risk for Netflix. Once you get beat well beyond the writers strike, content starts coming back on, you get some good shows, you will see that price increase. I like Netflix as a stock. It's not one of our top picks though.BRAD SMITH: And just quickly within there, where does AVOD fit into your valuation of Netflix as well, this advertising layered on tier as well?MARK MAHANEY: Well, I think they expanded their TAM, their Total Addressable Market. And so, you know, Netflix, kind of, hit a wall at the beginning of 2022 and they went two quarters without any sub growth. And then they announced they were going to get into the AVOD business. I call it SAVOD, Subscription and Advertising Video on Demand.I don't think they'll go pure AVOD, like only have an advertising revenue-driven business. But the SAVOD business, I think it's going to work really well for them. We've only had early days with it.Maybe 10 million or maybe it's 5 million of their total subscribers are on this SAVOD plan, but that's at a 250 million. So it's chump change. It's small. But over time, it'll help them gain more subscribers.And the beauty of this is with the advertising revenue, they could actually drop their subscription price by a couple of bucks, by $3, and actually generate more revenue per user. You rarely see that in business history. That's the big win here.

(Chris Pizzello/AP Photo) (Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP)Striking Hollywood actors will meet with studios again on Friday as the two sides restart negotiations on the heels of an epic conclusion to the writers strike last week.SAG-AFTRA — the union that represents approximately 160,000 actors, announcers, recording artists, and other media professionals around the world — began a strike on July 14 after failing to negotiate a deal with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which bargains on behalf of the major studios including Warner Bros. (WBD), Disney (DIS), Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NBCUniversal (CMCSA), Paramount (PARA), and Sony (SONY).Similarly to the writers, SAG-AFTRA is fighting for more protections surrounding the role of artificial intelligence in media and entertainment in addition to better pay, improved working conditions, and higher streaming residuals as more movies and TV shows go directly to streaming.The writers union, Writers Guild of America (WGA), had been on strike for nearly 150 days prior to its studio deal. The guild was successful in achieving many of its demands, which included increased regulations surrounding the use of artificial intelligence, minimum staffing requirements, a boost to streaming residuals, and more.Industry watchers largely expect SAG-AFTRA to reach a similar conclusion, although the union made it clear that, while it will review the WGA's agreement, the guild is ultimately committed to reaching a deal that's specific to its member base.Story continuesAccording to estimates from the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp., the 2007-2008 writers strike cost the Los Angeles County economy a whopping $2.5 billion.

(NYSE:TJX) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for TJX Companies TJX Companies Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive Chairman, Carol Meyrowitz, sold US$5.9m worth of shares at a price of US$91.13 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$88.56. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.In the last year TJX Companies insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At TJX Companies Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of TJX Companies shares. In total, insiders dumped US$10m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesInsider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. TJX Companies insiders own 0.1% of the company, currently worth about US$147m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About TJX Companies Insiders?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. On the plus side, TJX Companies makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

Mirati is a commercial-stage biotechnology company developing kinase and KRAS inhibitors.Though neither Mirati nor Sanofi issued any comments on the rumor, the Bloomberg article suggests that deliberations are still ongoing and other suitors may also be interested in acquiring Mirati. Since August, the company also parted ways with its chief financial officer (CFO) Laurie Stelzer and chief executive officer (CEO) David Meek.Mirati Therapeutics has been a likely acquisition target ever since the FDA granted accelerated approval to its sole-marketed drug Krazati (adagrasib) last December. The Mirati drug is approved to treat KRASG12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) in adult patients, who received at least one prior treatment.The rumored buyout news also comes a couple of months after Mirati reported encouraging data from clinical studies, which showed that treatment with the Krazati-Keytruda combination achieved an ORR of 63% in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated first-line NSCLC. This ORR was superior and favorable compared with the 39-45% ORR achieved by the current standard of care, i.e., Keytruda plus chemotherapy. Based on the above data, management intends to start a pivotal late-stage study on the Krazati-Keytruda combination in first-line NSCLC before 2023-end.Year to date, shares of Mirati have rallied 37.7% against the industry’s 17.9% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe buyout will likely benefit Sanofi which has been exploring opportunities to expand its pipeline as well as portfolio of marketed drugs. In the year so far, Sanofi has completed the acquisition of Provention Bio (for $2.9 billion) that added diabetes drug Tzield to its portfolio of marketed drugs. Earlier this month, Sanofi signed a deal with Teva Pharmaceuticals to jointly develop and market TEV’574 for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and crohn's disease.Story continuesThe timing of the article also benefits Mirati as it came on the same day when an FDA advisory committee was supposed to issue its recommendation on Lumakras, another KRASG12C inhibitor marketed by Amgen AMGN, also approved for an indication similar to Krazati. The committee members raised questions on the late-stage confirmatory study supporting Amgen’s regulatory filing on Lumakras and voted 10-2 stating that they cannot properly interpret the study’s primary endpoint.Like Krazati, Amgen’s Lumakras was also granted accelerated approval in 2021 as the first FDA-approved therapy to target a KRASG12C-mutated cancer indication. An FDA filing is currently under review to convert this accelerated approval to a full one.Despite a negative recommendation, the FDA did not suggest withdrawing the drug from the market. A final decision on Amgen’s Lumakras is still expected before this year’s end.Mirati has been an ideal acquisition target since last year when a previous Bloomberg article suggested that several large-cap pharma giants eyed the company as an acquisition target. The rumored news never came to pass likely due to preliminary data from a mid-stage study on the Krazati-Keytruda combination in first-line NSCLC, which did not impress investors.Mirati Therapeutics, Inc.

(AMGN) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amgen-inc-amgn-attracting-investor-130006228.html,1696597206,STORY,['AMGN'],"[Amgen (AMGN) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this world's largest biotech drugmaker have returned +4.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -5.2% change. The Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, to which Amgen belongs, has lost 3.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Amgen is expected to post earnings of $4.68 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +3.2%.The consensus earnings estimate of $18.35 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +3.7%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $19.93 indicates a change of +8.6% from what Amgen is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Amgen.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Amgen, the consensus sales estimate of $6.94 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +4.3%. The $27.26 billion and $31.01 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +3.6% and +13.8%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryAmgen reported revenues of $6.99 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.9%. EPS of $5 for the same period compares with $4.65 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.63 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.41%. The EPS surprise was +12.61%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Amgen is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amgen. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. We or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to realize any of the strategic benefits, synergies or opportunities arising from the Horizon acquisition, and such benefits, synergies or opportunities may take longer to realize than expected.  We may not be able to successfully integrate Horizon, and such acquisition or integration may take longer, be more difficult or cost more than expected. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach of our information technology systems could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving our environmental, social and governance objectives.

One such stock that has caught the attention of many is Newmont Corp (NYSE:NEM). Currently priced at 36.87, the stock recorded a gain of 1.42% in a day and a 3-month decrease of 11.12%. According to its GF Value, the stock's fair valuation is $68.81.Understanding GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NEM. Click here to check it out. NEM 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of NEMThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page provides an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. This calculation is based on three factors: Historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at, GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of business performance. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Is Newmont (NEM) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapDelving Deeper into Newmont's ValueDespite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Newmont (NYSE:NEM) should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 1.35. These indicators suggest that Newmont, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Understanding the Altman Z-scoreThe Altman Z-score, invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Story continuesCompany SnapshotNewmont is the world's largest gold miner, producing about 6 million attributable ounces of gold in 2022, good for about 5% of global mined output. The company also produced 1.3 million attributable gold equivalent ounces from the sale of byproducts, including copper, silver, zinc, and lead in 2022. It had about two decades of gold reserves along with significant byproduct reserves at end 2022. After buying Goldcorp in 2019 and combining its Nevada mines in a joint venture with competitor Barrick later that year, Newmont's portfolio includes 12 wholly owned mines and interests in two joint ventures in the Americas, Africa, and Australia.Is Newmont (NEM) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapBreaking Down Newmont's Low Altman Z-ScoreA dissection of Newmont's Altman Z-score reveals that the company's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress. The Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio provides insights into a company's capability to reinvest its profits or manage debt. Evaluating Newmont's historical data, 2021: 0.10; 2022: 0.08; 2023: 0.02, we observe a declining trend in this ratio. This downward movement indicates Newmont's diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt, consequently exerting a negative impact on its Z-Score.The EBIT to Total Assets ratio serves as a crucial barometer of a company's operational effectiveness, correlating earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to total assets. An analysis of Newmont's EBIT to Total Assets ratio from historical data (2021: 0.09; 2022: 0.02; 2023: 0.00) indicates a descending trend. This reduction suggests that Newmont might not be utilizing its assets to their full potential to generate operational profits, which could be negatively affecting the company's overall Z-score.ConclusionIn conclusion, despite Newmont's seemingly attractive valuation, the company's low Altman Z-Score and declining financial ratios suggest that it might be a potential value trap. Therefore, investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough due diligence before making an investment decision.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the following Screener: Walter Schloss Screen .This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Most of the motor fuels that come from Valero’s Corpus Christi refinery come from the West Plant, which plant processes both sweet crude and sour crude, as well as residual fuel oil, according to Valero’s website.The East and West refineries produce gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, asphalt, and aromatics.Distillate inventories in the United States have long languished well below what is typical for this time of year. At last EIA count, distillate inventories in the United States were 13% below the five-year average.News of the shutdown comes as Russia, the world’s top seaborne diesel exporter, lifted its ban on pipeline diesel imports after just a week. The ban lifted the price of crude oil most suitable for making diesel and jet fuel, sending prices for this feedstock upward.Valero’s West plant receives some of its feedstock by tanker or barge via deepwater docking facilities along the Corpus Christi Ship Channel, while West Texas or South Texas crude oil comes into the refinery via pipeline, Valero’s website explains.The West plant was commissioned in 1983, then known as the Bill Greehey refinery.

This company, which is in the Zacks Medical - Drugs industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.When looking at the last two reports, this animal health company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 4.98%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the last reported quarter, Zoetis came out with earnings of $1.41 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.32 per share, representing a surprise of 6.82%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.27 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.31 per share, delivering a surprise of 3.15%.For Zoetis, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Zoetis currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.09%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on November 2, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

In an era where environmental consciousness and technological advances are continuously converging, electric cars are becoming a desirable option for families across the world striving to make eco-friendly choices without compromising their daily convenience. And yet, the paradigm shift can seem overwhelming.We connected with Danita Park, Director of EV and Commercial Development at NRG, to learn more about this transition. What did we learn? Myths and misconceptions about electric vehicles (EVs) abound, and deciphering the truth about them isn't always easy.The reality is, EVs offer both substantial environmental benefits and unexpected advantages for families.1. Cost savings that matterFinancial planning plays a pivotal role in decision-making for families, and electric cars, trucks, and SUVs offer a compelling advantage. While the purchase cost of electric vehicles might be slightly higher than their gasoline counterparts, new incentives to make the switch, coupled with the long-term savings, are remarkable. Individuals with a qualifying adjusted gross income may be eligible for a tax credit of up to $7,500 for new EVs and hybrids, and up to $4,000 for used ones. You can learn more about the eligibility requirements at fueleconomy.gov.What about electricity costs? A 2020 Consumer Reports study showed that EV drivers spend an average of 60% less each year on fuel costs than gas-powered cars drivers.1 In terms of energy consumption, ""Electric vehicles are orders of magnitude more efficient,"" noted Park. EVs convert over 77% of the electrical energy they tap from the grid to power at the wheels. Conventional gasoline vehicles only convert about 12%-30% of the energy stored in gasoline to power at the wheels.2 Both internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and EVs range in efficiency, and a family's annual savings will depend on gasoline and electricity rates in their area.Story continuesMoreover, maintenance costs are substantially reduced as electric cars have fewer moving parts that can wear out over time. Families can bid farewell to oil changes, exhaust system repairs, and other costly maintenance procedures. This results in considerable savings over the lifespan of the vehicle, providing families with the ability to allocate money to other essential needs.2. Cancel carbon pollutionFor families concerned about their carbon footprint, EVs provide a solution they can take pride in. With zero tailpipe emissions, EVs contribute to cleaner air and a healthier environment. This is especially true, said Park, if the electricity you use to charge your vehicle is produced from renewable resources. By adopting electric cars, families play an active role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.3. Comfort meets technologyParents everywhere know that peaceful car rides are a rare gem, especially during family road trips and commutes. Electric cars provide an unexpected serene driving experience. The absence of a noisy internal combustion engine results in remarkably quiet rides, allowing families to hear one another (or hear the music you're jamming out to) more easily.Additionally, electric vehicles often offer smooth acceleration and more space (goodbye engine under the hood - hello frunk!).And as Park put it, ""EVs are more similar to an iPhone than to a petrol car."" This allows drivers to customize things they wouldn't ordinarily be able to, like their braking and driving experience. The payoff? A more comfortable and enjoyable ride for passengers, especially the littles who may be more prone to sensitivity when it comes to abrupt movements.4. Safety prioritizedSafety is a top concern for families, and electric cars definitely deliver on this front. EVs are engineered with a lower center of gravity due to the location of their heavy batteries. This enhances stability and reduces the risk of rollovers.What about fires? Studies in the U.S. and abroad have shown that EVs have a lower risk of fire compared to petrol cars.3 They undergo rigorous safety testing and have multiple layers of protection, such as thermal management systems and fire-resistant materials. While fires involving any vehicle can occur due to various reasons, it's important to note that modern EVs are engineered to minimize fire risks and protect occupants.Moreover, electric cars are designed with advanced safety features and cutting-edge technology, including collision avoidance systems, automatic emergency braking, and adaptive cruise control. These are just some of the tech enhancements that provide an added layer of protection, giving families more peace of mind when they hit the road.5. Plug in to convenienceContrary to common misconceptions, charging electric cars can be convenient for families. The ability to charge at home means no more trips to the gas station to fill up. With fast home charging stations, families can effortlessly charge their EVs overnight, ensuring a full battery each morning.Park also pointed out that the average driver in the U.S. only drives about 37 miles per day. A full charge in most EVs on the market today can get you well over 300 miles of travel distance; so anyone who drives the average daily amount would only need to charge their vehicle once per week. This level of convenience is game-changing, especially for parents juggling busy schedules.With the convenience of charging at home or work, many EV drivers find that they only occasionally charge on the go. The growing network of public charging outlets (currently over 138K in the U.S.4) offers families the flexibility to power up as needed during outings, turning recharging into an opportunity to explore and take a break.So, what's the truth about EVs? Electric cars aren't just vehicles; they're leading a true paradigm shift toward sustainable, family-friendly transportation. These benefits underscore the fact that EVs are not only relevant, but exceptionally advantageous for families. As we collectively navigate the road to a greener future, families have the opportunity to embrace electric cars as a practical, eco-conscious choice that seamlessly aligns with their values and needs.Unlock the Power4 Fascinating Facts About Electric Cars for Kids!Electric vehicles aren't new. In fact, in 1897 (that's 126 years ago), an electric vehicle named the Columbia Motor Carriage became the best-selling car in the U.S. This OG EV could travel 15 miles per hour, which is about the same speed as a bull.Electric vehicles are heavy. EV cars are heavy, partly due to their large batteries. The average weight of an EV battery is 1,000 lbs. That's about as heavy as a polar bear, a Grand Piano, or 1,600 cans of soupHow far an EV can travel? The first electric vehicles could only travel about 30 miles before needing to recharge. Modern EVs can travel as much as 500 miles! That means you could drive from Houston all the way to Disney World and only have to charge once. (Ummm... I'll be in the car.)Blast off!

Better yet, you'd like to see the share price move up more than the market average. But Patterson Companies, Inc. (NASDAQ:PDCO) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 26% over five years, which is below the market return. Looking at the last year alone, the stock is up 13%.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. Check out our latest analysis for Patterson Companies To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During the last half decade, Patterson Companies became profitable. That's generally thought to be a genuine positive, so we would expect to see an increasing share price.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Patterson Companies has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Patterson Companies, it has a TSR of 53% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Patterson Companies shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 18% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 9% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Patterson Companies better, we need to consider many other factors.

And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. For example, the Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) share price is up 60% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 50% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 5.5% , including dividends .In light of the stock dropping 3.9% in the past week, we want to investigate the longer term story, and see if fundamentals have been the driver of the company's positive five-year return. See our latest analysis for Masco To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Masco managed to grow its earnings per share at 14% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 10% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. This free interactive report on Masco's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Masco, it has a TSR of 73% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveMasco shareholders are up 5.5% for the year (even including dividends). But that was short of the market average. It's probably a good sign that the company has an even better long term track record, having provided shareholders with an annual TSR of 12% over five years. It may well be that this is a business worth popping on the watching, given the continuing positive reception, over time, from the market. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Masco better, we need to consider many other factors.

126,9ff32762-af11-3a8e-a8b7-c4715cab0b50,EXPE,2023-10-07,Expedia CEO says customers claim to be worried about climate change. But he isn’t seeing changes in their travel behavior,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/expedia-ceo-says-customers-claim-131237894.html,1696597957,STORY,['EXPE'],"[Expedia CEO Peter Kern has led the online travel agency for three years, from its pandemic nadir to the post-COVID surge in travel. With that experience, one trend he says he doesn't see changing anytime soon is people traveling like there's no tomorrow. What's more, he says, people talk a good talk about climate change angst but are not modifying their behavior much.Kern, a private equity executive and Expedia board director, took the helm of the company in April 2020 at the depths of the travel industry's woes, filling a corner office that had sat empty for months. While the travel industry has largely worked through the pent-up demand sparked by two years of limited travel in 2020 and 2021, Kern says the sector is still booming. Indeed, in its most recent quarter, Expedia's revenue rose 6%, helped in part by a 9% increase in hotel bookings. Last year, Expedia's revenue at $11.7 billion was more than double 2020's. Still, his prediction that this growth will last could be wishful thinking given that millions of Americans will have to resume paying down student loans this month, and inflation could curb their discretionary spending, including travel.""Humans feel a great compulsion to travel and experience things they derive joy from and be together,"" he tells Fortune. At the same time, they're putting aside any worries about travel's environmental impact, Kern notes, as evidenced by their choice when offered a chance to buy a plane ticket with a carbon offset at a higher price. ""They'll choose the cheaper [option] the overwhelming majority of the time.""This interview was edited and condensed for clarity.Fortune: With airfares and hotel rates now much higher, are we heading back to an era where leisure travel was mostly limited to the well-heeled? I don't think so. Post-COVID, there has been a general rise in inflation. But the nice thing about travel is that you usually can find something at every price point. If you're used to a specific chain or hotel and don't like their prices anymore, there is always another brand to fill in that void, or independents or rentals. But we are getting past those waves of Americans rushing to Europe and returning to something normal-ish.Story continuesWhat is the argument for booking an airfare on Expedia when someone can book one directly with the airlines, particularly if that person participates in a loyalty program?You can shop everything in one place, compare prices, track prices. If you book with us, you get points with us and the airline, so you're not giving anything up. It's true that if you're a super dedicated airline loyalty member, you can always get to the front of the line and that special phone number, but for everybody else, you can book your whole trip, with hotels and car with us. And if there are cancellations, we can do the rebooking for all parts of the trip, so it's better to fix the itinerary in one place than in six.What about hotels? Last year, I interviewed Hilton CEO Chris Nassetta, and he was a bit surprised when I told him I don't book hotels directly with the chain and instead book on an aggregator site. He said I was missing out on a lot of benefits.Most people don't have absolute loyalty to one chain or one group of chains. Our view is that we reward whatever you want to do. I like boutique hotels and, no offense to Chris, but I don't stay in his hotels very often, and I don't stay at Marriotts very often. Unless you are really dedicated and travel a lot with one company, it's hard to earn enough status to get a real reward. I'd tell Chris, ""We bring you a sampling. People will choose one of his properties on our site, and you have one shot on goal to really impress them.""You recently overhauled your loyalty program to create a dollar-value reward, which can be used on anything, rather than the free nights offered on hotels.com. Why? I liked getting free nights.Many people could never earn a free night, so we wanted more benefits for more people and for it to be super flexible so that people could use it across any of our products. Our research shows that 80% of people never earn much in loyalty programs, so we wanted to give them something, whether they spend $50,000 a year traveling or $500.There are new crackdowns on Airbnb listings. One in New York requires some hosts to register with the city. Does that help your business by sending more people to hotels, or does it mean they travel less? What's the net-net for Expedia?In the case of New York, it will probably mean somewhat more hotel bookings, but I think there is plenty of hotel supply in most major cities to accommodate whatever demand there is. I don't think people say, ""If I can't get an Airbnb, I'm not going to New York.""Any worries that people are starting to equate travel with climate change, leading them to curb travel?I don't. So far, consumers have not changed their habits materially in their shopping and travel. For instance, if you give a customer the option of a flight that is slightly greener than another one that costs $50 less, they'll choose the cheaper one the overwhelming majority of the time. It's not necessarily a great statement on society. We are seeing airlines test more efficient fuel and planes, and people are adopting electric cars. But I think it will take a general societal change.

It is worth considering Lockheed Martin (LMT), which belongs to the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry.When looking at the last two reports, this aerospace and defense company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 5.30%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the most recent quarter, Lockheed was expected to post earnings of $6.43 per share, but it reported $6.73 per share instead, representing a surprise of 4.67%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $6.07 per share, while it actually produced $6.43 per share, a surprise of 5.93%.For Lockheed, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Lockheed currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.15%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on October 17, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin Step By Step Through The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.44bUS$6.45bUS$6.85bUS$7.19bUS$7.43bUS$7.66bUS$7.87bUS$8.07bUS$8.27bUS$8.46bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x12Analyst x9Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 3.39%Est @ 3.02%Est @ 2.76%Est @ 2.58%Est @ 2.45%Est @ 2.36% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.4% US$6.1kUS$5.7kUS$5.7kUS$5.6kUS$5.5kUS$5.3kUS$5.1kUS$4.9kUS$4.7kUS$4.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$53bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$8.5b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.4%– 2.2%) = US$205bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$205b÷ ( 1 + 6.4%)10= US$110bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$163b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$397, the company appears quite undervalued at a 39% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Lockheed Martin as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.845. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Lockheed MartinStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Aerospace &amp; Defense market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

For more recession-resilient stocks, head over to 5 Best Stocks to Buy in Falling Markets.Recessions are inevitable and the market has been forecasting a recession in the near future for quite some time. The reason is that since July last year, the yield curve has been inverted, which has often been a signal that recession may be on the horizon. When economic downturns hit, people always tend to invest in safe stocks which may offer them reasonable returns during higher uncertainties. Thus healthcare and consumer staple shares are mostly preferred in those situations when macroeconomic headwinds are high.Companies in the consumer staples are the ones that mostly produce and sell consumer necessity goods. Those goods are bought easily even during recessions because when economic challenges skyrocket, people opt for necessities rather than luxuries. According to The Wall Street Journal, consumer staple stocks are a “bright spot in bleak market”.“Consumer-staples companies are commonly regarded as a haven during volatile markets and recessionary periods,” the WSJ added.Consumers cannot stop buying medicines, prescription drugs or basic household products even when recessions hit, Morningstar analyst Amy Arnott wrote.According to Arnott, healthcare and consumer staple stocks are the most “resilient performers” during economic downturns.Opportunities lie ahead for consumer staple companies as they will maintain their performance and have organic sales growth despite economic downturns this year and into 2024, analyst Amber Kanwar said in an interview on BNN Bloomberg.In the near future, consumer staples will be an important part of stock portfolios as there will be a major focus on low-end consumers, Mona Mahajan, a senior investment strategist at Edward Jones said.Considering recession is imminent and inevitable, according to many analysts, we decided to take a look at some of the best stocks to buy in falling markets which include General Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS), Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and others.Story continuesOur Methodology:We chose stocks from the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund because historically consumer staple companies have performed well in times of economic downturns. In this article, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund has been selected which holds 39 companies in the consumer services industry. The stocks held under this ETF are expected to offer earnings per share growth of 7.61% in the next three to five years. The price/book ratio for this ETF stands at 4.58 for the last year which demonstrates that stocks are trading at premium prices, while the price/earnings ratio for this ETF is at 18.94. The price/earnings ratio compares a company’s share price to its yearly net profits. Anything below 20 would be considered a good price-to-earnings ratio.

Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), which belongs to the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This world's biggest maker of health care products has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 7.03%.For the last reported quarter, Johnson &amp; Johnson came out with earnings of $2.80 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.61 per share, representing a surprise of 7.28%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $2.51 per share and it actually produced earnings of $2.68 per share, delivering a surprise of 6.77%.For Johnson &amp; Johnson, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Johnson &amp; Johnson currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.20%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on October 17, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber What's The Estimated Valuation?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$90.7mUS$185.2mUS$268.1mUS$353.9mUS$435.5mUS$508.6mUS$571.5mUS$624.8mUS$669.6mUS$707.5mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 44.79%Est @ 32.00%Est @ 23.04%Est @ 16.77%Est @ 12.39%Est @ 9.32%Est @ 7.17%Est @ 5.66% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 12% US$80.9US$147US$190US$224US$245US$256US$256US$250US$239US$225(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$2.1bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 12%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$707m× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (12%– 2.2%) = US$7.2bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$7.2b÷ ( 1 + 12%)10= US$2.3bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$4.4b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$11.6, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 26% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 12%, which is based on a levered beta of 2.000. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Goodyear Tire &amp; RubberStrengthNo major strengths identified for GT.WeaknessInterest payments on debt are not well covered.OpportunityExpected to breakeven next year.Has sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years based on current free cash flows.Good value based on P/S ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

The safety profile of the drug was consistent with previously-reported studies.Management will continue to evaluate the study for its other dual primary endpoint of overall survival (“OS”).Per the American Cancer Society, UC is the most common type of bladder cancer. Management estimates that around half of bladder cancer patients who undergo surgery experience disease recurrence within a year of surgery. By adding Keytruda as an adjuvant therapy, patients with localized MIUC or locally-advanced UC can have a new treatment option as the drug has the potential to prevent recurrence after surgery.Merck’s shares have lost 6.6% year to date against the industry’s 3.8% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchKeytruda is approved by the FDA for three indications in UC. In April, Keytruda plus Seagen’s SGEN Padcev (enfortumab vedotin) was approved under the accelerated pathway as a first-line treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC who are ineligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy.Last month, Merck and Seagen reported positive top-line results from a late-stage study (KEYNOTE-A39/EV-302) on the Keytruda-Padcev combination to treat adult patients with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer (la/mUC). Conducted in partnership with Seagen, the study achieved its co-primary endpoints of OS and progression-free survival (“PFS”). The Merck/Seagen conducted study intends to serve as a confirmatory study seeking to convert the accelerated approval to a full one.Story continuesKeytruda, an anti-PD-1 therapy, is Merck’s blockbuster oncology drug and is approved for several types of cancer, accounting alone for around 40% of MRK’s pharmaceutical sales. Keytruda is presently approved to treat seven indications in earlier-stage cancers in the United States. Merck’s Keytruda is continuously growing and expanding into new indications and markets globally.Keytruda, the key revenue generator for Merck, is already approved for treating many cancers globally. In the first half of 2023, Merck recorded $12.1 billion in sales from Keytruda, up 20% year over year. Drug sales are gaining from continued strong momentum in metastatic indications and rapid uptake across recent earlier-stage launches. Keytruda is continuously growing and expanding into new indications and markets globally.Merck is evaluating Keytruda across many indications that are progressing well. Keytruda is being studied for more than 30 types of cancer indications in more than 1600 studies, including combination studies.

Management’s decision also reflects the company’s environment-friendly stance as the usage of these jets would lower carbon emission. Deliveries of the ordered jets are scheduled to begin in 2028.This is the second large order to be placed by UAL in less than a year. The new order builds on early success of United Next strategy and includes 50 Boeing 787-9 and 60 A321neo aircraft. More specifically, management announced that it will convert previous options and purchase rights into firm orders for 50 Boeing 787-9s (slated for delivery in the 2028-2031 time frame) and 60 Airbus A321neos (scheduled for delivery in the 2028-2030 time frame).The newly ordered jets boast all amenities and are likely to enhance the air travel experience of passengers, once operational. These are also in-sync with UAL’s environment-friendly approach by virtue of less carbon emissions. According to Boeing, the usage of 787 Dreamliner reduces fuel emissions per seat by up to 25 % than the aircraft it replaces. Per Airbus, usage of A321neos lead to a 50% noise decrease, and more than 20% fuel savings and CO2 reduction compared with previous generation single-aisle planes.United Airlines anticipates that by 2030, 75% of its fleet will be new generational. UAL has also secured options for up to 50 more Boeing 787s in addition to purchase rights for 40 more A321neo aircraft at the end of the decade.The fleet-expansion strategy is likely to widen UAL’s international network. This is very prudent given the fact that international travel has come roaring back from the pandemic lows. As part of its fleet-expansion strategy, UAL aims to take delivery of approximately 800 new narrowbody and widebody aircraft in the 2023-2032 period.In 2019, UAL averaged 104 seats per North American departure. The figure is expected to increase by more than 40% and exceed 145 by 2027.Story continuesUAL, the largest carrier across the Atlantic and Pacific, currently has 150 Boeing 787s on firm order.

""It's exciting to see each new landmark in the Integrated Effects Test, as it helps our nation rebuild lost molten salt reactor knowledge.""Since installation of the IET at TerraPower's laboratory in Everett, Washington, the project team has completed mechanical, electrical and controls verification and commissioned all systems. Commissioning employed hot argon and chloride salts to confirm readiness, including filling and flushing of drain tanks and verifying operation of freeze valves - a unique and important component for salt systems. Chloride salt has now been loaded into the primary coolant salt loops and pumped-salt operations have begun. A multi-month test campaign will provide valuable salt operations data and know-how for the MCFR program.""The Molten Chloride Fast Reactor has the potential to meet the carbon-free needs of hard-to-decarbonize industrial sectors including and beyond electricity. The Integrated Effects Test will help us gather and evaluate data to support the development of our technology, and we are excited to launch pumped-salt operations,"" said Jeff Latkowski, senior vice president for the Molten Chloride Fast Reactor.Story continuesIntegrated Effects TestThe IET is a nonnuclear, externally heated, up to 1-megawatt multiloop system - the world's largest chloride salt system developed by the nuclear sector - and culminates years of separate effects testing. The project was initiated by Southern Company and TerraPower under the U.S. Department of Energy Advanced Reactor Concepts (ARC-15) award, a multiyear effort to promote the design, construction and operation of Generation-IV nuclear reactors. The project team also includes CORE POWER, EPRI, Idaho National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Vanderbilt University.The next generation of nuclear reactors promise the same stable value to customers that is derived from the current operating nuclear fleet, can complement intermittent renewable resources on the grid, and hold the potential to provide zero-carbon, high-grade process heat and thermal storage for energy-intensive industrial markets and ocean transportation sectors that currently rely on fossil fuels.""The startup of the Integrated Effects Test is a milestone achievement in the development of the first fast-spectrum molten salt reactor, and we are immensely proud to contribute to its success,"" said Mikal Bøe, president and CEO of CORE POWER. ""The Integrated Effects Test allows us to collect that crucial last-mile data for a design and build of the Molten Chloride Fast Reactor and takes the team one step closer to a genuinely unique way to do new nuclear that is appropriate for the commercial marine environment.""The IET will inform the design, licensing and operation of an approximately 180-megawatt MCFR demonstration planned for the early 2030s time frame.About Southern CompanySouthern Company (NYSE: SO) is a leading energy provider serving 9 million customers across the Southeast and beyond through its family of companies.

149,61e4ac19-6e1e-3fef-8351-ec24748bbeaf,SO,2023-10-07,4 Stocks to Buy From the Promising Electric Power Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-buy-promising-electric-140700649.html,1696601220,STORY,"['VST', 'SO', 'PNW', '^GSPC', 'PCG']","[Zacks Utility – Electric Power industry stocks have been transitioning toward clean sources of fuel and focusing on lower carbon emissions. The introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act 2022 will support the industry’s transition toward clean energy sources to produce electricity. Utilities are also focused on strengthening the grid as well as transmission and distribution infrastructure. The huge infrastructure of the utilities faces the impact of the hurricane season each year. Infrastructure enhancement around the year increases the resilience of the entire system, reduces outages and allows operators to restore power quickly for customers affected by storms.The Southern Company SO, with its expanding clean power generation portfolio and expanding customer base, renewable operations and well-chalked-out capital investments to strengthen infrastructure, offers an excellent opportunity to stay invested in the utility space. Other utilities worth adding to your portfolio are PG&amp; E Corporation PCG, Vistra Corp. VST and Pinnacle West Capital Corporation PNW.About the IndustryThe Utility – Electric Power industry involves the generation, transmission, distribution, storage and sale of electricity to customers. A substantial portion of utilities’ earnings is generated from regulated operations. Unless there is any major weather variation, demand for the services provided by utilities remains  steady, regardless of economic cycles. Per an EIA report, high temperatures during the third quarter are likely to have increased generation by 2% year over year. A clear transition is evident in this industry, with more companies declaring zero-emission goals. Research and development over the years have resulted in a substantial decline in the cost of setting up utility-scale renewable power projects, aiding in reducing emissions. However, the ongoing increase in interest rates is a concern for capital-intensive utilities.Story continues3 Electric Power Industry Trends to Watch Out ForTransition Toward Cleaner Sources to Generate Power:  The operators in the U.S. electric power sector are gradually moving toward cleaner sources of energy. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the annual share of U.S. electricity generation from renewable energy sources will rise from 22% in 2022 to 25% in 2024, as a result of the continuing addition of solar and wind-generating capacity. The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will support and accelerate the utilities’ transition toward clean energy sources. IRA has removed the uncertainties relating to federal incentives provided for renewable sources usage. The act entails an opportunity for a wide range of low-cost clean energy solutions in a predictable way for a long time and will create earnings visibility. Courtesy of IRA, the utility operators are planning to add more renewable assets to their generation portfolio and shut down old polluting units.Demand for Electricity Stable: Per EIA, electricity demand in the United States can drop 1.3% year over year in 2023 but increase 1.7% in 2024. The drop in demand in 2023 was primarily due to milder temperatures in the first half of the year. Despite the expected drop in usage, utilities will continue to benefit from the rise in residential electricity rates. EIA forecasts the average price of electricity to U.S. residential customers to increase by 4% in 2023 to 15.7 cents/kWh.Ongoing Interest Rate Increase is a Concern: Utilities, in order to maintain, upgrade and expand operations, approach capital markets for loans. The utilities have been enjoying near-zero interest rates for the past few years. But multiple rate hikes in 2022 pushed up interest rates. The Federal Reserve decided not to increase interest rate in its September meeting. The benchmark rate is high, in the 5.25-5.50% range, after a 25 bps hike in July. Fed officials are contemplating increasing rates once more in 2023. The increasing interest rates are a concern for capital-intensive utilities in the United States as these will push up capital servicing costs substantially from the current levels. Utilities might try to pass on the burden of increasing borrowing costs to customers but the necessary increase in rates might not be approved by the commission. In such a scenario, utilities will need to digest the extra expenses, which can lower their profitability and make them less attractive to investors interested in the utility space.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates strong near-term prospects.

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 90% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Cigna Group. See our latest analysis for Cigna Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Cigna Group?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Cigna Group. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Cigna Group, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Cigna Group is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that BlackRock, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.5% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.4% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.7% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 16 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Cigna GroupThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of The Cigna Group. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$328m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 10% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Cigna Group. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

(NYSE:TEL)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-opportunity-te-connectivity-ltd-185915806.html,1696618755,STORY,['TEL'],"[Let's talk about the popular TE Connectivity Ltd. (NYSE:TEL). The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$144 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$120. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether TE Connectivity's current trading price of US$121 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at TE Connectivity’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for TE Connectivity What Is TE Connectivity Worth?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 11% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy TE Connectivity today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $136.53, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since TE Connectivity’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What kind of growth will TE Connectivity generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 29% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for TE Connectivity. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? TEL’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on TEL, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Diving deeper into the forecasts for TE Connectivity mentioned earlier will help you understand how analysts view the stock going forward.

Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports on Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser's plans to implement layoffs and the challenges putting a squeeze on the banking sector.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptJOSH LIPTON: Banks are gearing up to report their third quarter results later this month. The sector is feeling the heat as it faces the likelihood of higher for longer rates and keeping an eye out for potential recession. But some of the biggest banks are dealing with problems of a different sort, namely whether they can change. Here to break it down for us is Yahoo Finance's own David Hollerith. David.DAVID HOLLERITH: Josh, so a couple of the country's largest banks are somewhere in the process of attempting these really big corporate shifts. And that's being led by their CEOs. Now, along with the possibility of higher interest rates for a longer period of time, this just adds an extra layer of complexity they've got to deal with when they do earnings. So Jane Frazier is attempting to eliminate middle managers at Citigroup, the country's third largest banks.And this is sort of seen as an effort to revive the bank's stock price, which has lagged peers. And Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon is trying to trim up the banks operations as it pulls out of consumer lending and focuses more on its core business of dealmaking. And CEO Charles Scharf, who is trying is trying to pull Wells Fargo back into a system of compliance and risk controls that regulators have approved by, but its legal troubles kind of keep resurfacing.So on Citi, you know, we're not expecting any tangible numbers about the layoffs. But we do want some kind of update this huge reorganization, as she's described, it is still a bit murky. On Goldman Sachs, Solomon is lucky in that. We have seen a bit of a resurgence in the IPO market, but he's been the first to admit that the M&amp;A market is going to take until next year to sort of reach normal levels again. He's also mentioned that there are some commercial real estate impairments that Goldman is going to probably take this quarter.And then finally, on Wells Fargo, it's still paying fines for consumer and investor violations. And the big thing here is in 2016, they had a fake accounts scandal that's kind of still been resurfacing. They've spent about $13 billion paying fines to regulators since then. And about 235 million of that has come in August. And we're expecting Scharf to touch on that and obviously some kind of progress to getting regulators approval. The bank is not allowed to grow. And that's according to the Fed, which was instated in 2018, this rule they cannot expand at all.JULIE HYMAN: All right. David, thank you so much. Dave Hollerith, appreciate you running us through what to expect on the management front for many of these banks.]"
161,8b6a0ca8-8aae-3b44-ad89-c8e6d9717a0a,WFC,2023-10-07,Wells Fargo (WFC) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q3 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wells-fargo-wfc-expected-beat-140006890.html,1696600806,STORY,['WFC'],"[Wells Fargo (WFC) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 13, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis biggest U.S. mortgage lender is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.23 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -5.4%.Revenues are expected to be $20.2 billion, up 3.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.11% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Wells Fargo?For Wells Fargo, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +5.63%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Wells Fargo will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Wells Fargo would post earnings of $1.15 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.25, delivering a surprise of +8.70%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Wells Fargo appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. For example, Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) shareholders have seen the share price rise 55% over three years, well in excess of the market return (15%, not including dividends).While this past week has detracted from the company's three-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment. View our latest analysis for Wells Fargo In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Wells Fargo was able to grow its EPS at 85% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. The average annual share price increase of 16% is actually lower than the EPS growth. Therefore, it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth, somewhat. We'd venture the lowish P/E ratio of 9.54 also reflects the negative sentiment around the stock.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how Wells Fargo has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on how its financial position has changed over time.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Wells Fargo's TSR for the last 3 years was 65%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveInvestors in Wells Fargo had a tough year, with a total loss of 4.3% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 13%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 2% per year over five years. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

Based on insights drawn from IBM Cybersecurity clients worldwide, it enables businesses to upgrade their security infrastructure with evolving IT requirements.Enterprises worldwide are witnessing a surge in cyber-attacks. Cyber criminals are adopting faster and more sophisticated ways to breach security measures. As the pace of digital transformation accelerates and business operations become more complex, security teams find themselves overwhelmed by the growing number of vulnerabilities.Many organizations also lack the necessary resources to deploy sophisticated tools to address these concerns, resulting in inefficiencies and low system visibility, ultimately leading to alert fatigue.The crowdsourced detection rules and optimized alerts feature utilizes real-time insights to distinguish between low-priority and high-priority alerts. Its AI-driven detection capability automatically escalates critical alerts to security teams and enables quick remediation of common low-value alerts. Along with improved precision, IBM’s security solution also provides investigation context and the reasoning behind the escalation. Its advanced threat disposition system offers insights into the status of the attacker, the activity of the past 24 hours and historical analysis of the past year.Complete replacement of existing security tools to align with the evolving threat landscape demands significant resources. It is often not feasible for companies to abandon their prior investments in the Security Operations Center (SOC) infrastructure. Moreover, skill shortage is also an issue.IBM TDR services address these concerns while protecting enterprises’ prior SOC investments. Its open API approach facilitates seamless integration with clients’ existing security tools across IT operations.IBM Security collects and analyses relevant data from multiple sources and offers a comprehensive understanding through a unified console. It enriches analysts with various KPIs that ensure greater visibility and expedite response times.

Others, not so much.",TechCrunch,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/6793c470-34f1-331e-9e24-eea50981a31a/some-gen-ai-vendors-say.html,1696605677,STORY,"['MSFT', 'AMZN', 'GOOGL', 'IBM']","[A person using generative AI -- models that generate text, images, music and more given a prompt -- could infringe on someone else's copyright through no fault of their own. But who's on the hook for the legal fees and damages if -- or rather, when -- that happens?It depends.In the fast-changing landscape of generative AI, companies monetizing the tech -- from startups to big tech companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft -- are approaching IP risks from very different angles.Some vendors have pledged to defend, financially and otherwise, customers using their generative AI tools who end up on the wrong side of copyright litigation. Others have published policies to shield themselves from liability, leaving customers to foot the legal bills.While the terms of service agreements for most generative AI tools are public, they're written in legalese. Seeking some clarity, I reached out to vendors about their policies on protecting customers who might violate copyright with their AI-generated text, images, videos and music.The responses -- and non-responses -- were enlightening.Regurgitating dataGenerative AI models ""learn"" from examples to craft essays and code, create artwork and compose music -- and even write lyrics to accompany that music. They're trained on millions to billions of e-books, art pieces, emails, songs, audio clips, voice recordings and more, most of which came from public websites.Some of these examples are in the public domain -- at least in the case of vendors that trawl the web for training data. Others aren't, or come under a restrictive license that requires citation or specific forms of compensation.The legality of vendors training on data without permission is another matter that's being hashed out in the courts. But what might possibly land generative AI users in trouble is regurgitation, or when a generative model spits out a mirror copy of a training example.Story continuesOn the top are images generated by Stable Diffusion from random captions in the model’s training set. On the bottom are images that the researchers prompted to match the originals.On the top are images generated by Stable Diffusion, an image-generating AI, from random captions in the model’s training set. On the bottom are images prompted to match the originals. Image Credits: Somepalli et al.Microsoft, GitHub and OpenAI are currently being sued in a class action motion that accuses them of violating copyright law by allowing Copilot, a code-generating AI, to regurgitate licensed code snippets without providing credit. Elsewhere, thousands of writers have signed an open letter decrying generative AI technologies that ""mimic and regurgitate"" their ""language, stories, style and ideas.""The cases keep coming.Authors in California and New York have sued OpenAI for alleged IP theft of their works. Image-generating tool vendors, including Stability AI and Midjourney, are the subject of lawsuits brought by artists and stock image sites like Getty Images. And Universal Music Group is seeking to ban AI-generated music mimicking the style of musicians it represents from streaming platforms, sending takedown notices to have the songs removed.Perhaps it's no surprise, then, that in a recent survey of Fortune 500 companies by Acrolinx, nearly a third said that intellectual property was their biggest concern about the use of generative AI.The threat of running afoul of copyright with a generative AI tool hasn't stopped investors from pouring billions into the startups creating those tools. One wonders, however, whether the situation will remain tenable for much longer.A question of indemnityIn the midst of the uncertainty, you might think that generative AI vendors would stand behind their customers in the strongest terms -- if for no other reason than to their allay their fears of IP-related legal challenges.But you'd be wrong.From the language in some terms of service agreements -- specifically the indemnity clauses, or the clauses that specify in which cases customers can expect to be reimbursed for damages from third-party claims -- it's clear that not every vendor's willing to chance a court decision forcing them to rethink their approach to generative model training, or in the worst case their business model.Anthropic, for instance, which recently inked a deal with Amazon to raise as much as $4 billion and is reportedly seeking another $2 billion investment from Google and others, reserves the right to ""hold harmless"" itself and partners from damages arising from the use of its generative AI -- including those related to IP.Point blank, I asked Anthropic, which offers strictly text-generating models, whether it would legally or financially support a customer implicated in a copyright lawsuit over its models' outputs. The company declined to say.AI21 Labs, another well-funded generative AI startup building a suite of text editing tools, also declined to give an answer. So I looked at its policy.A21 Labs says that it might ""assume exclusive defense and control"" of a lawsuit against a customer if the customer chooses not to defend or settle it themselves. But it won't pay for the privilege; it'll be at the customer's own expense.OpenAI -- arguably the most successful generative AI vendor today, with over $10 billion in venture capital and revenue approaching $1 billion -- pointed me to its terms of use, which limit the company's liability to ""the amount [a customer] paid for [an OpenAI] service that gave rise to [a] claim during the 12 months before the the liability arose or $100."" That's the best-case scenario for customers; OpenAI's policy makes it clear that the company, in many if not most cases, won't be a party to or defend against copyright lawsuits targeting its users.Vendors building image- and video-generating AI, where the potential copyright violations tend to be a bit more obvious, aren't much more supportive contractually than their text-first rivals.Stability AI, which develops music-generating models in addition to image- and text-generating ones, referred me to the terms for its API. The company leaves it to customers to defend themselves against copyright claims and -- unlike some other generative AI vendors -- has no payout carve-out in the event that it's found liable.Midjourney and Runway.ai didn't respond to my emails -- but I found their terms. Midjourney's policy releases the company from liability for third-party IP damages. Runway.ai's does, as well.Fine printNow, some vendors -- perhaps becoming more attuned to the concerns of enterprise customers considering adopting generative AI, or looking to position themselves as a ""safer"" alternative -- aren't shying away from committing to protecting customers in the event that they're sued for copyright infringement. To a point.Amazon, which recently launched a platform for running and fine-tuning generative AI models, called Bedrock, says that it'll indemnify (i.e. defend) customers against claims alleging the model infringes on a third-party's IP rights. But Amazon's indemnification policy only applies to the company's in-house family of text-analyzing models, Titan, as well as Amazon's code-generating service, CodeWhisperer.The CodeWhisperer indemnity is broader and applies to all IP claims, including trademarks. However, it requires at least a CodeWhisperer Professional subscription with copyright-defending filtering features enabled. Free users of CodeWhisper aren't afforded the same protections. And customers must agree to let AWS control their defense and settle ""as AWS deems appropriate.""IBM also provides IP indemnity for its generative AI models, Slate and Granite, available through its Watsonx generative AI service.""Consistent with IBM's approach to its indemnification obligation, IBM doesn't cap its indemnification liability for IBM-developed models,"" an IBM spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. ""This applies to current [and] future IBM-developed Watsonx models.""Google wouldn't respond to my emails. But from the company's terms, it'd appear that Google offers some defense for customers against third-party allegations of IP infringement arising from its text- and image-generating models. However, Google says that it might suspend a customer's use of the allegedly infringing model if it can't find ""commercially reasonable"" remedies.Google-backed Cohere, too, has a provision in its terms suggesting that it'll ""defend, indemnify and hold harmless"" customers facing third-party claims alleging that Cohere's models infringe on IP. Given Cohere's heavy enterprise focus, that's not surprising.Microsoft recently made a splashy announcement that it'll pay legal damages on behalf of customers using its AI products if they're sued for copyright infringement -- so long as those customers use ""guardrails and content filters"" built into its products.Which products does it pertain to? That's where it gets tricky.Microsoft says its indemnity policy covers paid versions of its portfolio of AI-powered ""Copilot"" services (including the Microsoft 365 Copilot for Word, Excel and PowerPoint) and Bing Chat Enterprise, the enterprise version of its chatbot on Bing. It also extends to GitHub Copilot, Microsoft's code-generating service co-developed with OpenAI.But in its Azure policy, Microsoft clarifies that customers using ""previews"" of generative AI features powered by its Azure OpenAI Service are responsible for responding to third-party claims of copyright infringement.Kate Downing, an IP lawyer based in Santa Cruz, takes issue specifically with the Copilot indemnity provision, arguing that -- given the vagueness of the provision and its exclusions -- the upfront costs of enforcing might be too high for a business to swallow.By contrast, Adobe claims to offer ""full indemnity"" protection for users of Firefly, its generative AI art platform, asserting its models are trained on stock images for which Adobe already holds the rights. Users must be enterprise customers, however, and are subject to Adobe's same liability cap that applies to other tech-based IP claims.Adobe sometime-rival Shutterstock, as well as Canva, also provides indemnity to all enterprise clients, a policy the company introduced late this summer. So does Getty Images. (Getty Images and Shutterstock, like Adobe, train their models on licensed images.)The road aheadIt seems likely that, as generative AI vendors, particularly startups, face investor pressure to acquire enterprise customers, indemnification protections will become commonplace. Those customers want the assurance that they won't be sued over copyright claims, after all.But if the current state of things is any indication, the policies won't look similar. And some will have exceptions that'll make them more attractive in theory than in practice -- in other words, more marketing ploy than a legitimate protection.As a recent article from U.K. law firm Ferrer &amp; Co. puts it, indemnities don't offer a ""get out of jail free card"" -- nor are they a panacea.""Our key message is, don't see the offering of provider indemnities as a complete answer to the risk of third-party infringement claims,"" the firm writes on its blog. ""Instead, weigh the offering of such indemnities in the balance when determining whether to use that provider’s generative AI tool for a project.""Gen AI customers would do well to remember that.This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/06/some-gen-ai-vendors-say-theyll-defend-customers-from-ip-lawsuits-others-not-so-much/]"
172,2a7cb126-17f2-38ef-a209-c85fcf987d34,IBM,2023-10-07,Here is What to Know Beyond Why International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-international-business-130010278.html,1696597210,STORY,['IBM'],"[IBM (IBM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this technology and consulting company have returned -4.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -5.2% change. The Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, to which IBM belongs, has lost 5.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, IBM is expected to post earnings of $2.13 per share, indicating a change of +17.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.43 points to a change of +3.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.87 indicates a change of +4.7% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for IBM.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For IBM, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.82 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $61.49 billion and $64.21 billion estimates indicate +1.6% and +4.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIBM reported revenues of $15.48 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.4%. EPS of $2.18 for the same period compares with $2.31 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.54 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.42%. The EPS surprise was +9%.Over the last four quarters, IBM surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.IBM is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about IBM. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

UAW president Shawn Fain announced a breakthrough in what he says will dramatically change negotiations. Take a listen.SHAWN FAIN: We were about to shut down GM'S largest moneymaker in Arlington, Texas. The company knew those members were ready to walk immediately. And just that threat has provided a transformative win. GM has now agreed in writing to place their electric battery manufacturing under our national master agreement.JOSH LIPTON: And because of the developments, there is no expansion of the strike this week. Automaker stocks trading near the highs of the day. And joining us now to talk about this is Arun Kumar, AlixPartner's managing director in the automotive and industrial practice. So Arun, let me get your take on the news here. Listen, UAW Shawn Fain, you heard him there saying there's been progress, no new strikes this week. Is this maybe a some ray of hope here, Arun, for getting an actual deal done?Story continuesARUN KUMAR: Thanks, Julie and Josh. Great to be on the show. I agree. I think this is a great development for both the auto OEMs, the automakers, as well as the UAW because it allows towards a path where we can actually get back to doing business, which is to produce cars and sell great vehicles that consumers are looking for, which is in great demand.JULIE HYMAN: I had to laugh-- Josh and I both had to laugh when we saw Shawn Fain's T-shirt that he was wearing as he was making this latest account announcement-- eat the rich. And obviously, his rhetoric has been sort of anti, quote, unquote, ""fat cats"" or what have you at the top of the automakers. You know, there he is.We're showing the picture of him in that shirt again. You know, how does that factor? I know a lot of this is performance, Arun, but how does that factor into how this all gets gamed out when all is said and done?ARUN KUMAR: Well, Julie, at the end of the day, you know, what you say in public is one thing, but what you do in private negotiations is a completely different thing. I think when you look at private negotiations, you're looking at basic facts and data to make decisions. And I think the crux of the matter, if you think about it, is that you know EVs require less labor hours to produce, which means that, you know, the UAW is concerned about how they're going to keep up with that transition to electric vehicles. And you know, the one way of looking at this is if you bring in more manufacturing back into the UAW and into North America, it's going to help them both from producing great vehicles as well as making sure that their labor force is fully participating and is able to earn a living like they've done in the last 30, 40, 50 years.JOSH LIPTON: And I did want to ask you, Arun, there was some news here today. UAW Shawn Fain saying apparently that they did reach a deal with GM to include workers at a new battery joint venture in a new labor contract. What's the significance of that to you, Arun? Is it meaningful?ARUN KUMAR: It's pretty meaningful because when you look at a battery electric vehicle, you know, 30% to 40% of the cost is in batteries, you know, cells, modules, and then you have the entire battery pack that goes into the vehicle. It's like an engine and a transmission in an internal combustion engine. So till now most of those battery production has been with a joint venture with other companies like Korean companies, or some Chinese companies, or we've been importing batteries from China.So I think, you know, having those manufacturing plants into the UAW mix allows expansion of jobs that could have been lost because you have less labor hours required to produce EVs. Now, if you want to make sure that you're not losing more of that, you know, with batteries because if those are outside the master services agreement, as Shawn put it, then you have less and less labor that's required to assemble the rest of the vehicle. So that's been a big concern and a crux that, you know, had to be sorted out. And I think that's a great sign of progress that we have seen with this announcement.]"

Management’s decision also reflects the company’s environment-friendly stance as the usage of these jets would lower carbon emission. Deliveries of the ordered jets are scheduled to begin in 2028.This is the second large order to be placed by UAL in less than a year. The new order builds on early success of United Next strategy and includes 50 Boeing 787-9 and 60 A321neo aircraft. More specifically, management announced that it will convert previous options and purchase rights into firm orders for 50 Boeing 787-9s (slated for delivery in the 2028-2031 time frame) and 60 Airbus A321neos (scheduled for delivery in the 2028-2030 time frame).The newly ordered jets boast all amenities and are likely to enhance the air travel experience of passengers, once operational. These are also in-sync with UAL’s environment-friendly approach by virtue of less carbon emissions. According to Boeing, the usage of 787 Dreamliner reduces fuel emissions per seat by up to 25 % than the aircraft it replaces. Per Airbus, usage of A321neos lead to a 50% noise decrease, and more than 20% fuel savings and CO2 reduction compared with previous generation single-aisle planes.United Airlines anticipates that by 2030, 75% of its fleet will be new generational. UAL has also secured options for up to 50 more Boeing 787s in addition to purchase rights for 40 more A321neo aircraft at the end of the decade.The fleet-expansion strategy is likely to widen UAL’s international network. This is very prudent given the fact that international travel has come roaring back from the pandemic lows. As part of its fleet-expansion strategy, UAL aims to take delivery of approximately 800 new narrowbody and widebody aircraft in the 2023-2032 period.In 2019, UAL averaged 104 seats per North American departure. The figure is expected to increase by more than 40% and exceed 145 by 2027.Story continuesUAL, the largest carrier across the Atlantic and Pacific, currently has 150 Boeing 787s on firm order.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 13. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.20 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -15.3%.Revenues are expected to be $5.33 billion, down 4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.73% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc?For The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.66%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc would post earnings of $3.31 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.36, delivering a surprise of +1.51%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

187,61e4ac19-6e1e-3fef-8351-ec24748bbeaf,PNW,2023-10-07,4 Stocks to Buy From the Promising Electric Power Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-buy-promising-electric-140700649.html,1696601220,STORY,"['VST', 'SO', 'PNW', '^GSPC', 'PCG']","[Zacks Utility – Electric Power industry stocks have been transitioning toward clean sources of fuel and focusing on lower carbon emissions. The introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act 2022 will support the industry’s transition toward clean energy sources to produce electricity. Utilities are also focused on strengthening the grid as well as transmission and distribution infrastructure. The huge infrastructure of the utilities faces the impact of the hurricane season each year. Infrastructure enhancement around the year increases the resilience of the entire system, reduces outages and allows operators to restore power quickly for customers affected by storms.The Southern Company SO, with its expanding clean power generation portfolio and expanding customer base, renewable operations and well-chalked-out capital investments to strengthen infrastructure, offers an excellent opportunity to stay invested in the utility space. Other utilities worth adding to your portfolio are PG&amp; E Corporation PCG, Vistra Corp. VST and Pinnacle West Capital Corporation PNW.About the IndustryThe Utility – Electric Power industry involves the generation, transmission, distribution, storage and sale of electricity to customers. A substantial portion of utilities’ earnings is generated from regulated operations. Unless there is any major weather variation, demand for the services provided by utilities remains  steady, regardless of economic cycles. Per an EIA report, high temperatures during the third quarter are likely to have increased generation by 2% year over year. A clear transition is evident in this industry, with more companies declaring zero-emission goals. Research and development over the years have resulted in a substantial decline in the cost of setting up utility-scale renewable power projects, aiding in reducing emissions. However, the ongoing increase in interest rates is a concern for capital-intensive utilities.Story continues3 Electric Power Industry Trends to Watch Out ForTransition Toward Cleaner Sources to Generate Power:  The operators in the U.S. electric power sector are gradually moving toward cleaner sources of energy. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the annual share of U.S. electricity generation from renewable energy sources will rise from 22% in 2022 to 25% in 2024, as a result of the continuing addition of solar and wind-generating capacity. The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will support and accelerate the utilities’ transition toward clean energy sources. IRA has removed the uncertainties relating to federal incentives provided for renewable sources usage. The act entails an opportunity for a wide range of low-cost clean energy solutions in a predictable way for a long time and will create earnings visibility. Courtesy of IRA, the utility operators are planning to add more renewable assets to their generation portfolio and shut down old polluting units.Demand for Electricity Stable: Per EIA, electricity demand in the United States can drop 1.3% year over year in 2023 but increase 1.7% in 2024. The drop in demand in 2023 was primarily due to milder temperatures in the first half of the year. Despite the expected drop in usage, utilities will continue to benefit from the rise in residential electricity rates. EIA forecasts the average price of electricity to U.S. residential customers to increase by 4% in 2023 to 15.7 cents/kWh.Ongoing Interest Rate Increase is a Concern: Utilities, in order to maintain, upgrade and expand operations, approach capital markets for loans. The utilities have been enjoying near-zero interest rates for the past few years. But multiple rate hikes in 2022 pushed up interest rates. The Federal Reserve decided not to increase interest rate in its September meeting. The benchmark rate is high, in the 5.25-5.50% range, after a 25 bps hike in July. Fed officials are contemplating increasing rates once more in 2023. The increasing interest rates are a concern for capital-intensive utilities in the United States as these will push up capital servicing costs substantially from the current levels. Utilities might try to pass on the burden of increasing borrowing costs to customers but the necessary increase in rates might not be approved by the commission. In such a scenario, utilities will need to digest the extra expenses, which can lower their profitability and make them less attractive to investors interested in the utility space.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates strong near-term prospects. The 55-stock Utility-Electric Power industry is housed within the broader Zacks Utilities sector and currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #25, which places it in the top 10% of more than 251 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are showing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential.Before we present a few Utility - Electric Power stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and current valuation.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 and SectorThe Utility Electric Power industry has lagged the Zacks S&amp;P 500 and its own sector over the past 12 months.

The iconic denim maker got dragged down by weaker shopping trends, both at department stores and big-box retailers across the U.S such as Macy’s Inc (NYSE: M), Kohl’s Corporation (NYSE: KSS) and Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT). A month ago, Target posted its first quarterly sales decline in six years due to the slowdown in discretionary spending. Target also opted for a cautionary outlook due to further decline in discretionary categories. Macy’s amplified its leaner and personalized inventory due to also grappling with discretionary softness. As the year winds down, Macy’s also expects consumers to adopt a more financially-mindful attitude. Despite beating earnings expectations with its latest quarter that ended on July 29th, even Macy’s provided a cautious outlook due to sliding sales.Weaker Than Expected Fiscal Third QuarterFor the quarter that ended on August 27th, the denim retailer made $1.51 billion in revenue, coming in short of LSEG’s consensus estimate of $1.54 billion as growth was almost flat compared to 2022’s comparable quarter when sales amounted to $1.52 billion. Levi earned only 10 million in net income, or 2 cents per share, significantly lower than $173 million, or 43 cents per share it earned during 2022’s comparable quarter. Adjusted earnings per share amounted to 28 cents, topping LSEG’s estimate of 27 cents.Slashing The Annual Outlook, Once AgainFor the full year, Levi guided for net revenues to be flat to up 1% YoY, down from its previous 1.5% to 2.5% growth range. Adjusted earnings per share are now expected to be on the low-end of the previously guided range between $1.10 to $1.20. Chief Financial and Growth Officer Harmit Singh elaborated that Levi opted for a conservative guidance despite observing a positive momentum in its direct-to-consumer business and improving wholesale trends in the first part of the undergoing, fiscal fourth, quarter.Story continuesThe Grinch Could Steal Christmas From Retailers This YearWith the restart of student loan payments that is already weighing heavily on the minds of indebted consumers pinched by inflation, along with high raising gas prices, discretionary retailers like Macy’s, Kohl’s Corporation and Target need to brace for another harmful impact, which will inevitably harm Levi simultaneously as consumers focus on their basic needs as opposed to wants. By the looks of it, even the iconic staple of fashion like denim jeans are not immune to the effects of an economic downturn.View more earnings on LEVIDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

RomanShortly after joining fashion-meets-philanthropy jewelry brand Kendra Scott as a director in 2015, Tom Nolan saw the company become a unicorn, commanding a $1 billion valuation in a private equity funding round. Eight years later, he’s at the helm as CEO with eyes to reach even greater heights, stewarding the company’s mission of reaching customers who are vast in number but often are neglected.“This audience of constituents we focus on are being overlooked by the media,” Mr. Nolan told IPO Edge in a wide-ranging interview on subjects from style to financial performance. “Anytime I hear about luxury goods I get it, but the majority don’t live in that space.”Kendra Scott CEO Tom NolanIndeed, Mr. Nolan embraces the same values founder Kendra Scott had when she started her eponymous company in her Austin, Texas home in 2002. At the time, Ms. Scott had a vision of making customers across the income spectrum feel beautiful, having noticed a chasm between pricey luxury brands and lower-end items that were poorly made.Reflecting on his own upbringing, Mr. Nolan pointed out that he was brought up working class and was the first in his family to graduate from high school. “My life has been predicted on hard work and output,” he said. “I’ve been an underdog my whole life.”Story continuesIn turn, he’s resistant to the idea of luxury feeling intimidating or too hard on a customer’s wallet. Elite luxury brands like Hermès, he says, can make even wealthy customers feel “uncomfortable” when visiting opulent stores like the French brand’s Paris flagship.“No one wants to go into any store and feel like they overpaid for anything,” he said. “True luxury isn’t necessarily about money it’s about feeling. The right piece can have just as much meaning as a Birkin bag.”The majority of Kendra Scott’s pieces are within financial reach of its shoppers but also designed to instill a feeling of luxury. “We make people feel good. We want them to feel elevated,” Mr. Nolan said. “It works because many wind up being repeat customers.”Mr. Nolan’s journey to Kendra Scott included a role at storied media conglomerate Condé Nast, where he was Publisher of Golf World (he’s also co-owner of a golf course in Tennessee) followed by a pivot to fashion. At Ralph Lauren, he was Senior Vice President and learned under the tutelage of fashion industry legend Roger Farah, who retired as Executive Vice Chairman in 2014. He’s also on the board of Tommy John, a comfort-focused lifestyle brand along with Made In, which brings restaurant-quality cookware to at-home chefs.When Mr. Nolan arrived at Kendra Scott, the brand had a strong wholesale footprint but only about a dozen stores. It had expanded steadily but was on the cusp of truly explosive growth having secured funding from Palo Alto private equity firm Norwest Venture Partners in 2014 that valued the business at $100 million. Soon after, Kendra Scott was crowned a unicorn with another investment from Berkshire Partners valuing the business at $1 billion, making Ms. Scott one of the wealthiest self-made women in the world.Fast forward to 2021, when Mr. Nolan became CEO, and the expansion has continued apace. The company’s sales have grown a mid-teens annualized percentage, reaching more than $400 million in the fiscal year through January. The company has 2,600 employees and its store count reached 134 stores as of August, with a sales mix of roughly 50% retail, 35% e-commerce and 15% wholesale.“It’s pure omnichannel,” Mr. Nolan said, pointing out that e-commerce can get a serious bounce from the presence of a brick-and-mortar store that serves as a showroom. The same phenomenon has been observed at other fashion brands such as white-hot preppie label Rowing Blazers, whose CEO described the effect in a recent interview.Kendra Scott skews younger, with 80% of its customers in the Gen Z, Millennial and Gen X range. It also commands a powerful social media following, with influencers donning pieces in viral videos. Take Kylan Darnell, a “sorority Tok” star who posed with Kendra Scott pieces she paired with Gucci earrings.While wholesale is a minority of Kendra Scott’s sales, it has landed partnerships with some of the country’s largest retailers. Later this month, the company will launch a collaboration with Target Corp. featuring over 200 items. At the other end of the spectrum, Neiman Marcus sells dozens of Kendra Scott pieces, which are slightly more expensive but most items are a few hundred dollars or less.Those partnerships reflect Mr. Nolan’s mantra of reaching as many people as possible, regardless of income. “Our customers are everyone from police officers to CEOs to schoolteachers,” he said. “We want aspiration among all customers.”Of course, Kendra Scott does have a fine jewelry line, with some pieces $1,500 and up. “When we launched fine jewlery it was a bit of a risk,” Mr. Nolan said. “But we saw customers stretch up and also a pull down.”The brand is also dedicated to doing good through the Kendra Scott Foundation. It also offers events at local stores where community members can hold shopping events for charities, with 20% of sales going to donations.Earlier this year, the company hired advisors to seek more growth capital as it continues to expand across channels. There’s been no word on plans to go public, but as the IPO window reopens, investors are on the hunt for high-quality growth stories. With Mr. Nolan at the helm, Kendra Scott is one to watch.Contact:IPO-Edge.comEditor@IPO-Edge.comTwitter: @IPOEdgeInstagram: @IPOEdge ]"

For income investors, a dividend’s security is paramount. It’s time to get rid of these three ticking time bomb dividend stocks before they explode.Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P. (BEP)Brookfield Renewable logo on a phone screen. BEPC stock. BEP stock.Source: IgorGolovniov / ShutterstockBrookfield Renewable Partners L.P. (NYSE:BEP) is a broadly diversified renewable power generation firm. Its assets span hydroelectric, wind, solar, distributed generation, pumped storage, cogeneration, and biomass.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWhile some of these, such as hydroelectric, have excellent economics, other parts of the business stand upon shakier footing. The wind market has convulsed over the past month recently. Specifically, industry leader Orsted (OTCMKTS:DNNGY) plunged in value following a massive write-down of its American offshore wind business.Then, the situation worsened this week. Fellow renewables company NextEra Energy Partners, LP (NYSE:NEP) abruptly lost a third of its value in two days as management slashed its future growth guidance.It appears that the Inflation Reduction Act’s subsidies for the wind and solar sectors haven’t quite matched investors’ expectations. Wind and solar are still newer industries that rely on government aid for growth. The current political gridlock in D.C. further limits the future tax breaks that the sector may receive.After seeing several big renewable energy companies plunge in value over the past month, investors should step aside before the next shoe falls. It’s only a matter of time until analysts question the sustainability of Brookfield Renewable’s dividend and growth plans given the problems its peers are facing.Boston Properties (BXP)Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of boston properties, stock market chart background. BXP stock.Source: Ralf Liebhold / ShutterstockBoston Properties (NYSE:BXP) is a leading office real estate investment trust (REIT).Story continuesIn prior years, investors could count on office REITs to deliver steady cash flows and strong dividends. However, the pandemic changed everything.Now, workers have become accustomed to using remote solutions rather than trekking into the office. Even firms that are returning to the office are often doing so for only three or four days per week. All this adds up to falling occupancy rates and lower rents for office buildings.And Boston Properties faces another problem. It has more than $10 billion in long-term debt. As interest rates continue rising, expect BXP’s annual interest expense to rise by hundreds of millions as it refinances its older lower-cost debt.Rising expenses combined with falling rental revenue are a toxic combination on a leveraged asset business model such as office REITs. The remote work storm is going to hit the office space hard. Boston Properties’ dividend may not survive at its present size.Best BuyA photo of a Best Buy store front.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comBest Buy (NYSE:BBY) has surprised investors with its resiliency.E-commerce has killed off a lot of specialty retailers. Best Buy’s electronics business would seem vulnerable to online competition from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). That’s especially true as online ordering has largely eliminated former Best Buy product categories such as physical CDs, software, and DVD sales.However, Best Buy’s in-person shopping experience and repair centers have proven useful to shoppers even in the digital age. The firm’s good luck may not last forever, though.Electronic sales boomed over the past few years as people bought new computers and equipment to study and work from home. Sadly, that demand driver has passed. Now. computer sales are down sharply year over year (YOY).More broadly, the economy appears to be weakening, and higher inflation is hurting consumers’ spending power. Also, product shrinkage is a mounting issue. Companies like Target (NYSE:TGT) are closing stores to address losses from theft and organized crime.All of this adds up to a bumpy road ahead for BBY stock as it navigates this challenging environment. The firm may trim the 5.4% dividend yield given these headwinds.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This transformation is expected to boost Zambia's copper industry and transform this formerly unprofitable operation into the forerunner of copper producers.Barrick is committed to investing nearly $2 billion in an expansion project aimed at elevating the Lumwana mine into a world-class copper producer. The project seeks to increase Lumwana's annual copper production to approximately 240,000 tons from a 50 million ton per annum processing plant, extending the mine's operational life to 36 years. The accelerated work program is targeting the completion of a full feasibility study by the end of 2024, with expanded production expected to commence by 2028.Since taking over Lumwana's operations in 2019, Barrick has significantly contributed to the Zambian economy, providing nearly $3 billion in the form of taxes, royalties, employee salaries and local procurement of goods and services. The company is also dedicated to hiring local talent, with 99.3% of Lumwana's current workforce being Zambian nationals.Barrick Gold Corporation Price and Consensus Barrick Gold Corporation Price and ConsensusBarrick Gold Corporation price-consensus-chart | Barrick Gold Corporation Quote Barrick places great importance on considering host countries as essential partners and strives to ensure that the economic advantages arising from its mining activities are shared with governments and local communities. To achieve this, Barrick launched several initiatives, including the Business Accelerator Program. This program is designed to strengthen the capabilities of Zambian contractors within Lumwana's supply chain and help them realize their expansion objectives. Barrick is actively engaged in partnerships with the Ministry of Small and Medium Enterprises to facilitate growth and development of local businesses in the region.Story continuesRegarding Lumwana's current performance, Bristow expressed confidence that it is on track to meet its production targets for 2023.

Last year was disappointing as the Fed pursued aggressive monetary control with a massive hike in the benchmark lending rate to combat 40-year high inflation.However, the cryptocurrency market has remained rangebound in the past 10 weeks as market participants are concerned about the Fed’s policy prescriptions. In his post-FOMC meeting statement in September, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell warned of one more rate hike of 25 basis points by the end of this year and a higher interest rate regime for a longer-than-expected period.A high interest rate is detrimental to growth assets like technology stocks, consumer discretionary stocks and cryptocurrencies. Tighter monetary control also raised concerns that the economy may fall into a recession in the near future.Following Powell’s warning, the yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note jumped to 4.8% this week, a level last seen just before the financial crisis of 2008. This yield is of immense importance as it reflects market participants’ perception about the country’s economic conditions affecting consumers, corporations and government agencies.The fear of a recession in the near future, which almost evaporated just two and a half months ago following a steady decline in the inflation rate and reduction of the magnitude and frequency of interest rate hikes by the central bank, has suddenly erupted in the past three weeks.

201,624ac4fc-a464-3b50-823c-af7fa87d2e97,MAR,2023-10-07,"Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 65% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marriott-international-inc-nasdaq-mar-175435087.html,1696614875,STORY,['MAR'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Marriott International's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsA total of 14 investors have a majority stake in the company with 52% ownership Insiders have sold recently To get a sense of who is truly in control of Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 65% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Marriott International. View our latest analysis for Marriott International ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Marriott International?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Marriott International already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Marriott International's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Marriott International. Our data shows that David Marriott is the largest shareholder with 8.5% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.2% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.3% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 14 shareholders have a combined ownership of 52% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Marriott InternationalWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.It seems insiders own a significant proportion of Marriott International, Inc.. It has a market capitalization of just US$58b, and insiders have US$9.5b worth of shares in their own names. That's quite significant. Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders, especially in a company of this size. You can  click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 14% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Private Company OwnershipOur data indicates that Private Companies hold 4.5%, of the company's shares. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Marriott International better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for Marriott International  you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Verizon Communications (VZ) Stock: A Hidden Value Trap? Unpacking the Risks and RewardsVerizon Communications: A Potential Value Trap?Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Verizon Communications should not be overlooked. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 1.19. These indicators suggest that Verizon Communications, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Deciphering the Altman Z-ScoreInvented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Story continuesCompany OverviewVerizon Communications is primarily a wireless business, providing about 70% of service revenue and nearly all operating income. It serves about 92 million postpaid and 22 million prepaid phone customers via its nationwide network, making it the largest U.S. wireless carrier. Fixed-line telecom operations include local networks in the Northeast, which reach about 25 million homes and businesses and serve about 8 million broadband customers. Verizon also provides telecom services nationwide to enterprise customers.Verizon Communications (VZ) Stock: A Hidden Value Trap? Unpacking the Risks and RewardsVerizon Communications's Low Altman Z-Score: A Breakdown of Key DriversA dissection of Verizon Communications's Altman Z-score reveals Verizon Communications's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress:Operational Efficiency: The Asset Turnover RatioA vital indicator for Verizon Communications is its asset turnover. The data from the past three years suggests a decreasing trend in this ratio: 2021: 0.41; 2022: 0.37; 2023: 0.36. The asset turnover ratio reflects how effectively a company is using its assets to generate sales. A drop in this ratio can signify reduced operational efficiency, potentially due to underutilization of assets or decreased market demand for the company's products or services. This shift in Verizon Communications's asset turnover underlines the need for the company to reassess its operational strategies to optimize asset usage and boost sales.ConclusionVerizon Communications Inc (NYSE:VZ), despite its attractive valuation, exhibits signs of being a potential value trap. The company's low Altman Z-Score and decreasing asset turnover ratio suggest potential financial distress and declining operational efficiency. Therefore, it is crucial for investors to conduct thorough due diligence before making an investment decision.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the following Screener: Walter Schloss Screen .This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

207,384f81aa-db94-3701-bccd-b901f9ab16b1,VZ,2023-10-07,The past three years for Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) investors has not been profitable,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/past-three-years-verizon-communications-130024685.html,1696597224,STORY,['VZ'],"[Many investors define successful investing as beating the market average over the long term. But the risk of stock picking is that you will likely buy under-performing companies. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) shareholders, since the share price is down 46% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 21%. Furthermore, it's down 11% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders.Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns. View our latest analysis for Verizon Communications There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Although the share price is down over three years, Verizon Communications actually managed to grow EPS by 2.6% per year in that time. Given the share price reaction, one might suspect that EPS is not a good guide to the business performance during the period (perhaps due to a one-off loss or gain). Or else the company was over-hyped in the past, and so its growth has disappointed.It's pretty reasonable to suspect the market was previously to bullish on the stock, and has since moderated expectations. However, taking a look at other business metrics might shed a bit more light on the share price action.We note that the dividend seems healthy enough, so that probably doesn't explain the share price drop. Revenue has been pretty flat over three years, so that isn't an obvious reason shareholders would sell. A closer look at revenue and profit trends might yield insights.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthVerizon Communications is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecastsWhat About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Verizon Communications' TSR for the last 3 years was -36%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveInvestors in Verizon Communications had a tough year, with a total loss of 9.7% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 13%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 4% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Verizon Communications better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Verizon Communications   you should know about.If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

However, the company’s opioid-related litigation expenses are a potential threat.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have risen 18.8% year to date compared with the industry’s 37.4% growth. The S&amp;P 500 Index has risen 12.4% in the same time frame.McKesson is a healthcare services and information technology company with a market capitalization of $59.63 billion. Its earnings are anticipated to improve 10.7% over the next five years.The company’s bottom line beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same once, delivering an average surprise of 8.1%. Its earnings yield of 6.1% compares favorably with the industry’s 5.2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchKey Growth DriversStrength in Biologics: Investors are optimistic about McKesson’s robust Biologics business. Independent specialty pharmacy, Biologics by McKesson, has been making impressive progress lately. Last month, the pharmacy was selected by GSK as a specialty pharmacy provider of OJJAARA (momelotinib).Last month, Biologics was chosen by Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. as a specialty pharmacy provider of VANFLYTA (quizartinib).Strength in Distribution Market: McKesson is a major player in the pharmaceutical and medical supplies distribution market that raises investors’ optimism. The Distribution Solutions segment caters to a wide range of customers and businesses. It also stands to benefit from increased generic utilization and inflation in generics, driven by several patent expirations in the next few years and an aging population.Per management, the uptick in the company’s U.S. Pharmaceutical and Medical-Surgical Solutions segments’ adjusted operating profit was driven by growth in the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems, and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government’s COVID-19 vaccine program, respectively, in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.Story continuesStrong Q1 Results: McKesson’s robust first-quarter fiscal 2024 results buoy optimism. The company recorded strong top and bottom-line performances and strength in its U.S. Pharmaceutical, Medical-Surgical Solutions and Prescription Technology Solutions segments.DownsidesWeak Trends: McKesson distributes generic pharmaceuticals, which are subject to price fluctuation. The Distribution Solutions segment continues to experience a weaker generic pharmaceutical pricing trend. Continued volatility, unfavorable pricing trends, reimbursement of generic drugs and significant fluctuations in the nature, frequency and magnitude of generic pharmaceutical launches could have an adverse impact on McKesson.Stiff Competition: Distribution Solutions faces stiff competition both in terms of price and service from various full-line, short-line and specialty wholesalers, service merchandisers, self-warehousing chains, manufacturers engaged in direct distribution, third-party logistics companies and large-payer organizations. Moreover, MCK depends on fewer suppliers for its products. As a result, it is not in a position to negotiate pricing.McKesson Corporation PriceMcKesson Corporation PriceMcKesson Corporation price | McKesson Corporation QuoteEstimates TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 revenues is pegged at $303.85 billion, indicating a 10.9% increase from the previous year’s level.

Robinson Worldwide (NASDAQ:CHRW) is promising, but the shareholders are still in the red over that time",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/three-underlying-earnings-growth-c-124404749.html,1696596244,STORY,['CHRW'],"[For many investors, the main point of stock picking is to generate higher returns than the overall market. But if you try your hand at stock picking, your risk returning less than the market. We regret to report that long term C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHRW) shareholders have had that experience, with the share price dropping 21% in three years, versus a market return of about 21%. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 11% in the last 90 days.Given the past week has been tough on shareholders, let's investigate the fundamentals and see what we can learn. View our latest analysis for C.H. Robinson Worldwide To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Although the share price is down over three years, C.H. Robinson Worldwide actually managed to grow EPS by 10% per year in that time. This is quite a puzzle, and suggests there might be something temporarily buoying the share price. Or else the company was over-hyped in the past, and so its growth has disappointed.It's worth taking a look at other metrics, because the EPS growth doesn't seem to match with the falling share price.We note that, in three years, revenue has actually grown at a 15% annual rate, so that doesn't seem to be a reason to sell shares. This analysis is just perfunctory, but it might be worth researching C.H. Robinson Worldwide more closely, as sometimes stocks fall unfairly. This could present an opportunity.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-and-revenue-growthC.H. Robinson Worldwide is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. Given we have quite a good number of analyst forecasts, it might be well worth checking out this free chart depicting consensus estimates.Story continuesWhat About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, C.H. Robinson Worldwide's TSR for the last 3 years was -15%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveC.H. Robinson Worldwide shareholders are down 11% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 13%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 0.8% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Even so, be aware that  C.H. Robinson Worldwide is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , you should know about...Of course C.H. Robinson Worldwide may not be the best stock to buy.

Maybe not at the moment, but Bernstein Analyst Laurent Yoon sees Disney as the “only credible challenger to Netflix” given its potential to gain full control of Hulu.Yahoo Finance Live's Seana Smith and Brad Smith analyze Yoon's note.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: We wanna get to the market commentary of the day. Could Disney knock Netflix off its top spot in the streaming space? Well, according to a new note out from Bernstein, Disney is the, quote, ""only credible challenger to the streaming giant.""Now, Netflix has maintained its leadership in this space despite legendary networks and tech giants alike putting their hats in the ring. Bernstein Analyst Laurent Yoon points to Hulu as a potential catalyst here, arguing that Disney has more to gain with full control of Hulu.And a favorable resolution of the deal would likely lift an overhang on the stock, saying in a recent note that, quote, ""We forecast DTC growth to outpace linear decline, supporting overall growth of Media. And Disney becoming the undisputed number two subscription video on demand.""Now, with the price target of $103, Yoon sees more than 20% upside to Disney's stock. We're seeing a bit of a lift here today, up just about a tenth of a percent. Lots to digest in this note here, Brad. But at scale, at least Bernstein arguing that they expect EBITDA margin to expand from roughly 18% today to the low 20s for the foreseeable future. And the price target multiple implies a decent premium to some of its legacy peers. But still, though, seven times turns less than Netflix, the industry leader.BRAD SMITH: I'm just excited about the advertising on here. This is a key part of this note as well, AVOD economics. All right. So we're gonna do a short but shallow deep dive into this one. AVOD economics works. But can it scale as one of the parts of this note here?Story continuesAnd it caught my attention because when you think about the advertising options that are out there for not just the consumers and kind of lowering the price that they're paying based on the tier that they're opting into, but for advertisers, for marketers who are trying to run these massive campaigns on streaming platforms, knowing the amount of screen time that is paid or ultimately amassed on each of these and largely the two lion's share winners there, Disney and Netflix, the not straight-up duopoly but certainly the largest of the streaming opportunities that are out there here.The AVOD arm is now basically higher than basic globally and also higher than standard domestically. What does all this mean here, the arm is already competitive with the standard tier. And that's what they're saying about Netflix and particularly how this relates to the larger AVOD tier. Standard tier is about $8.5 a month here.Now, the engagement and cost of advertising slots-- the CPMs, cost per million, is typically what that would have been for many decades and years at this point-- is what cost per essential millions of views an advertiser would be paying for here.And so all that considered, look for what Disney, what Netflix say about where their advertising tiers are showing strength, what's they're seeing in terms of revenue in those advertisers, those marketing dollars, millions, sometimes billions of dollars spent in these ad campaigns that are run on the platform that can amass to a significant revenue item for Disney and Netflix to be able to report back to investors here. I'm sorry, I'm just excited about advertising and marketing.]"

The tech sector has fallen from its peak earlier this year, paving the way for speculation over whether tech stocks are still a sound investment.Mark Mahaney, Evercore ISI Senior Managing Director and Head of Internet Research, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss Netflix's outlook after a recent report from the Wall Street Journal stated the streaming service's intent to raise subscription prices after the SAG-AFTRA strike ends.Mahaney comments on Netflix's move into AVOD (advertising on demand), stating: ""Over time, it will help them gain more subscribers, and the beauty of this is with the advertising revenue, they could drop their subscription price by a couple of bucks, three bucks, and generate more revenue per user, like you rarely see that in business history.""For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Tech stocks have certainly taken a beating this quarter. The Magnificent Seven, the biggest players in tech, Apple Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, NVIDIA, and Tesla are all well off their 2023 peaks. But should investors reassess their tech investments?We want to bring in Mark Mahaney, Evercore ISI senior managing director, also head of internet research to discuss all this and more. Mark, it's great to see you. Let's start with-- you cover a lot of names, but I want to start with Netflix and reports that we got out earlier this week about Netflix potentially raising prices yet again. The stock's still in the green since the start of the year up just about 27%. What do you think of the report and how material this would be to the business?MARK MAHANEY: I think it's a high probability that Netflix is going to raise prices again. They have a history of doing this. The wonderful term that they use, I think, the euphemism is called widening. So what they mean by that is they're going to, kind of, accordion or widen up the price point. So the high-end price points for you and me and all other consumers, 1549 for the standard package and then 1949 for the premium package, something like that.Story continuesAnyway, I think they're going to take those up over time. And this is how the company has, kind of, driven growth historically. Investor concerns over the last quarter centered on why [INAUDIBLE] wasn't growing fast. So this is the solution to that. It'll be a positive catalyst when it's announced.The big backdrop here is that the Hollywood writers' strike however pushed off the time when they could raise prices because that meant that there was a content hole risk for Netflix. Once you get beat well beyond the writers strike, content starts coming back on, you get some good shows, you will see that price increase. I like Netflix as a stock. It's not one of our top picks though.BRAD SMITH: And just quickly within there, where does AVOD fit into your valuation of Netflix as well, this advertising layered on tier as well?MARK MAHANEY: Well, I think they expanded their TAM, their Total Addressable Market. And so, you know, Netflix, kind of, hit a wall at the beginning of 2022 and they went two quarters without any sub growth. And then they announced they were going to get into the AVOD business. I call it SAVOD, Subscription and Advertising Video on Demand.I don't think they'll go pure AVOD, like only have an advertising revenue-driven business. But the SAVOD business, I think it's going to work really well for them. We've only had early days with it.Maybe 10 million or maybe it's 5 million of their total subscribers are on this SAVOD plan, but that's at a 250 million. So it's chump change. It's small. But over time, it'll help them gain more subscribers.And the beauty of this is with the advertising revenue, they could actually drop their subscription price by a couple of bucks, by $3, and actually generate more revenue per user. You rarely see that in business history. That's the big win here. We haven't really seen it play out in fundamentals yet, but I think it's, kind of, snowballed up there to see that impact next year.]"

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.Top 5 Upgrades:Jefferies upgraded e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $115, up from $110. The analyst notes that the recent pullback in EBITDA multiple to 23-times from 37-times has created a buying opportunity as underlying demand remains robust while the benefits from M&amp;A, international expansion, and share gains should more than offset tough comps in FY25.Piper Sandler upgraded Shoals Technologies (SHLS) to Overweight from Neutral with an unchanged price target of $28. The analyst cites the recent pullback in the shares for the upgrade.BofA upgraded Xcel Energy (XEL) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $66, up from $58. While noting that the upgrade comes ""relatively soon after"" the firm had recently downgraded the shares, the firm feels confident that the recent Colorado Resource Plan proposal ""lays the foundation for an upward inflection in rate base growth to the end of the decade,"" the analyst tells investors.Truist upgraded Frontdoor (FTDR) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $42, up from $40. The Truist card data suggests the company should generate $525M-plus in Q3 revenue, solidly ahead of the Street at $510M and guidance of $500M-$515M.JPMorgan upgraded Eaton (ETN) to Overweight from Neutral with a $230 price target.AutoZone store in Tallahassee, Fla. (AP Photo/Phil Coale)Top 5 Downgrades:Oppenheimer downgraded AutoZone (AZO) to Perform from Outperform with a price target of $2,600, down from $2,850. The analyst assumes a ""less upbeat stance"" on auto parts retail as the focus shifts to 2024.DA Davidson downgraded LCI Industries (LCII) to Underperform from Neutral with a price target of $91, down from $113. The analyst is citing the firm's follow-up with dealers to discuss Open House and the 2024 RV Industry outlook, noting that the feedback received was overwhelmingly negative, including weak Open House ordering trends, uncertain production cuts in Q4-Q1, and a desire for further price reductions.BTIG downgraded Venus Concept (VERO) to Neutral from Buy without a price target. The company reported preliminary Q3 revenue below expectations, cut full-year revenue guidance due to the accelerated distributor transition, and announced a debt restructuring, the analyst tells investors in a research note.Truist downgraded PTC Therapeutics (PTCT) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $25, down from $45. The analyst is citing the company's ""financing/development hurdles"" overshadowing the key strengths in its portfolio.JPMorgan downgraded Carrier Global (CARR) to Underweight from Neutral with a $53 price target.Story continuesThe world's first 'Frozen' themed land at Disneyland in Hong Kong, China September 12, 2023. REUTERS/Tyrone SiuTop 5 Initiations:Bernstein initiated coverage of Disney (DIS) with an Outperform rating and $103 price target. The decline of linear and transition to DTC are ""well-established narratives"" and future growth and profitability will be about outpacing linear decline with DTC growth and having scale for profitability, the analyst tells investors. Seaport Research also initiated coverage of Disney with a Buy rating and $93 price target.Seaport Research initiated coverage of Roku (ROKU) with a Neutral rating and no price target. The firm is initiating coverage of the ""core"" Media industry names, or those with owned IP, studios and/or streaming services, arguing that these ""content"" stocks have ""possibly seen the worst of investors' fears.""Oppenheimer initiated coverage of ImmunoGen (IMGN) with a Perform rating and $16 price target. While stating that ImmunoGen ""stands among the pioneers of antibody-drug conjugates,"" or ADCs, for oncology and acknowledging that the launch of lead asset Elahere ""surpassed expectations"" since the drug received accelerated approval in Q4 of 2022, the firm anticipates shares to continue trading near fair value.TD Cowen initiated coverage of Block (SQ) with an Outperform rating and $59 price target. Block, the parent of Square and Cash App, ""boasts a fundamentally differentiated ecosystem in Fintech,"" contends the analyst, who sees the company's ability to grow and integrate its solutions placing it ""among the most likely to challenge industry norms.""Goldman Sachs reinstated coverage of Enterprise Products (EPD) with a Neutral rating and $28 price target.

Hollywood's writers strike has ended, while the actors strike continues in their bid to get better pay and working conditions. (Chris Pizzello/AP Photo)Striking Hollywood actors will meet with studios again on Friday as the two sides restart negotiations on the heels of an epic conclusion to the writers strike last week.SAG-AFTRA — the union that represents approximately 160,000 actors, announcers, recording artists, and other media professionals around the world — began a strike on July 14 after failing to negotiate a deal with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which bargains on behalf of the major studios including Warner Bros. (WBD), Disney (DIS), Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NBCUniversal (CMCSA), Paramount (PARA), and Sony (SONY).Similarly to the writers, SAG-AFTRA is fighting for more protections surrounding the role of artificial intelligence in media and entertainment in addition to better pay, improved working conditions, and higher streaming residuals as more movies and TV shows go directly to streaming.The writers union, Writers Guild of America (WGA), had been on strike for nearly 150 days prior to its studio deal. The guild was successful in achieving many of its demands, which included increased regulations surrounding the use of artificial intelligence, minimum staffing requirements, a boost to streaming residuals, and more.Industry watchers largely expect SAG-AFTRA to reach a similar conclusion, although the union made it clear that, while it will review the WGA's agreement, the guild is ultimately committed to reaching a deal that's specific to its member base.Story continuesAccording to estimates from the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp., the 2007-2008 writers strike cost the Los Angeles County economy a whopping $2.5 billion. That likely will double this time around.Kevin Klowden, chief global strategist at the Milken Institute, estimated the nearly five-month-long writers strike, coupled with the ongoing actors strike, will cost the national economy $5 billion-plus.""The main thing we're really factoring into it is the lost wages,"" Klowden previously told Yahoo Finance Live.

For more recession-resilient stocks, head over to 5 Best Stocks to Buy in Falling Markets.Recessions are inevitable and the market has been forecasting a recession in the near future for quite some time. The reason is that since July last year, the yield curve has been inverted, which has often been a signal that recession may be on the horizon. When economic downturns hit, people always tend to invest in safe stocks which may offer them reasonable returns during higher uncertainties. Thus healthcare and consumer staple shares are mostly preferred in those situations when macroeconomic headwinds are high.Companies in the consumer staples are the ones that mostly produce and sell consumer necessity goods. Those goods are bought easily even during recessions because when economic challenges skyrocket, people opt for necessities rather than luxuries. According to The Wall Street Journal, consumer staple stocks are a “bright spot in bleak market”.“Consumer-staples companies are commonly regarded as a haven during volatile markets and recessionary periods,” the WSJ added.Consumers cannot stop buying medicines, prescription drugs or basic household products even when recessions hit, Morningstar analyst Amy Arnott wrote.According to Arnott, healthcare and consumer staple stocks are the most “resilient performers” during economic downturns.Opportunities lie ahead for consumer staple companies as they will maintain their performance and have organic sales growth despite economic downturns this year and into 2024, analyst Amber Kanwar said in an interview on BNN Bloomberg.In the near future, consumer staples will be an important part of stock portfolios as there will be a major focus on low-end consumers, Mona Mahajan, a senior investment strategist at Edward Jones said.Considering recession is imminent and inevitable, according to many analysts, we decided to take a look at some of the best stocks to buy in falling markets which include General Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS), Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and others.Story continuesOur Methodology:We chose stocks from the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund because historically consumer staple companies have performed well in times of economic downturns. In this article, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund has been selected which holds 39 companies in the consumer services industry. The stocks held under this ETF are expected to offer earnings per share growth of 7.61% in the next three to five years. The price/book ratio for this ETF stands at 4.58 for the last year which demonstrates that stocks are trading at premium prices, while the price/earnings ratio for this ETF is at 18.94. The price/earnings ratio compares a company’s share price to its yearly net profits. Anything below 20 would be considered a good price-to-earnings ratio.

232,a3b95869-0c1c-353c-a8bb-58903f4ffcd8,CL,2023-10-07,Will Demand & Pricing Trends Aid PepsiCo's (PEP) Q3 Earnings?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/demand-pricing-trends-aid-pepsicos-142600672.html,1696602360,STORY,"['PEP', 'KO', 'PG', 'CL']","[PepsiCo, Inc. PEP is expected to register bottom and top-line growth when it reports third-quarter 2023 numbers on Oct 10, before the opening bell. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $23.4 billion, implying 6.5% growth from the year-ago quarter's reported figure.For quarterly earnings, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.17, suggesting 10.2% growth from the $1.97 reported in the prior-year quarter. The consensus mark has moved down by a penny in the past 30 days.In the last reported quarter, the company reported an earnings beat of 7.2%. It has delivered an earnings surprise of 6.3%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.PepsiCo, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise PepsiCo, Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePepsiCo, Inc. price-eps-surprise | PepsiCo, Inc. QuoteKey Factors to NotePepsiCo has been benefiting from strength and resilience in its diversified portfolio, modernized supply chain, improved digital capabilities, flexible go-to-market distribution systems, and robust consumer demand trends. The company is likely to have gained from delivering convenience, variety and value proposition to customers through its brands in the to-be-reported quarter.PEP’s third-quarter results are expected to reflect gains from improved pricing across all segments. The bottom line is likely to reflect the continued benefits of the mitigation of inflationary pressures through cost-management and revenue-management initiatives. PepsiCo is likely to have benefited from the resilience and strength of the global beverage and convenient food businesses.We expect year-over-year consolidated organic revenue growth of 8% for the third quarter, driven by a 12.1% rise in the price/mix, offset by a 4.1% decline in volume.Market share growth in the liquid refreshment beverage category, with share gains in the carbonated soft drinks, ready-to-drink tea and water categories, is likely to have aided the improvement in the beverage category. Investments in innovation and execution also bode well.The company’s food business has been gaining from revenue growth across core brands like Doritos, Lay’s, Ruffles, Tostitos and Cheetos. The Quaker business has been benefiting from market share gains in the rice and pasta, lite snacks, ready-to-eat cereal, and snack bar categories, as it has been capitalizing on the elevated demand for tasty products that deliver convenience and value.However, PepsiCo’s third-quarter gross margin is expected to have been partly negated by inflationary labor, transportation and commodity costs. Adverse currency rates are also likely to have been headwinds.Increased advertising and marketing expenses, along with additional investments to build digital capabilities and integrate purpose throughout the company, are likely to have led to a rise in SG&amp;A expenses in the to-be-reported quarter.We anticipate the adjusted gross margin to expand 60 bps to 54% in the third quarter. Margin growth can be attributed to the easing of supply-chain headwinds, partly offset by inflationary costs. Meanwhile, our estimate for adjusted SG&amp;A expenses of $8.5 billion indicates a year-over-year rise of 4.3%. Driven by the gross margin expansion and higher SG&amp;A expenses, our model suggests a 30-bps operating margin expansion to 16.7% in the third quarter.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for PepsiCo this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here.

Hollywood's writers strike has ended, while the actors strike continues in their bid to get better pay and working conditions. (Chris Pizzello/AP Photo) (Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP)Striking Hollywood actors will meet with studios again on Friday as the two sides restart negotiations on the heels of an epic conclusion to the writers strike last week.SAG-AFTRA — the union that represents approximately 160,000 actors, announcers, recording artists, and other media professionals around the world — began a strike on July 14 after failing to negotiate a deal with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which bargains on behalf of the major studios including Warner Bros. (WBD), Disney (DIS), Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NBCUniversal (CMCSA), Paramount (PARA), and Sony (SONY).Similarly to the writers, SAG-AFTRA is fighting for more protections surrounding the role of artificial intelligence in media and entertainment in addition to better pay, improved working conditions, and higher streaming residuals as more movies and TV shows go directly to streaming.The writers union, Writers Guild of America (WGA), had been on strike for nearly 150 days prior to its studio deal. The guild was successful in achieving many of its demands, which included increased regulations surrounding the use of artificial intelligence, minimum staffing requirements, a boost to streaming residuals, and more.Industry watchers largely expect SAG-AFTRA to reach a similar conclusion, although the union made it clear that, while it will review the WGA's agreement, the guild is ultimately committed to reaching a deal that's specific to its member base.Story continuesAccording to estimates from the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp., the 2007-2008 writers strike cost the Los Angeles County economy a whopping $2.5 billion. That likely will double this time around.Kevin Klowden, chief global strategist at the Milken Institute, estimated the nearly five-month-long writers strike, coupled with the ongoing actors strike, will cost the national economy $5 billion-plus.""The main thing we're really factoring into it is the lost wages,"" Klowden previously told Yahoo Finance Live.

235,86437d6e-c84b-31e9-903c-41eb0e4b1f74,MU,2023-10-07,Micron (MU) Begins New Fab Construction to Expand US Chip Output,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/micron-mu-begins-fab-construction-141700472.html,1696601820,STORY,['MU'],"[Micron Technology MU announced on Thursday that it has officially started the construction of a new memory chip factory in Boise, Idaho. This will mark the United States’ first memory chip manufacturing facility in the last 20 years.During Thursday’s announcement, Micron revealed that it would indirectly infuse approximately $15.3 billion into the Idaho economy and directly spend about $13 billion on Idaho businesses throughout the lifespan of the project. This will make it the largest-ever private investment in Idaho history.Micron currently has only design and research &amp; development centers in Boise. With the new fab factory, the company will be able to assemble memory chips domestically. The project is anticipated to bring more than 17,000 jobs to the state, of which at least 2,000 of the staff will be directly employed at Micron.Micron Technology, Inc. Price and ConsensusMicron Technology, Inc. Price and ConsensusMicron Technology, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Micron Technology, Inc. QuoteThe construction initiation is in line with the company’s September 2022 commitment of investing approximately $15 billion through the end of this decade for building a new fabrication factory for manufacturing memory chips in Idaho. In October 2022, MU announced that it plans to invest up to $100 billion over the next 20-plus years to build a factory in upstate New York, which will be the largest semiconductor fabrication facility in the history of the United States.Why Is Micron Expanding Domestic Chip Manufacturing?With its multi-decade investment commitment of $100 billion, Micron is likely to take advantage of the CHIPS and Science Act 2022, under which the U.S. government is providing $52 billion to boost domestic semiconductor research and development. MU projects to gain $5.5 billion in incentives from the state of New York over the course of the project apart from anticipated federal grants and tax credits from the CHIPS and Science Act.Moreover, Micron’s latest investment plans will help the company raise its memory chip output in the United States. The company has a long-term strategic target of bringing American-made DRAM chip production to 40% of its total global output over the next decade.Story continuesIncreased domestic production output will facilitate a more resilient and secure supply chain of Micron’s leading-edge memory chips to the United States and global customers. The majority of the world’s semiconductor need is fulfilled by fabrication facilities in Taiwan. However, China’s hostile actions toward Taiwan have made the United States and other countries concerned about a smooth supply of semiconductors in the future.Memory chips have become one of the most important components of the current-day technology-driven economy. Digitization across industries, the adoption of cloud computing as well as the integration of AI and machine learning are fueling the demand for memory chips.The accelerated deployment of 5G technology — the next-generation wireless revolution — is likely to propel further growth. Apart from this, the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, augmented reality/virtual reality and wearables are other growth prospects.Therefore, Micron’s latest move will reduce the company’s as well as the United States’ dependency on foreign-made chips and ensure a more resilient and secured supply of crucial semiconductors.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Micron carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Shares of MU have increased 38.2% year to date (YTD).Some better-ranked stocks from the broader technology sector are NVIDIA NVDA, Paylocity Holding PCTY and Palo Alto Networks PANW.

(NASDAQ:MU) with 83% ownership",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-investors-lot-riding-micron-130033164.html,1696597233,STORY,['MU'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Micron Technology's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsA total of 22 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownership Insiders have sold recently A look at the shareholders of Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 83% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Last week’s 5.9% gain means that institutional investors were on the positive end of the spectrum even as the company has shown strong longer-term trends. One-year return to shareholders is currently 28% and last week’s gain was the icing on the cake.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Micron Technology. Check out our latest analysis for Micron Technology ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Micron Technology?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Micron Technology. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Micron Technology, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Micron Technology. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.6% of shares outstanding. Capital Research and Management Company is the second largest shareholder owning 8.2% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 7.9% of the company stock.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 22 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Micron TechnologyThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Micron Technology, Inc.. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$185m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 17% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Micron Technology. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Be aware that  Micron Technology is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

BrandsTaco Bell BlogNational Hispanic/Latin Heritage Month, which runs from September 15 to October 15, is dedicated to showcasing the brilliant Hispanic/Latin culture. These grand celebrations include art exhibitions, music performances, parades, street fairs and more!The observation started on September 15, 1968 as a weeklong celebration and expanded in 1988 to a monthlong commemoration. But why September 15? This date is the anniversary of the independence days shared by Latin American countries Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua, also falling close to Mexico and Chile's independence days on September 16 and September 18.To honor this momentous month, we're spotlighting members of the Hispanic/Latin community and their inspiring career and life journeys.Brina R. (She/Her/Hers) - Associate Manager, Human Resources, Taco Bell InternationalHispanic/Latin Heritage month is all about celebrating the diverse cultures that make up this community of people. For Brina, it's a moment to showcase her pluralistic roots, which has made her who she is today.""I love that I can bring these two cultures together in my household, showing my family what it means to be a Guatemalan living in the United States. Celebrating the warmth of the Hispanic/Latin culture, the delicious food, music, talents, as well as the adversities we have overcome is what makes this month so special.""Brina was born in Guatemala and moved to the United States when she was five years old. She grew up in the San Fernando Valley in California, surrounded by American and Guatemalan traditions. Since high school, Brina enjoyed helping people learn new things and grow their careers. Little did she know these two worlds would collide in her role on Taco Bell's Ibero-America HR team supporting franchisees.""Growing up in a Guatemalan household and living in the United States, I never thought I would be able to apply my culture in my career. I've always been proud of who I am, so working on the international team and using my background to connect and communicate with others gave me a new perspective.""Story continuesWhen Brina first started on the international team, she knew Spanish would be part of her daily discourse. She was confident in her skills, but what she didn't expect was how much business would be conducted in Spanish. This ended up becoming a goal for her to work towards.""I grew up speaking Spanish my entire life, so there was no doubt that I was fluent in it. But the more time I spent working in Spanish, I knew there was a level of mastery I had to aim for. I had an American accent and didn't know every word, especially corporate terms.""Although she knew the language, Brina started second-guessing herself. She had to change her mindset to fully appreciate her bilingual skills.""I knew I had to sharpen my skills, so I started surrounding myself more with Spanish. I watched more Spanish TV and read the language to better understand grammar and improve my writing skills. I jumped at every opportunity to speak Spanish to get more comfortable with it. Being in the role for several years now, I can look back and be proud of how much I have developed and the opportunities I have been a part of. I am also grateful for my team's support along the way!""Being on the international team has also changed the way Brina views people and their individual journeys.""This role has made me more compassionate for others in all aspects of life, whether it be understanding their family history, their drive to pursue an education, or the passion they have for Taco Bell. It has also expanded my understanding of the Latin American culture, giving me a deeper appreciation for the diversity that is around us.""At the same time, her biggest source of inspiration and empathy is her family.""My husband pushes me to pursue my dreams and believe in myself. That is what I want to do for my son as well. I want to give him everything that my mom was able to give me. But more than anything, I want to teach him to be proud of who he is and raise him to dream big.""If Brina could share one piece of advice to those going through a similar experience, it would be this: ""The struggles our parents went through to raise us in this country are what makes us stronger. It's not the typical life you may think of, or what you see on TV, but what you go through are the strengths you have. Be proud of them and don't forget them.""Check out more people stories!View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Yum! Brands on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Yum!

With a commitment to providing cost-effective, functional, flexible and safe industrial spaces, Plymouth Industrial REIT has not only maintained high occupancy rates but also embarked on a strategic path toward sustained profitability.Leases commencing during the third quarter totaled 1,761,715 square feet, all with terms of at least six months. This healthy leasing activity consisted of both renewal and new leases, with 1,194,817 square feet associated with renewals and 566,898 square feet of new leases. PLYM anticipates a 24.2% increase in rental rates on a cash basis from these leases, contributing to its strong performance.As of Sep 30, 2023, the company's portfolio occupancy stood at an impressive 97.6%, reflecting recent new developments now in service. Furthermore, same-store occupancy as of the same date was 98.7%, demonstrating Plymouth's proficiency in tenant retention and property management.The total square footage of executed leases set to begin in 2023, encompassing leases commencing within the first three quarters but excluding those related to new construction, amounts to 5,396,550 square feet, all of which have durations of at least six months. PLYM will experience a 20.5% increase in rental rates on a cash basis from these leases. Consequently, 7% of 2023 expirations need to be addressed.The company has already executed leases covering 32% of its total 2024 expirations, with a 13.5% increase in rental rates on a cash basis, illustrating the management's proactive approach to securing future revenue streams.Plymouth's development initiatives are equally noteworthy. In the third quarter, PLYM successfully delivered a 180,000-square-foot industrial building in Atlanta, securing a five-year, 72,000-square-foot lease set to commence in September.In Jacksonville, the company delivered a fully leased 40,572-square-foot industrial building with an eight-year lease, and a second Jacksonville building, totaling 39,750 square feet and fully leased with a five-year term, is slated to come online in the fourth quarter. Additionally, a third 52,920-square-foot, fully leased building in Jacksonville is expected to be operational in mid-2024, boasting a 10-year lease.Furthermore, the company inked a 10-year, 47,000-square-foot lease for its 147,000-square-foot industrial building in Cincinnati, commencing in September. These developments signify Plymouth Industrial REIT's commitment to expanding its footprint and providing high-quality spaces tailored to the evolving needs of its tenants.The company's upcoming third-quarter earnings release on Nov 2, 2023, before market open, and a conference call later that day, is an event investors should keep an eye on for further insights into its financial performance and strategic outlook.Amid an e-commerce boom, growth in industries and companies making efforts to improve supply-chain efficiencies, the demand for industrial real estate space has been shooting up. Apart from the fast adoption of e-commerce, the industrial real estate space is poised to gain traction over the long run from a likely rise in the inventory levels of companies as a precaution for any supply-chain disruption. This will offer opportunities to industrial landlords, including Plymouth, Prologis PLD and EastGroup Properties EGP, to enjoy a favorable market environment.Plymouth, with its strong leasing activity and strategically planned development program, is well-positioned to benefit from these market trends. The company's impressive leasing results, including strong renewal rates and new leases, highlight its ability to attract and retain tenants. The anticipated rental rate increases demonstrate the financial growth potential of PLYM. Additionally, ongoing development projects contribute to portfolio expansion and provide avenues for future revenue generation.Shares of Plymouth, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), have risen 8.7% year to date against the industry’s decline of 12.5%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPrologis carries a Zacks Rank of 3 at present. PLD’s long-term growth rate is projected at 9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 funds from operations (FFO) per share of $5.59 suggests an 8.3% year-over-year increase.

Rowe Price (TROW) Amid Rising Expenses,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/expansion-efforts-aid-t-rowe-174800788.html,1696614480,STORY,['TROW'],"[T. Rowe Price Group's TROW solid assets under management (AUM) balance and expansion moves are key strengths. Its decent liquidity position helps it sustain steady capital distributions. However, elevated operating expenses and increased dependence on investment advisory fees are likely to hurt the company’s financials.What’s Aiding it?Though the company's net revenues decreased in the first six months of 2023, it witnessed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.2% over a three-year period (ended 2022). Going forward, the company’s focus on fortifying its business by enhancing investment capabilities and mix shift toward international growth funds will likely drive top-line growth.T. Rowe Price has been able to sustain earnings throughout the global financial crisis, supported by its diverse business model. The company's AUM witnessed a CAGR of 5.2% over the past five years (2017-2022). The uptrend persisted in the first half of 2023. The company’s decent business volumes, strong brand and consistent investment track record are likely to keep supporting AUM growth in the upcoming period. Our model estimates AUM to witness at a CAGR of 3.6% by 2025.TROW has successfully expanded its business operations through several opportunistic deals over the years. In April 2023, it acquired Retiree, a fintech firm. Further, T. Rowe Price expanded its footprint and capabilities through the acquisition of Oak Hill Advisors in 2021. With this acquisition, it bulked up its offerings in the alternative investment market space. We believe such endeavors will likely support its prospects in the long-term prospects.TROW’s substantial liquidity, which included total cash and investments of $4.97 billion as of Jun 30, 2023, ensures steady capital distribution activities. The company has hiked quarterly dividends every year since its IPO in 1986, the most recent being a hike of 1.6% in February 2023. Also, in the first half of 2023, it repurchased 0.42 million shares for nearly $45 million. Such efforts reflect the company’s commitment to enhancing shareholder value.Story continuesWhat’s Hurting it?Rising operating expenses are a major concern for the company. Expenses saw a two-year (2020-2022) CAGR of 9%. The rising trend continued in the first half of 2023.As TROW continues to incur expenses to attract new investment advisory clients and make additional investments from existing clients, its ability to expand the bottom line might get hampered. We expect total operating expenses to witness a CAGR of 3.9% by 2025.Investment advisory fees are the biggest revenue source for T. Rowe Price. The increased dependence on these can hurt the company's financials in the near term because of AUM changes, owing to market fluctuations and foreign exchange translation, regulatory changes or a sudden slowdown in business activities.The majority of assets managed by T. Rowe Price are invested in U.S. equities, which seems to be another negative factor. Although T. Rowe Price is making efforts to adopt various strategies to diversify its product mix across other asset classes and geographies, concentration in U.S. equities is a major risk, which could lead to inconsistent asset flows.Analysts are pessimistic about the stock’s earnings prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TROW's current-year earnings has been revised marginally downward over the last seven days. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past six months, shares of TROW have declined 7.2% against the industry's rise of 7.2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFinance Stocks Worth a LookA couple of better-ranked stocks from the finance space are Apollo Global Management APO and Prospect Capital PSEC.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Apollo Global’s current-year earnings has been revised marginally upward over the past 30 days.

If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. That's why when we briefly looked at United Parcel Service's (NYSE:UPS) ROCE trend, we were very happy with what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for United Parcel Service:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.21 = US$12b ÷ (US$70b - US$15b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).So, United Parcel Service has an ROCE of 21%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Logistics industry average of 15%. View our latest analysis for United Parcel Service roceIn the above chart we have measured United Parcel Service's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.So How Is United Parcel Service's ROCE Trending?In terms of United Parcel Service's history of ROCE, it's quite impressive. The company has consistently earned 21% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 65% in that time. Now considering ROCE is an attractive 21%, this combination is actually pretty appealing because it means the business can consistently put money to work and generate these high returns. If these trends can continue, it wouldn't surprise us if the company became a multi-bagger.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On United Parcel Service's ROCEIn short, we'd argue United Parcel Service has the makings of a multi-bagger since its been able to compound its capital at very profitable rates of return. And the stock has followed suit returning a meaningful 56% to shareholders over the last five years. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.One more thing, we've spotted   2 warning signs  facing United Parcel Service that you might find interesting.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

UPS is being affected by rising capital expenditure and weak guidance.Let’s delve deeper.Underperformance: UPS stock dipped 3.6% against its industry’s growth of 13.2% in the past year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSouthward Earnings Estimate Revisions: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings has been revised 36.5% downward over the past 60 days. For the current year, the consensus mark for earnings has moved 12.1% south in the same time frame. The unfavorable estimate revisions indicate brokers’ lack of confidence in the stock.Weak Zacks Rank and Style Score: UPS currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Moreover, its Momentum Score of D shows its short-term unattractiveness.Other Headwinds:  Rising capital expenses further add to its woes. In 2022, UPS incurred $4,769 million of capital expenditures, up 13.7% year over year. The company now expects current-year capital expenditures to be $5.3 billion, well above 2022 levels. The elevated capex guidance, even though aimed at long-term benefits, may dent current-year profit margins.For 2023, United Parcel now anticipates revenues to be around $93 billion (prior view: $97 billion). The consolidated adjusted operating margin is now expected to be around 11.8% (prior view: 12.8%). The five-year deal with International Brotherhood of Teamsters for better pay and working conditions is worth about $30 billion.  Apart from the adverse effects of labor negotiations, weakening demand due to economic slowdown has also led to a decline in the volume of packages shipped.

When using a device that supports facial or fingerprint recognition, select U.S. card members that checkout with SafeKey will be prompted to enable the biometrics, the company said in a statement.Only a select number of U.S. cardholders will initially be eligible for the pilot program, which is set to be rolled out to all U.S. cardholders in early 2024, American Express said.SafeKey is the company’s technology that works in the background during online checkout to make sure it’s really you using your card.

If possible, enable all the security features available on your financial accounts, such as two-factor authentication and other technologies.Story continuesBiometric authentication is one way that companies including tech giants such as Amazon’s Whole Foods, Apple and Google are experimenting with to improve online security. But the technology itself also raises privacy and data security concerns, which the FTC has also warned about.Earlier this year, those concerns led to new legislation introduced in the House and Senate by a group of lawmakers who are seeking a moratorium on biometric surveillance systems by federal, state and local governments. At present, the legislation is still pending in committees at both chambers.Related ContentHow to Monitor Your Credit Reports for FreeScams Cost Consumers $8.8 Billion in 2022 — The Top Five FraudsWhole Foods Quietly Asks for Your Palm PrintJ.D.

NI announced the start of a multi-phase hydrogen blending project, one of the first projects in the United States to use a blending skid in a controlled environment to mix hydrogen and natural gas at precise levels. The idea is to determine the best blend percentages and their benefits for consumers and the environment.The hydrogen blending skid was built by Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, a NiSource subsidiary, in collaboration with EN Engineering. It enables the regulated blending of hydrogen into Safety Town's natural gas system at varying percentages in the range of 2-20%.Highlights of the ProjectNiSource intends to have a wide portfolio of energy sources to fulfil its present and future clean energy demands. The company is exploring hydrogen blending to increase sustainability and provide a safe and reliable energy supply to its customers.NI constructed a specifically designed on-site model home, outfitted with natural gas appliances to imitate daily use in a residential environment in order to show the effectiveness of the mixed fuel. The ongoing field confirmations have determined that hydrogen has a positive impact on natural gas, machinery, pipelines and the overall reduction in carbon emissions caused by blending.The company will continue to assess the potential of hydrogen-natural gas blends for various uses, such as industries and power plants, throughout the multi-phase hydrogen blending project. Future phases of the program may involve introducing a hydrogen-blend into a live-gas environment, utilizing the company's current gas distribution infrastructure that already provides services to consumers, depending on the outcome and data.Focus on Hydrogen BlendingHydrogen is the most abundant element on the planet. It can be generated from a wide range of sources, stored for use in the future, pumped to where it’s needed, and transformed into a clean source of heat and electricity.The addition of hydrogen to energy mix complements renewable energy sources and could contribute to the ongoing global energy transition. Per a report from energynetworks association, blending up to 20% of hydrogen into the gas grid with existing natural gas could save around 6 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions every year.According to an International Energy Agency report, the number of countries with polices that directly support investment in hydrogen technologies is increasing, along with the number of sectors they target.Along with NI, some other utilities like Dominion Energy, Inc. D, NewJersey Resources NJR and Sempra Energy SRE are also adopting hydrogen projects to meet clean-energy targets.In April 2023, Dominion Energy Utah took the next step in its hydrogen blending journey by bringing a 5% blend of hydrogen and gas to a Utah community. The tests found that a 5% hydrogen blend was safe and effective in reducing emissions from natural gas appliances.D’s long-term (three- to five-year) earnings growth rate is 4%. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 4.3% in the last four quarters.In 2023, NJR completed the first year of operation of New Jersey Natural Gas’ milestone green hydrogen blending facility that showcases the real-world value of its pipeline infrastructure to integrate, store, transport and deliver blended green hydrogen.NJR’s long-term earnings growth rate is 6%. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 120.8% in the last four quarters.With a focus on innovation and sustainability, Sempra is advancing more than 20 hydrogen research and development projects to enhance grid resilience and help decarbonize the economy. It is collaborating with strategic research partners, jointly funding nearly $140 million in the last two years for research, development and demonstration initiatives in the areas of cleaner fuels, hydrogen technology and infrastructure.SRE’s long-term earnings growth rate is 4.95%.

For more recession-resilient stocks, head over to 5 Best Stocks to Buy in Falling Markets.Recessions are inevitable and the market has been forecasting a recession in the near future for quite some time. The reason is that since July last year, the yield curve has been inverted, which has often been a signal that recession may be on the horizon. When economic downturns hit, people always tend to invest in safe stocks which may offer them reasonable returns during higher uncertainties. Thus healthcare and consumer staple shares are mostly preferred in those situations when macroeconomic headwinds are high.Companies in the consumer staples are the ones that mostly produce and sell consumer necessity goods. Those goods are bought easily even during recessions because when economic challenges skyrocket, people opt for necessities rather than luxuries. According to The Wall Street Journal, consumer staple stocks are a “bright spot in bleak market”.“Consumer-staples companies are commonly regarded as a haven during volatile markets and recessionary periods,” the WSJ added.Consumers cannot stop buying medicines, prescription drugs or basic household products even when recessions hit, Morningstar analyst Amy Arnott wrote.According to Arnott, healthcare and consumer staple stocks are the most “resilient performers” during economic downturns.Opportunities lie ahead for consumer staple companies as they will maintain their performance and have organic sales growth despite economic downturns this year and into 2024, analyst Amber Kanwar said in an interview on BNN Bloomberg.In the near future, consumer staples will be an important part of stock portfolios as there will be a major focus on low-end consumers, Mona Mahajan, a senior investment strategist at Edward Jones said.Considering recession is imminent and inevitable, according to many analysts, we decided to take a look at some of the best stocks to buy in falling markets which include General Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS), Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and others.Story continuesOur Methodology:We chose stocks from the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund because historically consumer staple companies have performed well in times of economic downturns. In this article, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund has been selected which holds 39 companies in the consumer services industry. The stocks held under this ETF are expected to offer earnings per share growth of 7.61% in the next three to five years. The price/book ratio for this ETF stands at 4.58 for the last year which demonstrates that stocks are trading at premium prices, while the price/earnings ratio for this ETF is at 18.94. The price/earnings ratio compares a company’s share price to its yearly net profits. Anything below 20 would be considered a good price-to-earnings ratio.

GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with MDLZ. Click here to check it out. MDLZ 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of MDLZMondelez International Inc has been operating independently since its split from the former Kraft Foods North American grocery business in October 2012. As a leading player in the global snack arena, it has a significant presence in biscuits, chocolate, gum/candy, beverages, and cheese and grocery aisles.

It derives around one third of its revenue from developing markets, 36% from Europe, and the rest from North America.The current stock price is $61.37, while the estimated GF Value is $79.25, hinting at a potential undervaluation of the stock. Let's delve deeper into the company's financials and valuation metrics to understand this better.Mondelez International (MDLZ): A Closer Look at Its Undervalued StatusUnderstanding GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure that estimates a stock's intrinsic value based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it indicates overvaluation and potential poor future returns. Conversely, if it's significantly below the GF Value Line, the stock may be undervalued, implying higher future returns.For Mondelez International, the GF Value suggests that the stock might be modestly undervalued. As a result, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be higher than its business growth.Mondelez International (MDLZ): A Closer Look at Its Undervalued StatusLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with poor financial strength can lead to a high risk of permanent capital loss. Therefore, it's crucial to review a company's financial strength before purchasing its shares.

This results in a  profitability  rank of 7 out of 10, indicating fair profitability.One key factor in a company's valuation is its  growth . Companies that grow faster create more value for shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. Mondelez International's average annual revenue growth is 8.6%, ranking better than 57.22% of companies in the Consumer Packaged Goods industry. However, its 3-year average EBITDA growth is 0.2%, which ranks worse than 60.58% of companies in the same industry.ROIC vs WACCComparing a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted cost of capital (WACC) can provide insights into its profitability. ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business.

Bitcoin was trading near $40,000 at the time. It’s now trading at around $28,700.Meanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway’s Class A stock has outperformed the cryptocurrency and recently reached an all-time high, surpassing $560,000.Don't missCommercial real estate has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over 25 years. Here's how to diversify your portfolio without the headache of being a landlordRich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwindsOwning real estate for passive income is one of the biggest myths in investing — but here's how you can actually make it workUnsurprisingly, Buffett hasn’t changed his mind about the world’s most persistent digital obsession. “I’ve seen people do stupid things all my life,” Buffett said in an interview with CNBC earlier this year, comparing betting on Bitcoin to playing the slots in Las Vegas.“We’ve had an explosion of gambling, essentially. And I like to bet on a football game — if I’m sitting and watching, it makes it more interesting. But I don’t think I want to make a living trying to bet against the house.”Instead of crypto, Buffett has been laser-focused on his preferred asset class: equities. Here are the top three stocks he’s invested in over the past year that have outperformed Bitcoin by a wide margin.Lennar Corp.Buffett seems to be focused on American homebuilders right now. He added a stake in Lennar Corporation (LEN) sometime in the second quarter of 2023, according to recent regulatory filings.The Florida-based company is one of the largest home builders in the country. That puts it in a favorable position given the shortage of homes across America. Between 2012 and 2022, there were 6.5 million more households formed than homes constructed. If this gap continues to widen, demand for homebuilding could skyrocket.Story continuesBuffett seems to be betting on this trend, adding two other homebuilders, NVR (NVR) and DR Horton (DHI), to his portfolio during the second quarter.Read more: Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now use $100 to cash in on prime real estate — without the headache of being a landlord. Here's howDiageoIn the first quarter of the year, Buffett added a stake in British alcoholic beverage giant Diageo (DEO). But the Oracle of Omaha is no stranger to sin stocks, having acquired a sizable stake in Guinness, the beer brand that would eventually be combined with other brands to form Diageo, back in the 1990s.At the time, Buffett even compared the investment to his most famous bet. “In the sense of where they earn their profits — continent-by-continent — Coca-Cola and Guinness display strong similarities,"" he wrote in a letter to investors that year.Now, Diageo is back in the Berkshire portfolio, and that’s probably a sign that the company is undervalued. The stock trades at just under 19 times earnings per share and offers a 2.57% dividend yield. Meanwhile, Bitcoin's dividend yield is 0% and has a non-existent price-to-earnings ratio.Occidental PetroleumWarren Buffett is clearly bullish on energy, at least in the medium term. That’s why he started accumulating a stake in Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY) last year and now controls over 25% of the company’s outstanding shares.The price of crude oil has rebounded in recent months. In fact, it hit a 10-month high recently and experts expect demand to keep a price floor on the commodity for the year ahead. That’s a major tailwind for oil producers like Occidental.Buffett’s bet on energy giants is now a key part of his portfolio. Considering how cheap these companies are (Occidental stock trades at 11 times earnings), retail investors should consider taking a closer look too.What to read nextWorried about the economy?

We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Boston Scientific Crunching The NumbersWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.63bUS$2.85bUS$3.18bUS$3.37bUS$3.53bUS$3.66bUS$3.78bUS$3.89bUS$4.00bUS$4.10bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 4.51%Est @ 3.80%Est @ 3.31%Est @ 2.96%Est @ 2.72%Est @ 2.55% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.8% US$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.6kUS$2.6kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$24bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.1b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.2%) = US$90bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$90b÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)10= US$47bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$71b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$52.1, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Boston Scientific as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.932. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Boston ScientificStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Medical Equipment industry.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.Shareholders have been diluted in the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.ThreatRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

The worries are compounded by a report from BMO that the obesity drug market could reach $100 billion by 2035 causing further impacts to consumer habits for the companies.Yahoo Finance Anchors Seana Smith and Brad Smith break down the current down trend for the beverage companies as well as what this means for the bigger picture of consumer habits in this space.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: Well, let's get into the food and beverage industry, a little more tasty here than oil. PepsiCo shares-- I'm not, you know-- anyway, PepsiCo shares, you're seeing them move on the day as well as Coke after weight loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy are spooking investors in the snack and beverage space.Yesterday we heard from Walmart's US head of business on the impact of food sales. Not all bad news. Goldman Sachs is seeing mid single-digit volume growth for Pepsi in 2024. And that's without any more price increases here.So shares of Coca-Cola are down fractionally. Shares of Pepsi down by about 1.2% right now. And Walmart really, I think, got out in front of-- or at least for the reaction that we saw from the street was trying to signal or at least couch some of the expectations for declining performance or worsened performance in some of the aisles in the store by saying, yeah, people aren't as hungry just because they're taking so many of these what's now viral weight loss-- you know, weight loss but also is a much larger kind of-- not even a nutrition.It's just like a pill essentially. It's flabbergasting honestly at the of the day that so many people have gone into this and looked at it without some of the side effects that could take place. And I just kind of read through some of these. And I'm just like, my goodness, all right. Well, sure, yeah, it's gonna impact Pepsi and Coca-Cola and Walmart. But at the end of the day, like, we've got to be smarter about the things that we're putting in our bodies too.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly a lot of the warnings out there just in terms of the adverse side effects that are associated with these drugs, certainly very important to keep in mind. When we talk about the business implications of this, what it could mean for sales for some of these consumer-staple companies, obviously, it's something that has been warned about by some analysts.Going back to March, Morgan Stanley was out with a note saying that they do expect some sort of hit here to some of these consumer-staple companies considering the fact that the pool of patients is expected to grow to 24 million people taking these types of drugs, about 7% of the overall US population. That's only just within the next decade.So we talk about the pressure that that could put on companies. I think investors are gonna be paying very close attention to these earnings calls on the heels of what we just heard from one of Walmart's executives earlier this week. We have Pepsi coming out on Tuesday, next Tuesday, Coca-Cola on October 24.So we're seeing some of the worry in the market when it comes to some of these consumer staples when you see the downward pressure in Coca-Cola, downward pressure in Pepsi for a second day in a row. I think everyone's trying to figure out exactly what that roadmap looks like going forward given the fact that if Walmart is right in terms of the trends that they are seeing and the fact that people are pulling back on some of their spending if they are taking these types of drugs. Clearly, that could mean a huge hit across the board for many of these companies.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, this is even more. And it goes deeper than even Wegovy and Ozempic. It goes back to where people are getting this thought or getting this perception that they need to look a certain way, feel a certain way. There were studies that were initiated even prepandemic and leading up to the pandemic, talking about the dangers of Instagram and looking at so many different figures out there that would make you want to compare yourself.And I think with all of that considered, it's time for us to perhaps reinitiate even more of those studies to talk about where there's still a role that social media has to account for, Meta platforms, whether it's Google, all of these different places where studies have revealed that there are issues that show body dissatisfaction, mental health issues all stemming from an exuberance or abundance of use of some of the platforms, too.So that's not me just-- you know, I'm not a parent. I'm nobody's parent out there. You can decide what your own FaceTime, what your own screen time looks like. But at the end of the day, there are some serious disorders that have been started. And it's unfortunate as well as how that's impacted society.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, extremely unfortunate, obviously. Very, very important to keep in mind.]"

Price and EPS SurprisePepsiCo, Inc. price-eps-surprise | PepsiCo, Inc. QuoteKey Factors to NotePepsiCo has been benefiting from strength and resilience in its diversified portfolio, modernized supply chain, improved digital capabilities, flexible go-to-market distribution systems, and robust consumer demand trends. The company is likely to have gained from delivering convenience, variety and value proposition to customers through its brands in the to-be-reported quarter.PEP’s third-quarter results are expected to reflect gains from improved pricing across all segments. The bottom line is likely to reflect the continued benefits of the mitigation of inflationary pressures through cost-management and revenue-management initiatives. PepsiCo is likely to have benefited from the resilience and strength of the global beverage and convenient food businesses.We expect year-over-year consolidated organic revenue growth of 8% for the third quarter, driven by a 12.1% rise in the price/mix, offset by a 4.1% decline in volume.Market share growth in the liquid refreshment beverage category, with share gains in the carbonated soft drinks, ready-to-drink tea and water categories, is likely to have aided the improvement in the beverage category. Investments in innovation and execution also bode well.The company’s food business has been gaining from revenue growth across core brands like Doritos, Lay’s, Ruffles, Tostitos and Cheetos. The Quaker business has been benefiting from market share gains in the rice and pasta, lite snacks, ready-to-eat cereal, and snack bar categories, as it has been capitalizing on the elevated demand for tasty products that deliver convenience and value.However, PepsiCo’s third-quarter gross margin is expected to have been partly negated by inflationary labor, transportation and commodity costs. Adverse currency rates are also likely to have been headwinds.Increased advertising and marketing expenses, along with additional investments to build digital capabilities and integrate purpose throughout the company, are likely to have led to a rise in SG&amp;A expenses in the to-be-reported quarter.We anticipate the adjusted gross margin to expand 60 bps to 54% in the third quarter. Margin growth can be attributed to the easing of supply-chain headwinds, partly offset by inflationary costs. Meanwhile, our estimate for adjusted SG&amp;A expenses of $8.5 billion indicates a year-over-year rise of 4.3%. Driven by the gross margin expansion and higher SG&amp;A expenses, our model suggests a 30-bps operating margin expansion to 16.7% in the third quarter.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for PepsiCo this time around.

Salesforce (CRM) and Adobe (ADBE) stocks have seen declines of more than 8% over the past month and even the biggest software names such as Microsoft (MSFT) aren't immune.Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne recently published a note, offering some advice to investors.""Embrace the suck, but only if you can take a 6-9 month view,"" he wrote on Oct. 4. ""While every pullback in software is unique given that the industry is still maturing and every company is at a different point on the maturity curve, the common thread across nearly every [second half of the year] pullback over the last 10 years is that software outperforms the S&amp;P 500 off the bottom.""This pullback in software stocks goes back to macroeconomic uncertainty as the economy adjusts to higher interest rates and a shifting post-pandemic landscape. Software stocks have gone through these sorts of withdrawals in the back half of the year before.""We believe this pullback is similar to other ... pullbacks in that investors are taking profits in the face of macro uncertainty — sensible — and we won’t have a great read on [information technology] spending budgets for another 30-60 days,"" Materne wrote.To be clear, this is far from the worst tech sell-off, and there's still overarching positive data.The Nasdaq remains up about 27% year to date and its long-term upward trajectory is clear. Over the last five years, the Nasdaq has gone up approximately 76%.Software companies to watchTo Materne's point, if software stocks leap off the bottom, who's set to win?Look at the large-cap names, according to Materne, including Microsoft, Adobe, Intuit (INTU), and Palo Alto Networks (PANW). He also identified a select group of growth names as possible winners, calling out Snowflake (SNOW), CrowdStrike (CRWD), and HubSpot (HUBS).Story continuesFor many of these names, Wall Street agrees there's room to run.Take Adobe, for example. CFRA analyst Angelo Zino, who has a Buy rating on the stock, suggests that Adobe shares have upside, especially given the company's potential to leverage AI.""Our Buy recommendation reflects our view of potential AI monetization opportunities, dominant position in select content creation apps with formidable competitive advantages, and cross-selling prospects,"" Zino wrote on Sept. 30.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella delivers the keynote address at the company's annual conference for software developers on Monday, May 6, 2019, in Seattle. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Next, consider Intuit, which just held its annual investor day on Sept. 28. AI came up again.""In our view, the analyst day provided a good incremental update on Intuit’s platform and AI strategy,"" William Blair's Matthew Pfau wrote on Sept. 29. ""We believe the company is positioning itself well to continue to grow the top line in the low- to mid-teens while providing margin expansion.""What would these companies be excited about if it weren't AI? It's hard to know.But AI or not, this is a movie investors have seen before, and it's a reminder that investing in software isn't for the faint of heart. It's more cyclical than investors might like to think, and it's in transition between a growth industry and a mature sector.With that history in mind, some say this is an opportunity.""While we expect that software stocks are at the mercy of the macro backdrop (and interest rates) in the immediate near-term, prior [second half of the year] pullbacks in software have ultimately proven to be great relative buying opportunities when taking a 180 or 365 day view,"" Materne wrote. ""This one feels similar — though bigger is better this time around in terms of large cap continuing to outperform small-cap.""Allie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

But is now the time to buy? Yahoo Finance's Allie Garfinkle has the details for us. Allie.ALLIE GARFINKLE: Akiko, for software stocks right now, as Olivia Rodrigo would say, it's brutal out there. And while it sounds like I'm being facetious, September was actually the worst month for tech stock since May. And going into this month, that slide has continued. We're still-- you know, and right now, it's software, of course, in the crosshairs, right? Salesforce, Adobe, both down more than 8% over the last four weeks. And it really comes down to macro pressure. Yes, it's high interest rates.There's also really limited visibility, end of the year, as to where clients are going to be spending and how comfortable they're going to be doing that spending. That said, I think it's important to say we've seen this movie before. There's history here.Over the last 12 years, the software space has had a number of pullbacks, especially in the second half of the year. And then those stocks will leap off the bottom. To this end, Evercore analyst-- Evercore analyst Kirk Materne had some advice for investors. It's a very Olivia Rodrigo-esque take. What he writes is, ""Embrace the suck, but only if you can take a six- to nine-month view.""AKIKO FUJITA: Allie, this might be your first, I think-- software and Olivia Rodrigo. I did not make the connection. But let's talk about those investors who are looking into this space. You know, what companies are analysts calling out as having upside?Story continuesALLIE GARFINKLE: Olivia Rodrigo's side? Look at the large caps here, Akiko. Look at Adobe. Look at Intuit. And yes, Microsoft is in that bag, but Microsoft is perhaps the most obvious of them. If you think about Adobe, think about AI. They're rolling out AI features left and right into it. Same deal, investor day, generative AI was really featured. That's what-- that's what we're expecting to see help kind of lift these companies off the bottom.That's certainly the story, at the very least, that they're selling-- that they're selling to Wall Street. And I should say also, Wall Street is optimistic about a few smaller caps. Snowflake, CrowdStrike, HubSpot are in that category. That said, if you're an investor saying yes right now to software, if you're really ready to invest, remember, you're going to be embracing the suck.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, that'll certainly be a line to leave us with as we go into the weekend.

The contract aims to aid in advancing a platform and specific candidates designed to address various public health threats in viral infectious diseases.The awarded funding will likely enable research, development and clinical evaluation of potent multispecific antibodies based on ModeX’s proprietary MSTAR technology.The contract is expected to boost ModeX’s research and development programs related to the multispecific antibodies, thereby solidifying OPKO Health’s foothold in the niche space.Background of the ContractThe SARS-CoV-2 program is supported by HHS’ Project NextGen, which is dedicated to advancing a pipeline of innovative vaccines and therapeutics against COVID-19. The BARDA contract includes an initial $59 million for the development, manufacturing and execution of a Phase 1 clinical trial for a next-generation MSTAR multispecific antibody with broad neutralizing activity against known variants of SARS-CoV-2. Such antibodies have the potential for both treatment and prevention of COVID-19.Significance of the ContractThe initiative builds on a collaboration between ModeX and the Vaccine Research Center of the National Institutes of Health for the discovery and characterization of novel therapeutic antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Additional funding of up to $109 million may be available from BARDA upon achieving particular milestones to develop multispecific antibodies targeting other viral pathogens, such as influenza. As part of the research program, gene-based delivery methods for the multispecific antibodies are expected to be developed using mRNA or DNA vectors to leverage the body’s natural protein production processes.Per management, the latest contract from BARDA is expected to advance the potential of OPKO Health’s MSTAR multispecific antibody platform as a versatile solution to major viral threats. Management also believes that BARDA’s support will likely allow ModeX to assess promising candidates in clinical trials to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and explore the utility of the platform against diverse viruses.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a report by Future Market Insights, the global next-generation immunotherapies market is expected to reach $112.88 billion in 2023 at a CAGR of 7.5% from 2023 to 2033.

DGX recently inked a strategic lab services agreement with Neway.  The agreement aims to accelerate dialysis laboratory testing and reduce the laboratory costs of dialysis programs for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).The latest development is likely to broaden Quest Diagnostics' laboratory services offering.More on AgreementAccording to the terms of the agreement, Neway will leverage Quest Diagnostics' broad lab network to deliver local dialysis laboratory testing services with typically next-day results after arriving at a Quest Diagnostics laboratory.The collaboration between Quest Diagnostics and Neway will provide an alternative to the centralized lab paradigm, in which the majority of dialysis programs in the United States transmit specimens to a single laboratory for processing.Neway and its connected dialysis centers as well as their patients will benefit from speedier testing and results reporting as well as decreased transportation expenses by utilising Quest Diagnostics' distributed lab network.Strategic EffortsQuest Diagnostics -- a pioneer in cardiometabolic diagnostic solutions, including renal disease, knows the specific issues that patients with ESRD confront, as well as the importance of speedy testing that never compromises on quality. Through a partnership with Neway, the company will overcome these obstacles and speed test results while preserving the highest level of quality for ESRD patients in collaboration with Neway.Further, it is worth mentioning that the 'new way' for dialysis laboratory testing is a nationwide decentralized network of laboratory facilities. This method benefits dialysis patients, dialysis programs, insurance payers, and the dialysis industry as a whole. It is a win-win situation for everyone.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Grand View Research, the global end-stage renal disease market size was valued at $ 99.1 billion in 2022 and is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 13.0% by 2030. An increasing number of patients suffering from kidney failure and the introduction of technologically advanced products, such as low-maintenance dialysis equipment and artificial kidneys, are the major factors expected to drive the market.Story continuesProgress Within Laboratory BusinessIn March 2023, Quest Diagnostics acquired select assets of Northern Light Laboratory --  a large integrated healthcare system in Maine.

But the risk of stock picking is that you will likely buy under-performing companies. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) shareholders, since the share price is down 38% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 21%. Furthermore, it's down 16% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders.Given the past week has been tough on shareholders, let's investigate the fundamentals and see what we can learn. View our latest analysis for Whirlpool While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over the three years that the share price declined, Whirlpool's earnings per share (EPS) dropped significantly, falling to a loss. Extraordinary items contributed to this situation. Due to the loss, it's not easy to use EPS as a reliable guide to the business. But it's safe to say we'd generally expect the share price to be lower as a result!The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Whirlpool's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Whirlpool, it has a TSR of -31% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 18% in the last year, Whirlpool shareholders lost 5.7% (even including dividends). Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 8%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Whirlpool better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 3 warning signs  with Whirlpool (at least 1 which is concerning)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

The company remains on track with its long-term targets, with profitable growth of 5-6% and ongoing EBIT margin expansion of 11%-12%.Based in Benton Harbor, MI, Whirlpool currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). It belongs to the Zacks Household Appliances industry, which comes under the ambit of the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector.Let’s delve into the factors that make investing in this home appliance manufacturer a smart choice at the moment.Whirlpool remains well-positioned to benefit from the recovery in the U.S. homebuilding market, which is likely to boost its product demand going forward. Its focus on protecting its margins and productivity amid ongoing supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures bodes well. For instance, it has implemented several cost-takeout actions, including curtailing structural and discretionary costs, capturing raw material deflation opportunities, effectively managing working capital and syncing supply chain and labor levels with demand.WHR launched a cost-takeout program worth $500 million that is likely to reduce fixed and variable costs in 2023. It has been actively pursuing its cost management actions and expects $800-$900 million related to gains from these measures and eased raw material inflation.In April 2022, Whirlpool concluded the strategic review of Europe, the Middle East and Africa operations. The company’s major domestic appliance business in Europe will form a new entity with Arçelik. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2023, subject to certain regulatory approvals. The new company is likely to generate more than €6 billion in annual sales and more than €200 million in cost synergies. While Arçelik will own 75% of the new entity, WHR will retain the remaining stake.The company also remains committed to rewarding its shareholders through dividend payouts and share buyback programs. In the first six months of 2023, the company returned $193 million in cash to shareholders as dividends. At the end of second-quarter 2023, it had $2.6 billion remaining as share repurchase authorization.However, the company has been experiencing a tough operating environment and tepid global demand amid high inflation. In the second quarter, the company’s net sales fell 6% to $4,792 million from the year-ago quarter. For 2023, WHR expects net sales to be $19.4 billion, suggesting a 1-2% decline from the prior-year figure.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares of the company have inched down 1.3% in the past six months against the industry’s growth of 1.5%.Other Key PicksSome other top-ranked companies in the consumer discretionary sector are Sonos, Inc.

This company, which is in the Zacks Technology Services industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This manufacturer has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 5.56%.For the most recent quarter, Trane Technologies was expected to post earnings of $2.55 per share, but it reported $2.68 per share instead, representing a surprise of 5.10%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.33 per share, while it actually produced $1.41 per share, a surprise of 6.02%.With this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Trane Technologies. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Trane Technologies currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.89%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

NI announced the start of a multi-phase hydrogen blending project, one of the first projects in the United States to use a blending skid in a controlled environment to mix hydrogen and natural gas at precise levels. The idea is to determine the best blend percentages and their benefits for consumers and the environment.The hydrogen blending skid was built by Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, a NiSource subsidiary, in collaboration with EN Engineering. It enables the regulated blending of hydrogen into Safety Town's natural gas system at varying percentages in the range of 2-20%.Highlights of the ProjectNiSource intends to have a wide portfolio of energy sources to fulfil its present and future clean energy demands. The company is exploring hydrogen blending to increase sustainability and provide a safe and reliable energy supply to its customers.NI constructed a specifically designed on-site model home, outfitted with natural gas appliances to imitate daily use in a residential environment in order to show the effectiveness of the mixed fuel. The ongoing field confirmations have determined that hydrogen has a positive impact on natural gas, machinery, pipelines and the overall reduction in carbon emissions caused by blending.The company will continue to assess the potential of hydrogen-natural gas blends for various uses, such as industries and power plants, throughout the multi-phase hydrogen blending project. Future phases of the program may involve introducing a hydrogen-blend into a live-gas environment, utilizing the company's current gas distribution infrastructure that already provides services to consumers, depending on the outcome and data.Focus on Hydrogen BlendingHydrogen is the most abundant element on the planet. It can be generated from a wide range of sources, stored for use in the future, pumped to where it’s needed, and transformed into a clean source of heat and electricity.The addition of hydrogen to energy mix complements renewable energy sources and could contribute to the ongoing global energy transition. Per a report from energynetworks association, blending up to 20% of hydrogen into the gas grid with existing natural gas could save around 6 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions every year.According to an International Energy Agency report, the number of countries with polices that directly support investment in hydrogen technologies is increasing, along with the number of sectors they target.Along with NI, some other utilities like Dominion Energy, Inc. D, NewJersey Resources NJR and Sempra Energy SRE are also adopting hydrogen projects to meet clean-energy targets.In April 2023, Dominion Energy Utah took the next step in its hydrogen blending journey by bringing a 5% blend of hydrogen and gas to a Utah community. The tests found that a 5% hydrogen blend was safe and effective in reducing emissions from natural gas appliances.D’s long-term (three- to five-year) earnings growth rate is 4%. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 4.3% in the last four quarters.In 2023, NJR completed the first year of operation of New Jersey Natural Gas’ milestone green hydrogen blending facility that showcases the real-world value of its pipeline infrastructure to integrate, store, transport and deliver blended green hydrogen.NJR’s long-term earnings growth rate is 6%. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 120.8% in the last four quarters.With a focus on innovation and sustainability, Sempra is advancing more than 20 hydrogen research and development projects to enhance grid resilience and help decarbonize the economy. It is collaborating with strategic research partners, jointly funding nearly $140 million in the last two years for research, development and demonstration initiatives in the areas of cleaner fuels, hydrogen technology and infrastructure.SRE’s long-term earnings growth rate is 4.95%.

VMC 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of VMCVulcan Materials Co, the United States' largest producer of construction aggregates, operates in major markets like Texas, California, Virginia, Tennessee, Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, and Alabama.

The company's current stock price is $211.59, and it has a market cap of $28.10 billion. Comparing this price with the GF Value of $230.42, we can start to gauge whether the stock is over, under, or fairly valued.Unveiling Vulcan Materials Co (VMC)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary valuation model that considers historical multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past returns and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.According to the GF Value calculation, Vulcan Materials Co stock shows every sign of being fairly valued. This suggests that the long-term return of its stock is likely to be close to the rate of its business growth.Unveiling Vulcan Materials Co (VMC)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideFinancial StrengthChecking the financial strength of a company before buying its stock is crucial. Investing in companies with poor financial strength have a higher risk of permanent loss.

To skip our detailed analysis of the renewable energy sector in 2023, go directly and see 5 Countries with the Cleanest Air in the World.As the climate crisis exacerbates globally, governments, especially from countries with the cleanest air in the world, are diverting greater focus towards achieving net-zero carbon emission targets by 2050. However, according to an analysis by McKinsey and Company, achieving these goals will necessarily require greater investment in electricity generation via renewable energy sources. However, according to Deloitte, in 2022, renewable energy growth was significantly hampered in the US, which is one of the countries with the cleanest air in the world, due to rising costs and project delays, which in turn were driven by global supply chain disruptions, skyrocketing inflation, increasing interest rates, glaring uncertainties in trade policies, and interconnection delays. Nevertheless, with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act and increasing demand, robust growth within the renewable energy industry is expected in 2023. Some of the largest players in the renewable energy sector which are likely to be affected by these trends are NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE), General Electric Co. (NYSE:GE), and Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG). To delve into further detail about the global clean energy sector in 2023, check out our coverage of the  11 Most Undervalued Renewable Energy Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.Within the next decade, a report by McKinsey estimates that global renewable energy capacity will drastically increase to more than 8,800 gigawatts. Of this, the vast majority will be derived from onshore wind and solar power. However, the report also points out that additional solar panels and onshore wind turbines will require substantial land space, the overall implications of which are ominous. Developers will need to continuously identify new sites at a time when the availability of suitable, economically desirable land is dire. Further constraints that are likely to hamper the growth of the global renewable energy sector are different regulatory and sustainability limits, the upsurge in land prices globally, long and unpredictable development timelines, and increased grid congestions.Story continuesClean Energy Transition in the Oil and Gas Industry: An AnalysisSince the burning of fossil fuels like oil and gas is one of the greatest sources of carbon emissions and with climate change assuming a higher priority for countries with the cleanest air in the world, efforts to impose a sustainable transition to a lower-carbon energy model are underway and require fundamental shifts in how energy is produced and consumed globally. These shifts require strategic adjustments by businesses. According to an article by McKinsey, oil and gas companies which have long relied on fossil fuels for electricity generation are not spared from this global transition and find themselves needing to navigate an environment in which incredibly strict carbon-reduction targets are likely to impact investment decisions. However, the oil and gas industry is still largely uncertain about where to support initiatives like offshore generation, EV charging, and hydrogen production and development. As a result, operating models for new and legacy companies are undergoing drastic transformations in the face of competition from companies like NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE), General Electric Co. (NYSE:GE), and Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG).According to McKinsey's Global Energy Perspective 2022, fossil fuels like oil and natural gas are widely projected to sustain a  significant share of the energy mix at least till 2050, partly due to their methods of combining affordability and security of supply. Regardless, the report still postulates that the oil and gas industry is adequately positioned to play a meaningful role in the global energy transition effort. Some of the main reasons for this are their massive global footprint, the risk appetite of their investors, their expansive balance sheets and cash positions, and their long-standing relationships with energy consumers and stakeholders. A quick analysis of how strategic choices can aid in the implementation of a sustainable power value chain reveals three primary ways oil and gas companies can lead in the global energy transition effort.One of the primary ways in which they can do this is by constructing an operational model whereby customer centricity is at the core. Business models tend to constantly evolve as innovation shapes technology and services landscapes worldwide. Oil and gas companies can leverage their existing business and deep technical capabilities to aid in creating value in key segments of the energy transition, all the while creating specific and integrated customer offerings that are tailored to individual requirements. This customer centric approach ensures oil and gas players enter production when demand is rising, invest capital in projects best suited to consumer needs, and help define a unique operating model. To know more about some of the measures the oil and gas industry is taking to reduce their carbon footprint substantially, check out our article on Top 20 Countries with the Highest Oil Consumption.Secondly, the oil and gas sector must implement energy management and risk-exposure practices to contend with fluctuating prices, turbulent geopolitical circumstances and demand shocks. As a result, the industry has developed a robust and adaptable risk culture that continuously plays into investment decisions. Investors in renewables have already shown substantial tolerance to the risks of exposure to power markets, as evidenced by the 2021 Uri winter storm in the United States.Thirdly, oil and gas companies need to offset geopolitical fluctuations by diversifying their product portfolios and optimize risk returns. Balancing risk exposure across entire portfolios can improve a company's risk/return profile, compared with non-diversified portfolios. Furthermore, through diversified portfolios, companies can improve their project returns through higher leverage over countries with the cleanest air in the world.Three Trends in the Renewable Energy Industry: An OverviewAccording to Deloitte, skyrocketing demand in 2023 could present serious problems for the growth of the renewable power industry through its exacerbation of supply chain disruptions and interconnection bottlenecks, thereby driving prices further up and extending project deadlines. Furthermore, clogs in the transmission belt could further hamper industry growth until capacity is substantially expanded. The report highlights three major evolving trends and opportunities that could help the industry navigate headwinds and increase growth in 2023, setting the stage for faster growth in 2024.One primary trend that is instantly apparent is that rising clean energy component manufacturing could grease supply chain clogs over a short period of time. Currently, American manufacturing does not meet the renewable energy sector's needs for clean energy components held up by sustainable domestic supply chains. Since then, the Inflation Reduction Act 2022 has exacerbated new plant announcements and has encouraged significant investment. This points towards a favorable environment for renewable energy companies in the longer term in countries with the cleanest air in the world.Another trend that cannot be ignored is that new clean hydrogen economics could pave new pathways for renewable providers. The enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 has ignited interest in green hydrogen. While lack of infrastructure makes hydrogen production unfeasible, policies driven by the Act could open doors for renewable energy companies like NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE), General Electric Co. (NYSE:GE), and Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG) to benefit in 2023, causing investors to flock towards these stocks.Lastly, an important sign that the renewable energy sector is maturing as an industry is that it is increasingly entering the scopes of different cyber attacks. With cyber threats projected to rise significantly in 2023, it is a good indicator that the clean energy transition is progressing, especially in countries with the cleanest air in the world. Biggest Wind Farms in the WorldPixabay/Public DomainOur MethodologyTo compile our list of the 30 countries with the cleanest air in the world, we looked at the IQAir's World Air Quality Report, which ranks countries based on their AQI (Air Quality Index) as of 2022. The AQI takes into account pollutants such as PM2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O3) concentration levels. The higher the AQI value in a country, the greater the level of overall air pollution. For instance, an AQI value of 30 or below represents good air quality while an AQI value north of 300 represents hazardous air quality. We also looked at the Environment Protection Index by Yale University and the Global Green Economy Index (GGEI) to examine annual trends in air quality. We did this to account for seasonal variations, fluctuations and to validate our results. Subsequently, we selected 30 countries with the lowest AQI and ranked them from highest to lowest.Many of the countries that feature in this list also feature on our list of the 5 Most Advanced Countries in Renewable Energy. Countries with the Cleanest Air in the World30.

Most of the motor fuels that come from Valero’s Corpus Christi refinery come from the West Plant, which plant processes both sweet crude and sour crude, as well as residual fuel oil, according to Valero’s website.The East and West refineries produce gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, asphalt, and aromatics.Distillate inventories in the United States have long languished well below what is typical for this time of year. At last EIA count, distillate inventories in the United States were 13% below the five-year average.News of the shutdown comes as Russia, the world’s top seaborne diesel exporter, lifted its ban on pipeline diesel imports after just a week. The ban lifted the price of crude oil most suitable for making diesel and jet fuel, sending prices for this feedstock upward.Valero’s West plant receives some of its feedstock by tanker or barge via deepwater docking facilities along the Corpus Christi Ship Channel, while West Texas or South Texas crude oil comes into the refinery via pipeline, Valero’s website explains.The West plant was commissioned in 1983, then known as the Bill Greehey refinery.

But union officials countered that they were left waiting for a ""meaningful response"" from company executives to all their biggest demands.After a day of little apparent communication between them, the two parties announced on Friday they had agreed to resume negotiations on Oct. 12.The current strike was set to conclude at 6 a.m. local time on Saturday, as healthcare workers are barred by law from extending the duration of a walkout unless 10 days' advance notice is given.UNION WARNINGHowever, the union coalition warned on Friday of that labor peace would be short-lived if ""Kaiser executives continue to commit unfair labor practices and bargain in bad faith.""""It is possible that the coalition will issue a 10-day strike notice after Saturday, which could lead to further striking by Kaiser employees after those ten days,"" it said.Kaiser's previous four-year labor contract expired on Sept. 30, after nearly six months of labor negotiations.The union coalition has accused the company of failing to address a prolonged staffing crunch that has left employees feeling overworked and underpaid while compromising patient care.The company has acknowledged staffing shortages plaguing the entire sector, a consequence of occupational ""burnout"" from the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to more than 5 million medical workers leaving their jobs.Short staffing and high turnover were among the final sticking points left to be settled, as were union demands to limit outsourcing of jobs to vendors and third-party subcontractors.Union officials have said pay increases was another major point of contention, while the company argued that it already led competitors in total compensation packages in every market where Kaiser operates.Unions across the United States have grown bolder in their demands in the past two years, pressing for higher wages and better benefits in a tighter post-pandemic labor market.Government data shows 2023 is already the busiest year for strikes overall since 2019, with nearly 309,700 workers involved in work stoppages through August this year.The largest number of workers previously involved in a major walkout in the healthcare sector was 53,000 in 2018, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,The coalition of eight unions representing medical professionals and support staff at Kaiser insisted the company commit to hiring at least 10,000 new workers, in addition to filling some 4,000 recent vacancies.Kaiser nationwide serves some 13 million patients and employs 68,000 nurses and 213,000 technicians, clerical workers, and administrative staff, alongside its 24,000 doctors.

The pursuit of buyouts, a solid financial position and a robust 2023 outlook are other tailwinds.Zacks Rank &amp; Price PerformanceUnitedHealth Group currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The stock has gained 11.8% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 9.2% rise.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRising EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for UnitedHealth Group’s 2023 earnings and revenues is pegged at $24.83 per share and $368.2 billion, respectively, indicating an improvement of 11.9% and 13.6% from the year-ago reported figures.UNH boasts an impressive surprise record. Its earnings outpaced estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 3.4%.Solid Return on EquityUnitedHealth Group’s efficiency in utilizing shareholders’ funds can be substantiated by its trailing 12-month return on equity of 26.7%, which remains higher than the industry’s average of 23.2%.Robust 2023 OutlookUnitedHealth Group anticipates revenues between $357 billion and $360 billion, the mid-point of which indicates an improvement of 10.6% from the 2022 reported figure.Adjusted net earnings per share are estimated to be between $24.70 and $25 for the year. The mid-point of the updated guidance suggests 12% growth from the 2022 figure.Key DriversRevenues of UnitedHealth Group continue to benefit from solid contributions from its UnitedHealthcare and Optum businesses. Premiums contributed 78% to the company’s total revenues in the second quarter. It is expected to rise further as UnitedHealth Group continues to serve more people through Medicare and Medicaid Advantage plans.Through the UnitedHealthcare unit, UNH devises effective Medicare and Medicaid businesses, as well as integrates lucrative features within them from time to time. The top line of UnitedHealthcare segment is expected to benefit as the company grows its existing Medicaid markets and serves more people through fee-based and risk-based commercial offerings.Story continuesThe company expects to add more than 900,000 members to its Medicare Advantage plan this year, expanding its membership base and fetching higher premiums. The Medicaid business is set to grow as it continues to support states in initiating redeterminations. The company aims to reach 96% of all Medicare customers with its 2024 Individual Medicare Advantage Plan.Optum Health segment will continue to gain from more people served under value-based care arrangements and consistent strengthening of care delivery services. Optum Insight and Optum Rx are expected to benefit from enhanced capabilities and new sales and opportunities. However, excellent customer retention should also favor Optum Rx results. The company expects to serve more than 4 million patients in value-based care arrangements through Optum in 2023.UnitedHealth Group has been pursuing collaborations with renowned healthcare providers to bolster its capabilities and solidify its nationwide presence. Its acquisition of Amedisys should enhance and expand its in-home capabilities and fuel growth in the Optum Health segment. Moreover, UNH will get access to Amedisys’s Medicare customers, thus enhancing its benefits business in the future. The company’s launch of Price Edge and zero-cost life-saving drugs should help retain more customers in the future. Its partnership with ProHealth Care should also aid Optum’s result in the future.The company also earns through investment income. The metric increased nearly three-fold in the second quarter. A high-interest rate environment should boost this metric in the future.A solid financial position is a dire need for companies that keep an eye on continued business investments. Apart from growth-related initiatives, a sound financial stand instills confidence in UNH in the tactical deployment of capital through share buybacks and dividend payments. The company returned $8.3 billion to shareholders in the first half of 2023 through share repurchases and dividends. Its dividend yield of 1.5% remains higher than the industry’s figure of 1.3%. UNH expects operating cash flow in the range of $27-$28 billion in 2023.UNH currently carries an impressive Value Score of B.Key ConcernsThe health insurer has been experiencing an increase in operating expenses due to higher medical and operating costs and the cost of goods sold. Such expenses continue to weigh on the margin expansion. We expect total operating costs to rise 12% in 2023. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive growth in the long term.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the Medical space are Molina Healthcare, Inc. MOH, The Ensign Group, Inc. ENSG and Medpace Holdings, Inc. MEDP.

PEP is expected to register bottom and top-line growth when it reports third-quarter 2023 numbers on Oct 10, before the opening bell. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $23.4 billion, implying 6.5% growth from the year-ago quarter's reported figure.For quarterly earnings, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.17, suggesting 10.2% growth from the $1.97 reported in the prior-year quarter. The consensus mark has moved down by a penny in the past 30 days.In the last reported quarter, the company reported an earnings beat of 7.2%. It has delivered an earnings surprise of 6.3%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.PepsiCo, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise PepsiCo, Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePepsiCo, Inc. price-eps-surprise | PepsiCo, Inc. QuoteKey Factors to NotePepsiCo has been benefiting from strength and resilience in its diversified portfolio, modernized supply chain, improved digital capabilities, flexible go-to-market distribution systems, and robust consumer demand trends. The company is likely to have gained from delivering convenience, variety and value proposition to customers through its brands in the to-be-reported quarter.PEP’s third-quarter results are expected to reflect gains from improved pricing across all segments. The bottom line is likely to reflect the continued benefits of the mitigation of inflationary pressures through cost-management and revenue-management initiatives. PepsiCo is likely to have benefited from the resilience and strength of the global beverage and convenient food businesses.We expect year-over-year consolidated organic revenue growth of 8% for the third quarter, driven by a 12.1% rise in the price/mix, offset by a 4.1% decline in volume.Market share growth in the liquid refreshment beverage category, with share gains in the carbonated soft drinks, ready-to-drink tea and water categories, is likely to have aided the improvement in the beverage category. Investments in innovation and execution also bode well.The company’s food business has been gaining from revenue growth across core brands like Doritos, Lay’s, Ruffles, Tostitos and Cheetos. The Quaker business has been benefiting from market share gains in the rice and pasta, lite snacks, ready-to-eat cereal, and snack bar categories, as it has been capitalizing on the elevated demand for tasty products that deliver convenience and value.However, PepsiCo’s third-quarter gross margin is expected to have been partly negated by inflationary labor, transportation and commodity costs. Adverse currency rates are also likely to have been headwinds.Increased advertising and marketing expenses, along with additional investments to build digital capabilities and integrate purpose throughout the company, are likely to have led to a rise in SG&amp;A expenses in the to-be-reported quarter.We anticipate the adjusted gross margin to expand 60 bps to 54% in the third quarter. Margin growth can be attributed to the easing of supply-chain headwinds, partly offset by inflationary costs. Meanwhile, our estimate for adjusted SG&amp;A expenses of $8.5 billion indicates a year-over-year rise of 4.3%. Driven by the gross margin expansion and higher SG&amp;A expenses, our model suggests a 30-bps operating margin expansion to 16.7% in the third quarter.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for PepsiCo this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here.

The company is expected to register top-line growth when it reports third-quarter 2023 numbers.

Office owners staged their first quarterly outperformance against the S&amp;P 500 Index since 2020. The group slipped just 2.8% for the third-quarter, compared to the S&amp;P 500’s nearly 3.7% quarterly drop.It’s a drastic improvement from the lows the group has clocked in since the start of the pandemic, but the sector is vulnerable to the elevated interest-rate environment. Last month, there was a surprise spike in hiring in the US, sparking concerns that the Federal Reserve will hike rates again before the end of the year.The robust jobs report sent real estate stocks plummeting, making it among the worst-performing sectors in the S&amp;P 500. Office REITs hit their lowest intraday level since 2009 Friday.Despite the latest blow, the group just wrapped up its best quarter since the start of the pandemic compared with its real estate landlord peers, falling just 1.5% in the third-quarter, according to Evercore ISI data. Only data centers came close to office landlords shedding 2.5%.Office owners received a lift during the third-quarter after SL Green Realty Corp. sold its 49.9% stake in 245 Park Avenue in late June, spurring a broad-based relief rally across the entire peer group, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jeffery Langbaum.“That may just be one data point, but it showed that at least one investor was willing to put incremental equity capital into an office building, and absorb a large amount of office-backed debt,” he said.Story continuesThat deal provided a tailwind for even the most beaten-down office owner this year. Los-Angeles-based Hudson Pacific Properties, which is down 40% year-to-date, jumped 58% during the third-quarter becoming the biggest gainer for the period. Similarly, New York-based office owners Vornado Realty Trust and SL Green advanced 25% and 24%, respectively.Even in San Francisco, where office landlords have seen outsized vacancy rates since the onset of Covid-19, there are signs of relief. The number of tenants in the market has risen to 180 from 137 at the beginning of the year with square-footage requirements nearly doubling, Evercore ISI analyst Steve Sakwa wrote in a note. But he warns much of the incremental demand stems from tenants with future lease expirations.“Commercial real estate owners and purchasers have to be willing to play the longer game,” said Mary Daly, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco president at the Economic Club of New York on Thursday. “You have to have a strong constitution to be in commercial real estate because it goes through cycles.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekCan AI Beat the Market?

SL Green Realty Corp (NYSE:SLG), a stock currently priced at 32.44, has caught the attention of many, especially with its recent 3-month increase of 13.31%. Despite the day's loss of 5.83%, the stock's fair valuation stands at $57.46, according to its GF Value. However, is this seemingly attractive valuation a genuine opportunity or a potential value trap?Understanding GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with SLG. Click here to check it out. SLG 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of SLGThe GF Value represents a stock's current intrinsic value derived from GuruFocus's exclusive method. This value is calculated based on historical multiples the stock has traded at, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of business performance. The GF Value Line on our summary page provides an overview of the fair value at which the stock should be traded. If the stock price significantly deviates from the GF Value Line, it may indicate overvaluation or undervaluation, influencing its future return.Is SL Green Realty (SLG) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapScrutinizing SL Green Realty's Risk FactorsDespite its apparent undervaluation, certain risk factors associated with SL Green Realty Corp (NYSE:SLG) should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 0.23. This indicator suggests that SL Green Realty, despite its attractive valuation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Decoding the Altman Z-ScoreThe Altman Z-score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Story continuesSL Green Realty Corp (NYSE:SLG): A SnapshotSL Green Realty is one of the largest Manhattan property owners and landlords, with interest in around 35 million square feet of wholly owned and joint-venture office space. The company has additional property exposure through its limited portfolio of well-located retail space. It operates as a real estate investment trust, with a market cap of $2.10 billion and sales of $882 million.Is SL Green Realty (SLG) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapDissecting SL Green Realty's Low Altman Z-ScoreA closer look at SL Green Realty's Altman Z-score reveals potential financial distress. The Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio, which provides insights into a company's capability to reinvest its profits or manage debt, shows a declining trend for SL Green Realty. Historical data from 2021 to 2023 indicates a diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt, negatively impacting its Z-Score.Furthermore, the company's asset turnover, a vital indicator of operational efficiency, shows a decreasing trend from 2021 to 2023. A drop in this ratio can signify reduced operational efficiency, potentially due to underutilization of assets or decreased market demand for the company's products or services. This shift underlines the need for SL Green Realty to reassess its operational strategies to optimize asset usage and boost sales.Conclusion: Navigating the Thin Line Between Value and TrapConsidering the potential financial distress indicated by SL Green Realty's low Altman Z-Score and declining operational efficiency, the company appears to be a potential value trap. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, the risks associated with investing in SL Green Realty should not be overlooked. As always, thorough due diligence is crucial before making an investment decision.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the Walter Schloss Screen .This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

It will let go of its space on the fourth and 17th floors as part of the new direct deal with Vornado and expand its total footprint by 26,000 square feet, Ginzburg said. Asking rent is about $110 per square foot in the upper levels of the building, TRD reported. The length of the deal is unclear.“We have grown a lot since the firm launched five years ago,” Ginzburg said in a statement. “We now have 80 partners and associates, and our long-term lease will allow us room for more growth in the future and helps bring our firm community closer together, including moving our fourth- and 17th-floor offices to the higher floors.”Some of the space Selendy Gay Elsberg has been occupying was vacated by Venable when it relocated to 151 West 42nd Street in March after building out 157,000 square feet in the former Condé Nast tower over the course of 18 months. Landlord Vornado handled the deal in-house via Edward Riguardi and Ryan Levy along with Cushman &amp; Wakefield (CWK)’s Josh Kuriloff and Bruce Mosler.

VNO 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of VNOThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock, derived from an exclusive method. It is calculated based on historical multiples, GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future estimates of business performance. The stock price is likely to fluctuate around the GF Value Line. If the price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Is Vornado Realty Trust (VNO) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapFinancial Health: The Altman Z-ScoreBefore delving into the details, it's crucial to understand what the Altman Z-score entails. The Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year timeframe. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Company SnapshotVornado Realty Trust is a real estate investment trust with a market cap of $3.80 billion. It owns and has an ownership interest in Class A office and retail properties highly concentrated in Manhattan, with additional properties in San Francisco and Chicago. However, the company's revenues and earnings have been on a downward trend over the past five years, raising a crucial question: Is Vornado Realty Trust a hidden gem or a value trap?Is Vornado Realty Trust (VNO) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapVornado Realty Trust's Financial HealthA dissection of Vornado Realty Trust's Altman Z-score reveals potential financial distress. For instance, the Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio, which provides insights into a company's capability to reinvest its profits or manage debt, has been on a declining trend. This downward movement indicates Vornado Realty Trust's diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt, exerting a negative impact on its Z-Score.Story continuesDeclining Revenues and EarningsOne of the telltale indicators of a company's potential trouble is a sustained decline in revenues. In the case of Vornado Realty Trust, both the revenue per share and the 5-year revenue growth rate have been on a consistent downward trajectory. This pattern may point to underlying challenges such as diminishing demand for Vornado Realty Trust's products, or escalating competition in its market sector. Either scenario can pose serious risks to the company's future performance, warranting a thorough analysis by investors.Is Vornado Realty Trust (VNO) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapThe Red Flag: Sluggish Earnings GrowthDespite its low price-to-fair-value ratio, Vornado Realty Trust's falling revenues and earnings cast a long shadow over its investment attractiveness. A low price relative to intrinsic value can indeed suggest an investment opportunity, but only if the company's fundamentals are sound or improving. In Vornado Realty Trust's case, the declining revenues, EBITDA, and earnings growth suggest that the company's issues may be more than just cyclical fluctuations.ConclusionDespite its seemingly attractive valuation, Vornado Realty Trust might be a potential value trap.

Horton, Inc.'s (NYSE:DHI) 34% Undervaluation?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/opportunity-d-r-horton-inc-120038444.html,1696680038,STORY,['DHI'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for D.R. Horton is US$158 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityCurrent share price of US$104 suggests D.R. Horton is potentially 34% undervalued The US$144 analyst price target for DHI is 8.7% less than our estimate of fair valueToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for D.R. Horton The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.10bUS$2.22bUS$3.89bUS$5.55bUS$4.65bUS$4.15bUS$3.87bUS$3.71bUS$3.62bUS$3.59bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ -10.73%Est @ -6.86%Est @ -4.16%Est @ -2.27%Est @ -0.94% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.2% US$3.8kUS$1.9kUS$3.1kUS$4.0kUS$3.1kUS$2.6kUS$2.2kUS$2.0kUS$1.8kUS$1.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$26bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.6b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (8.2%– 2.2%) = US$60bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$60b÷ ( 1 + 8.2%)10= US$27bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$53b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$104, the company appears quite undervalued at a 34% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at D.R. Horton as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.215. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for D.R. HortonStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Consumer Durables market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For D.R.

Bitcoin was trading near $40,000 at the time. It’s now trading at around $28,700.Meanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway’s Class A stock has outperformed the cryptocurrency and recently reached an all-time high, surpassing $560,000.Don't missCommercial real estate has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over 25 years. Here's how to diversify your portfolio without the headache of being a landlordRich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwindsOwning real estate for passive income is one of the biggest myths in investing — but here's how you can actually make it workUnsurprisingly, Buffett hasn’t changed his mind about the world’s most persistent digital obsession. “I’ve seen people do stupid things all my life,” Buffett said in an interview with CNBC earlier this year, comparing betting on Bitcoin to playing the slots in Las Vegas.“We’ve had an explosion of gambling, essentially. And I like to bet on a football game — if I’m sitting and watching, it makes it more interesting. But I don’t think I want to make a living trying to bet against the house.”Instead of crypto, Buffett has been laser-focused on his preferred asset class: equities. Here are the top three stocks he’s invested in over the past year that have outperformed Bitcoin by a wide margin.Lennar Corp.Buffett seems to be focused on American homebuilders right now. He added a stake in Lennar Corporation (LEN) sometime in the second quarter of 2023, according to recent regulatory filings.The Florida-based company is one of the largest home builders in the country. That puts it in a favorable position given the shortage of homes across America. Between 2012 and 2022, there were 6.5 million more households formed than homes constructed. If this gap continues to widen, demand for homebuilding could skyrocket.Story continuesBuffett seems to be betting on this trend, adding two other homebuilders, NVR (NVR) and DR Horton (DHI), to his portfolio during the second quarter.Read more: Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now use $100 to cash in on prime real estate — without the headache of being a landlord. Here's howDiageoIn the first quarter of the year, Buffett added a stake in British alcoholic beverage giant Diageo (DEO). But the Oracle of Omaha is no stranger to sin stocks, having acquired a sizable stake in Guinness, the beer brand that would eventually be combined with other brands to form Diageo, back in the 1990s.At the time, Buffett even compared the investment to his most famous bet. “In the sense of where they earn their profits — continent-by-continent — Coca-Cola and Guinness display strong similarities,"" he wrote in a letter to investors that year.Now, Diageo is back in the Berkshire portfolio, and that’s probably a sign that the company is undervalued. The stock trades at just under 19 times earnings per share and offers a 2.57% dividend yield. Meanwhile, Bitcoin's dividend yield is 0% and has a non-existent price-to-earnings ratio.Occidental PetroleumWarren Buffett is clearly bullish on energy, at least in the medium term. That’s why he started accumulating a stake in Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY) last year and now controls over 25% of the company’s outstanding shares.The price of crude oil has rebounded in recent months. In fact, it hit a 10-month high recently and experts expect demand to keep a price floor on the commodity for the year ahead. That’s a major tailwind for oil producers like Occidental.Buffett’s bet on energy giants is now a key part of his portfolio. Considering how cheap these companies are (Occidental stock trades at 11 times earnings), retail investors should consider taking a closer look too.What to read nextWorried about the economy?

Rapper Talib Kweli leveled similar allegations in January. (R. Diamond / Getty Images)American Airlines has apologized to musician David Ryan Harris for stopping and questioning him at LAX last month because they suspected he was trafficking children. The boys are his own kids.The singer-songwriter, who is Black and was traveling with his two biracial children, questioned whether the incident was an instance of racial profiling, which he said had left him ""shocked and humiliated."" He joins a list of American Airlines passengers, including Black celebrities, who have been removed from flights by airline employees. The incidents reignited conversations around racism toward Black travelers, which sprang up amid nationwide uprisings following the 2020 murder of George Floyd.This week, American Airlines issued its apology to Harris — who has toured with John Mayer and performed with the Dave Matthews Band and Carlos Santana — nearly three weeks after the incident. The airline said that the flight attendant did not follow policies on identifying possible signs of human trafficking.Read more: Former Rams star Odell Beckham Jr. removed from plane in Miami“Through coaching and counseling … our flight attendant realizes that their interaction and observations did NOT meet the criteria that human trafficking was taking place,"" American Airlines wrote in a statement to Harris, which he shared on Instagram on Wednesday.

They were planning on watching the Rams' home opener against the 49ers at SoFi Stadium later that weekend, the singer recalled in a series of videos posted to his Instagram on Sept. 23.Shortly before landing, a flight attendant had asked his children for their names. His 7-year-old, who Harris said is shy and was tired from a 4 a.m. start time to catch their early flight, didn't immediately respond, instead looking toward Harris. ""One of them is pretty shy — I always have to tell him, 'Hey buddy, tell the guy your name, shake his hand, look him in the eye,' and quite frankly he doesn't owe that to anyone,"" he said of his son Hendrix.Story continuesAfter landing, Harris was met at the gate by an airline employee and four police officers who began to question his children and asked if they were OK.Read more: A Black LAPD officer wanted to make a difference. Then, he says, he was racially profiled by his own department""Apparently a flight attendant had called ahead with some sort of concern that my mixed-race children weren't my children, because they were unresponsive during an interaction with her,"" Harris said in the video. ""I wanted to go through the roof, but I did not want my kids to see me handle the situation with anything other than grace and class, and me not lose my mind, although I want to tell these people some choice words.""After the questioning, the officers left, and the airline employee offered to show Harris to baggage claim.""Maybe ... just maybe it isn’t a race thing, but when you don’t respond at all, I’m left to make sense of the altercation on my own,"" Harris captioned his Instagram post after the airline had failed to respond to his complaint about the incident more than a week later.Read more: In California’s largest race bias cases, Latino workers are accused of abusing Black colleaguesIn the following days, Harris went on to post a series of other videos in which he shared the developing situation, including a call from an American Airlines agent who explained that they were conducting an investigation into the incident. He asked the agent why they hadn't looked up the flight passenger information to confirm his name, or other forms of identification, before calling authorities. He said both he and his children have frequent flier accounts with the airline. ""There were many steps she could've taken,"" he recalled telling the agent. ""At the bare minimum, it was a knee-jerk reaction that could've been avoided.""The incident caught the attention of fellow artists, such as Mayer and Questlove, who signaled their support for Harris on social media.In a statement to The Times, the airline said, ""At American, we do not tolerate discrimination of any kind as it does not align with our values, and we thoroughly investigated Mr. Harris’ claims. A member of our team reached out to discuss his experience and how we can continue to best care for our customers. We are sorry for any misunderstanding.""American has a longstanding history of working to ensure our customers feel valued and respected at every touchpoint along their journey, and we rely on our collective team and partners to provide critical objective insight, perspective and support on issues where we can improve our processes and training.""Read more: L.A. sheriff’s deputies use minor stops to search bicyclists, with Latinos hit hardestBlack travelers leveling complaints of racism toward American Airlines is a longstanding issue for the company. In 2017, the NAACP issued a travel advisory, warning Black travelers that flying on American Airlines could subject them to “disrespectful, discriminatory or unsafe conditions,"" citing four instances from that year in which Black passengers were forced to give up their first-class seats.Discussions around the issue were reignited late last year and early this year, when several Black celebrities said they faced similar treatment within months of one another.In November, NFL star Odell Beckham Jr. was removed from an American Airlines plane in Miami that was bound for Los Angeles. Authorities said the former Rams Super Bowl champion had ""appeared to be coming in and out of consciousness"" and that he was removed out of fear that Beckham Jr. was ill and ""his condition would worsen."" The airline added that he had failed to fasten his seat belt before takeoff. Daniel Davillier, Beckham Jr.'s attorney, said the attendant merely ""wanted to prove he had the authority"" to kick him off the plane.Months later, in January, rapper and Black Star member Talib Kweli was escorted off an American Airlines flight from Austin, Texas, to Los Angeles after he and a flight attendant had a disagreement about luggage space. After the argument with the flight attendant, a second attendant came and sorted out the issue with Kweli, and they were able to properly stow his luggage beneath his seat, according to videos of the incident recorded by the rapper and shared on his Instagram.But before taking off, an attendant told Kweli he had to leave the plane because the crew didn't feel safe. After he refused, citing that he wasn't breaking any rules and had remained calm throughout, three police officers came to escort him off. At one point, an attendant had threatened that if he didn't follow their instructions, he would be jailed.""I'm a Black man in America — I paid good money for this seat, why am I being told that I'm going to jail?"" he said to the officers while explaining the incident, according to the video.Read more: Tesla sued for 'widespread and ongoing' racial harassment at California plantDuring that same week, track star Sha'Carri Ricardson was removed from an American Airlines plane after an argument with a flight attendant over the use of her phone leading up to takeoff, according to now-deleted videos she recorded and shared on social media.In a statement, an American Airlines spokesperson said Richardson was booked on a later flight and that the airline had reached out to the attendant to ""learn more,"" according to NBC News.""If this is how they are treated Black folks with fame privilege imagine how they are treating Black folks without large platforms!"" Kweli wrote in a separate post several weeks after his incident, referring to the other incidents involving Richardson and Beckham Jr.The airline has also faced two lawsuits in recent years from its passengers, both alleging racial discrimination. The first was filed in June 2020 by Elgin Banks, a Black man from Arizona who was on a flight from Los Angeles to Phoenix. Banks alleged that a white flight attendant told him to gather his belongings and leave after he tried to switch his seat, according to court documents obtained by The Times. Four of six other passengers who were also kicked off the plane after protesting the airline's move joined Banks in the suit.Read more: Randall Emmett settles racial discrimination lawsuit brought by former assistantKTLA, which was first to report the incident, obtained video of parts of the altercation.A spokesperson for American Airlines told NBC News that the allegations ""are not a full or accurate portrayal of the incident."" A federal judge eventually threw out the case in 2022, saying among other things that the group had ""failed to state a claim for race discrimination,"" according to court documents.A second lawsuit was filed against the airline in 2021 by Troskie Stewart, a Black man who had boarded an American Airlines flight from Miami to Atlanta. He alleged he was removed from the plane after a run-in with an attendant who was acting aggressively toward him, ""yelling and screaming"" in an ""act of blatant racial discrimination,"" according to court documents obtained by The Times. Court records show that he voluntarily withdrew his complaint in March. The airline's attorneys claimed the case was filed in the wrong federal district court, and Stewart and his attorneys failed to respond by a deadline set by the court.Read more: After a 'hot labor summer,' Black Hollywood is confronting the limits of solidarityHarris says his experience has also affected his children.

306,581a0ef4-c853-3af2-bc83-3fdeba61392f,FCX,2023-10-07,Just Four Days Till Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) Will Be Trading Ex-Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/just-four-days-till-freeport-120156434.html,1696680116,STORY,['FCX'],"[Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth, and if you're one of those dividend sleuths, you might be intrigued to know that Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) is about to go ex-dividend in just four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Meaning, you will need to purchase Freeport-McMoRan's shares before the 12th of October to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 1st of November.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.15 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$0.60 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Freeport-McMoRan has a trailing yield of approximately 1.6% on its current stock price of $36.67. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. See our latest analysis for Freeport-McMoRan Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Fortunately Freeport-McMoRan's payout ratio is modest, at just 41% of profit. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. It paid out an unsustainably high 225% of its free cash flow as dividends over the past 12 months, which is worrying. Our definition of free cash flow excludes cash generated from asset sales, so since Freeport-McMoRan is paying out such a high percentage of its cash flow, it might be worth seeing if it sold assets or had similar events that might have led to such a high dividend payment.Story continuesFreeport-McMoRan paid out less in dividends than it reported in profits, but unfortunately it didn't generate enough cash to cover the dividend. Were this to happen repeatedly, this would be a risk to Freeport-McMoRan's ability to maintain its dividend.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Freeport-McMoRan, with earnings per share up 3.9% on average over the last five years. Earnings have been growing somewhat, but we're concerned dividend payments consumed most of the company's cash flow over the past year.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Freeport-McMoRan's dividend payments per share have declined at 7.1% per year on average over the past 10 years, which is uninspiring. Freeport-McMoRan is a rare case where dividends have been decreasing at the same time as earnings per share have been improving. It's unusual to see, and could point to unstable conditions in the core business, or more rarely an intensified focus on reinvesting profits.The Bottom LineHas Freeport-McMoRan got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Freeport-McMoRan has seen its earnings per share grow steadily and paid out less than half its profit over the last year. Unfortunately, its dividend was not well covered by free cash flow. To summarise, Freeport-McMoRan looks okay on this analysis, although it doesn't appear a stand-out opportunity.With that being said, if dividends aren't your biggest concern with Freeport-McMoRan, you should know about the other risks facing this business. To help with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Freeport-McMoRan that you should be aware of before investing in their shares.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

Let’s take a deeper dive into what’s expected out of each.PepsiCoPEP shares have faced adverse price action over the last several months following an impressive start to 2023, down roughly 13% during the period. Analysts have primarily kept their earnings expectations unchanged for the upcoming release, with the $2.17 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate down just a penny over the last several months.The consumer staples giant regularly beats quarterly expectations, exceeding both Zacks Consensus earnings and revenue estimates in six consecutive releases. As shown below, shares have seen a boost post-earnings following several recent releases.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStill, negative sentiment has taken hold of near-term price action, with shares recently being rejected at the 200-day moving average and heading lower.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIt’s worth noting that the company upped its FY23 view following its latest quarterly print, citing continued strong business momentum. Our consensus quarterly revenue estimate for PEP stands at $23.4 billion, 6% higher than the year-ago figure.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPepsiCo, a current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), will report on Tuesday, October 10th, before the market’s open.Delta Air LinesDelta Air Lines shares have traded somewhat similarly to PEP over the last three months, facing adverse price action following a melt-up during early summer. Analysts moved their expectations lower following a filing on September 14th, with the $1.96 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate down 17% over the last several months.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDAL shares sold off following its latest release despite posting record quarterly revenue and profitability, likely a reflection of profit-taking following the above-mentioned summer melt-up.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRising fuel costs throughout the period undoubtedly impacted DAL’s quarter to be released. As mentioned above, in September, the company updated previous guidance given in the latest earnings call, now expecting fuel prices of $2.75 - $2.90 per gallon ($2.50 -$2.70 per gallon previously). Our consensus estimate for average fuel price per gallon presently sits at $2.88, 14% higher than $2.52 per gallon in 2023 Q2.Delta Air Lines, a current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), will report on Thursday, October 12th, before the market’s open.UnitedHealth GroupUnlike those above, UNH shares have seen favorable action over the last several months, tacking on 14% in value and outperforming the general market. Analysts have taken their expectations modestly lower for the quarter to be released, with the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate down 2% since July.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company posted strong balanced growth in its latest release, with both segments posting double-digit percentage year-over-year growth rates. Regarding expectations, UNH exceeded both Zacks Consensus earnings and revenue forecasts, continuing its consistent nature. And given its first-half performance, UNH upped its full-year adjusted EPS outlook to $24.70 - $25.00 per share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUnitedHealth, a current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), will report on Friday, October 13th, before the market’s open.Bottom LineEarnings season is always an exciting time to be an investor, with companies pulling the curtain back and unveiling what’s transpired behind closed doors.And next week, the quarterly reports will really start rolling in, including those from PepsiCo PEP, Delta Air Lines DAL, and UnitedHealth Group UNH.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The worries are compounded by a report from BMO that the obesity drug market could reach $100 billion by 2035 causing further impacts to consumer habits for the companies.Yahoo Finance Anchors Seana Smith and Brad Smith break down the current down trend for the beverage companies as well as what this means for the bigger picture of consumer habits in this space.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: Well, let's get into the food and beverage industry, a little more tasty here than oil. PepsiCo shares-- I'm not, you know-- anyway, PepsiCo shares, you're seeing them move on the day as well as Coke after weight loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy are spooking investors in the snack and beverage space.Yesterday we heard from Walmart's US head of business on the impact of food sales. Not all bad news. Goldman Sachs is seeing mid single-digit volume growth for Pepsi in 2024. And that's without any more price increases here.So shares of Coca-Cola are down fractionally. Shares of Pepsi down by about 1.2% right now. And Walmart really, I think, got out in front of-- or at least for the reaction that we saw from the street was trying to signal or at least couch some of the expectations for declining performance or worsened performance in some of the aisles in the store by saying, yeah, people aren't as hungry just because they're taking so many of these what's now viral weight loss-- you know, weight loss but also is a much larger kind of-- not even a nutrition.It's just like a pill essentially. It's flabbergasting honestly at the of the day that so many people have gone into this and looked at it without some of the side effects that could take place. And I just kind of read through some of these. And I'm just like, my goodness, all right. Well, sure, yeah, it's gonna impact Pepsi and Coca-Cola and Walmart. But at the end of the day, like, we've got to be smarter about the things that we're putting in our bodies too.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly a lot of the warnings out there just in terms of the adverse side effects that are associated with these drugs, certainly very important to keep in mind. When we talk about the business implications of this, what it could mean for sales for some of these consumer-staple companies, obviously, it's something that has been warned about by some analysts.Going back to March, Morgan Stanley was out with a note saying that they do expect some sort of hit here to some of these consumer-staple companies considering the fact that the pool of patients is expected to grow to 24 million people taking these types of drugs, about 7% of the overall US population. That's only just within the next decade.So we talk about the pressure that that could put on companies. I think investors are gonna be paying very close attention to these earnings calls on the heels of what we just heard from one of Walmart's executives earlier this week. We have Pepsi coming out on Tuesday, next Tuesday, Coca-Cola on October 24.So we're seeing some of the worry in the market when it comes to some of these consumer staples when you see the downward pressure in Coca-Cola, downward pressure in Pepsi for a second day in a row. I think everyone's trying to figure out exactly what that roadmap looks like going forward given the fact that if Walmart is right in terms of the trends that they are seeing and the fact that people are pulling back on some of their spending if they are taking these types of drugs. Clearly, that could mean a huge hit across the board for many of these companies.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, this is even more. And it goes deeper than even Wegovy and Ozempic. It goes back to where people are getting this thought or getting this perception that they need to look a certain way, feel a certain way. There were studies that were initiated even prepandemic and leading up to the pandemic, talking about the dangers of Instagram and looking at so many different figures out there that would make you want to compare yourself.And I think with all of that considered, it's time for us to perhaps reinitiate even more of those studies to talk about where there's still a role that social media has to account for, Meta platforms, whether it's Google, all of these different places where studies have revealed that there are issues that show body dissatisfaction, mental health issues all stemming from an exuberance or abundance of use of some of the platforms, too.So that's not me just-- you know, I'm not a parent. I'm nobody's parent out there. You can decide what your own FaceTime, what your own screen time looks like. But at the end of the day, there are some serious disorders that have been started. And it's unfortunate as well as how that's impacted society.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, extremely unfortunate, obviously. Very, very important to keep in mind.]"

PEP is expected to register bottom and top-line growth when it reports third-quarter 2023 numbers on Oct 10, before the opening bell. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $23.4 billion, implying 6.5% growth from the year-ago quarter's reported figure.For quarterly earnings, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.17, suggesting 10.2% growth from the $1.97 reported in the prior-year quarter. The consensus mark has moved down by a penny in the past 30 days.In the last reported quarter, the company reported an earnings beat of 7.2%. It has delivered an earnings surprise of 6.3%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.PepsiCo, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise PepsiCo, Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePepsiCo, Inc. price-eps-surprise | PepsiCo, Inc. QuoteKey Factors to NotePepsiCo has been benefiting from strength and resilience in its diversified portfolio, modernized supply chain, improved digital capabilities, flexible go-to-market distribution systems, and robust consumer demand trends. The company is likely to have gained from delivering convenience, variety and value proposition to customers through its brands in the to-be-reported quarter.PEP’s third-quarter results are expected to reflect gains from improved pricing across all segments. The bottom line is likely to reflect the continued benefits of the mitigation of inflationary pressures through cost-management and revenue-management initiatives. PepsiCo is likely to have benefited from the resilience and strength of the global beverage and convenient food businesses.We expect year-over-year consolidated organic revenue growth of 8% for the third quarter, driven by a 12.1% rise in the price/mix, offset by a 4.1% decline in volume.Market share growth in the liquid refreshment beverage category, with share gains in the carbonated soft drinks, ready-to-drink tea and water categories, is likely to have aided the improvement in the beverage category. Investments in innovation and execution also bode well.The company’s food business has been gaining from revenue growth across core brands like Doritos, Lay’s, Ruffles, Tostitos and Cheetos. The Quaker business has been benefiting from market share gains in the rice and pasta, lite snacks, ready-to-eat cereal, and snack bar categories, as it has been capitalizing on the elevated demand for tasty products that deliver convenience and value.However, PepsiCo’s third-quarter gross margin is expected to have been partly negated by inflationary labor, transportation and commodity costs. Adverse currency rates are also likely to have been headwinds.Increased advertising and marketing expenses, along with additional investments to build digital capabilities and integrate purpose throughout the company, are likely to have led to a rise in SG&amp;A expenses in the to-be-reported quarter.We anticipate the adjusted gross margin to expand 60 bps to 54% in the third quarter. Margin growth can be attributed to the easing of supply-chain headwinds, partly offset by inflationary costs. Meanwhile, our estimate for adjusted SG&amp;A expenses of $8.5 billion indicates a year-over-year rise of 4.3%. Driven by the gross margin expansion and higher SG&amp;A expenses, our model suggests a 30-bps operating margin expansion to 16.7% in the third quarter.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for PepsiCo this time around.

Regeneron (REGN), which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This biopharmaceutical company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 6.15%.For the most recent quarter, Regeneron was expected to post earnings of $9.92 per share, but it reported $10.24 per share instead, representing a surprise of 3.23%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $9.25 per share, while it actually produced $10.09 per share, a surprise of 9.08%.Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Regeneron lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Regeneron currently has an Earnings ESP of +2.50%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on November 2, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Add Union Pacific to the list of Class I railroads seeking a better link for customers between the U.S. Southeast and Mexico.The western U.S. Class I railroad announced this week that it will be offering intermodal service that originates on Mexican rail carrier Grupo México from both Monterrey in Nuevo Leon and Silao in Guanajuato to cities in the southeastern U.S.The intermodal service is targeted for domestic freight within North America that doesn’t come from the ports, UP told FreightWaves. As such, the service is for those using 53-foot domestic containers.An illustration from Union Pacific’s website highlighting the new service.“In tandem with our diverse customer base, including our private asset and rail container channel partners, this new service introduces the largest influx of intermodal capacity for the Southeastern U.S. market out of Mexico,” UP (NYSE: UNP) said. “It also reinforces Union Pacific’s steadfast commitment to serving Mexico markets, helps take trucks off congested highways, and offers customers a complete transportation solution for business traversing this key trade corridor.”A chart from UP’s website showing transit times between the two regions.UP’s offering follows remarks by executives from Norfolk Southern (NYSE: NSC) and CSX (NASDAQ: CSX) at an investor conference in August, in which both companies expressed interest in beefing up service between the markets in Mexico and the southeastern U.S. CSX and Canadian Pacific Kansas City (CPKC) have plans for a new direct interchange connection in Alabama via acquiring or operating portions of the Meridian &amp; Bigbee Railroad, which operates in Mississippi and Alabama and is owned by short-line operator Genesee &amp; Wyoming (G&amp;W). G&amp;W, CSX and CPKC (NYSE: CP) announced their plans in late June, saying the change would establish a new freight corridor connecting Mexico, Texas and the U.S. Southeast. The plans need approval by the Surface Transportation Board.Meanwhile, NS has a relationship with CPKC in which shippers can utilize the Meridian Speedway to go between Texas and Mexico and the Southeast. NS also has its own service products, including those that involve partners J.B. Hunt and Hub Group.Story continuesSeptember also saw a slew of announcements from Class I railroads about expanded intermodal services across national borders, including enhanced service between the U.S. Midwest and Mexico.All of these new or expanded services follow April’s merger between Canadian Pacific and Kansas City Southern.Nationwide, loaded domestic intermodal has picked up seasonally in the past month, according to this SONAR chart.

With the underlying ecosystem dependent on economic stability, concerns about a possible recession on the horizon present a dour framework. Still, investors may want to keep an open mind before making their decision.First off, the experts calling for a downturn might be incorrect. While it might seem illogical to many that the Federal Reserve can simply engineer a soft landing after an awful pandemic, it’s not an entirely impossible prospect. Also, traders could simply speculate on a reversal in transportation stocks. Another factor to keep in mind is that the industry may represent a forward indicator. Sure, individual ideas in the space might not look so hot right now.However, if a turnaround materializes, that could help lift many other sectors. Basically, this sector is where the economic rubber meets the road. With that, below are transportation stocks to buy for intrepid contrarians.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTransportation Stocks: Knight-Swift Transportation (KNX)Knight Transportation truckSource: Thomas Trompeter / Shutterstock.comOne of the top names among transportation stocks, Knight-Swift Transportation (NYSE:KNX) is the fifth-largest trucking company in the U.S. In better or more predictable circumstances, KNX would be a solid wager. However, the underlying trucking industry suffered a huge crisis this year; namely, a significant shortage of freight. And that has led to a domino effect, impacting everything from job stability to consumer prices.To be perfectly blunt, KNX doesn’t immediately appear as one of the transportation stocks to buy. Since the January opener, shares suffered a loss of more than 6%. In the trailing month, KNX dipped nearly 10%. Still, it might not be time to hit the panic button. Looking at the financials, Knight posts a solid three-year revenue growth rate of 17.4%, above 76.64% of its peers. Also, despite challenges, it remains a consistently profitable business.Story continuesEven more encouraging, analysts rate KNX a moderate buy with a $59.47 price target, implying over 19% upside.Union Pacific (UNP)United Pacific (UNP) switch on tracks near Kansas City.Source: Michael Rosebrock / Shutterstock.comA publicly traded railroad holding company, Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) is a vital cog in national infrastructure. Obviously, Union plays a massive role in commerce and overall economic viability. So, it’s not the most encouraging look to see UNP slip about 2% since the beginning of the year. What’s more, in the trailing month, UNP shed nearly 9% of its equity value.Still, it could be one of the transportation stocks to buy. As evidence, I turn to Fintel’s options flow screener, which exclusively targets big block trades likely made by institutions. First, for options expiring in late 2023/early 2024, the net sentiment appears bullish.Second, on Aug. 16, an institutional trader apparently sold (wrote) 10,002 contracts of the Oct 20 ’23 205.00 Put, collecting a premium of $2 million in the process. Also, this premium represents 4.63 standard deviations above the mean, which is significant. Basically, major traders believe that a floor may materialize around the $205 price. Adding to the sentiment, analysts peg UNP as a moderate buy with a $252.50 target, implying nearly 24% growth.Eagle Bulk Shipping (EGLE)a cargo ship in the middle of the ocean representing TOPS stockSource: VladSV / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, Eagle Bulk Shipping (NYSE:EGLE) is a fully integrated shipowner-operator engaged in the global transportation of dry bulk commodities. Per its website, Eagle focuses exclusively on the mid-size dry bulk vessel segment and owns one of the largest fleets of Supramax/Ultramax ships in the world. Since the start of the year, EGLE fell nearly 14%.Still, that loss isn’t as bad as it may look on paper. Basically, EGLE has been at parity since early May. And should global economic conditions pick up – or at least not collapse – Eagle Bulk could perform surprisingly well. For example, the company prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 15.4%, above 73.58% of its peers.Also, during the same period, its EBITDA growth pinged at 56.9%, above 88% of sector rivals. For those willing to take a shot, EGLE trades at a lowly forward earnings multiple of 5.97x. To close, analysts peg EGLE a consensus strong buy with a $60 target, implying 43% upside potential. Thus, it could be an enticing idea for transportation stocks.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

DGX recently inked a strategic lab services agreement with Neway.  The agreement aims to accelerate dialysis laboratory testing and reduce the laboratory costs of dialysis programs for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).The latest development is likely to broaden Quest Diagnostics' laboratory services offering.More on AgreementAccording to the terms of the agreement, Neway will leverage Quest Diagnostics' broad lab network to deliver local dialysis laboratory testing services with typically next-day results after arriving at a Quest Diagnostics laboratory.The collaboration between Quest Diagnostics and Neway will provide an alternative to the centralized lab paradigm, in which the majority of dialysis programs in the United States transmit specimens to a single laboratory for processing.Neway and its connected dialysis centers as well as their patients will benefit from speedier testing and results reporting as well as decreased transportation expenses by utilising Quest Diagnostics' distributed lab network.Strategic EffortsQuest Diagnostics -- a pioneer in cardiometabolic diagnostic solutions, including renal disease, knows the specific issues that patients with ESRD confront, as well as the importance of speedy testing that never compromises on quality. Through a partnership with Neway, the company will overcome these obstacles and speed test results while preserving the highest level of quality for ESRD patients in collaboration with Neway.Further, it is worth mentioning that the 'new way' for dialysis laboratory testing is a nationwide decentralized network of laboratory facilities. This method benefits dialysis patients, dialysis programs, insurance payers, and the dialysis industry as a whole. It is a win-win situation for everyone.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Grand View Research, the global end-stage renal disease market size was valued at $ 99.1 billion in 2022 and is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 13.0% by 2030. An increasing number of patients suffering from kidney failure and the introduction of technologically advanced products, such as low-maintenance dialysis equipment and artificial kidneys, are the major factors expected to drive the market.Story continuesProgress Within Laboratory BusinessIn March 2023, Quest Diagnostics acquired select assets of Northern Light Laboratory --  a large integrated healthcare system in Maine. Financial details of the deal were kept under wraps. Through this acquisition, Quest Diagnostics now offers professional laboratory management services for nine of Northern Light Health's hospital laboratories and its cancer center laboratory at Northern Light Cancer Care in Brewer, Maine.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn February 2023, Quest Diagnostics entered into a strategic agreement with NewYork-Presbyterian to extend access to quality, advanced laboratory services for the providers and patients. The agreement targets to serve NewYork-Presbyterian's providers and patients in the greater New York region and beyond.Price PerformanceIn the past year, shares of DGX have declined 2.4% compared with the industry’s 6.6% growth.Zacks Rank and Other Key PicksQuest Diagnostics currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc.
