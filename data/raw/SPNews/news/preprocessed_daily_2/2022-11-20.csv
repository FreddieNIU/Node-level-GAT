If you want to see more of billionaire Cliff Asness' top 10 technology stock picks, go directly to Billionaire Cliff Asness' Top 5 Technology Stock Picks.Billionaire Cliff Asness is the founder of quantitative giant AQR Capital Management which as of the end of September had a 13F equity portfolio of over $40 billion.As a quantitative fund, AQR Capital Management uses sophisticated data models and intensive computing to decide what to buy and sell. Given the fund's huge size and Asness' belief in diversification, AQR Capital Management has thousands of positions and regularly rotates in and out of stocks each quarter.Given how big the tech sector in the United States is, AQR Capital Management has substantial positions in many leading tech stocks.In terms of the S&amp;P 500 index, for example, the tech sector accounted for 28% of the index as of April 2022, or more than the combined weighting of the health care and consumer discretionary sectors.In terms of AQR Capital Management's portfolio, tech stocks account for 7 of the fund's top 10 positions.Technology stocks account for a substantial percentage of the S&amp;P 500 and also AQR Capital Management's top positions due to the growth in the industry over the last thirty years.Given tech advancements in semiconductors, computers and smartphones have become more affordable over time. With billions of more potential customers, some software, hardware, and internet companies have grown substantially as a result. With their scale, those companies have created even more useful services that have made more people want to buy computers and smartphones.Given the cycle, some software, hardware, and internet companies have grown to rank among the world's most valuable companies that many investors want to own in their portfolios.2022Due to high inflation, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times in 2022 alone and many analysts expect the U.S. central bank to raise rates further.Story continuesAlthough October's core inflation was lower than expected, San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly said in mid November that she expects interest rates to rise at least one percentage point or potentially more before the Federal Reserve pauses to evaluate the inflation fight.With rising interest rates, Treasury rates have increased substantially and capital has moved from big tech stocks into Treasuries as a result. With the capital flows, many big tech stocks are down substantially year to date. If the economy slows more than expected in the future, there could be even more downside in the near term.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.AQR CAPITAL MANAGEMENTCliff Asness of AQR Capital ManagementMethodologyFor our list of Billionaire Cliff Asness' Top 10 Technology Stock Picks, we selected 10 technology stocks among AQR Capital Management's top equity holdings according to 13F filings as of Q3 2022.We ranked them based on AQR Capital Management's stake value in the stocks at the end of September.Billionaire Cliff Asness' Top 10 Technology Stock Picks10.

Since September 30, shares of the semiconductor company have rallied thanks to the broader market rally despite the company's fourth quarter guidance being weaker than expected.Baron Funds commented on Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) in a Q3 2022 investor letter,Shares of Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN), the leading global analog semiconductor company, rose 1% during the quarter after the company reported strong financial results with revenue growth of 14% year-over-year, operating profit growth of 23%, and operating margins of 52%. While the level of uncertainty over near-term revenue and free-cash-flow trends has risen due to a potential macro slowdown and supply-chain normalization, Texas Instruments has a long history of growing free-cashflow-per-share over full-market cycles to drive shareholder value. We remain investors and believe that Texas Instruments will benefit from the growth in semiconductor content across a broadening set of end-markets and applications. In addition, we believe that the company will be able to sustain its competitive advantages for the long term, underpinned by its manufacturing technology and process, its broad product portfolio, the reach of its go-to-market organization, and the diversity and longevity of its products.Alongside Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc.

The company's market worth decreased by US$2.3b over the past week after the stock price dropped 3.4%, although insiders were able to minimize their lossesWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At U.S. BancorpIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, Timothy Welsh, sold US$834k worth of shares at a price of US$43.92 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$43.38. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).In the last year U.S. Bancorp insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeI will like U.S. Bancorp better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.U.S. Bancorp Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at U.S. Bancorp. In total, insiders dumped US$1.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Insider Ownership Of U.S. BancorpLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. U.S. Bancorp insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$109m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The U.S. Bancorp Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. For example - U.S. Bancorp has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.Of course U.S. Bancorp may not be the best stock to buy.

5,dacd87dd-371b-3203-a1fc-02092c5adc07,WMT,2022-11-20,15 Biggest Multinational Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-biggest-multinational-companies-world-152339448.html,1668871419,STORY,"['GOOGL', 'MCK', 'TM', 'WMT', 'XOM']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 15 biggest multinational companies in the world. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest Multinational Companies in the World.A multinational is a company which is incorporated in a single country but its operations are spread across borders. One of the things distinguishing a multinational from just an investment organization which invests in companies abroad is the aspect of control in the former. While the above is just a basic definition, there are some specific definitions that different organizations use, with Black's Law Dictionary suggesting that a company is a multinational if at least 25% of its revenue is from outside its home country.You might think that multinationals only came into existence in the past couple of centuries especially after the development of global trade, but the actual history of multinationals, even though they weren't known as multinationals at the time, is actually much older, in line with colonialism. The two earliest examples of multinationals are the Dutch East India Company and the British East India Company which were set up to engage in trade in different port cities. The British East India company had its own army and formed the basis of the British colonialism of India. The Dutch East India Company meanwhile is assessed to have been worth close to $8.3 trillion adjusted for inflations, making it the richest corporation in history.Currently, most of the biggest companies in the world are multinationals, with some defining characteristics, mainly central headquarters with operations in multiple countries. These companies are often engaged in importing and exporting goods, investing in foreign countries, engaging in the buying and selling of licenses in foreign countries, manufacturing or assembly operations operating in basically every industry in the world.Nowadays, multinationals have become the targets of activists for their unscrupulous activities, resulting in many anti-capital and anti-corporate movements. Many such companies are criticized for their size and political involvement, with lobbying, trade agreements and deregulated financial markets allowing them to exercise a lot of power. Despite massive corporations earning billions of dollars every year in profit, most of them have been decried for their labor practices, including underpaying and overworking employees and these companies' opposition to unions or better rights for employees.Story continuesThe biggest multinational companies in the world aren't the biggest companies in the world. This is true for Chinese companies which are state-owned and only have operations within the country. There are also a couple of health companies in the United States which are counted among the biggest companies in the world but aren't multinationals since their operations are only concentrated within the nation. To determine our list, we consulted the Fortune Global 500 list and excluded companies which don't fall under the definition of a multinational. We then ranked these companies based on revenue, profits, assets and employees, assigning 30% weightage to the first two metrics and 20% weightage to the last two. So, without further ado, let's take a look at the biggest multinationals out there right now, starting with number 15:Daily newspaper economy stock market chart15.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Coal Stocks To Buy Now. Coal is among the most hated fuels in the fossil fuel segment. While it is credited with having spurred the industrial revolution, as engines, locomotives, and machinery were powered by steam before internal combustion machinery became popular, this power had a terrible cost. Coal is one of the dirtiest burning fuels in the world, as it produces vast amounts of soot and carbon that are injected into the atmosphere.However, despite these drawbacks, it continues to be relied upon by the developing world for energy needs. Coal is also cheaper, and is available in vast amounts. These two factors make it quite attractive if carbon emissions limits are not imposed. In fact, due to the severity of the ongoing energy crisis, even the United Kingdom was forced to keep its coal power plants open this year, after the British government announced that it was looking into keeping coal power plants open to meet the island's energy needs for the winter months for two gigawatts of backup power supply.These factors have ensured that the global coal market continues to grow. According to research firm The Business Research Company, this market was worth $595 billion in 2021 and it will grow to $618 billion by the end of this year through a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.9%. From the end of this year to 2026, the research firm expects the sector to grow at a CAGR of 3.7% and sit at $715 billion by the end of the forecast period. Like other industries, coal companies are also starting to rely heavily on technology, as they have started to use three dimensional visualization, among other technology, to gain a better picture of their mines, which then lets them improve productivity.The largest coal producer is Asia Pacific, and as you will find out when you scroll through today's list, some of the largest companies in our collection are Chinese and Asian firms. Overall, the global coal market is worth a massive $1.5 trillion right now, and it will grow at a CAGR of 8.6 % between 2022 and 2027 to be worth $2.3 trillion. This places its value right alongside crude oil, which is estimated to be worth $1.5 trillion in 2026.Story continuesToday's list will focus on the top coal companies right now, with some of them being CONSOL Energy Inc.

The company's stock saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine Microsoft’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. View our latest analysis for Microsoft What's The Opportunity In Microsoft?Great news for investors – Microsoft is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $303.67, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. What’s more interesting is that, Microsoft’s share price is theoretically quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to move to its intrinsic value, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.What kind of growth will Microsoft generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 45% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Microsoft. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since MSFT is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on MSFT for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy MSFT. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 87% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Mastercard. Check out our latest analysis for Mastercard ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Mastercard?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Mastercard does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Mastercard, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Mastercard. Our data shows that The MasterCard Foundation, Endowment Arm is the largest shareholder with 11% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.0% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.7% by the third-largest shareholder.Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 20 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Story continuesWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of MastercardThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Mastercard Incorporated. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$339m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 12% stake in Mastercard. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Mastercard better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Mastercard   you should know about.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

So when we looked at the ROCE trend of Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) we really liked what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Lockheed Martin is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.21 = US$7.5b ÷ (US$52b - US$16b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Therefore, Lockheed Martin has an ROCE of 21%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 8.6% earned by companies in a similar industry. View our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin roceIn the above chart we have measured Lockheed Martin's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Lockheed Martin.How Are Returns Trending?Lockheed Martin's ROCE growth is quite impressive. The figures show that over the last five years, ROCE has grown 41% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. The company is doing well in that sense, and it's worth investigating what the management team has planned for long term growth prospects.The Bottom Line On Lockheed Martin's ROCETo bring it all together, Lockheed Martin has done well to increase the returns it's generating from its capital employed. And investors seem to expect more of this going forward, since the stock has rewarded shareholders with a 72% return over the last five years. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.Story continuesIf you want to continue researching Lockheed Martin, you might be interested to know about the 1 warning sign that our analysis has discovered.High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

It is the second largest manufacturer in the world after China and the third largest in terms of regions, with the European Union coming in second place. In Q1 2018, the output of the manufacturing sector in the U.S. was $2 trillion. The manufacturing sector employs more than 12.5 million people. Currently, manufacturing accounts for $2.3 trillion of the GDP and is comprised of more than 20% of the country's total capital investment, 35% of productivity growth and around 60% of the total exports of the country, not to mention 70% of business R&amp;D spending.Despite being a manufacturing giant, the U.S. has seen high growth in other sectors including the service sector which dominates its GDP. Growth in the manufacturing sector meanwhile has stagnated from 4.9% in the 1990s to 1.4% in the last two decades. Further, the number of manufacturing plants have also decreased in the U.S. over the past quarter of a century, declining by nearly 25%. While only contributing 8% to the national workforce and 11% to the country's GDP, there are some signs of a potential resurgence. From 2010 to 2019, around 1.3 million manufacturing jobs were added in the U.S. after the loss of close to 6 million jobs in the previous decade. According to McKinsey, maintaining and improving this growth in the manufacturing sector could result in the U.S. GDP being boosted by 15% in the future. This will also add more than 1.5 million jobs.  In around 500 U.S. counties, manufacturing is easily the biggest sector. The manufacturing sector is more inclusive in its selection of employees not to mention that people don't need four-year degrees in order to be eligible to work which makes it easier for people of differing backgrounds to get in. Middle-skill workers would benefit the most from an improvement in the manufacturing sector which in turn would bolster the middle class.Story continuesThe top manufacturing companies in the U.S. belong to wildly differing industries, from aerospace and defense to tech products to healthcare products.

(NASDAQ:TMUS)No. of Hedge Fund Holders: 91Performance of TMUS Over the Past 6 Months: +18%T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) is an American wireless network operator and the second-largest wireless carrier in the US. The company provides wireless voice and data services in the US and serves as a host network for several mobile virtual network operators.CEO G Michael Sievert dumped 20,000 shares on 11th May, at an average price of $121.99 per share. Total value came in at $2,439,800.00. On 25th May, Moffett Nathanson reduced the price target on T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) to $165.00.At the end of the first quarter of 2022, 91 elite funds were bullish on T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) against 86 hedge funds in the previous quarter.ClearBridge Investments, an investment management firm, released its Q4 investor letter and mentioned T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS). Here is what the fund said:“As mentioned, the communication services sector has come under some pressure, and irrational pricing competition has negatively impacted wireless industry growth and profitability of late, weighing on T-Mobile. Faced with these headwinds, and with pressure from other wireless carriers and cable companies that could cause the company to cede share in subscriber growth in 2022, we exited our position in the fourth quarter.”9. PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM)No. of Hedge Fund Holders: 27Performance of PHM Over the Past 6 Months: +0.26%Headquartered in Atlanta, PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM) is one of the largest homebuilders in the US, and it operates in 40 markets across 23 states. It builds single-family detached homes and provides products to entry-level, move-up, and active-adult buyers. The company is also engaged in offering homebuyers mortgage financing and title agency services. Its financial services segment takes care of these services.In the first quarter of 2022, its net income came in at $455 million, or $1.83 per share, exhibiting favorable operating conditions in the homebuilding industry. The company has realized significant growth in homebuilding revenues, gross margin, net income, and ROE. It has a contract backlog of 19,935 sold homes, valuing $11.5 billion as of 31st March 2022. The average sales price in backlog was $578,000, exhibiting 24% growth year-over-year. Following the close of Q1, Moody's Investors Service upgraded the company’s senior unsecured notes ratings to Baa2 from Baa3.Analysts at UBS Group reduced their target price on PulteGroup, Inc.

In a report dated 2nd May, Wedbush reduced its target price on the company from $68.00 to $57.00.As of Q1 2022, 27 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey reported owning stakes worth $318.02 million in PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM), down from 35 in the preceding quarter worth $788.8 million.Oakmark Funds, an investment management firm, published its Q1 2022 investor letter and mentioned PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM). This is what the fund has to say:“Pulte (NYSE:PHM) is one of the nation’s largest homebuilders. While demographic tailwinds are expected to support healthy housing demand for years to come, more important to our thesis is the company’s operational transformation over the past decade. Having adopted a more rigorous, returns-driven approach to land acquisition and manufacturing, Pulte now consistently earns returns on equity near the high end of its peer group. We expect the company to generate approximately 15% of its market cap in free cash flow this year, and management is putting that cash to good use by strengthening its balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders. While we recognize that the recent surge in home prices is producing a level of profitability that’s above what we would consider “normal,” we still find the stock attractive relative to our more tempered estimate of mid-cycle earnings.”8. D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI)No. of Hedge Fund Holders: 52Performance of DHI Over the Past 6 Months: +18%D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) is the largest homebuilding company when measured by the number of homes closed. The company constructs and sells homes through its operating divisions in 98 markets across 31 states.The company has reported that its net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 59% to $4.03 per diluted share against $2.53 per diluted share in Q2 of fiscal 2021. Its net sales orders for Q2 decreased 10% to 24,340 homes and grew 10% in value to $9.7 billion in comparison to 27,059 homes and $8.8 billion in the same quarter of the previous year. In fiscal 2022, consolidated revenues are expected to lie between $35.3 billion-$36.1 billion.D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) was in 52 hedge fund portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2022, compared to 54 funds in the preceding quarter. In a research report dated 17th June, analysts at Wells Fargo &amp; Company reduced their price target on shares of D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) from $86.00 to $73.00. They gave an “Overweight” rating on the stock.A fall in consumer confidence, higher interest rates, and a trend change in the number of building permits are the near-term headwinds for D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI). Most real estate purchases are funded through mortgages. With the US Fed increasing interest rates, mortgages are becoming expensive. This can result in lower demand for houses.Third Avenue Management, an investment management firm, released a first-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here is what Third Avenue Management stated about D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI):“Outside of these additions, the Fund also sold “out-of-the-money” put options on the common stock of D.R. Horton, Inc. (“DR Horton”)-the largest homebuilder in the U.S. that accounted for nearly 1 out 9 new homes sold in the U.S. last year. Having followed the company for years, Fund Management can say without hesitation that DR Horton is an incredibly efficient builder focused on delivering quality product at the entry-level price point (its average selling price was less than $325,000 last year) with leading positions in key Sunbelt markets including Dallas, Houston, Austin, Atlanta, and Phoenix.While the near-term outlook for DR Horton is somewhat uncertain given mortgage rate and supply chain volatility, the medium-to-long-term prospects for volume-based homebuilders with super-strong balance sheets and scale advantages seem promising (such as DR Horton and Lennar Corp.) in Fund Management’s view. This is especially the case when considering that:Residential inventories are at record- low levels in most major markets whether gauged by “month’s supply” or aggregate units available,Demand for single- family residences is accelerating as the largest generation in U.S. history (the “millennial cohort”) enters its prime home buying years and desires more space not only due to “life events” but also “remote” and “hybrid” working arrangements, andSignificant inflation in rental rates for multi-family units in urban areas has left the rent-to-own proposition for single- family homes in suburban areas in a compelling range…” (Click here to see the full text)”7. DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. (NYSE:DKS)No. of Hedge Fund Holders: 31Performance of DKS Over the Past 6 Months: +40%DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. (NYSE:DKS) is a leading omni-channel sporting goods retailer which offers an extensive assortment of authentic, high-quality sports equipment, apparel, footwear, and accessories.On 25th May, Robert W. Baird reduced their target price on DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. (NYSE:DKS) from $115.00 to $85.00, giving a “Neutral” rating on the stock. However, Barclays analyst Adrienne Yih is optimistic about the stock after attending management meetings. She thinks that post-COVID enhanced margin structure, strong market position, and nationwide omnichannel footprint are expected to lend support.Insider Monkey’s data shows that 31 hedge funds held stakes at the end of the first quarter worth $1.14 billion. At the end of the previous quarter, 37 hedge funds held stakes in the company.Baron Funds, an asset management firm, released a first-quarter 2022 investor letter in which it mentioned DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. (NYSE:DKS). Here is what the fund said:“Dick’s Sporting Goods, Inc. was the first stock Michael recommended to us shortly after he joined Baron Capital in 2003. Dick’s share price has since increased about nine-fold. Unfortunately, we sold our investment in Dick’s about six years ago and, although it was a successful investment, we did not realize the full benefit of Michael’s recommendation. We sold too soon because I was concerned that competition from internet retailers would have a permanent negative impact on Dick’s stores’ profitability. I was wrong. Dick’s stock price so far has about doubled after we sold…and its prospects have brightened!We sold even though we considered Ed Stack, Dick’s Chairm”n and CEO, a terrific retailer, a great entrepreneur and a special person. Ed had built Dick’s from three bait and tackle stores his dad started into a uniquely positioned, nationwide chain of 730 sporting goods stores. In fact, Dick’s is now the largest nationwide sporting goods chain. Ed had purchased the three bait and tackle stores, the foundation of Dick’s business, from his dad. Ed’s mother loaned him the money to buy his dad’s stores! I’m not exactly sure what that signifies. But it may have something to do with Carl Icahn’s proclamation that “everything I have is for sale except my children…and maybe my wife.”Ed and his newly appointed CEO Lauren Hobart visited us last month. Ed asked for the meeting to introduce us to Lauren, as well as to discuss the prospects for Dick’s new, large format stores with attached outdoor, student athletic fields. Lauren then described how well its new format stores were doing in two smaller communities. We also spoke about the successes of Dick’s omni-channel retailing efforts and how desirable Dick‘s stores have become to shopping centers trying to lure shoppers to return to their malls.”6. CarMax, Inc. (NYSE:KMX)No. of Hedge Fund Holders: 27Performance of KMX Over the Past 6 Months: -28%CarMax, Inc. (NYSE:KMX) offers a broad selection of quality used vehicles and related products and services at competitive prices. It was formed in the year 1993 as a unit of Circuit City and, in late 2002, it was spun off into an independent company.CarMax, Inc. (NYSE:KMX) was in 27 hedge fund portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2022, compared to 35 funds in the previous quarter. On 7th June, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. reduced their price objective on the shares of CarMax, Inc. (NYSE:KMX) from $110.00 to $105.00.Giverny Capital, an asset management firm, released its first-quarter 2022 investor letter and mentioned CarMax, Inc. (NYSE:KMX). Here is what the fund said:“As for our other big decliners, Carmax is the country’s largest seller of used autos. Last year, amid supply chain shortages, production of new cars slowed. This created huge demand for used cars, and prices surged. Carmax opted to hold its gross profit dollars per vehicle flat in this environment, which benefits customers. If historically Carmax sold a used car for an average price of $21,000 with a $2,100 gross profit, in 2022 it sold used cars for an average price of $29,000 with a $2,200 gross profit. This decision was not well-received by Wall Street. In fairness to the critics, Carmax faced inflationary costs in wages and other areas that may have justified charging higher mark-ups. Still, Carmax sold 23% more vehicles in 2021 than in 2020, earned a lot more money and grew its market share to 4% of all transactions for used cars under 10 years old, from 3.5% a year ago. Presumably, the decision to price responsibly won it some customer goodwill that will result in future business.Recently, those very high prices for used cars have caused demand to wane. Carmax may sell fewer cars in 2022 than in 2021, which unnerves investors. But it continued to gain market share in early 2022 and still generate healthy profits. Carmax has become quite inexpensive relative to its proven ability to grow profitably in an enormous industry. A 4% market share leaves a lot of room for growth. We added modestly to our position during the first quarter.” Click to continue reading and see Was David Tepper Right About These 5 Stocks?.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 84% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Medtronic. See our latest analysis for Medtronic ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Medtronic?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Medtronic already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Medtronic, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Medtronic. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.3% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.7% and 4.4%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Story continuesWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of MedtronicThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Medtronic plc in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$98m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 16% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Medtronic. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.I always like to check for a history of revenue growth.

(NYSE:MRK), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 76% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And last week, institutional investors ended up benefitting the most after the company hit US$264b in market cap. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 34%.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Merck. View our latest analysis for Merck ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Merck?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Merck does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Merck's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Merck is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.8% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.5% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.6% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of MerckThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Merck &amp; Co., Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$198m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 24% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Merck.

It is the second largest manufacturer in the world after China and the third largest in terms of regions, with the European Union coming in second place. In Q1 2018, the output of the manufacturing sector in the U.S. was $2 trillion. The manufacturing sector employs more than 12.5 million people. Currently, manufacturing accounts for $2.3 trillion of the GDP and is comprised of more than 20% of the country's total capital investment, 35% of productivity growth and around 60% of the total exports of the country, not to mention 70% of business R&amp;D spending.Despite being a manufacturing giant, the U.S. has seen high growth in other sectors including the service sector which dominates its GDP. Growth in the manufacturing sector meanwhile has stagnated from 4.9% in the 1990s to 1.4% in the last two decades. Further, the number of manufacturing plants have also decreased in the U.S. over the past quarter of a century, declining by nearly 25%. While only contributing 8% to the national workforce and 11% to the country's GDP, there are some signs of a potential resurgence. From 2010 to 2019, around 1.3 million manufacturing jobs were added in the U.S. after the loss of close to 6 million jobs in the previous decade. According to McKinsey, maintaining and improving this growth in the manufacturing sector could result in the U.S. GDP being boosted by 15% in the future. This will also add more than 1.5 million jobs.  In around 500 U.S. counties, manufacturing is easily the biggest sector. The manufacturing sector is more inclusive in its selection of employees not to mention that people don't need four-year degrees in order to be eligible to work which makes it easier for people of differing backgrounds to get in. Middle-skill workers would benefit the most from an improvement in the manufacturing sector which in turn would bolster the middle class.Story continuesThe top manufacturing companies in the U.S. belong to wildly differing industries, from aerospace and defense to tech products to healthcare products. These companies are generally among the biggest in their industry not just in the U.S. but also globally.

Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Accordingly, Northrop Grumman investors that purchase the stock on or after the 25th of November will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 14th of December.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.73 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$6.92 per share. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Northrop Grumman has a trailing yield of approximately 1.3% on its current stock price of $520.42. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. Check out our latest analysis for Northrop Grumman If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Northrop Grumman is paying out just 19% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Northrop Grumman generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. Over the past year it paid out 186% of its free cash flow as dividends, which is uncomfortably high. We're curious about why the company paid out more cash than it generated last year, since this can be one of the early signs that a dividend may be unsustainable.Story continuesWhile Northrop Grumman's dividends were covered by the company's reported profits, cash is somewhat more important, so it's not great to see that the company didn't generate enough cash to pay its dividend. Were this to happen repeatedly, this would be a risk to Northrop Grumman's ability to maintain its dividend.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. That's why it's comforting to see Northrop Grumman's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 26% per annum for the past five years. Earnings have been growing quickly, but we're concerned dividend payments consumed most of the company's cash flow over the past year.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Northrop Grumman has lifted its dividend by approximately 13% a year on average. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.The Bottom LineIs Northrop Grumman an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? We're glad to see the company has been improving its earnings per share while also paying out a low percentage of income. However, it's not great to see it paying out what we see as an uncomfortably high percentage of its cash flow. It might be worth researching if the company is reinvesting in growth projects that could grow earnings and dividends in the future, but for now we're not all that optimistic on its dividend prospects.On that note, you'll want to research what risks Northrop Grumman is facing. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 2 warning signs with Northrop Grumman and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

(NYSE:NKE)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-intrinsic-value-nike-inc-120057503.html,1668945657,STORY,['NKE'],"[In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for NIKE What's The Estimated Valuation?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.74bUS$5.63bUS$6.76bUS$7.45bUS$8.50bUS$9.27bUS$9.91bUS$10.5bUS$10.9bUS$11.3bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x10Analyst x8Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 9.07%Est @ 6.94%Est @ 5.45%Est @ 4.41%Est @ 3.68% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.6% US$4.4kUS$4.9kUS$5.4kUS$5.5kUS$5.9kUS$6.0kUS$5.9kUS$5.8kUS$5.6kUS$5.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$55bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$11b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.6%– 2.0%) = US$204bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$204b÷ ( 1 + 7.6%)10= US$98bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$152b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$105, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at NIKE as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.104. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

Many investors are growing increasingly apprehensive about what next year may hold. Accordingly, many are choosing to add exposure to high-yielding dividend stocks over growth stocks, as uncertainty reigns supreme.This makes sense, considering the latest macroeconomic developments. In my view, investors should consider allocating at least a portion of their portfolio to dividend stocks. These companies tend to serve as an excellent source of passive income, perfect for current retirees and investors looking towards eventual retirement. Additionally, dividend stocks provide excellent added stability to investors’ portfolios.Now, given the current market scenario, one might question a company’s ability to deliver proper dividend payouts. However, there are a few businesses with solid fundamentals that would be perfect choices right now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe three companies below have withstood tough times in the past, consistently delivering dividend payouts to their stakeholders. Furthermore, these firms have also increased their dividend payments continuously for at least 25 years. Investors looking for passive income should consider these three high-yielding dividend stocks for the long term.VFCV.F. Corporation$33.45CVXChevron$188.05XOMExxon Mobil$114.13V.F. Corporation (VFC)Image of a giant boot in the street surrounded by people.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comFirst on our list of high-yielding dividend stocks to buy is U.S.-based international footwear and apparel company V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC). Known for its North Face, Timberland, JanSport and Eastpak brands, this company’s market presence is significant. In fact, they dominate almost 55% of the country’s backpack market.Now, investors might refrain from putting their money in businesses that deal in apparel. There are many reasons for this, but chief among the concerns are the fact that these companies’ profits tend to be tied to products that change as quickly as consumer tastes. That said, this company has a wide array of consumer brands under its belt, with significant customer loyalty. Thus, this is a company that I think is able to align its business model with ongoing consumer trends and reap profits.Story continuesFor example, North Face sales have grown by 14% in the recent quarter, and 21% year-to-date. This sort of growth has propelled the company to announce the increase of its quarterly dividend of 51 cents. This is a rise of 2% from the previous year’s 50 cents, taking the current dividend yield to 7.1%. It will be available to investors on record from Dec. 20 on. Moreover, market experts expect V.F.’s earnings per share to increase in the coming year, making the company’s valuation more attractive.Over the years, V.F. Corporation has shown a steady rise in its dividend payouts, with very little fluctuation. In 2012, the company’s annual payout stood at 72 cents, and from there, it increased to $2.00 per share most recently.Chevron (CVX)CVX stockSource: tishomir / Shutterstock.comAnother company I’ve long considered to be among the best high-yielding dividend stocks to buy is  Chevron (NYSE:CVX). This oil giant provides investors with a dividend yield of 3.02%. That’s great, but perhaps not as high-yielding as many would have liked to see.That said, investors who bought Chevron stock during the depths of the pandemic saw the kind of yield CVX stock and others provided. Dealing in oil exploration, production and refining, the company’s business model has gone from demonized to viewed as essential in the span of a year.Due to the war between Russia and Ukraine, there is a dearth in the supply of oil and natural gas in the market. This situation is making it more difficult for European countries to generate adequate power. Hence, stocks of energy companies like Chevron are trading in the market near their all-time high.As of today, this corporation offers a dividend yield of 3.02%. Experts predict that these payouts will increase in the future thanks to the growing demand for energy and Chevron’s share buyback program. Moreover, this company’s return on capital employed is growing at a rapid pace. Currently, it stands at 17%, recording growth of 2,640% in the last 5 years.In addition, Chevron Corporation has entered into an agreement with Pertamina Power Indonesia and Keppel Infrastructure (OTCMKTS:KPELY) to explore the development of ammonia and green hydrogen projects in Indonesia. This partnership can enable the corporation to deliver strong growth in the long run.Exxon Mobil (XOM)Exxon Mobil logo outside of a corporate buildingSource: Harry Green / Shutterstock.comTexas-based Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is another energy company I think long-term investors would do well to consider at these levels. Yes, Exxon Mobil has outperformed the market of late. But that’s for good reason.Apart from manufacturing, transporting and selling petroleum products, Exxon is also involved in the manufacturing of synthetic rubber, plastic and other products. These will continue to be in high demand, regardless of where oil prices go in the near term. Owning the entire value stack allows Exxon to capture a significant portion of the value it creates, relative to many of its peers.At the time of writing, the dividend yield of this company stands at 3.2%. Over the last 10 years, the company has increased its dividend from 47 cents per share to a current distribution of 91 cents per share. That’s some impressive growth for investors who have simply stuck with this name.Additionally, recent developments around Exxon Mobil’s Coral South floating project in Mozambique have intrigued investors. This project has delivered $8 billion worth of liquefied natural gas (LNG) via its first cargo ship. This massive supply will help meet the rising global energy demand in the market and also expand Exxon’s international LNG business.Moreover, this offshore project is estimated to generate 450 billion cubic meters of natural gas for transporting. With the Coral South offshore floating project’s help, Exxon plans on doubling its LNG supply by 2030.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

(NYSE:PFE) boasts of strong institutional backing",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/70-ownership-pfizer-inc-nyse-120033490.html,1668945633,STORY,['PFE'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 70% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Pfizer. Check out our latest analysis for Pfizer ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Pfizer?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Pfizer does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Pfizer, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Pfizer. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.8%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.7% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.5% by the third-largest shareholder.On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Story continuesWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of PfizerThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Pfizer Inc.. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$102m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 30% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Pfizer better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Pfizer  that you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

Millennials are using it in almost identical numbers. What these younger generations may not realize is the financial risk to this popular payment method.The Future of Finances: Gen Z &amp; How They Relate to MoneyFind Out: 3 Easy Tips To Turn Your Credit Woes Into WowsBuy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) services allow customers to make purchases and take them home before they actually pay for the items. The customer must pay the service back within a set period of time — most commonly 30 days, although some BNPL services allow longer.“Unfortunately, there are no easy ways to buy over time without incurring interest fees,” said Cyndie Martini, CEO and founder of Member Access Processing. “While Buy Now, Pay Later options [can] have lower interest rates, they still add a fee that ultimately makes that item you purchased last month more expensive with each passing month the balance is not paid off.”Of course, if you pay off your BNPL debts on time, you won’t have to worry about interest or late fees. But racking up debt for the holidays isn’t a new concept, and it’s one that can lead to financial turmoil if you find yourself short on cash down the line. Here are seven alternatives to BNPL that are easier on your wallet.Apply For a Credit Card With 0% APR“Credit cards are a highly competitive environment, and they compete on special offers and rewards,” Martini said. “Smart consumers can take advantage of these factors.“Some credit cards have introductory APRs of 0% for six to 12 months. That means purchases made during that window are interest free. However, if the consumer doesn’t pay off the balance before the introductory period ends, they are required to pay all the back interest.”These types of credit cards give consumers more time to pay back their holiday debt than most BNPL services. This can be six, 12, even 21 months. However, you typically need good or excellent credit to qualify.Story continuesTake Our Poll: How Long Do You Think It Will Take You To Pay Off Your Credit Card Debt?Accrue Cash-Back Rewards To Fund Your Shopping“The other strategy that Gen Z consumers can use is [credit card] rewards,” Martini said. “One way to do this is to find a cash-back card that has no annual fee. Then, put all must-pay monthly bills on the credit card, including bills for shelter, food, insurance and utilities. By doing so, consumers can quickly build a bank of cash rewards to use during the holiday season.”The downside to this strategy is that it’s best done over time. Consumers will have more rewards and more money to use if they start months before they need to buy gifts.You also can use a cash-back card to make your holiday purchases. If you’re confident you can pay it off, it’s better than using a debit card, since the rewards actually can reduce the balance on the card. This is especially true if your bank lets you select a specific category for the most cash back, such as “online shopping.”Buy Gifts on LayawayEllen Cibula, fintech expert and founder of Ellen H Cibula Inc., suggests layaway as a viable alternative to BNPL.“With layaway, [consumers] put down a deposit on an item and then make small payments until it’s paid off,” she said. “Once it’s paid in full, they can take the item home. This can be a great option if they’re worried about being able to afford everything all at once or if they want to avoid racking up credit card debt or fees from BNPL payments.”Not all stores offer layaway. Here are some that do, according to the Krazy Coupon Lady:AmazonBuckleBurlingtonGameStopHallmarkKmartSearsPay With Cash or DebitIf you’re nervous about debt this holiday season, you can simply stick to cash or debit cards.“This is the old-school method for many, and it may involve saving up the funds to purchase something rather than just shelling out cash whenever they want — but it’s also the best way to avoid debt,” said consumer analyst Julie Ramhold with DealNews.com.“The downside to this is that it does involve planning ahead so that you’re able to save the funds up before making your purchase, which may mean missing out on an early deal.”Set Deal Alerts NowIn case you’re not still saving up, Ramhold recommends staying on top of holiday deals so you can snag gifts at a fraction of the price.“Set deal alerts now so that when a product drops in price, you can grab it while it’s discounted and avoid having to pay more later,” she said. “There are multiple sites that allow you to set up alerts for specific products — in some cases, simply creating an account and adding items to a wish list is enough.”Make Your Gifts or Shop SecondhandWhat’s so tempting about BNPL during the holidays is being able to gift your friends and family with things they love even if you don’t quite have the funds to make that happen. But you can still be a good giver by thinking outside the box and either making your gifts or buying them used.“Secondhand bookstores often have great rates and, depending on the size, plenty to choose from,” Ramhold said. “If you’re crafty, you can take advantage of Black Friday sales at craft stores to pick up items to make your own gifts, or even for supplies to gift to your favorite crafter. You can also consider things like gifting a treat you’re known for, like cookies, fudge or toffee; and, if you’re feeling very generous, including the recipe with it.”Peruse your local Goodwill or other thrift store for a multitude of gift-worthy items. It’s often assumed that thrifted items are worse than brand-new ones, but a lot of what’s stocked in a Goodwill is practically new and has the same quality.Use PayPal’s Version of BNPLIf you’re really strapped for cash and determined to get your holiday gifts anyway, you can consider using PayPal to fund your gift purchases.“The service offers its own Buy Now, Pay Later function, but without late fees,” Ramhold said. “Because PayPal is so widely offered as a payment option, it’s easy to shop where you want, and you can choose Pay in 4, which works like other BNPL methods, or the Pay Monthly option, which provides plans for six, 12 and 24 monthly payments with $0 down and no late fees.“There are pros and cons for each, but the Pay in 4 assures that you accrue no interest and both methods come with purchase protection and no signup or late fees.”Make sure you’re familiar with the terms and conditions before you use PayPal’s Pay in 4 or Pay Monthly options, and understand that even without late fees or interest you’re still obligated to pay back whatever you spend.More From GOBankingRates25 Sneaky Car Dealership Tricks To Avoid at All CostsSocial Security Payment Schedule 2023: What Dates To Watch Out ForThe 10 Best Balance Transfer Credit Cards for 20237 Ways To Know You're Ready To Start InvestingThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 7 Alternatives to ‘Buy Now, Pay Later’ This Holiday Season]"

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Major Companies that Accept Bitcoin as Payment.The world of cryptocurrency is a strange one, and despite having been in existence for well over a decade, anyone dealing in cryptocurrency is still seen as shady, though recent evens, which we'll talk more about, may provide some reason behind this belief. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency in the world, created by a person with the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, whose identity is still unknown. First used in 2009, when its cost was close to $0, Bitcoin's price has wildly fluctuated ever since. To maintain the bitcoin blockchain, ensuring its completeness and consistency, miners step in, in a method known as proof-of-work, which is extremely time consuming, not to mention requiring a lot of processing power.Once bitcoin started to gain in popularity, other cryptocurrencies followed, with the total number of cryptocurrencies now exceeding 12,000. The most popular of the other cryptocurrencies is definitely Ethereum, which also has the second highest market cap after Bitcoin and recently shifted from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, which is expected to result in reduction of consumption of energy by an incredible 99.95%.15 major companies that accept Bitcoin as paymentWhile initially costing just a few cents, Bitcoin kept gaining in value over time. In 2010, the first transaction in Bitcoin was conducted by crypto enthusiast Laszlo Hanyecz, when he ordered 2 large pizzas from Papa John's International for 10,000 bitcoins which were worth around $40 at the time. Today, they are worth over $166.2 million. At their peak, they were worth over $640 million. In 2013, the price of Bitcoin jumped to around $100 which many considered to be a bubble. The price kept increasing steadily over the next four years, crossing $1,000 in early 2017. 2017 was the first year of stratospheric growth in the price of Bitcoin which crossed $10,000 within the same year, a jump of around 1,000%. 2018 meanwhile saw the first major crash after the currency became popular, closing the year at under $4,000, resulting in many people losing out on their investments. This volatility demonstrated by the cryptocurrency has not decreased or matured over time as 2019 saw the price jumping again to around $10,600 before falling to $7,200 in January 2020. But it was in 2020 and then the first three quarters of 2021 that the price of the cryptocurrency kept increasing with no end in sight at that time, peaking at around $64,000 in November 2021, before crashing over the next year to its current price of close to $17,000, with most other cryptocurrencies following suit but exhibiting even more volatility.Story continuesWhile crypto enthusiasts have long decried regulation and have supported Bitcoin precisely because there is no regulation involved, 2022 has shown the risks of having something worth hundreds of billions of dollars and yet not being regulated at all, with scams rife in addition to corruption and manipulation. In 2022, one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies, Luna, collapsed completely, wiping out $45 billion from the crypto market in just one week. Earlier in November, FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange based in the Bahamas, collapsed after news emerged that Sam Bankman-Fried's Alameda Research held a position worth $5 billion in FTT, the native token of FTX. FTX, the company that was valued at about $32 billion, went from its peak to bankruptcy within a matter of just 10 days.Because of the lack of regulation and the volatility associated with Bitcoin, many countries have banned it, with nine countries having banned it completely and an additional fifteen countries have banned it implicitly. Some other countries meanwhile have embraced it whole-heartedly, including El Salvador which has actually made Bitcoin legal tender, with the same move being made by the Central African Republic in 2022. Meanwhile, other countries have used it because of its anonymity and not being regulated such as Iran, which often uses Bitcoin to bypass sanctions imposed by the West. Ukraine has been a major beneficiary of Bitcoin, using it to accept donations during the Russia Ukraine war which began in early 2022.While countries and governments have been wary of Bitcoin, many companies are now considering embracing Bitcoin and using it as a form of payment, which represents major growth for a cryptocurrency which for several years after its creation was primarily used for illegal, nefarious purposes such as buying illegal drugs or making payments for illegal activities on the Dark Web. One of the first companies to adopt Bitcoin was a Fortune 500 company which started doing so in 2014. According to Bloomberg, in 2018, the 17 biggest crypto processing merchants handled transactions in Bitcoin worth $69 million which was a significant decrease from 2017 which recorded $411 million. Since chargebacks can't be processed and the cost of using Bitcoin is high, many vendors refuse to use it.In 2021, when Bitcoin was setting a new record for all time high prices every few days or weeks, and people were expecting it to reach $100,000, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) gave it a huge boost with CEO Elon Musk, who has historically preferred Tweets over press releases, announcing in March 2021 that Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) would be accepting Bitcoin as payment, while also investing $1.5 billion in Bitcoin. However, in May 2021, Musk announced that Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) would stop accepting Bitcoin as payment, reversing course in just two months, citing the environmental cost of Bitcoin as its primary reason behind this reversal, as if that was something that the company hadn't known about two months prior.With Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) no longer accepting Bitcoin as payment, the list of major companies that accept Bitcoin as payment has changed from the prior year. So, without further ado, let's take a look at the amended list, starting with number 15:15.

In Q1 2018, the output of the manufacturing sector in the U.S. was $2 trillion. The manufacturing sector employs more than 12.5 million people. Currently, manufacturing accounts for $2.3 trillion of the GDP and is comprised of more than 20% of the country's total capital investment, 35% of productivity growth and around 60% of the total exports of the country, not to mention 70% of business R&amp;D spending.Despite being a manufacturing giant, the U.S. has seen high growth in other sectors including the service sector which dominates its GDP. Growth in the manufacturing sector meanwhile has stagnated from 4.9% in the 1990s to 1.4% in the last two decades. Further, the number of manufacturing plants have also decreased in the U.S. over the past quarter of a century, declining by nearly 25%. While only contributing 8% to the national workforce and 11% to the country's GDP, there are some signs of a potential resurgence. From 2010 to 2019, around 1.3 million manufacturing jobs were added in the U.S. after the loss of close to 6 million jobs in the previous decade. According to McKinsey, maintaining and improving this growth in the manufacturing sector could result in the U.S. GDP being boosted by 15% in the future. This will also add more than 1.5 million jobs.  In around 500 U.S. counties, manufacturing is easily the biggest sector. The manufacturing sector is more inclusive in its selection of employees not to mention that people don't need four-year degrees in order to be eligible to work which makes it easier for people of differing backgrounds to get in. Middle-skill workers would benefit the most from an improvement in the manufacturing sector which in turn would bolster the middle class.Story continuesThe top manufacturing companies in the U.S. belong to wildly differing industries, from aerospace and defense to tech products to healthcare products. These companies are generally among the biggest in their industry not just in the U.S. but also globally. Some of these companies are counted among the largest companies in the world regardless of sector or industry. Their combined revenue exceeds a staggering $1 trillion while their combined market cap is closer to $2 trillion.

Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, the CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) share price is up 82% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 45% (ignoring dividends).While the stock has fallen 3.3% this week, it's worth focusing on the longer term and seeing if the stocks historical returns have been driven by the underlying fundamentals. View our latest analysis for CSX To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, CSX achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 24% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 13% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on CSX's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, CSX's TSR for the last 5 years was 94%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that CSX shares lost 13% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 21%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 14% for each year. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with CSX , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.CSX is not the only stock that insiders are buying.

If you want to see more of billionaire Steve Cohen's top dividend stocks, go directly to Billionaire Steve Cohen's Top 5 Dividend Stocks.Billionaire Steve Cohen is the founder of Point72 Asset Management which as of the end of September has a 13F equity portfolio of over $25 billion. Prior to founding Point72 Asset Management, Cohen was the founder of SAC Capital Advisors which generated higher than average returns for two decades.Due to the success of SAC Capital Advisors and Point72 Asset Management, Steve Cohen is worth around $12.8 billion according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Aside from owning stocks, Cohen also owns the New York Mets.In terms of Point72 Asset Management, the fund has many different strategies including long short equity investing, and systematic investing.In terms of long/short equity investing, the strategy is Point72's largest by asset allocation and is a sector-aligned, multi-manager business where teams are empowered to do deep fundamental research and run unique investing processes.For systematic investing, Point72 Asset Management designs and implements systematic, computer driven trading strategies to buy and sell across multiple asset classes.Given that Point72 Asset Management has many different investing teams and the fund also uses computer driven trading strategies for part of its fund, Point72 Asset Management has many different positions. For Q3, for example, the fund has over 1,800 positions in different stocks.2022Given high inflation, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times in 2022 so far and U.S. Treasury yields have increased substantially as a result.Given the higher Treasury yields, many dividend stocks have declined year to date as capital has flowed from dividend stocks into Treasuries which in some instances offer higher yields. As a result, some quality blue chip dividend stocks have fairly low valuations that could be attractive if the Federal Reserve eventually wins its war against inflation.Story continuesGiven the economic uncertainty currently, however, the market could still go lower if economic data fails to meet expectations. As a result, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset ManagementMethodologyFor the Billionaire Steve Cohen's Top 10 Dividend Stocks list, we took 10 stocks that paid a dividend from billionaire Steve Cohen's Point72 Asset Management's top 25 positions according to Q3 2022 13F filings.We ranked them based on Point72 Asset Management's stake value in the stocks.Billionaire Steve Cohen's Top 10 Dividend Stocks10.

Although shares of GlaxoSmithKline plc (NYSE:GSK) are down almost 27% year to date due to broader market weakness and the Zantac lawsuits, Point72 Asset Management initiated a new stake of over $136 million or 0.54% of the fund's 13F equity portfolio in GlaxoSmithKline plc (NYSE:GSK) in Q3. With estimated average EPS of $3.12 for 2022, $3.39 for 2023, and $3.64 for 2024, GlaxoSmithKline plc (NYSE:GSK)'s annual dividend of $1.64 per share seems secure if the company meets profit expectations.Alongside Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS), and AstraZeneca plc (NASDAQ:AZN), GlaxoSmithKline plc (NYSE:GSK) is a top dividend stock in billionaire Steve Cohen's Point72 Asset Management's portfolio.9. Dell Technologies Inc.

(NYSE:DELL) in Q3 where the price of the stock ranged from around $34 to $49 per share. Given Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL)'s current price of $42.04, Point72 Asset Management could either be down or up on its position depending on its average price. In terms of analyst estimates, Jim Suva of Citi recently cut his price target to $55 from $60 per share but kept a 'Buy' rating on Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) citing a weakening environment for PC, smartphone and printers given the macroeconomic headwinds.Given Point72 Asset Management's position, Dell Technologies Inc.

(NASDAQ:ROST) by 210% in Q3 to end the quarter with a position worth over $146 million in the off-price retail apparel and home fashion chain. Given Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST)'s surge of almost 10% on November 18 due to stronger than expected Q3 earnings and guidance, the new purchases have been profitable at least in the near term.Madison Mid Cap Fund commented on Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) in a Q3 2022 investor letter,“Ross Stores is one of our longest-tenured holdings. Its profits have gyrated wildly since the beginning of the pandemic, first from store closures and shutdowns, then from the pent-up demand for apparel, and more recently, from the economic uncertainty. Adding to that, Ross is finding that consumers’ spending trends in terms of mix and categories have been more difficult to predict than usual, resulting in some mismatches between its merchandise assortment and what shoppers want. This doesn’t appear to be a Ross-specific issue, as other apparel retailers have reported similar problems. We attribute this to the unusual post-pandemic environment, and while we don’t have a crystal ball as to when this will normalize, we believe it will.”7. Juniper Networks, Inc. (NYSE:JNPR)Point72 Asset Management's Stake Value as of 9/30: $163,388,000Percentage of Point72 Asset Management's 13F Portfolio as of 9/30: 0.65%Dividend Yield as of 11/18: 2.66%Billionaire Steve Cohen's Point72 Asset Management increased its position in Juniper Networks, Inc.

(NYSE:JNPR) also has a dividend yield of 2.66%. In terms of its preliminary Q3 results, Juniper Networks, Inc. (NYSE:JNPR) earned an adjusted EPS of $0.58 on sales of $1.415 billion versus the estimated $0.50 and $1.35 billion.Given Point72 Asset Management's stake, Juniper Networks, Inc.

This means that a larger number of shares were sold by insiders in relation to shares purchased.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Verizon Communications The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Verizon CommunicationsThe , Tamara Erwin, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.2m worth of shares at a price of US$49.77 each. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$38.55. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price. Tamara Erwin was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below.

This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Verizon Communications Tell Us?The fact that there have been no Verizon Communications insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. We don't take much encouragement from the transactions by Verizon Communications insiders. But it's good to see that insiders own shares in the company.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest Multinational Companies in the World.A multinational is a company which is incorporated in a single country but its operations are spread across borders. One of the things distinguishing a multinational from just an investment organization which invests in companies abroad is the aspect of control in the former. While the above is just a basic definition, there are some specific definitions that different organizations use, with Black's Law Dictionary suggesting that a company is a multinational if at least 25% of its revenue is from outside its home country.You might think that multinationals only came into existence in the past couple of centuries especially after the development of global trade, but the actual history of multinationals, even though they weren't known as multinationals at the time, is actually much older, in line with colonialism. The two earliest examples of multinationals are the Dutch East India Company and the British East India Company which were set up to engage in trade in different port cities. The British East India company had its own army and formed the basis of the British colonialism of India. The Dutch East India Company meanwhile is assessed to have been worth close to $8.3 trillion adjusted for inflations, making it the richest corporation in history.Currently, most of the biggest companies in the world are multinationals, with some defining characteristics, mainly central headquarters with operations in multiple countries. These companies are often engaged in importing and exporting goods, investing in foreign countries, engaging in the buying and selling of licenses in foreign countries, manufacturing or assembly operations operating in basically every industry in the world.Nowadays, multinationals have become the targets of activists for their unscrupulous activities, resulting in many anti-capital and anti-corporate movements. Many such companies are criticized for their size and political involvement, with lobbying, trade agreements and deregulated financial markets allowing them to exercise a lot of power. Despite massive corporations earning billions of dollars every year in profit, most of them have been decried for their labor practices, including underpaying and overworking employees and these companies' opposition to unions or better rights for employees.Story continuesThe biggest multinational companies in the world aren't the biggest companies in the world. This is true for Chinese companies which are state-owned and only have operations within the country. There are also a couple of health companies in the United States which are counted among the biggest companies in the world but aren't multinationals since their operations are only concentrated within the nation. To determine our list, we consulted the Fortune Global 500 list and excluded companies which don't fall under the definition of a multinational. We then ranked these companies based on revenue, profits, assets and employees, assigning 30% weightage to the first two metrics and 20% weightage to the last two. So, without further ado, let's take a look at the biggest multinationals out there right now, starting with number 15:Daily newspaper economy stock market chart15.

When you buy individual stocks, you can make higher profits, but you also face the risk of under-performance. Investors in The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) have tasted that bitter downside in the last year, as the share price dropped 40%. That falls noticeably short of the market decline of around 21%. Notably, shareholders had a tough run over the longer term, too, with a drop of 38% in the last three years. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 24% in the last 90 days. We note that the company has reported results fairly recently; and the market is hardly delighted. You can check out the latest numbers in our company report.Given the past week has been tough on shareholders, let's investigate the fundamentals and see what we can learn. See our latest analysis for Walt Disney To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Even though the Walt Disney share price is down over the year, its EPS actually improved. Of course, the situation might betray previous over-optimism about growth.It's fair to say that the share price does not seem to be reflecting the EPS growth. So it's easy to justify a look at some other metrics.Walt Disney's revenue is actually up 23% over the last year. Since we can't easily explain the share price movement based on these metrics, it might be worth considering how market sentiment has changed towards the stock.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-and-revenue-growthWalt Disney is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. Given we have quite a good number of analyst forecasts, it might be well worth checking out this free chart depicting consensus estimates.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 21% in the twelve months, Walt Disney shareholders did even worse, losing 40%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 1.4% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. Before forming an opinion on Walt Disney you might want to consider these 3 valuation metrics.Of course Walt Disney may not be the best stock to buy.

Estee Lauder (NYSE:EL) has agreed to buy Tom Ford for $2.8 billion. The company will pay about $2.3 billion, in addition to $300 million in deferred payments to sellers starting from July 2025, as well as including a $250 million payment from Marcolin S.p.A. to extend the long-term global eyewear license for the brand.D.A. Davidson analyst Linda Bolton Weiser thinks the Tom Ford deal is a “huge positive for EL.” EL had to buy Tom Ford, Bolton Weiser argues, because “if Kering (EPA:PRTP) had acquired Tom Ford, Kering could have brought the beauty business in-house at some point in the future, removing one of EL’s highest growth revenue streams.” Bank of America analyst Bryan Spillane raised the price target on EL stock to $230 per share from the prior $218 and weighed in positively on the deal.2. 8x8 Inc (NASDAQ:EGHT) has been approached about a takeover by a strategic buyer, according to a source cited by StreetInsider. The buyer is said to have hired bankers to explore a deal. It is unclear if 8x8 is entertaining the approach or has hired its own advisors. 8x8 is an integrated cloud communications platform that has had its fair share of takeover speculation over the years. In 2017, the company unsuccessfully explored a sale although its stock was trading at over 4 times the current level at that time.3. Hasbro Inc (NASDAQ:HAS) has decided to put most of Entertainment One up for sale, according to Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter. The company appointed JPMorgan and Centerview Partners to steer the process after receiving takeover interest.4. Opiant Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:OPNT) said it has agreed to be acquired by Indivior Inc, a subsidiary of Indivior PLC (OTC:INVVY) (LON:INDV), for $20.00 per share in cash, plus contingent value rights (CVRs) representing, if achieved, potential additional payments over a period of seven years of up to $8.00 per share. The companies say the upfront payment represents a premium of approximately 111% to Opiant's closing share price on November 11, 2022.Story continues5. Standard General's proposed acquisition of Tegna Inc (NYSE:TGNA) has cleared its security review, according to Bloomberg. A filing says U.S. security agencies have ""no objection"" to the deal, which still needs to clear antitrust and FCC review. Earlier this month Standard General's acquisition of Tegna drew Department of Justice queries over potential TV price hikes, according to Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter. Antitrust officials are also concerned about information sharing.6. Diamondback Energy Inc (NASDAQ:FANG) agreed to an acquisition of Northern Midland Basin assets through its deal to purchase all leasehold interest and related assets of Lario Permian, LLC, a subsidiary of Lario Oil &amp; Gas Company, and certain associated sellers, in exchange for 4.18 million shares of Diamondback common stock and $850 million of cash.Senad Karaahmetovic contributed to this article.Related Articles6 biggest deal reports this week: Estee Lauder, HasbroVolkswagen-SAIC venture to close manual transmission plant in ChinaBudweiser World Cup campaign curbed, not crashed, by Qatar beer ban]"

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Major Companies that Accept Bitcoin as Payment.The world of cryptocurrency is a strange one, and despite having been in existence for well over a decade, anyone dealing in cryptocurrency is still seen as shady, though recent evens, which we'll talk more about, may provide some reason behind this belief. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency in the world, created by a person with the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, whose identity is still unknown. First used in 2009, when its cost was close to $0, Bitcoin's price has wildly fluctuated ever since. To maintain the bitcoin blockchain, ensuring its completeness and consistency, miners step in, in a method known as proof-of-work, which is extremely time consuming, not to mention requiring a lot of processing power.Once bitcoin started to gain in popularity, other cryptocurrencies followed, with the total number of cryptocurrencies now exceeding 12,000. The most popular of the other cryptocurrencies is definitely Ethereum, which also has the second highest market cap after Bitcoin and recently shifted from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, which is expected to result in reduction of consumption of energy by an incredible 99.95%.15 major companies that accept Bitcoin as paymentWhile initially costing just a few cents, Bitcoin kept gaining in value over time. In 2010, the first transaction in Bitcoin was conducted by crypto enthusiast Laszlo Hanyecz, when he ordered 2 large pizzas from Papa John's International for 10,000 bitcoins which were worth around $40 at the time. Today, they are worth over $166.2 million. At their peak, they were worth over $640 million. In 2013, the price of Bitcoin jumped to around $100 which many considered to be a bubble. The price kept increasing steadily over the next four years, crossing $1,000 in early 2017. 2017 was the first year of stratospheric growth in the price of Bitcoin which crossed $10,000 within the same year, a jump of around 1,000%. 2018 meanwhile saw the first major crash after the currency became popular, closing the year at under $4,000, resulting in many people losing out on their investments. This volatility demonstrated by the cryptocurrency has not decreased or matured over time as 2019 saw the price jumping again to around $10,600 before falling to $7,200 in January 2020. But it was in 2020 and then the first three quarters of 2021 that the price of the cryptocurrency kept increasing with no end in sight at that time, peaking at around $64,000 in November 2021, before crashing over the next year to its current price of close to $17,000, with most other cryptocurrencies following suit but exhibiting even more volatility.Story continuesWhile crypto enthusiasts have long decried regulation and have supported Bitcoin precisely because there is no regulation involved, 2022 has shown the risks of having something worth hundreds of billions of dollars and yet not being regulated at all, with scams rife in addition to corruption and manipulation. In 2022, one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies, Luna, collapsed completely, wiping out $45 billion from the crypto market in just one week. Earlier in November, FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange based in the Bahamas, collapsed after news emerged that Sam Bankman-Fried's Alameda Research held a position worth $5 billion in FTT, the native token of FTX. FTX, the company that was valued at about $32 billion, went from its peak to bankruptcy within a matter of just 10 days.Because of the lack of regulation and the volatility associated with Bitcoin, many countries have banned it, with nine countries having banned it completely and an additional fifteen countries have banned it implicitly. Some other countries meanwhile have embraced it whole-heartedly, including El Salvador which has actually made Bitcoin legal tender, with the same move being made by the Central African Republic in 2022. Meanwhile, other countries have used it because of its anonymity and not being regulated such as Iran, which often uses Bitcoin to bypass sanctions imposed by the West. Ukraine has been a major beneficiary of Bitcoin, using it to accept donations during the Russia Ukraine war which began in early 2022.While countries and governments have been wary of Bitcoin, many companies are now considering embracing Bitcoin and using it as a form of payment, which represents major growth for a cryptocurrency which for several years after its creation was primarily used for illegal, nefarious purposes such as buying illegal drugs or making payments for illegal activities on the Dark Web. One of the first companies to adopt Bitcoin was a Fortune 500 company which started doing so in 2014. According to Bloomberg, in 2018, the 17 biggest crypto processing merchants handled transactions in Bitcoin worth $69 million which was a significant decrease from 2017 which recorded $411 million. Since chargebacks can't be processed and the cost of using Bitcoin is high, many vendors refuse to use it.In 2021, when Bitcoin was setting a new record for all time high prices every few days or weeks, and people were expecting it to reach $100,000, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) gave it a huge boost with CEO Elon Musk, who has historically preferred Tweets over press releases, announcing in March 2021 that Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) would be accepting Bitcoin as payment, while also investing $1.5 billion in Bitcoin. However, in May 2021, Musk announced that Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) would stop accepting Bitcoin as payment, reversing course in just two months, citing the environmental cost of Bitcoin as its primary reason behind this reversal, as if that was something that the company hadn't known about two months prior.With Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) no longer accepting Bitcoin as payment, the list of major companies that accept Bitcoin as payment has changed from the prior year. So, without further ado, let's take a look at the amended list, starting with number 15:15. Coca-Cola Amatil LimitedTotal revenue of the company (in billions): $1.73One of the biggest distributors of Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Amatil announced in June 2020 that its vending machines would accept cryptocurrencies as payment too.14.

71,6cd57d7c-d0a8-33a4-a054-e31c5bffbeff,RHI,2022-11-20,7 Recession-Resistant Stocks to Batten Down the Hatches,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-recession-resistant-stocks-batten-000349265.html,1668643429,STORY,"['HD', 'FIVE', 'RHI', 'KO', 'PGR', 'PG', 'KR']","[With fears rising regarding a global economic slowdown, investors should consider recession-resistant stocks to batten down the hatches. Fundamentally, one of the biggest concerns that analysts cited centers on global central banks tightening their money supply. Reduced liquidity almost certainly signals deflation if left unchecked, which translates to reduced business activity. That’s going to be a killer for growth-oriented investments.On the other hand, it may open up a cynical opportunity for so-called recession-resistant stocks to buy. These enterprises typically command well-established and relevant business models that cater to overriding needs. They’re not the sexiest market ideas to be sure and thus don’t offer extreme growth potential. However, they can offer dependability and stability, which may carry a higher premium given the circumstances.If anything, your portfolio should be protected from the wild vagaries of the present market cycle. As well, if monetary fluctuations occur, recession-resistant stocks may be able to insulate your wealth. Therefore, every investor should at least give some thought to the below contextually compelling ideas.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsKOCoca-Cola$60.52KRKroger$47.83HDHome Depot$314.91PGProcter &amp; Gamble$141.74PGRProgressive$125.91FIVEFive Below$149.77RHIRobert Half$76.88Coca-Cola (KO)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large textSource: iQoncept/shutterstock.comOne of the most iconic brands in American business, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) offers a classic case for recession-resistant stocks to buy. During the aftermath of the Great Recession, many analysts cited KO as a name investors can trust. No, it’s not the most exciting company in the world. However, the brand is integrated into the fabric of society.For me, Coca-Cola drives plenty of value and confidence because of its cheap pick-me-up narrative. During decidedly bullish economic cycles, consumers usually won’t think twice about popping into their local coffee shop franchise to order an overpriced cup of Joe. However, with recessionary forces at play, consumers must tighten their belts. That’s going to benefit Coca-Cola.Story continuesOn the financials, investors can bank on KO’s strong profitability metrics. For instance, its net margin stands at 23.4%, ranked higher than over 94% of its rivals. Also, the company carries a return on equity (ROE) of nearly 43%. In contrast, the industry median is only 10.7%.Kroger (KR)Kroger (KR) Supermarket. The Kroger Co. is One of the World's Largest Grocery Retailers.Source: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.comFundamentally, the narrative for Kroger (NYSE:KR) as one of the recession-resistant stocks to buy sells itself. It’s a cynical topic but let’s be real. Humans require a minimum amount of calorie intake. No calories and liquids and you’re not getting too far in life. Therefore, households have little choice but to sacrifice everything else before they cut into the grocery budget.Another factor that helps boost KR as one of the recession-resistant stocks to put on your radar centers on the trade-down effect. During a bull market, people feel good about themselves. So, they might treat themselves (and their loved ones) to fancy dinners. However, with the specter of a global recession on the horizon, those fancy dinners become fast-food takeout. Then this category trades down to microwave dinners.You get the point. Plus, Kroger enjoys some intriguing financial metrics. For instance, its ROE stands at nearly 26%, which reflects a high-quality business. Also, its price-to-sales ratio is 0.24 times, lower than the industry median of 0.5 times.Home Depot (HD)an interior view of a house attic under constructionSource: ronstik / Shutterstock.comA dependable company when circumstances go awry, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) just happens to be built for economic and literal storms. Further, the organization proved its benefit to the public, staying open for longer than most other businesses during the initial wave of the coronavirus pandemic. Frankly, I don’t think Home Depot gets enough credit for this gesture.Now, as one of the recession-resistant stocks to buy, Home Depot benefits from cynical realities. Basically, Murphy’s Law doesn’t care if a recession is ongoing or not. Sometimes, it seems like Murphy’s Law becomes more prominent when a recession or some other crisis materializes. While it’s not a panacea for all mishaps, you can depend on Home Depot to carry the products that will get you out of your particular jam.Financially, investors will likely take great encouragement from the company’s income-statement metrics. Specifically, its operating and net margins of 15.3% and 10.9%, respectively, rank among the underlying sector’s elite.Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)Procter &amp; Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&amp;G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods CompanySource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comA relatively easy choice for recession-resistant stocks to buy, Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) benefits from an indelible business model. Manufacturing several household goods, Procter &amp; Gamble combines relevancy (through addressing basic needs) and brand awareness. To be fair, consumers can trade down to generic alternatives. However, circumstances will need to be truly dire before we get to that point.Interestingly, though, PG’s boring nature as one of the recession-resistant stocks didn’t spare it from volatility. So far this year, shares slipped nearly 14% in equity value. That’s not too far removed from the benchmark S&amp;P 500, which shed almost 17%. However, PG garnered momentum recently, gaining over 2% in the trailing five days. It’s also up over 10% in the trailing month.Financially, the company benefits from reasonable stability in the balance sheet. For instance, its Altman Z-Score is 5.23, reflecting a very low bankruptcy risk. Also, it features strong profitability metrics, such as a net margin of 18% which ranks above nearly 92% of the competition.Progressive (PGR)ROOT Stock - Man holding car insuranceSource: Jirsak / Shutterstock.comRepresenting the number one commercial auto insurer in the U.S., Progressive (NYSE:PGR) commands significant brand awareness. Thanks to its memorable fictional salesperson character Flo, Progressive has become ingrained when it comes to auto insurance. And that’s significant because it enables the company to muscle out other recession-resistant stocks in this insurance subsegment.While it’s a cynical talking point, we’ve got to face reality: Progressive enjoys a hostage audience. According to the company’s website, every state in the Union requires auto insurance except New Hampshire. Even then, those that decide to go without coverage must meet the state’s financial responsibility requirements. Honestly, it’s just better to get auto insurance.Another cynical argument for PGR as one of the recession-resistant stocks to buy? It’s getting more dangerous out there on America’s roadways. Although you can’t control what others do, you can at least protect yourself. Given that everyone learned a lesson that stuff can happen at any moment, PGR makes an excellent case for itself.Five Below (FIVE)Friends sit on a ledge with shopping bags after shopping retail stores.Source: Rawpixel.com / ShutterstockShould an economic downturn materialize, investors will want to target Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) as one of the recession-resistant stocks to buy. It comes down to the trade-down effect. When financial pressures materialize, consumers naturally start to tighten their spending habits. However, they don’t go from one extreme to another. Rather, they taper down their expenditures gradually.Fundamentally, that’s what I like about Five Below. Unlike a pure discount-dollar store, Five Below mostly features products priced at $5 or less. Further, the company provides a small selection of products that range from $6 to $25, enabling greater consumer choice. It also means that the stores feature a more upscale ambiance which can certainly help the shopping experience.Financially, Gurufocus.com makes a case that Five Below represents a modestly undervalued investment. Backed by a decently stable balance sheet, Five Below features excellent revenue growth and profit margins that rank in the sector’s top tier.Robert Half (RHI)An image of someone using a laptop on a white table with 'jobs' on the rightSource: TierneyMJ / ShutterstockTo be clear, the inclusion of Robert Half (NYSE:RHI) as one of the recession-resistant stocks will likely generate controversy. As an employment staffing agency, an argument exists that Robert Half and its ilk fleece the flock. After all, job applicants can apply directly for the positions they want. And with employers apparently desperate for workers, RHI seems irrelevant.Still, the process of finding quality workers represents a major hassle. As well, so much can go wrong if an enterprise hires a person not qualified for the position. In addition, you have other factors (such as personality mismatches) that can cloud an organization’s ambiance. For efficiency’s sake, many companies outsource the hassle of hiring to professional staffing agencies.Also, keep in mind the current circumstances. With the Fed continuing to attack the inflation rate through higher interest rates, the strategy is having a major effect. Several companies, particularly those tied to big tech, are implementing big layoffs. Cynically, then, Robert Half could see an influx of demand, making RHI one of the recession-resistant stocks to consider.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

(NASDAQ:MDLZ) insiders sold US$11m worth of stock, possibly signalling a downtrend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mondelez-international-inc-nasdaq-mdlz-110008066.html,1668942008,STORY,['MDLZ'],"[The fact that multiple Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Mondelez International Mondelez International Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, Fredric Reynolds, sold US$5.7m worth of shares at a price of US$63.29 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$64.99, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was 69% of Fredric Reynolds's stake.Mondelez International insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider Ownership Of Mondelez InternationalLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Mondelez International insiders own 0.1% of the company, currently worth about US$107m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Mondelez International Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Mondelez International shares in the last quarter. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Mondelez International insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 3 warning signs for Mondelez International (of which 1 is a bit unpleasant!) you should know about.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

73,659b85a6-3e1b-3e99-ad8f-b0d8dbee1476,MDLZ,2022-11-20,10 Biggest Chewing Gum Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-biggest-chewing-gum-companies-225220688.html,1668898340,STORY,"['TROLB', 'MDLZ']","[In this article, we take a look at the 10 biggest chewing gum companies in the world. You can skip our detailed analysis of the chewing gum industry and go directly to 5 Biggest Chewing Gum Companies in the World.The global chewing gum market had a market size of $26 billion in 2021 and is projected to grow with a CAGR of 3% during the period 2022-2027, per the IMARC market research. North America has both the biggest producer and consumer share of the gum industry at $5 billion as of 2019 and this share is projected to have a compounding annual growth of $7 billion for the 2022-2027 period.Chewing Gum Sub-IndustriesDifferent sub-industries within the larger gum industry however, have different dynamics. For instance, Research and Markets reported that nicotine gum saw a surge in demand during the pandemic presumably because of covid health risk to smokers. Fortune Business Insights valued the nicotine gum sub-industry at $1.49 billion in 2021. Their report projected its growth at a CAGR of 4.8% for the period 2022-2029, which would translate to a gain in share of over half a billion dollars. The Research and Markets report further went on to say that sugary chewing gums are seeing a relative decline in demand which is being offset by healthier sugar-free gums. Mordor Intelligence forecasts a CAGR of 7.3% for the sugar-free chewing gum sub-industry for the 2022-2027 period, with Europe being its largest market and Asia-Pacific being the fastest growing market.Overall, functional chewing gums — gums that serve a beneficial purpose — are rising higher in demand than non-functional gums as consumers become more health-conscious. The tooth-whitening gum industry holds more than 50% share of the functional gum market according to the Research and Markets report. Key PlayersMost prominent corporations in the market include Wrigley Company, owned by Mars, Incorporated, Cadbury, owned by Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) and Lotte. Wrigley Company and Cadbury alone account for 60% of the global chewing gum market. Story continuesSome of the most popular chewing gums made by Wrigley Company and Mondelez-International-owned Cadbury include DoubleMint and Trident, respectively. In fact, DoubleMint has been the best-selling chewing gum in the world per Statista, with almost $100 million in sales for 2019. These gum brands are easily available across the world in many flavors. Some of the most prominent platforms and stores where people can get their hands on these chewing gums include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST). Photo by Pete Alexopoulos on Unsplash Our MethodologyFor our list of the 10 biggest chewing gum companies in the world, we’d be looking at their most recent revenues as the ranking metric. We’d also be discussing the scale of the companies in terms of their number of employees and presence across the world. 10. Tootsie Roll Industries, Inc. (NYSE:TR)Annual Revenue: $570 million Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 10Tootsie Roll Industries, Inc. (NYSE:TR) is an American confectionery company headquartered in Chicago, Illinois.

The increase in sales was attributed to growing post-pandemic demand recovery and “effective” pre-Halloween sales program.Addressing the issue of price increase for Tootsie products, Ellen Gordon, the CEO of Tootsie Roll Industries, Inc. (NYSE:TR), said that the prices had to be raised throughout 2021-2022 to compensate for the growing economic stagflation. She also lamented that the increase in sales was offset for the most part by “significantly"" high input costs due to growing prices of ingredients, packaging material and freight in the face of growing energy cost, commodity shortage and supply chain issues. As of the third quarter of 2022, 10 hedge funds own a total equity of $21 million in Tootsie Roll Industries, Inc. (NYSE:TR). Renaissance Technologies alone accounts for $14 million worth of stock and is its leading shareholder.9. Ezaki Glico Co., Ltd.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Having said that, from a first glance at Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Coca-Cola, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.17 = US$12b ÷ (US$92b - US$21b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, Coca-Cola has an ROCE of 17%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 14% generated by the Beverage industry. See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola roceIn the above chart we have measured Coca-Cola's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Coca-Cola here  for free.So How Is Coca-Cola's ROCE Trending?Over the past five years, Coca-Cola's ROCE and capital employed have both remained mostly flat. It's not uncommon to see this when looking at a mature and stable business that isn't re-investing its earnings because it has likely passed that phase of the business cycle. With that in mind, unless investment picks up again in the future, we wouldn't expect Coca-Cola to be a multi-bagger going forward. That probably explains why Coca-Cola has been paying out 70% of its earnings as dividends to shareholders. These mature businesses typically have reliable earnings and not many places to reinvest them, so the next best option is to put the earnings into shareholders pockets.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayIn summary, Coca-Cola isn't compounding its earnings but is generating stable returns on the same amount of capital employed. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 56% over the last five years. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.On a separate note, we've found   2 warning signs for Coca-Cola   you'll probably want to know about.While Coca-Cola isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

76,6e648c68-acf8-32d7-ad70-8ffb972c07b0,GE,2022-11-20,Top 15 Manufacturing Companies in the US,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-15-manufacturing-companies-us-164034446.html,1668876034,STORY,"['GE', 'DELL', 'BA', 'GM', 'LMT']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the top 15 manufacturing companies in the U.S. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the Top 5 Manufacturing Companies in the U.S.The manufacturing sector in the United States is among the biggest in the world and a key driver of the biggest economy in the world. It is the second largest manufacturer in the world after China and the third largest in terms of regions, with the European Union coming in second place. In Q1 2018, the output of the manufacturing sector in the U.S. was $2 trillion. The manufacturing sector employs more than 12.5 million people. Currently, manufacturing accounts for $2.3 trillion of the GDP and is comprised of more than 20% of the country's total capital investment, 35% of productivity growth and around 60% of the total exports of the country, not to mention 70% of business R&amp;D spending.Despite being a manufacturing giant, the U.S. has seen high growth in other sectors including the service sector which dominates its GDP. Growth in the manufacturing sector meanwhile has stagnated from 4.9% in the 1990s to 1.4% in the last two decades. Further, the number of manufacturing plants have also decreased in the U.S. over the past quarter of a century, declining by nearly 25%. While only contributing 8% to the national workforce and 11% to the country's GDP, there are some signs of a potential resurgence. From 2010 to 2019, around 1.3 million manufacturing jobs were added in the U.S. after the loss of close to 6 million jobs in the previous decade. According to McKinsey, maintaining and improving this growth in the manufacturing sector could result in the U.S. GDP being boosted by 15% in the future. This will also add more than 1.5 million jobs.  In around 500 U.S. counties, manufacturing is easily the biggest sector. The manufacturing sector is more inclusive in its selection of employees not to mention that people don't need four-year degrees in order to be eligible to work which makes it easier for people of differing backgrounds to get in. Middle-skill workers would benefit the most from an improvement in the manufacturing sector which in turn would bolster the middle class.Story continuesThe top manufacturing companies in the U.S. belong to wildly differing industries, from aerospace and defense to tech products to healthcare products. These companies are generally among the biggest in their industry not just in the U.S. but also globally. Some of these companies are counted among the largest companies in the world regardless of sector or industry. Their combined revenue exceeds a staggering $1 trillion while their combined market cap is closer to $2 trillion.

77,830a117f-acfa-3e86-abbd-e7d18192cee1,PGR,2022-11-20,The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) insiders sold US$3.7m worth of stock suggesting impending weakness.,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/progressive-corporation-nyse-pgr-insiders-120049647.html,1668945649,STORY,['PGR'],"[Many The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Progressive Progressive Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the President of Personal Lines, Patrick Callahan, for US$2.4m worth of shares, at about US$126 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$128, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. It is worth noting that this sale was 59% of Patrick Callahan's holding.In the last year Progressive insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeI will like Progressive better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insiders At Progressive Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Progressive. In total, President of Personal Lines Patrick Callahan dumped US$2.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesDoes Progressive Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It's great to see that Progressive insiders own 0.3% of the company, worth about US$236m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Progressive Tell Us?An insider sold Progressive shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. While conducting our analysis, we found that Progressive has 2 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore them.But note: Progressive may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

78,6cd57d7c-d0a8-33a4-a054-e31c5bffbeff,PGR,2022-11-20,7 Recession-Resistant Stocks to Batten Down the Hatches,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-recession-resistant-stocks-batten-000349265.html,1668643429,STORY,"['HD', 'FIVE', 'RHI', 'KO', 'PGR', 'PG', 'KR']","[With fears rising regarding a global economic slowdown, investors should consider recession-resistant stocks to batten down the hatches. Fundamentally, one of the biggest concerns that analysts cited centers on global central banks tightening their money supply. Reduced liquidity almost certainly signals deflation if left unchecked, which translates to reduced business activity. That’s going to be a killer for growth-oriented investments.On the other hand, it may open up a cynical opportunity for so-called recession-resistant stocks to buy. These enterprises typically command well-established and relevant business models that cater to overriding needs. They’re not the sexiest market ideas to be sure and thus don’t offer extreme growth potential. However, they can offer dependability and stability, which may carry a higher premium given the circumstances.If anything, your portfolio should be protected from the wild vagaries of the present market cycle. As well, if monetary fluctuations occur, recession-resistant stocks may be able to insulate your wealth. Therefore, every investor should at least give some thought to the below contextually compelling ideas.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsKOCoca-Cola$60.52KRKroger$47.83HDHome Depot$314.91PGProcter &amp; Gamble$141.74PGRProgressive$125.91FIVEFive Below$149.77RHIRobert Half$76.88Coca-Cola (KO)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large textSource: iQoncept/shutterstock.comOne of the most iconic brands in American business, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) offers a classic case for recession-resistant stocks to buy. During the aftermath of the Great Recession, many analysts cited KO as a name investors can trust. No, it’s not the most exciting company in the world. However, the brand is integrated into the fabric of society.For me, Coca-Cola drives plenty of value and confidence because of its cheap pick-me-up narrative. During decidedly bullish economic cycles, consumers usually won’t think twice about popping into their local coffee shop franchise to order an overpriced cup of Joe. However, with recessionary forces at play, consumers must tighten their belts. That’s going to benefit Coca-Cola.Story continuesOn the financials, investors can bank on KO’s strong profitability metrics. For instance, its net margin stands at 23.4%, ranked higher than over 94% of its rivals. Also, the company carries a return on equity (ROE) of nearly 43%. In contrast, the industry median is only 10.7%.Kroger (KR)Kroger (KR) Supermarket. The Kroger Co. is One of the World's Largest Grocery Retailers.Source: Eric Glenn / Shutterstock.comFundamentally, the narrative for Kroger (NYSE:KR) as one of the recession-resistant stocks to buy sells itself. It’s a cynical topic but let’s be real. Humans require a minimum amount of calorie intake. No calories and liquids and you’re not getting too far in life. Therefore, households have little choice but to sacrifice everything else before they cut into the grocery budget.Another factor that helps boost KR as one of the recession-resistant stocks to put on your radar centers on the trade-down effect. During a bull market, people feel good about themselves. So, they might treat themselves (and their loved ones) to fancy dinners. However, with the specter of a global recession on the horizon, those fancy dinners become fast-food takeout. Then this category trades down to microwave dinners.You get the point. Plus, Kroger enjoys some intriguing financial metrics. For instance, its ROE stands at nearly 26%, which reflects a high-quality business. Also, its price-to-sales ratio is 0.24 times, lower than the industry median of 0.5 times.Home Depot (HD)an interior view of a house attic under constructionSource: ronstik / Shutterstock.comA dependable company when circumstances go awry, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) just happens to be built for economic and literal storms. Further, the organization proved its benefit to the public, staying open for longer than most other businesses during the initial wave of the coronavirus pandemic. Frankly, I don’t think Home Depot gets enough credit for this gesture.Now, as one of the recession-resistant stocks to buy, Home Depot benefits from cynical realities. Basically, Murphy’s Law doesn’t care if a recession is ongoing or not. Sometimes, it seems like Murphy’s Law becomes more prominent when a recession or some other crisis materializes. While it’s not a panacea for all mishaps, you can depend on Home Depot to carry the products that will get you out of your particular jam.Financially, investors will likely take great encouragement from the company’s income-statement metrics. Specifically, its operating and net margins of 15.3% and 10.9%, respectively, rank among the underlying sector’s elite.Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)Procter &amp; Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&amp;G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods CompanySource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comA relatively easy choice for recession-resistant stocks to buy, Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) benefits from an indelible business model. Manufacturing several household goods, Procter &amp; Gamble combines relevancy (through addressing basic needs) and brand awareness. To be fair, consumers can trade down to generic alternatives. However, circumstances will need to be truly dire before we get to that point.Interestingly, though, PG’s boring nature as one of the recession-resistant stocks didn’t spare it from volatility. So far this year, shares slipped nearly 14% in equity value. That’s not too far removed from the benchmark S&amp;P 500, which shed almost 17%. However, PG garnered momentum recently, gaining over 2% in the trailing five days. It’s also up over 10% in the trailing month.Financially, the company benefits from reasonable stability in the balance sheet. For instance, its Altman Z-Score is 5.23, reflecting a very low bankruptcy risk. Also, it features strong profitability metrics, such as a net margin of 18% which ranks above nearly 92% of the competition.Progressive (PGR)ROOT Stock - Man holding car insuranceSource: Jirsak / Shutterstock.comRepresenting the number one commercial auto insurer in the U.S., Progressive (NYSE:PGR) commands significant brand awareness. Thanks to its memorable fictional salesperson character Flo, Progressive has become ingrained when it comes to auto insurance. And that’s significant because it enables the company to muscle out other recession-resistant stocks in this insurance subsegment.While it’s a cynical talking point, we’ve got to face reality: Progressive enjoys a hostage audience. According to the company’s website, every state in the Union requires auto insurance except New Hampshire. Even then, those that decide to go without coverage must meet the state’s financial responsibility requirements. Honestly, it’s just better to get auto insurance.Another cynical argument for PGR as one of the recession-resistant stocks to buy? It’s getting more dangerous out there on America’s roadways. Although you can’t control what others do, you can at least protect yourself. Given that everyone learned a lesson that stuff can happen at any moment, PGR makes an excellent case for itself.Five Below (FIVE)Friends sit on a ledge with shopping bags after shopping retail stores.Source: Rawpixel.com / ShutterstockShould an economic downturn materialize, investors will want to target Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) as one of the recession-resistant stocks to buy. It comes down to the trade-down effect. When financial pressures materialize, consumers naturally start to tighten their spending habits. However, they don’t go from one extreme to another. Rather, they taper down their expenditures gradually.Fundamentally, that’s what I like about Five Below. Unlike a pure discount-dollar store, Five Below mostly features products priced at $5 or less. Further, the company provides a small selection of products that range from $6 to $25, enabling greater consumer choice. It also means that the stores feature a more upscale ambiance which can certainly help the shopping experience.Financially, Gurufocus.com makes a case that Five Below represents a modestly undervalued investment. Backed by a decently stable balance sheet, Five Below features excellent revenue growth and profit margins that rank in the sector’s top tier.Robert Half (RHI)An image of someone using a laptop on a white table with 'jobs' on the rightSource: TierneyMJ / ShutterstockTo be clear, the inclusion of Robert Half (NYSE:RHI) as one of the recession-resistant stocks will likely generate controversy. As an employment staffing agency, an argument exists that Robert Half and its ilk fleece the flock. After all, job applicants can apply directly for the positions they want. And with employers apparently desperate for workers, RHI seems irrelevant.Still, the process of finding quality workers represents a major hassle. As well, so much can go wrong if an enterprise hires a person not qualified for the position. In addition, you have other factors (such as personality mismatches) that can cloud an organization’s ambiance. For efficiency’s sake, many companies outsource the hassle of hiring to professional staffing agencies.Also, keep in mind the current circumstances. With the Fed continuing to attack the inflation rate through higher interest rates, the strategy is having a major effect. Several companies, particularly those tied to big tech, are implementing big layoffs. Cynically, then, Robert Half could see an influx of demand, making RHI one of the recession-resistant stocks to consider.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

79,78a8c6b9-3f9b-329c-af9f-ad7002fbde37,EL,2022-11-20,"6 biggest deal reports this week: Estee Lauder, Hasbro",Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/6-biggest-deal-reports-week-115434621.html,1668858874,STORY,"['HAS', 'EL', 'EGHT', 'FANG']","[Here are the 6 most head-turning deal dispatches from the past week, as covered first on InvestingPro+.1. Estee Lauder (NYSE:EL) has agreed to buy Tom Ford for $2.8 billion. The company will pay about $2.3 billion, in addition to $300 million in deferred payments to sellers starting from July 2025, as well as including a $250 million payment from Marcolin S.p.A. to extend the long-term global eyewear license for the brand.D.A. Davidson analyst Linda Bolton Weiser thinks the Tom Ford deal is a “huge positive for EL.” EL had to buy Tom Ford, Bolton Weiser argues, because “if Kering (EPA:PRTP) had acquired Tom Ford, Kering could have brought the beauty business in-house at some point in the future, removing one of EL’s highest growth revenue streams.” Bank of America analyst Bryan Spillane raised the price target on EL stock to $230 per share from the prior $218 and weighed in positively on the deal.2. 8x8 Inc (NASDAQ:EGHT) has been approached about a takeover by a strategic buyer, according to a source cited by StreetInsider. The buyer is said to have hired bankers to explore a deal. It is unclear if 8x8 is entertaining the approach or has hired its own advisors. 8x8 is an integrated cloud communications platform that has had its fair share of takeover speculation over the years. In 2017, the company unsuccessfully explored a sale although its stock was trading at over 4 times the current level at that time.3. Hasbro Inc (NASDAQ:HAS) has decided to put most of Entertainment One up for sale, according to Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter. The company appointed JPMorgan and Centerview Partners to steer the process after receiving takeover interest.4. Opiant Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:OPNT) said it has agreed to be acquired by Indivior Inc, a subsidiary of Indivior PLC (OTC:INVVY) (LON:INDV), for $20.00 per share in cash, plus contingent value rights (CVRs) representing, if achieved, potential additional payments over a period of seven years of up to $8.00 per share. The companies say the upfront payment represents a premium of approximately 111% to Opiant's closing share price on November 11, 2022.Story continues5. Standard General's proposed acquisition of Tegna Inc (NYSE:TGNA) has cleared its security review, according to Bloomberg. A filing says U.S. security agencies have ""no objection"" to the deal, which still needs to clear antitrust and FCC review.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these companies, go directly to the 5 Biggest Commercial Janitorial Companies In USA.According to Statista, the janitorial services sector's market size will increase by 6.6 percent in 2022. The annualized percentage of this market's growth was 6.7% between 2017 and 2022. Additionally, between 2020 and 2021, the number of janitors and cleaners employed in the United States rose by nearly 50,000. By 2024, it is predicted that the U.S. janitorial services industry will generate around $50.1 billion in sales. The market size, measured by revenue, of the janitorial services industry is $97.6 billion in 2022. Businesses frequently grow when corporate profits increase, raising demand for janitorial services. However, dwindling corporate profit decreases demand for janitorial services as companies close facilities and cut back on the frequency of contracted cleaning to cut expenses. The industry may have an opportunity in 2022 as corporate profits are anticipated to rise, according to ibisworld. According to Allied Market Research, the cleaning services market is to reach $111.49 billion globally by 2030 at a 6.5% CAGR, as reported by Bloomberg.The global cleaning services industry is expanding due to service providers expanding their online presence and rising commercial consumer demand. However, heightened rivalry and the introduction of new companies limit market expansion. On the other hand, the demand for construction and post-construction cleaning services will open up new prospects. The Covid-19 pandemic has had a favorable effect on the global cleaning services business. Deep cleaning and disinfection have become more popular among residential and commercial users to reduce the risk of cross-contamination. To reduce the risk of infection, the governments of various countries established a variety of standard operating procedures and guidelines for businesses. As a result, cleaning services were more in demand at malls and large businesses.Story continuesPhoto by Jon Tyson on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of the 12 biggest commercial janitorial companies in the USA, we took the top 12 largest janitorial companies in the US by market capitalization.

(NASDAQ:TMUS)No. of Hedge Fund Holders: 91Performance of TMUS Over the Past 6 Months: +18%T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) is an American wireless network operator and the second-largest wireless carrier in the US. The company provides wireless voice and data services in the US and serves as a host network for several mobile virtual network operators.CEO G Michael Sievert dumped 20,000 shares on 11th May, at an average price of $121.99 per share. Total value came in at $2,439,800.00. On 25th May, Moffett Nathanson reduced the price target on T-Mobile US, Inc.

(NASDAQ:TMUS) against 86 hedge funds in the previous quarter.ClearBridge Investments, an investment management firm, released its Q4 investor letter and mentioned T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS). Here is what the fund said:“As mentioned, the communication services sector has come under some pressure, and irrational pricing competition has negatively impacted wireless industry growth and profitability of late, weighing on T-Mobile. Faced with these headwinds, and with pressure from other wireless carriers and cable companies that could cause the company to cede share in subscriber growth in 2022, we exited our position in the fourth quarter.”9. PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM)No. of Hedge Fund Holders: 27Performance of PHM Over the Past 6 Months: +0.26%Headquartered in Atlanta, PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM) is one of the largest homebuilders in the US, and it operates in 40 markets across 23 states. It builds single-family detached homes and provides products to entry-level, move-up, and active-adult buyers. The company is also engaged in offering homebuyers mortgage financing and title agency services. Its financial services segment takes care of these services.In the first quarter of 2022, its net income came in at $455 million, or $1.83 per share, exhibiting favorable operating conditions in the homebuilding industry. The company has realized significant growth in homebuilding revenues, gross margin, net income, and ROE. It has a contract backlog of 19,935 sold homes, valuing $11.5 billion as of 31st March 2022. The average sales price in backlog was $578,000, exhibiting 24% growth year-over-year. Following the close of Q1, Moody's Investors Service upgraded the company’s senior unsecured notes ratings to Baa2 from Baa3.Analysts at UBS Group reduced their target price on PulteGroup, Inc.

(NYSE:PHM), down from 35 in the preceding quarter worth $788.8 million.Oakmark Funds, an investment management firm, published its Q1 2022 investor letter and mentioned PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM). This is what the fund has to say:“Pulte (NYSE:PHM) is one of the nation’s largest homebuilders. While demographic tailwinds are expected to support healthy housing demand for years to come, more important to our thesis is the company’s operational transformation over the past decade. Having adopted a more rigorous, returns-driven approach to land acquisition and manufacturing, Pulte now consistently earns returns on equity near the high end of its peer group. We expect the company to generate approximately 15% of its market cap in free cash flow this year, and management is putting that cash to good use by strengthening its balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders. While we recognize that the recent surge in home prices is producing a level of profitability that’s above what we would consider “normal,” we still find the stock attractive relative to our more tempered estimate of mid-cycle earnings.”8. D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI)No. of Hedge Fund Holders: 52Performance of DHI Over the Past 6 Months: +18%D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) is the largest homebuilding company when measured by the number of homes closed. The company constructs and sells homes through its operating divisions in 98 markets across 31 states.The company has reported that its net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 59% to $4.03 per diluted share against $2.53 per diluted share in Q2 of fiscal 2021. Its net sales orders for Q2 decreased 10% to 24,340 homes and grew 10% in value to $9.7 billion in comparison to 27,059 homes and $8.8 billion in the same quarter of the previous year. In fiscal 2022, consolidated revenues are expected to lie between $35.3 billion-$36.1 billion.D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) was in 52 hedge fund portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2022, compared to 54 funds in the preceding quarter. In a research report dated 17th June, analysts at Wells Fargo &amp; Company reduced their price target on shares of D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) from $86.00 to $73.00. They gave an “Overweight” rating on the stock.A fall in consumer confidence, higher interest rates, and a trend change in the number of building permits are the near-term headwinds for D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI). Most real estate purchases are funded through mortgages. With the US Fed increasing interest rates, mortgages are becoming expensive. This can result in lower demand for houses.Third Avenue Management, an investment management firm, released a first-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here is what Third Avenue Management stated about D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI):“Outside of these additions, the Fund also sold “out-of-the-money” put options on the common stock of D.R. Horton, Inc. (“DR Horton”)-the largest homebuilder in the U.S. that accounted for nearly 1 out 9 new homes sold in the U.S. last year. Having followed the company for years, Fund Management can say without hesitation that DR Horton is an incredibly efficient builder focused on delivering quality product at the entry-level price point (its average selling price was less than $325,000 last year) with leading positions in key Sunbelt markets including Dallas, Houston, Austin, Atlanta, and Phoenix.While the near-term outlook for DR Horton is somewhat uncertain given mortgage rate and supply chain volatility, the medium-to-long-term prospects for volume-based homebuilders with super-strong balance sheets and scale advantages seem promising (such as DR Horton and Lennar Corp.) in Fund Management’s view. This is especially the case when considering that:Residential inventories are at record- low levels in most major markets whether gauged by “month’s supply” or aggregate units available,Demand for single- family residences is accelerating as the largest generation in U.S. history (the “millennial cohort”) enters its prime home buying years and desires more space not only due to “life events” but also “remote” and “hybrid” working arrangements, andSignificant inflation in rental rates for multi-family units in urban areas has left the rent-to-own proposition for single- family homes in suburban areas in a compelling range…” (Click here to see the full text)”7. DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. (NYSE:DKS)No. of Hedge Fund Holders: 31Performance of DKS Over the Past 6 Months: +40%DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. (NYSE:DKS) is a leading omni-channel sporting goods retailer which offers an extensive assortment of authentic, high-quality sports equipment, apparel, footwear, and accessories.On 25th May, Robert W. Baird reduced their target price on DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. (NYSE:DKS) from $115.00 to $85.00, giving a “Neutral” rating on the stock. However, Barclays analyst Adrienne Yih is optimistic about the stock after attending management meetings. She thinks that post-COVID enhanced margin structure, strong market position, and nationwide omnichannel footprint are expected to lend support.Insider Monkey’s data shows that 31 hedge funds held stakes at the end of the first quarter worth $1.14 billion. At the end of the previous quarter, 37 hedge funds held stakes in the company.Baron Funds, an asset management firm, released a first-quarter 2022 investor letter in which it mentioned DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. (NYSE:DKS). Here is what the fund said:“Dick’s Sporting Goods, Inc. was the first stock Michael recommended to us shortly after he joined Baron Capital in 2003. Dick’s share price has since increased about nine-fold. Unfortunately, we sold our investment in Dick’s about six years ago and, although it was a successful investment, we did not realize the full benefit of Michael’s recommendation. We sold too soon because I was concerned that competition from internet retailers would have a permanent negative impact on Dick’s stores’ profitability. I was wrong. Dick’s stock price so far has about doubled after we sold…and its prospects have brightened!We sold even though we considered Ed Stack, Dick’s Chairm”n and CEO, a terrific retailer, a great entrepreneur and a special person. Ed had built Dick’s from three bait and tackle stores his dad started into a uniquely positioned, nationwide chain of 730 sporting goods stores. In fact, Dick’s is now the largest nationwide sporting goods chain. Ed had purchased the three bait and tackle stores, the foundation of Dick’s business, from his dad. Ed’s mother loaned him the money to buy his dad’s stores! I’m not exactly sure what that signifies. But it may have something to do with Carl Icahn’s proclamation that “everything I have is for sale except my children…and maybe my wife.”Ed and his newly appointed CEO Lauren Hobart visited us last month. Ed asked for the meeting to introduce us to Lauren, as well as to discuss the prospects for Dick’s new, large format stores with attached outdoor, student athletic fields. Lauren then described how well its new format stores were doing in two smaller communities. We also spoke about the successes of Dick’s omni-channel retailing efforts and how desirable Dick‘s stores have become to shopping centers trying to lure shoppers to return to their malls.”6. CarMax, Inc. (NYSE:KMX)No. of Hedge Fund Holders: 27Performance of KMX Over the Past 6 Months: -28%CarMax, Inc. (NYSE:KMX) offers a broad selection of quality used vehicles and related products and services at competitive prices. It was formed in the year 1993 as a unit of Circuit City and, in late 2002, it was spun off into an independent company.CarMax, Inc. (NYSE:KMX) was in 27 hedge fund portfolios at the end of the first quarter of 2022, compared to 35 funds in the previous quarter. On 7th June, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. reduced their price objective on the shares of CarMax, Inc. (NYSE:KMX) from $110.00 to $105.00.Giverny Capital, an asset management firm, released its first-quarter 2022 investor letter and mentioned CarMax, Inc. (NYSE:KMX). Here is what the fund said:“As for our other big decliners, Carmax is the country’s largest seller of used autos. Last year, amid supply chain shortages, production of new cars slowed. This created huge demand for used cars, and prices surged. Carmax opted to hold its gross profit dollars per vehicle flat in this environment, which benefits customers. If historically Carmax sold a used car for an average price of $21,000 with a $2,100 gross profit, in 2022 it sold used cars for an average price of $29,000 with a $2,200 gross profit. This decision was not well-received by Wall Street. In fairness to the critics, Carmax faced inflationary costs in wages and other areas that may have justified charging higher mark-ups. Still, Carmax sold 23% more vehicles in 2021 than in 2020, earned a lot more money and grew its market share to 4% of all transactions for used cars under 10 years old, from 3.5% a year ago. Presumably, the decision to price responsibly won it some customer goodwill that will result in future business.Recently, those very high prices for used cars have caused demand to wane. Carmax may sell fewer cars in 2022 than in 2021, which unnerves investors. But it continued to gain market share in early 2022 and still generate healthy profits. Carmax has become quite inexpensive relative to its proven ability to grow profitably in an enormous industry. A 4% market share leaves a lot of room for growth. We added modestly to our position during the first quarter.” Click to continue reading and see Was David Tepper Right About These 5 Stocks?.

To skip our analysis of the construction industry, you can go directly to see the 5 Longest Bridges in the World.The Construction Industry: An AnalysisThe construction industry is one of the world’s largest industries with respect to spending as well as contributions to the GDP. The industry encompasses real estate, infrastructure, and industrial structures and accounts for 13% of the world’s GDP, according to a McKinsey report.The construction industry, similar to almost all other industries, was severely affected by the coronavirus pandemic. The industry is on a path to recovery with construction spending peaking at $1.57 trillion in July 2021. The $1 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) is also expected to act as a catalyst for the growth of the construction industry in the United States.On a global scale, the industry is expected to face significant headwinds from multiple factors such as inflation, supply chain issues, and labor shortages. Multiple projects faced delays due to lockdowns and other safety measures taken during the peak of coronavirus pandemic. Contractors are still dealing with the backlogs in project delivery across multiple projects. A prime example is the Metro Manila Skyway System expansion project which was scheduled for completion in 2019 and still hasn’t been finalized.The global construction market was valued at $10.7 trillion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 3.57% to $15.2 trillion by 2030. The growth is expected to be led by China, United States, and India. Major trends in the industry include the continuous growth of urbanization, and technological advancements including digitalization of the industry.Some of the biggest construction companies across the globe are China Communications Construction Group, China Railway Construction Corporation Limited, Pacific Construction Group, and VINCI, among others. There are several notable names in the construction industry of United States, such as Jacobs Solutions Inc. (J), Bechtel Corporation, Fluor Corporation (NYSE:FLR), D.R. Horton, Inc.

Engineering News-Record (ENR) and Trenchless Technology ranked Jacobs Solutions Inc. as the #1 design and engineering firm in the world.Story continuesA notable event related to the large-scale infrastructure development projects is the destruction of the Crimean Bridge by Ukraine in October 2022. The Crimean Bridge, comprising a 4-lane road and a double-track railway line, spans 18.1 km (11.25 miles) and is the only direct road link between the transport networks of Crimea and Russia. The Bridge was built by Stroygazmontazh, also known as the S.G.M. Group, at a total cost of $3.7 billion.Methodology We picked the longest bridges in the world based on their total length in meters. Our list is ranked in an ascending order of bridge length.15. Yangcun BridgeLength of Bridge: 35,812 metersCompleted in 2007, the Yangcun Bridge is a railway bridge spanning 35,812 meters (22.253 miles), located in China.

The project was one of the earliest high-speed railway lines to be constructed in China and was built by China Railway Group Limited, one of the world’s largest construction and engineering contractors.14. Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Causeway Main LinkLength of Bridge: 36,140 metersSheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Causeway is a mega bridge project that comprises two distinct projects: the Main Link that connects Kuwait City with the future Madinat al-Hareer (Silk City) in Subiyah in one direction, and the Doha Link which connects Kuwait City with Doha and Kuwait Entertainment City.

South Korea’s Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction was the lead contractor on the Main Link project which was opened to the public in May 2019. The complete project, comprising both links, had a construction cost of $3.6 billion.13.

How is this possible when the company’s end markets are so cyclical?Deere sells an “ongoing relationship” to farmers, as every piece of equipment purchased leads to a steady supply of future parts and related services.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Ameriprise Financial with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. View our latest analysis for Ameriprise Financial Ameriprise Financial's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingIf a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Impressively, Ameriprise Financial has grown EPS by 22% per year, compound, in the last three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Not all of Ameriprise Financial's revenue this year is revenue from operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers used in this article might not be the best representation of the underlying business. Ameriprise Financial shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 27% to 30%, and revenue is growing. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-historyWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Ameriprise Financial?Are Ameriprise Financial Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Ameriprise Financial has a market capitalisation of US$35b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$137m. This comes in at 0.4% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Is Ameriprise Financial Worth Keeping An Eye On?If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into Ameriprise Financial's strong EPS growth. This EPS growth rate is something the company should be proud of, and so it's no surprise that insiders are holding on to a considerable chunk of shares. On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research. Even so, be aware that  Ameriprise Financial is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

If you want to see more of billionaire Cliff Asness' top 10 technology stock picks, go directly to Billionaire Cliff Asness' Top 5 Technology Stock Picks.Billionaire Cliff Asness is the founder of quantitative giant AQR Capital Management which as of the end of September had a 13F equity portfolio of over $40 billion.As a quantitative fund, AQR Capital Management uses sophisticated data models and intensive computing to decide what to buy and sell. Given the fund's huge size and Asness' belief in diversification, AQR Capital Management has thousands of positions and regularly rotates in and out of stocks each quarter.Given how big the tech sector in the United States is, AQR Capital Management has substantial positions in many leading tech stocks.In terms of the S&amp;P 500 index, for example, the tech sector accounted for 28% of the index as of April 2022, or more than the combined weighting of the health care and consumer discretionary sectors.In terms of AQR Capital Management's portfolio, tech stocks account for 7 of the fund's top 10 positions.Technology stocks account for a substantial percentage of the S&amp;P 500 and also AQR Capital Management's top positions due to the growth in the industry over the last thirty years.Given tech advancements in semiconductors, computers and smartphones have become more affordable over time. With billions of more potential customers, some software, hardware, and internet companies have grown substantially as a result. With their scale, those companies have created even more useful services that have made more people want to buy computers and smartphones.Given the cycle, some software, hardware, and internet companies have grown to rank among the world's most valuable companies that many investors want to own in their portfolios.2022Due to high inflation, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times in 2022 alone and many analysts expect the U.S. central bank to raise rates further.Story continuesAlthough October's core inflation was lower than expected, San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly said in mid November that she expects interest rates to rise at least one percentage point or potentially more before the Federal Reserve pauses to evaluate the inflation fight.With rising interest rates, Treasury rates have increased substantially and capital has moved from big tech stocks into Treasuries as a result. With the capital flows, many big tech stocks are down substantially year to date. If the economy slows more than expected in the future, there could be even more downside in the near term.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.AQR CAPITAL MANAGEMENTCliff Asness of AQR Capital ManagementMethodologyFor our list of Billionaire Cliff Asness' Top 10 Technology Stock Picks, we selected 10 technology stocks among AQR Capital Management's top equity holdings according to 13F filings as of Q3 2022.We ranked them based on AQR Capital Management's stake value in the stocks at the end of September.Billionaire Cliff Asness' Top 10 Technology Stock Picks10.

While the level of uncertainty over near-term revenue and free-cash-flow trends has risen due to a potential macro slowdown and supply-chain normalization, Texas Instruments has a long history of growing free-cashflow-per-share over full-market cycles to drive shareholder value. We remain investors and believe that Texas Instruments will benefit from the growth in semiconductor content across a broadening set of end-markets and applications. In addition, we believe that the company will be able to sustain its competitive advantages for the long term, underpinned by its manufacturing technology and process, its broad product portfolio, the reach of its go-to-market organization, and the diversity and longevity of its products.Alongside Alphabet Inc.
