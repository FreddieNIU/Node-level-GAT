0,5ef535e9-19e0-3da7-9c0e-6ed9856b0746,SCHW,2023-09-07,3 Crypto Stocks in Focus as Bitcoin Gears Up for a Comeback,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-crypto-stocks-focus-bitcoin-140100503.html,1694008860,STORY,"['HOOD', 'COIN', 'HIVE', 'SCHW']","[The cryptocurrency rally came to a sudden halt in August. The price of Bitcoin (BTC) fell below the $25,000 mark in late August, its lowest level since mid-June, as volatility continues to grip markets ahead of the Federal Reserve’s September policy meeting.Bitcoin staged a solid turnaround from its 2022 lows and was trading above $31,500 in early July. However, the rally stalled in late July, and August saw somewhat of a bloodbath for Bitcoin, with a nearly 10% decline.In fact, the start to September is also rocky, holding below the psychological level of $26,000 over the past 24 hours. So, what’s in store for Bitcoin in September?Traditionally, the price of Bitcoin has been closely correlated with the performance of the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 stock index. This is because both tech stocks and cryptocurrencies are viewed as risky assets, and investors often respond to market conditions in a similar manner when assessing their investment strategies.Right now, there are a lot of positives for having faith in Bitcoin despite its recent lows. Last month, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA came up with robust earnings. This gave not only investors confidence to invest in tech stocks but also cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, a boost.Moreover, the long-date Treasury yields hit multi-year highs in August. The 10-year Treasury yield hit its highest level since 2007 last month. However, it has since fallen to 4.23% as of Sep 5.The Fed has so far increased interest rates by 525 basis points, taking the benchmark rate to the range of 5.25-5.5%. The measure has resulted in inflation declining sharply over the past year. However, inflation remains a lot higher than the Fed’s target of 2%. This has kept the Fed open for more interest rate hikes, which has been putting pressure on the bond yield.However, a series of economic data released over the past week indicates that the labor market is cooling. This has raised hopes of the Fed keeping interest rates unaltered in its September meeting. The CME FedWatch Tool shows that around 95% of the market participants are now confident about the Fed pausing its interest rate hikes in September.Story continuesThis definitely bodes well for high-risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Moreover, the growing interest in cryptocurrencies among financial giants is expected to drive up the prices of Bitcoin and other digital currencies in the near future.For instance, BlackRock, Inc. BLK has urged regulators to create a spot Bitcoin ETF, a move that could boost retail investor involvement.Similarly, The Charles Schwab Corporation SCHW is backing a new exchange called EDX Markets, indicating a growing institutional interest in the crypto space. These developments could have a positive impact on the cryptocurrency market.Bitcoin’s rally may have taken a pause but the future holds promise. Currently, it is advisable for investors to contemplate accumulating cryptocurrencies through a buying-on-the-dip strategy. Each decline in cryptocurrency prices may present an advantageous opportunity for acquisitions, potentially resulting in significant gains as the market's volatility eventually settles.Stocks to WatchRobinhood Markets, Inc.

ShealyThank you, Tom, and welcome everyone to our fiscal fourth quarter conference call. During the quarter, we were able to deliver our seventh consecutive quarter of record sales as revenue growth in the June quarter was within our guided range of up 10% to 20% sequentially.This was driven by a 41% sequential growth in filter products revenue with continuing WiFi 6E ramps across the enterprise market, increased activity in service provider and consumer markets, as well as shipments to our Tier-1 5G mobile RF component customer, for broad sampling of its multiplexer for 5G mobile devices.Additionally, we experienced a rebound in our SAW filter, automotive and timing control business during the June quarter and we expect this business to show further gains moving forward as new products are introduced, which I will describe in greater detail shortly.During the June quarter, we had 2 customers that made up greater than 10% of our revenue. XBAW-related sales accounted for the top 5 customers and 6 out of the top 10 customers. Our top 10 customers made up 63% of our revenue. Our top 25 customers made up 77% of revenue.In terms of regional sales, 3 out of our top 10 customers were Asia-based. Finally, our top 2 customers in Q4 increased their sequential revenue with Akoustis by 18% and 3%, respectively.We are experiencing the same challenging end-market environment that has been noted by many of our customers and industry peers over the past several weeks as high component inventory levels, weak consumer electronics demand, particularly in mobile handsets, and a slower return to office implementation have negatively impacted multiple segments of the consumer electronics industry.This corresponds with a slower-than-expected rebound in the automotive, 5G mobile devices and network infrastructure and WiFi markets with focused weakness in both consumer and service provider markets. As a result, we expect revenue for the September quarter to be down approximately 15%.Despite these macro challenges, we continue to receive new design wins and introduce new products that we expect will facilitate substantial revenue growth over the next 24 months.I would now like to take a moment to discuss the recent developments involving the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. Regarding CHIPS Act funding, the domestic manufacturing program is being implemented by the Department of Commerce or DOC. R&amp;D investments in nanotechnology and the creation of regional high-tech hubs are being driven by the Department of Defense or DoD.Akoustis' current activity includes, proposal activity with both the DOC and DoD-related programs for domestic semiconductor manufacturing, R&amp;D and the commercialization of leading-edge nanotechnologies. As of today, we have submitted one DoD proposal with Akoustis as the lead contractor or hub, focused on electronic warfare or EW for defense applications. The proposed 5-year contract, if awarded, has an initial program budget of over $150 million. We currently expect the DoD to announce their award selections by the end of September.Akoustis is seeking to expand its domestic manufacturing footprint, including both semiconductors and advanced packaging at our New York campus under the DOC CHIPS for America program. We are currently awaiting feedback on our pre-application from the DOC, and we expect to file a final application by the end of the calendar year and expect a program (technical difficulty) in calendar year 2024.We continue to plan our CHIPS application around multiple semiconductor partners which intend to manufacture semiconductor materials, wafers and/or packaging on our New York manufacturing campus.Next, I would like to discuss several compelling updates in our primary target markets, beginning with WiFi. One of our milestones during the June quarter was to deliver 2 additional WiFi design wins, and we received 4 new wins, all of which are expected to ramp over the next 12 months. These design wins include high-frequency WiFi 6E and WiFi 7 XBAW filter solutions as well as 2.4 gigahertz BAW filter solutions.During the June quarter, we began sampling our new 5.6 and 6.6 gigahertz WiFi 6E and WiFi 7 filter solutions to multiple customers. These new parts offer approximately 4x size reduction compared to earlier generation parts and initial feedback has been positive.We have received our first design win for these new filter solutions for our consumer-focused WiFi 6E platform with a multi-user, multiple-in, multiple-out or MU-MIMO architecture. We now have multiple catalogs in customer WiFi 6E and WiFi 7 XBAW filter solutions that are currently selling in the market.While the overall WiFi market has been impacted over the past 12 months by excess inventory driven by component shortages in 2021 and 2022, and slowing WiFi AP demand post-COVID, we do expect improvement in the next 6 months with normalized inventory levels returning in calendar 2024.With our continuing design win traction, as evidenced by the 4 new design wins in the June quarter, we expect strong growth in our WiFi business to continue in calendar 2024 and beyond. This will be driven by our expanding portfolio of catalog WiFi products in the spectrum covering 2.4 gigahertz to 7.1 gigahertz combined with our ability to rapidly deliver customized solutions.Looking ahead, in the September quarter, we expect to receive a design win for next-generation WiFi 7 hardware with a consumer-focused OEM. Further, we also expect to receive a design win for our next-generation WiFi 7 solution with a Tier-1 U.S.-based carrier. And finally, we plan to secure design wins for our Tier-1 enterprise-class customers' WiFi 7 suite of routers and access points.Next, I would like to discuss our recent developments in the 5G mobile market. We continue to ship our initial 5G mobile filter to our Tier-1 customer in the June quarter. The customer has been sampling its multiplexer that uses our filter and has been waiting for its chipset reference design partner to launch its baseband into the China market.During the June quarter, our 5G mobile customer brought a Tier-1 smartphone tablet OEM to our Canandaigua, New York fab to perform its own quality audit of our facility and manufacturing process. We successfully passed the audit, including 2 offshore assembly and test locations, further validating our technology and manufacturing capability. This was our first audit by a Tier-1 handset OEM. So this was a major milestone for our company.We delivered 2 newly developed WiFi 7 filter samples to our Tier-2 mobile customer during the June quarter, and we continue to expect these filters to be qualified and ready for production in the first half of calendar 2024. These 2 new filters are being developed using our foundry process with the customer creating its own designs using our advanced machine learning-driven, AI product development kit, or PDK.Our customers decide it would like to make minor changes to the first design, and we expect to begin redesign later this year. Our anticipated milestones for the September quarter include: we expect to receive an order for a 2.4 gigahertz WiFi filter for our Tier-2 5G mobile RF front-end module-making customer.I will now discuss our progress in our network infrastructure business. During the June quarter, we continued XBAW filter shipments to our CBRS customers targeting the U.S. market. We are seeing the 5G Open Radio Access Network or O-RAN market slow along with the broader RAN market as operators take inventory of existing developments.We do expect the small cell market to improve in calendar 2024 as carriers throughout the U.S., Europe, the Middle East and Africa begin to deploy sub-5 gigahertz networks due to increased data demands. We expect carriers to deploy small cells in greater numbers in 5G networks to expand capacity and improve service.We had several major developments in our network infrastructure business during the June quarter. First, we successfully delivered samples of 7 gigahertz XBAW filters to a Tier-1 European 5G network infrastructure OEM. We were also awarded a development order for a new high-band massive MIMO filter design from the same Tier-1 OEM aimed at the new 7 gigahertz spectrum for 5G base station applications.For the September quarter, we expect to secure a fourth design win in 5G from a new massive MIMO customer. Furthermore, we are currently working to engineer new improved samples of our 5G band 41 and 5G U.S. 3.8 gigahertz network infrastructure filter solutions. We expect to finalize the design and provide samples in the December quarter.And now finally, I would like to provide an update on our defense and other businesses. During the June quarter, we achieved several milestones in our Defense and other market segment. We successfully broadened the sampling of our new automotive CV2X XBAW filter solution to multiple customers, while we have been involved in the automotive market, delivering RFMI, SAW filter and crystal components. The introduction of our new XBAW solution for CV2X should significantly expand our potential TAM for the automotive market.Our new CV2X filter operates between 5.855 gigahertz and 5.925 gigahertz and allows for device-to-device and device-to-network connections for multiple applications aimed at providing safe and effective communication within vehicles. Our new patented filter delivers low-loss performance and enables high-power handling capabilities that establish long-range connectivity for CV2X applications.We also successfully delivered the second of 2 resonators for the timing control market after our customers asked for wider bandwidth performance earlier in the year. We are now working on qualifying this resonator and our customer is finalizing the development of its low jitter oscillator product that is aimed at multiple end markets. During the quarter, we were also able to secure a development order for a new millimeter wave XBAW filter for a Tier-1 defense customer.Our biggest success in the Defense and Other Market segment was the introduction of our new XP3F technology, which incorporates a new revolutionary multilayer nanomaterial that incorporates our patented single crystal piezoelectric material. This new nanomaterial was developed with funding from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, to scale the XBAW technology to frequencies up to 18 gigahertz.The new piezoelectric material stack and the accompanying manufacturing process enables high-Q micro-acoustic wide bandwidth filter solutions that will provide improved coexistence compared to competing high-frequency LTCC, IPD and PCB solutions.We believe the XP3F technology could present Akoustis with significant opportunities in X-band radar, SATCOM, Ku band and upcoming 5G, 6G FR3 spectrum, and we are receiving significant customer interest in both defense and commercial markets.For the September quarter, in the defense and other market segments, we are expecting to secure a design win of at least one of the following: crystal oscillator, BAW filter and/or SAW filter used in automotive wireless battery management systems or wBMS solutions used in a Tier-1 IC reference design, and we also expect to complete the qualification of the second XBAW resonator for a timing control customer.And now, I would like to hand the call over to Ken to go through our financial highlights.Kenneth E. BollerThank you, Jeff. For the fourth quarter ended June 30, 2023, the company reported revenue of $8.3 million, which is an increase of more than 13% over the prior quarter ended March 31, 2023, and represents an increase of 60% year-over-year.On a GAAP basis, operating loss was $17.9 million for the June quarter, driven by revenue of $8.3 million, offset by labor costs of $8.6 million, depreciation and amortization of $3.3 million and other operational costs totaling $14.3 million. As a result, GAAP net loss per share was $0.25.On a non-GAAP basis, operating loss was $15 million and non-GAAP net loss per share was $15.2 million. Reconciliation of these amounts to the corresponding GAAP measures is available in the press release issued this morning available on the Investors Section of our corporate website.CapEx spending for Q4 was $1.2 million, a decline from $2.1 million in the prior quarter as we placed into service the last of our ordered equipment of the company's New York fab expansion.Cash used in operating activities was $8.7 million, which represents the second quarter in a row of double-digit improvement as operating cash spending is down another 12% from $9.9 million in the prior quarter. The company exited the June quarter with $43.1 million of cash and cash equivalents versus $52.7 million at the end of the previous quarter.In the September quarter, we expect revenue to be down approximately 15% given the broader market weakness along with associated inventory correction. Despite these challenges, we continue to receive design wins and introduce new products that we expect will help us grow our revenue substantially moving forward.I will now turn the call back over to Jeff for his closing comments.Jeffrey B. ShealyThank you, Ken. Before I wrap up the call, I would like to provide a brief update on pending litigation matters with respect to the lawsuit Qorvo filed against Akoustis in Delaware in 2021, work on the case continues. The company continues to develop its defenses and mitigation strategies and intends to proceed in defending itself vigorously against claims asserted by Qorvo.Turning to the patent infringement case filed by Akoustis against Qorvo in the Eastern District of Texas, Qorvo has filed a motion to dismiss the case as well as a motion to strike Akoustis' infringement contentions. These motions are typical tactics used by defendants at this early stage of litigation.For example, in its motion to strike, Qorvo argues that Akoustis should be required to provide individual claim charts for each of the 1,015 Qorvo products accused of infringement in the case. One key takeaway from these updates is the complexity and evolving nature of Akoustis' disputes with Qorvo.Although, we can provide no assurance as to the outcome of the disputes with Qorvo, Akoustis remains focused on advancing the interest of the company and its shareholders in both cases to obtain the best possible outcome.And now, I would like to finish by stating that notwithstanding a persistent challenging macroenvironment for the broader semiconductor industry, we are positioned to continue to deliver top-line revenue and unit growth over the next 24 months and beyond driven by 5G mobile, WiFi, automotive, defense and other markets.During the June quarter, we sampled new products, including our 5.6 gigahertz to 6.6 gigahertz WiFi 6E and 7 filters as well as our new CV2X filter, and introduced a new resonator for the timing control market. We successfully passed a major milestone with a successful audit at our New York fab facility from one of the largest handset and tablet manufacturers in the world, along with our OSAT provider.In conclusion, we believe the market opportunity for our patented high-frequency XBAW and XP3F filters is substantial. As of August 25, 2023, we have 104 issued patents and 108 patents pending as we continue to build a substantial IP moat around our technology. We continue to work diligently to achieve each of our stated objectives, and we will continue to provide updates on our execution against these objectives going forward.Finally, I would like to once again thank our employees for their hard work, passion, and dedication, which account for multiple design wins across the WiFi, 5G, network infrastructure, automotive, and defense markets. We have also experienced exceptional momentum in the 5G mobile market, driven by our industry-leading XBAW filters that operate above 3 gigahertz and our new and expanding wafer-level packaging capabilities. I also wish to thank our shareholders who continue to support the company.And with that, I would like to open the call for questions from the investment community.Operator, please go ahead with the first question.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question today is from the line of Anthony Stoss with Craig-Hallum.Anthony Joseph StossHey, Jeff, congrats, I guess, on all the activity surrounding and the progress. 3 questions I wanted to hear from you today. On the WiFi 7 side, just can you paint a picture when do you expect kind of volume revenues? Similar question on the smartphone tablet customer that just passed your -- audit of your facilities and I have a follow-up.Jeffrey B. ShealySo as we said, we've seen despite the WiFi slowdown that we're seeing in the carrier and enterprise, we've seen a significant pickup in the WiFi 7 activity, which is a real bright spot. So in terms of the specific customer activity, let me let Dave kind of articulate what's going on there and also kind of what level we got and what he sees in the mobile space.David M. AicheleOn the WiFi 7, where I see the activity of that picking up is Q2 of next year. We've got engagements, both in the carrier sector and also in the enterprise sector, active designs that are starting their development runs, and then they'll start working through qualifications later this year. So I expect WiFi 7, both of those sectors to pick -- start in Q2 of next year. There's other activities as well with other customers that may trail quarter after that and these are 2 of our top-tier customers that we deal with right now.On the smartphone tablet, as we highlighted a successful major milestone of passing the audit. And we've had multiple Tier-1 audits from other market segments. This is the first one we had in the smartphone side. So a huge accomplishment on the Akoustis side and also with OSAT provider. So that one, it's an engagement that we're going to track and watch. We'll be able to give better guidance in later quarters as we see, obviously traction with this customer.Jeffrey B. ShealyAnd Tony, let me add to that. On the mobile front, that's an area where that's -- in the other segments, we actually engage directly with the OEM. This one is one where we engage with a third party. So as we previously stated that our part goes into a more complex module, which then has to be -- is sold into a reference design, which we previously stated that, that's targeting the China market. That China market has limited visibility and also some pretty significant headwinds in it as outlined by others in the space.Anthony Joseph StossAnd then lastly, probably a bigger question. Gross margins remained negative even while revenues have grown. Can you give us a sense of where you expect gross margins to pass over to being positive? What kind of metrics you need to get them above 30%? And maybe if you can update us on when you now expect kind of the cash flow breakeven on a quarterly basis?Jeffrey B. ShealyGood opportunity to bring Ken in. So Ken, why don't you start it?Kenneth E. BollerFor gross margins, we are undertaking a number of initiatives to improve our margins to switch over, as you said, to positive. Those are predominantly increasing utilization of our New York fab being one of them as well as decreasing a lot of our back-end costs. Our initial products were larger sizes, mostly 3.5 by 3.5. Our laminate sizes are coming down in size, which dramatically reduces the cost, as well as some cost savings with our providers, the OSATs.And our new products are also much smaller size and much lesser back-end costs associated with those products as they come online. So we expect, as we improve our laminate reductions and other measures in bringing on new projects that those margins will come down and you'll start to see them become positive in the next few quarters.And then, as you mentioned, operating cash flow breakeven. We expect that to occur in the October 2024 quarter and still with the same guidance as before when we get to about $15 million to $18 million of revenue per quarter. But also of note, I will say that we've seen operating cash flow decline 12% each quarter for the last 2 quarters. And we have undertaken a number of prudent, but necessary cost-saving initiatives recently, which includes expense controls and aligning our resources to our current customer -- to our current business model. So I expect that operating cash flow to continue to decline, and we're taking measures to make sure that happens and then margins will improve as we see new products come online.Jeffrey B. ShealyAnd Tony, this is Jeff. Just to add to that, I think Ken has previously stated and just to kind of complete the picture. As we transition those gross margins with these cost savings plans, we expect at the time of cash flow breakeven, the gross margins will be in the roughly the 30% range is what we're projecting in how we're modeling it.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley Securities.Craig Andrew EllisAnd Jeff and Ken, congratulations on all the customer progress in the most recent quarter. I wanted to follow up on the color for September revenues down 15% quarter-on-quarter. Can you talk a little bit about the gives and takes by the different product groups for the September quarter?And then, Jeff, can you talk about your confidence that the September quarter would be the bottom in quarterly revenues or the potential for there to be a further decrease out in the fiscal second quarter time frame ending in December?Jeffrey B. ShealySo let me just outline and just provide some contrast over what we're seeing relative to Q4. So we expect the September quarter or Q1 to experience the following. We're seeing some slowdown in mobile and WiFi, as I mentioned, particularly the carrier and enterprise-class offset by the WiFi 7 activity pickup. So we see that softness in the WiFi for a period of 1 to 2 quarters.We are seeing and experiencing a seasonal slowdown in some of the foundry services. We have, as some of -- as part of our foundry services, we also connect in some of the R&amp;D government contracts that we have. We're right in the middle of transitioning from a first or a Phase I program to a Phase II program. So we're certainly seeing that hit in the September quarter as we make that transition.I will point to that DARPA program that I'm referring to. We were extremely successful. And I think out of the 7 participants, we hit every milestone the customer put in front of us related to that P3F technology we were developing. So we're very bullish on that approach going forward.And then finally, also in the Q1 September quarter, we see some lead time in supply chain constraints, particularly in the -- in one of our particular Asia OSAT. So those are -- that's really the kind of the puts and takes. But that's really the macroenvironment that we're navigating now.In terms of confidence, to your second question, in terms of the confidence that September will be a bottom, what we're projecting is 1 to 2 quarters. We're seeing -- I think we mentioned in the script, particularly in WiFi, there has been some inventory buildup in the channel, which needs to clear, and we're projecting 1 to 2 quarters.So I think internally if you look how we model it is, I would say, we're going to see some softness certainly in the December quarter. That's probably comparable to what we're seeing in the September quarter. But then March quarter began picking back up with the programs that we're currently delivering our products to. There's several in the WiFi space. And we see those picking up and see some nice design wins already coming together for those quarters. So I think I've addressed your question. Any follow-up, please go ahead.Craig Andrew EllisThe follow-up question may be for Dave, and it's digging into mobile and the potential for some of the successful activity with different customers to move into a production ramp. And I'll just use the China market as an example. So if we look out at key China selling seasons where the leading players would be developing new product, we've got Golden Week early in October; Singles' Day, November; Lunar New Year in the January-February time frame. And then May Day further out in mid-2Q. As you're engaging with your module partners and other players, when does it look like it would be reasonable for investors to expect more of a volume production ramp if we take those selling seasons as a proxy?David M. AicheleThanks for the question, Craig. I think the -- and Jeff touched on this, our component customer that we've engaged with this, we've made some shipments last quarter and it's into a multiplex that's going into the China market on a reference design. So we've seen limited activity. Right now, I think everybody is aware, obviously, of the depressive state that the China mobile market is in. So we do not have a direct finger on the pulse to the OEMs there. It's something that we have to go through our customer, obviously, to get those visibilities. And so, we're getting updates quarterly on the take rates and the traction. So we'll watch that closely. It's hard to really give any strong guidance until we start seeing some positive trends in that mobile market in China.The other part is, the other engagements we have with the RF front-end module guys, is mainly focused. I think we've guided in the past focusing on later-year models. And that is one that we've been validating the technology. We've shipped, as we've said in previous quarterly calls that we've shipped solutions that have been validated by them, and it's really navigating a strategy of implementing our technology into those modules. So that's still underway. So the guidance right now has been the out-years on when we would see that take rates. Obviously, as we have better visibility to the platforms to be integrated, we can provide more concrete updates.Jeffrey B. ShealyAnd Craig, let me just add to that from the mobile segment, I just want to emphasize -- reemphasize the quality audit we passed. We actually -- we did continue making shipments to that customer during the June quarter. And also would add, our WLP was part of the supply chain, that's the packaging -- critical packaging for that. That was part of the audit that we passed. And so we're prepared to ship the pieces from our end. There's been no delay on our end, and that supply chain is working really well. So I just want to emphasize how we're positioned, at least to service that market as we've already demonstrated with shipments for the last 2 quarters.Craig Andrew EllisSo certainly, it seems like you're executing well on the things that you can control, and it's been very well publicized that the Android market is unusually weak, especially in China. If I could sneak a last one in. Jeff, nice update on your specific plans with both the CHIPS Act and DoD, and you mentioned some milestones. Are there any intermediate update points that investors could look to as it relates to potential funding for either source?Jeffrey B. ShealySo if you look historically, when -- from the time that we've been notified of an award decision, that's -- we have to negotiate a contract and the company's position is until we're under contract, we don't make any public announcements because those have to be negotiated and some of the terms of those have to be worked through. So I think the -- we certainly will have an update. We'll provide another update. Just being the year-end for us, it's kind of a short cycle until we're back on with investors after the September quarter. So certainly, we think in the early October when we report again that -- excuse me, in the early November time frame when we report again, we'll have an update. And I would not anticipate we'd be under contract before then.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Suji Desilva with ROTH MKM.Suji DesilvaCongrats on the progress here. So can you give us a sense of the WiFi 7 ramp that's coming? Maybe how to size that opportunity to think about it relative to prior WiFi ramps, perhaps attach rate, penetration metrics, or content per access point device or whatever way to think about it, that would be helpful.Jeffrey B. ShealyThanks for your comment, Suji. So we did mention we delivered 2 newly developed WiFi filter samples to a Tier-1 mobile customer during the quarter. But in terms of the some of the market dynamics, I'll let Dave comment on those for WiFi 7.David M. AicheleSo I think a couple of comments there. As Ken mentioned earlier that we're releasing a new family of WiFi 6E, WiFi 7 products that are better than previous generation in response, but also in smaller form factor. So we're making it more attractive, both from a size and also a performance standpoint, particularly for these higher MIMO count architectures.So the dollar content per system is actually increasing in the WiFi 7, both with the enterprise sector that we're seeing and also with the carrier side. And I expect the demand to be as same or if not, higher in system unit sales. So overall, the revenue should be increased for Akoustis in these WiFi 7 platforms.Some examples is that the filter count can go up 50%, almost 100% based on the architectures that we're seeing right now and how they're developing. So they are fairly complex to previous ones. I think you guys are all aware of the WiFi 7 advantages, particularly this high-band selectivity or what they call MLO, multi-link operation is requiring higher performance filters to be able to enable that in the WiFi 7.So this definitely plays in our favor, and we're keeping a lead as best as we can from a performance technology-wise based on the XBAW technology. So we're very bullish about the WiFi 7 market and all the activity is moving in the right direction as far as what we're seeing from customer deployments.Suji DesilvaAnd then my other question is on the auto market. You mentioned it in the prepared remarks. I'm just trying to get a sense of the number of customers you may be engaged with kind of in order of magnitude. Is it handful, is it more than that?And what is the -- are they semis companies, systems companies, module companies Tier-1s, or auto OEMs directly? And what's the timing of revenue ramp opportunity there just to level set expectations for auto?David M. AicheleSuji, I will take the question. Yes, I've been actually out on the road visiting with some of the automotive customers and pretty excited about the opportunity that is presenting to us. It will take several years before you see these platforms rolled out. But we're actually -- so example is the wireless battery management system.We've got 3 components on our reference design with a Tier-1 IC manufacturer. And so we've got good activity going on in Asia. And that is starting to move into Europe and we expect some of that pickup in North America. So we're pretty excited about the opportunities there. And I think we said that we'd be announcing some design wins.And then in the CV2X, we've got better than 5 customers that we've been sampling to and CV2X is starting to pick up activity-wise, including in Asia, the ETC, so toll collection. So those are things that we're looking at closely.And then we've been working with recently some North America OEMs on the automotive side that have more traditional ways of going about building their systems, not using subcontractors, doing it more in-house and we see a lot of activity from discrete components, both from the RFMi on oscillators and SAW filters to our BAW technology for TCUs and other spectrum that we're going after. So there's a lot of activity, and we've got greater than 5 customers that we're selling to into production and obviously, in Tier-1s to smaller companies. But these new opportunities won't really be panning out for another couple of years.OperatorAt this time, I'll hand the call back to Jeff Shealy for closing remarks.Jeffrey B. ShealyI want to take the opportunity to thank everyone for your time today. We look forward to speaking with you on our next update call to discuss the current quarter execution against our milestones and future expectations. And with that, I want to wish everybody a very pleasant day. Thank you for your time.OperatorThis will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.]"

(NYSE: TMO), the world leader in serving science, and the National Minority Quality Forum (NMQF), an independent not-for-profit research and education organization, today announced a collaboration to help bring clinical research to historically underserved patient populations through NMQF’s Alliance for Representative Clinical Trials (ARC). The collaboration supports biopharmaceutical and biotech customers in meeting regulatory expectations to enroll and retain patients in clinical trials who more fully reflect real-world populations experiencing the disease or health condition being studied, including U.S. Food and Drug Administration requirements around diversity action plans.The work reflects Thermo Fisher and NMQF’s shared commitment to health equity and building sustainable solutions to engage groups and communities in the United States that have suffered past structural and systemic inequity and/or have been denied access to clinical research for promising new medicines. These include African Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanics/Latinos and Native Americans, as well as other ethnicities, veterans, people with disabilities, LGBTQ+ individuals, religious groups, and those with challenged socioeconomic backgrounds and geographic groups with disparate access to health care.Participation in clinical trials provides patients with early access to cutting-edge medicines under close medical supervision, while offering treatment options to patients facing a variety of disease diagnoses. ARC is a multi-sponsor public/private program focused on increasing clinical research participation within communities of color and other populations that have been historically underrepresented in clinical trials. Since NMQF’s recently renamed Center for Clinical and Social Research launched ARC in 2022, the program has established clinical research sites in 11 states, including California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Virginia.Story continuesThe ARC program includes the PI Institute, which trains community clinicians to become clinical trial principal investigators. MyClinical, a for-profit affiliate of the ARC program, is an investigative research network of PI Institute graduates designed to empower independent community clinicians and federal qualified health clinics to facilitate industry-sponsored clinical trials.Thermo Fisher’s clinical research business and NMQF will help build the capacity of community health clinics to participate in clinical trials. The collaboration will integrate ARC clinics into the clinical research process through comprehensive training and ongoing participation as investigator sites in clinical trials. Participating clinics include federally qualified health centers and private community-based/non-academic health care practices.""To better serve our biopharma customers and drive greater health equity and access to potentially life-changing therapies, we are working to build clinical trials that reflect the diverse populations in society,"" said Michel Lagarde, executive vice president and chief operating officer at Thermo Fisher Scientific. ""Helping to train clinicians with NMQF addresses the need to expand and sustain a pipeline of experienced clinical research providers, and underscores Thermo Fisher’s mission to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer.""Thermo Fisher’s clinical research business provides customized support, training and mentorship through its SiteCoach program to community clinicians in the PI Institute and the MyClinical investigative site network. This support helps expand access to trials and accelerate the development of novel medicines by providing advanced training to staff members at community clinics and practices who are new to clinical research.The SiteCoach program includes practical, self-paced modules to help investigator sites better understand, recognize and address the barriers that often prevent populations from accessing clinical trials. Building this level of in-depth capacity – with experienced site clinical resources and establishing connectivity with industry clinical trial sponsors – is a critical success factor for investigator sites.The MyClinical network utilizes community clinicians, who have developed trust in, and have personal knowledge of, the neighborhood residents they serve. These clinicians can support trial recruitment and planning by ensuring enrollment criteria and trial logistics do not create additional barriers. This can help simplify the research site-selection process for trial sponsors seeking to ensure their studies represent historically underserved patients who disproportionately experience disease.""Diversifying clinical trials demands an enduring commitment and shared responsibility among the various stakeholders within the health care ecosystem,"" said Salvatore Alesci, M.D. Ph.D., senior vice president of NMQF’s Center for Clinical and Social Research. ""ARC sets the stage. ARC isn't just a platform. It's a catalyst set to disrupt the traditional approach to clinical research that does not reflect the increased diversity and complexity of the U.S. and global population. Ultimately, ARC's aim is to bring clinical trials to communities that are historically underserved yet stand to gain enormously. Together with Thermo Fisher, we are prepared to help democratize clinical research and deliver equitable health care for all.""About Thermo Fisher ScientificThermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

If you want to skip our discussion on the healthcare market, head directly to 5 Best Healthcare ETFs To Buy. In December 2022, BlackRock highlighted concerns about the performance for the healthcare sector in 2023. The previous year was rather challenging for equity and fixed income markets. However, the healthcare sector has historically shown resilience during such times. For 2023, BlackRock expected a volatile market, given the inflationary pressure and other geopolitical uncertainty. As per expectations, the sector has exhibited uncertainty in 2023. Over the past two years, the industry has reached record highs in performance. This can be directly attributed to the industry’s effective response to COVID-19. In 2021, the healthcare sector contributed around 19% of the GDP for the United States, while the medical expense for a person amounted to roughly $13,000. BlackRock reported that revenues from COVID-19 are going to normalize over the next few years, as the world moves on from the pandemic. However, the industry presents a valuable opportunity for innovation in creating mRNA-based technologies to treat cancer, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s. While the pandemic forced drastic changes for the medical sector worldwide, it highlighted the efficacy of telehealth, remote monitoring, and cloud-management services within the industry. Don't Miss: 10 Best Semiconductor ETFsLBMC, a professional services CPA firm, valued the telehealth market at $48.3 billion in 2022, and it is forecasted to reach $57.1 billion in 2023. Similarly, in 2021, the worldwide big data healthcare market was worth $32.9 billion, and it is anticipated to be valued at $105.73 billion by 2030, showing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.85%. With the recent hype about artificial intelligence, companies are expected to innovate and integrate it into their cloud-based data management portals. The industry faces significant challenges despite the recent performance boost since Covid-19. Perhaps the biggest concern in the US market is the shortage of medical professionals. In addition, the rising levels of inflation would increase healthcare premiums. Currently, the consumer price index is at 3%. In comparison, this was 9.1% in June 2022. Although the Federal Reserve has managed to reduce inflation, the officially targeted rate is 2%. To add to this, many experts expect unemployment levels to rise over the next year. Collectively, unemployment and inflation are expected to increase the likelihood of a recession over the next 12 months. Story continuesAlso Read: 20 Biggest ETFs by VolumeWhile the healthcare sector continues to normalize in the post-pandemic world, the sector remains set to innovate – be it treatments, workforce management solutions, medical devices, or better healthcare plans.

The increasing complexity of scientific breakthroughs, regulatory processes, and a rising number of investment prospects calls for specialized expertise to navigate this thrilling phase in human progress. This makes Tema Oncology ETF (NASDAQ:CANC) one of the best healthcare ETFs to buy.

(NASDAQ:REGN) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“There have been some bright spots in our long book. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN), a major position and a stock we wrote up in our June 2021 letter, has been one of the best performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 this year. Alas it has not been enough to offset some of our weaker stocks, let alone our overweight exposure to the UK (and Europe) which have suffered from both stock and currency weakness. We do not think we are bad at picking stocks on the long side and hope – reasonably we think – for better relative results in the future. Prior to COVID, our longs were markedly better than the index. Unfortunately, if you look at our long book this quarter and since the onset of the COVID pandemic, there is scant evidence that we have added any value by picking stocks to go long.”11. iShares Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ:IBB)5 Year Performance as of September 4: 10.42%iShares Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ:IBB) aims to mimic the performance of the ICE Biotechnology Index, which consists of biotechnology sector equities listed in the United States.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) - this number remained unchanged from the last quarter. Here is what Smead Capital Management has to say about Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Two things are very noticeable right off the top. First, sometimes you have to be happy losing less in a bear market environment so that you have more of your capital to grow in the next bull market. We are never really happy losing money. Second, 2022 is likely to be our third year of existence as a fund to lose money for the year. This year would join 2008 and 2018 in this undistinguished category. Our biggest detractors were dominated by  Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN). Consumer/investor fears about media and e-commerce hit WBD and EBAY and profit taking in Amgen came from early 2022 strength.”10.

Danaher has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 this year due to a slowdown in the bioprocessing industry and more cautious spending by biopharma customers. Bioprocessing is a key end-market that drives more than a quarter of Danaher’s profits. Bioprocessing products are the main inputs that biopharma companies use to manufacture biologic drugs, which are the fastest growing category of drugs, growing low-to-mid-teens and representing a sizeable portion of the clinical pipeline.The bioprocessing industry experienced significant growth in 2021 and 2022, driven by Covid vaccines and a strong biotech funding environment. Several participants, including Danaher, lowered their 2023 growth outlook in large part due to customer inventory de-stocking and biotech funding weakness. We anticipate that this slowdown is temporary, and the bioprocessing industry will return to normalized growth of high-single digit to mid-teens in 2024 and beyond.…” (Click here to read the full text)9.

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.Top 5 Upgrades: TD Cowen upgraded Constellation Brands (STZ) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $300, up from $240. While the company had to take on debt to buyout the Sands family, that move has ""meaningfully de-risked the capital allocation story,"" the firm argues.Morgan Stanley upgraded First Solar (FSLR) to Equal Weight from Underweight with a price target of $206, up from $180. The firm continues to see long-term risk to First Solar's margin profile, but acknowledges that the company's ""substantial"" 77.8 GW backlog de-risks its earnings profile through 2026.Argus upgraded Chewy (CHWY) to Buy from Hold with a $30 price target. The stock has underperformed over the past quarter, falling 29% vs. a gain of 3% for the Russell 2000 index, but the company's recent Q2 results topped consensus estimates and its internal metrics suggest better results in the coming quarters, the firm notes.Needham upgraded ResMed (RMD) to Buy from Hold with an $180 price target, noting that shares are down 31% since the start of August. Concerns about the potential for GLP-1 obesity drugs to reduce demand for ResMed's sleep therapy devices and added pressure coming from Philips' (PHG) possible re-entry into the flow generator market are now priced in given the pullback, the firm says.KeyBanc upgraded Celanese (CE) to Overweight from Sector Weight with a $149 price target. The firm expects Celanese's earnings per share to reach a ""trough level"" of $8.46 in 2023, with ""meaningful recovery"" to the normalized earnings per share potential of $16-$19 ahead within the next few years.Cash App on a smartphone. (Photo Illustration by Nikolas Kokovlis/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)Top 5 Downgrades:UBS downgraded Block (SQ) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $65, down from $102. The company's gross profit growth will likely slow given softening of consumer discretionary spending, a slowdown in Cash App monthly active user growth and moderation of Cash App monetization in the second half of 2023 and 2024, the firm says.Goldman Sachs downgraded Olin (OLN) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $57, down from $67. The firm has concerns around the company's pricing and margin strategy following industry comments about more aggressive pricing to gain volume coupled with weaker macro conditions in chloralkali.Citi downgraded Kinetik Holdings (KNTK) to Neutral from Buy with an unchanged price target of $34. The stock's risk/reward trade-off is now more balanced following the outperformance versus the broader midstream sector since May earnings, the firm says.Morgan Stanley downgraded Stem (STEM) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $8, down from $12. Stem remains Morgan Stanley's preferred energy storage name given its software-heavy focus, but based on the company's year-to-date earnings, the firm sees risk to its ability to achieve its 65%-85% service and software revenue growth and EBITDA-positive target in the second half of 2023.Citi downgraded Plains All American (PAA) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $15.50, up from $14. The stock still offers a ""compelling"" free cash flow yield, but a lack of obvious catalysts could limit further upside from here, the firm says. Citi also downgraded Plains GP Holdings (PAGP) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $15.50, up from $14.Story continuesA lab at the Thermo Fisher plant producing COVID-19 vaccines for AstraZeneca in Seneffe, Belgium.

Eventually, most or all of the $840B global advertising market will be digital, up from roughly 69% today, creating a ""substantial"" opportunity for Trade Desk, the firm argues.Morgan Stanley initiated coverage of Penumbra (PEN) with an Equal Weight rating and $265 price target. The firm thinks near-term Street estimates ""look sensible"" and cites valuation for its Equal Weight rating.Citi resumed coverage of Thermo Fisher (TMO) with a Buy rating and $625 price target following a period of restriction. The firm believes Thermo has one of the highest quality management teams in the space, with the ability to navigate the current uncertainty.Baird initiated coverage of Lucid Group (LCID) with a Neutral rating and $7 price target. The firm argues that high starting prices and a niche market segment create a challenging near-term setup for the shares.Raymond James initiated coverage of FICO (FICO) with an Outperform rating and $1,007 price target. Although the shares have performed well over the past year, further upside remains as investors fully appreciate the pricing power, resilience, and competitive position of the company's FICO Score business, the firm tells investors in a research note.]"

Pearl and Gutierrez have worked together for several years, including in her recent role serving on the organization's board.""CHC is proud to honor Lisa as one of the recipients of this year's California Housing Hall of Fame Awards,"" said Pearl. ""Lisa was nominated this year because she has become one of the state's go-to experts on affordable housing and impact financing, while also helping modernize our industry by promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in all the work we do. Her deep knowledge of tax credit and lending programs is helping connect affordable housing providers across California with the critical resources they need to build safe, affordable homes for the state's most vulnerable households. Millions of Californians are depending on CHC and our members to produce a lot more affordable housing in every community, and leaders like Lisa are helping ensure affordable housing providers have all the tools to do the job.""According to California Housing Partnership, California is facing a shortfall of 1.2 million homes affordable to the state's lowest-income households.""The work that Impact Finance is doing in California is key,"" said Gutierrez. ""On average, 40% or more of the dollars we lend and invest nationwide annually for affordable housing are deployed right here in California.""Gutierrez' award comes at a time when U.S. Bank has made a material commitment in California and is building continued relationships with the clients from the bank's recent acquisition of Union Bank.""Although this is an individual award, it truly represents our company's commitment to the market, affordable housing, and the support they have afforded me to not only carry on day-to-day duties but be a community leader in this space.""When she's not talking about affordable housing, Gutierrez loves spending time with her family, including their Labradoodle Duke.

We’re consolidating content previously under The Stockout (CPG) and Point of Sale (retail) while keeping The Stockout name. So, those subscribed to Point of Sale are now signed up for The Stockout. The content overlapped too much to do anything else, such as discussions of dynamics between retailers and their suppliers. In addition, Grace Sharkey has joined me on The Stockout show as co-host — that started on Monday’s episode, during which we discussed Instacart’s IPO and can be seen here. Grace brings a perspective from experience in the freight brokerage industry and from producing editorial coverage of the FreightTech industry. Our graphics are even updated — although I’ll miss the old B-roll of boxes falling off the conveyor belt to nowhere. We welcome suggestions for upcoming topics or guests.Upcoming guests for The Stockout show (live Mondays at 2 p.m. EDT):Sept. 11 — Flowspace co-founder and CEO Ben Eachus.Sept. 18 — Steve Lewis, division president of the Americas and Asia-Pacific and head of GXO direct. (See the FreightWaves article here.)Sept. 25 — Bold Carts CEO Bill Rinehart. Bold carts manufactures premium vape cartridges, batteries and hardware for plant-based oil extracts. The discussion will include topics such as innovation in cannabis technology and the company’s supply chain.The three-year relative performance of Dollar General, Target, Walmart, Dollar Tree and Costco and shown in black, purple, blue, green and orange, respectively. (Chart: Barchart.com Inc.)Dollar General continues to struggle with elevated inventoriesWhen I listened to Dollar General’s analyst call last week, I had to double-check the date to make sure I wasn’t listening to a recording from a year earlier. That’s when Walmart and Target were discussing their own inventory issues and their associated corrective actions — Walmart now talks about its inventory being in “good shape.” Also in contrast to Walmart, Dollar General reported sales trends in the quarter that were below expectations, whereas Walmart reported a more resilient consumer than expected in its most recent quarter. Maybe the more rural consumers are the ones struggling the most.Story continuesA few takeaways from Dollar General’s call:Adding tractors to its private fleet saves 20% when compared to for-hire carriers. The company currently utilizes its private fleet of 1,800 tractors for 50% of its transportation capacity needs with plans to increase that portion.Total inventory of $7.5 billion at the end of the quarter was an increase of 11.4% year over year (y/y) on a 5% y/y increase in average store count.The company is pursuing large-scale automation for store fulfillment. That is expected to improve the efficiency of processing a larger number of SKUs while also reducing warehousing costs.Both dry van tender rejections (white) and reefer tender rejections (green) have increased since midsummer with reefer tender rejections having an outsized impact from the hurricane season. (SONAR: VOTRI.USA, ROTRI.USA)Next year freight markets might look much differentFor now, shippers retain pricing power over carriers, which FreightWaves expresses via the quantitative Supply Chain Pricing Power Index (SCPPI), which currently stands at 30/100. (Values below 50 indicate that shippers have the pricing power.)But the SCPPI is today’s weather report. For a look ahead, I recommend reading FreightWaves CEO Craig Fuller’s article published over the weekend that suggests that the freight market in 2024 may look nothing like the past 18 months. Capacity is coming out of the market (you might say the truckload capacity bubble is bursting) while freight demand has increased throughout this year. Shippers’ financial results this year have been mixed — some are seeing sales holding up and have already rightsized inventories while others are struggling with depressed sales and still-elevated inventories (an example is Walmart versus Dollar General). But most shippers have benefited from a cooling in the rate of inflation in their costs and some of the loosest freight market conditions that supply chain professionals have ever seen. In addition, consumer spending has held up better this past quarter than most would have expected after two years of steep inflation and sharply rising interest rates.Shippers’ primary objective now should be positioning themselves for a potential tightening in the freight market, which will come sooner or later. A few ideas for shippers along those lines include:Lock in contract rates. (Even if freight contracts ultimately don’t have teeth, carriers may be inclined to comply with contracts to maintain relationships with preferred shippers.)Benchmark freight costs against industry data, such as contract rates paid by other shippers in the same industry verticals, to prepare for upcoming bids.Use index-linked contracts to manage rate and capacity risk. While freight has historically been a cost category that is difficult or impossible to hedge, FreightWaves is currently working with more than two dozen shippers on freight rate indexing.

At the end of Q3, 2023, Costco had an all-time high membership renewal rate of 92.6% in the U.S. and Canada, TheStreet.com recently reported.I’m a Self-Made Millionaire: Here Are 5 Stocks I’m Never SellingLearn: How To Get Cash Back on Your Everyday PurchasesCostco also seems to be succeeding in areas where competitors like Target, Walmart and Kroger are failing; the wholesale club hasn’t seen increasing theft in its stores, which these retailers have struggled with.SecurityInfoWatch.com recently reported that shrinkage could cost Target $500 million in profits in 2023. Target chairman and CEO Brian Cornell told the website that theft and retail crimes are “increasingly urgent issues.” Meanwhile, shrink costs Walmart roughly $3 billion annually, based on Gitnux statistics.All four organizations have self-checkout systems in place. Only Costco seems to be managing theft better with its members-only policy, checking receipts carefully at the door, and associates available to oversee self-checkout lines. Although Costco members have chastised the club for its self-checkout policies, the level of oversight may be helping prevent theft.With a fanatical member base, low prices, a 5.5% increase in net sales in the first 36 weeks of the year, and a net income of $1.3 billion in the third quarter, Costco is a favorite of not just shoppers, but investors, as well.After peaking in July, Costco experienced a dip in August.

WMT enjoys a favorable position as its shares rose close to 20% in the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 17.6%. The supermarket giant has also outperformed the Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector’s growth of 7.5% in the same time frame. Walmart’s unparalleled efforts to boost omnichannel efforts and upgrade customer experience are a major reason behind its growth story.Over a sustained period, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has achieved consecutive growth in comp sales, thanks to its remarkable performance in both brick-and-mortar stores and digital platforms. We believe that these upsides keep Walmart well-placed for continued gains. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current fiscal year EPS has jumped from $6.22 to $6.42 in the past 30 days.E-commerce - A Significant Driving ForceWalmart's e-commerce operations have been expanding. During the second quarter, e-commerce net sales accounted for 15% of the company's total net sales.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, global e-commerce sales saw an impressive 24% increase, driven by the strength of its omnichannel capabilities, including pickup and delivery services.Within the United States, e-commerce sales jumped 24%, largely propelled by the robust performance of pickup and delivery services as well as advertising efforts. The International segment experienced a 26% increase in e-commerce sales, primarily due to the strength of store-fulfilled orders. At Sam's Club, e-commerce sales witnessed 18% growth, largely attributed to the solid performance of curbside pickup services.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEnhancing Delivery ServicesWalmart has made significant strides in strengthening its delivery capabilities, evident through various strategic moves. These include partnering with Salesforce, expanding its InHome delivery service, investing in DroneUp, launching the Walmart+ membership program, and conducting a pilot program with Cruise to explore grocery delivery using self-driving electric vehicles.Prior to these initiatives, Walmart introduced Express Delivery in April 2021 and formed partnerships with Point Pickup, Skipcart, AxleHire, and Roadie in January 2019. Additionally, the acquisition of Parcel in September 2017 was a key strategic move to enhance its delivery services. Additionally, Walmart offers store and curbside pickup options. As of the second quarter of fiscal 2024, Walmart U.S. had nearly 4,600 pickup locations and more than 4,000 same-day delivery stores.

Its e-commerce business and Neighbor's Club loyalty program are impressive.These led to sturdy year-over-year performance in second-quarter 2023. The company’s earnings of $3.83 per share rose 8.5% year over year. Net sales advanced 7.2% year over year to $4,184.7 million, driven by contributions from the acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home, store openings, and comparable store sales growth.Comps improved 2.5% year over year but lagged our estimate of 5.3% growth. Comparable average transaction count improved 1.8%, while comparable average ticket grew 0.6%. Sturdy demand for core year-round merchandise including consumable, usable and edible products contributed to comps growth.Consequently, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock inched up 1% against the industry’s decline of 3.9%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s dive deeper.Growth StrategiesThe company is on track to build up on Tractor Supply’s Out Here lifestyle assortment and convenient shopping format to gain new customers and market share. The strategy is essentially based on five key pillars, which include customers, digitization, execution, team members and total shareholder return.As part of plans, it revised long-term financial growth targets for 2022-2026. Management still envisions achieving net sales growth of 6-7%, while comps are expected to climb 4-5%. The operating margin is now anticipated to be 10.1-10.6%, up from the earlier mentioned 9-9.5%. Earnings per share are likely to jump 8-11%, up from the previously projected 8-10%.Earlier, it launched Field Activity Support Team, and implemented various technology and service enhancements across the enterprise.TSCO remains focused on its growth initiatives, which include expansion of store base and incorporation of technological advancements to induce traffic and drive the top line. It is well positioned to increase its domestic store to 2,500 in the long term. In the second quarter, it opened 17 Tractor Supply stores and three Petsense stores. Management intends to open 70 Tractor Supply stores and 10-15 Petsense stores in 2023.The company announced an update to its long-term store plan and several new real estate programs to strengthen its balance sheet and real estate portfolio. As part of this, it set a target of 3,000 Tractor Supply stores in the United States, up 200 locations from its prior guidance. Also, it anticipates accelerating its annual new store growth to 80 stores in 2024 and 90 per year in 2025.Another key component of the company’s space productivity initiatives is the transformation of its Side Lot. Project Fusion and Side Lot model transformations have been significant investments toward stores. These store investments target achieving higher market share and boosting productivity across existing and new stores. Notably, TSCO boasts more than 700 Project Fusion stores, accounting for 30% of its store base.Its ONETractor strategy, aimed at connecting store and online shopping, bodes well. The company’s omni-channel investments include curbside pickup, same-day and next-day delivery, a re-launched website and new mobile app. Earlier, it launched Tractor Supply Visa Credit Card, which allows customers to earn points on their everyday purchases, both in-store and anywhere Visa is accepted.Tractor Supply exited the second quarter with 31 million Neighbor's Club members, driven by all-time high retention rates and re-launch of the point-based structure of its Neighbor's Club program. Rebranding of Petsense by Tractor Supply and expansion of its Neighbor's Club program to Petsense stores received positive customer feedback. These moves will enable it to gain new pet customers for both banners. Management earlier predicted to reach more than $2 billion in sales by 2026.Story continuesHeadwinds to OvercomeTractor Supply has been reeling under inflation woes and rising costs.  In second-quarter 2023, SG&amp;A expenses including depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of sales, expanded 77 bps year over year to 22.8%. In dollar terms, SG&amp;A expenses including depreciation and amortization rose 10.9% year over year to $955.4 million and came ahead of our estimate of $867.9 million. Higher SG&amp;A expenses resulted from increased depreciation and amortization, opening of a distribution center and impacts of raised medical claims.As a result, management revised its guidance for 2023, which seems dull. It expects net sales of $14.8-$14.9 billion, down from earlier mentioned $15-$15.3 billion and in-sync with our estimate of $14.8 billion. Meanwhile, comps are likely to grow 1.3-2.5%, down from the prior stated 3.5-5.5% rise. We estimate the metric to inch up 1.6%.Operating margin is anticipated to be 10.2-10.3% compared with 10.1-10.3% mentioned earlier. Earnings per share are estimated to be $10.20-$10.40, down from $10.30-$10.60 expected earlier but in-sync with our forecast of $10.24.Wrapping UpAll said, online strength, solid demand and well chalked-out endeavors are likely to help the stock offset inflation led cost woes. Topping it, a long-term earnings growth rate of 7.8% and a VGM Score of A reflects its inherent strength.Analysts also seem optimistic about the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TSCO 2023 sales and EPS is pegged at $14.9 billion and $10.27, suggesting respective growth of 4.7% and 5.8% from the year-ago reported figures.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies are BJ's Restaurants BJRI, Urban Outfitters URBN and Walmart WMT.BJ's Restaurants, which operates a chain of high-end casual dining restaurants in the United States, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

AJG has made a strategic move by acquiring Lifesure Group Limited, a UK-based personal lines insurance broking services provider. While the terms of the deal remain undisclosed, this acquisition marks an important step for the global insurance brokerage firm. Lifesure's portfolio includes vacation/holiday and leisure insurance products, such as park home, motorhome, caravan and leisure home insurance. In addition, the acquisition encompasses Barnes Commercial, an affiliated company of Lifesure, specializing in insurance for small-to-medium businesses. This expansion aligns with Gallagher's commitment to broadening its service offerings and presence in the UK.Strengthening Retail CapabilitiesThe acquisition of Lifesure Group Limited is expected to significantly bolster Arthur J. Gallagher &amp; Co.'s UK &amp; Ireland Retail division. Lifesure's strong reputation for client relationships and niche expertise in personal lines insurance will enhance Gallagher's position in this market segment. J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr., chairman, president, and CEO of Arthur J. Gallagher &amp; Co., noted, ""Lifesure has an excellent reputation for client relationships and will enhance our UK retail capabilities in the niche personal lines space."" This strategic move demonstrates Gallagher's commitment to serving clients with an even broader spectrum of insurance solutions.The Acquisition PipelineArthur J. Gallagher &amp; Co. has a history of leveraging strategic acquisitions to fuel its growth. This recent acquisition reflects its dedication to identifying and integrating companies that align with its mission and values. AJG’s ability to carefully select and integrate such acquisitions has been a key driver of its success, allowing it to expand its market presence and deliver a wider range of services to clients. AJG has a strong merger and acquisition pipeline with about $350 million of revenues, associated with about 45 term sheets either agreed upon or being prepared.Domestic and International Contributions Historically, Arthur J. Gallagher &amp; Co. has reaped significant benefits from its strategic acquisitions, both domestically and internationally. These acquisitions have played a vital role in bolstering the company's top-line growth and solidifying its position as a global insurance powerhouse. AJG’s international operations contribute about one-third of revenues. The company expects an increase in international contribution to total revenues, given the number and size of non-U.S. acquisitions.A solid capital position supports this insurance broker in its growth initiatives and it thus remains focused on continuing its tuck-in mergers and acquisitions. The company expects an M&amp;A capacity of more than $3 billion through the end of 2023.Story continuesShare Price PerformanceShares of Arthur J. Gallagher have gained 20.3% year to date (YTD), outperforming the industry’s 12.1% increase. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) insurance broker’s efforts to ramp up its growth profile and capital position should continue to drive the share price higher.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnother Acquisition in the Insurance SpaceMarsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc.’s MMC business, Marsh, inked a deal to purchase the entire outstanding share capital of the Australia-based specialist insurance broker Honan Insurance Group Pty Ltd. Management of Marsh believes that the inclusion of Honan’s well-established capabilities, specifically in the field of corporate risk and strata insurance, will enhance its specialist competence. This, in turn, will enable Marsh to better serve its client base across Australia and New Zealand.Acquisitions form one of the core growth strategies of Marsh &amp; McLennan. Buyouts, similar to the latest one, add strength to its capabilities, expand its services offerings and enable the company to enter new geographies as well as solidify its foothold across existing markets. An upgraded services suite is likely to lure more customers and contribute more to the revenues of MMC in the days ahead.

And if that isn’t compelling enough, who can forget how Burry preempted the 2007-2009 mortgage crisis. It was the period when he realized a personal profit of $100 million and amassed $700 million for his investors.Given these credentials, sidelining his financial guidance could prove incredibly costly.

Surpassing its own benchmarks, it produced a record 44.4 thousand barrels of oil daily and an aggregated 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent by the Q2 close.In addition, VTLE’s second-quarter financial results showcase its brilliance. Its revised capital investment guidance of $665 million to $695 million, from an initial $675 million to $725 million, epitomizes its prudent strategy. Furthermore, a free cash flow of a whooping $57 million in the first half is projected to bounce to $150 million as the year closes, bolstered by the smart integration of its acquisition of Forge. The Permian-Earthstone acquisition further illuminates the path for VTLE, with a healthy surge in VTLE’s share price expected.

This is because earnings are a measure of the money a company is making.Still, earnings acceleration works even better when it comes to lifting the stock price. Studies have shown that most successful stocks have seen an acceleration in earnings before an uptick in the stock price.Earnings acceleration is the incremental growth in a company's earnings per share (EPS). In other words, if the rate of a company's quarter-over-quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time, it can be called earnings acceleration.In the case of earnings growth, you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price. But earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven't yet caught the attention of investors and, once secured, will invariably lead to a rally in the share price. This is because earnings acceleration considers both the direction and magnitude of growth rates.An increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period. Meanwhile, a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown, while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down.The above criteria narrowed down the universe of around 7,735 stocks to only three. Here are the stocks:Norwegian Cruise Line is a leading cruise line operator. Norwegian Cruise Line currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

You can skip our analysis of the vegetable oil industry and read Top 8 Vegetable Oil Producing Countries in the World.Oils extracted from soybean, palm, canola, sunflower, olive, and coconut plants serve as a cornerstone in the agricultural economies of the top vegetable oil producing countries in the world. Historically, the twin titans of vegetable oil production have been Indonesia and Malaysia due to their dominance in palm oil cultivation. As of the last assessment, Malaysia and Indonesia own 85% of the world's palm oil output. Likewise, China, the US, and Brazil are the leading soybean oil producers. Currently, Malaysia is the largest exporter of vegetable oils, with the Netherlands and China as its primary importers. According to OEC, Malaysia's vegetable oil exports amounted to $1.63 billion in 2021, and the Netherlands imported vegetable oil valued at $499 million in the same year. Notably, in addition to their obvious culinary uses, vegetable oils are also employed in biodiesel production. According to Precedence Research, the biodiesel market was $36.48 billion in 2022, and 96.4% of its worldwide revenue originated from the vegetable oil feedstock category. We have previously discussed the 15 Most Consumed Edible Oils in the World; read our article to discover which oils are most in demand.Companies Focusing on Innovation in the Vegetable Oil IndustryThe vegetable oil industry was valued at $212.6 billion in 2022 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.8% between 2022 and 2027, reaching $268.9 billion by 2027. As market dynamics shift, with an increasing emphasis on sustainability and healthier alternatives, companies are consistently innovating to optimize vegetable oil yield. For instance, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), a titan in the vegetable oil industry, specializes in edible oil sourcing, processing, and distribution. The company leads in vegetable oil innovation and has invested in a biodiesel-focused soybean crushing plant. The soybean plant aims to produce 600 million pounds of refined soybean oil, a portion of which will be utilized as renewable diesel feedstock.Story continuesBesides biodiesel, ADM-SIO, a subsidiary of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), has introduced sustainable personal care solutions derived from hydrogenated vegetable oils. A prevalent texturization agent in personal care products like soaps, lipsticks, and lotions is stearic acid; this agent traditionally comes from the hydrolysis of animal fat. However, a more sustainable method involves using hydrogenated vegetable oils, such as cottonseed, palm, olive, and sunflower oils. As a result, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) produces texturization agents from these hydrogenated vegetable oils for use in cosmetics and personal care items, offering a more eco-friendly alternative to those derived from animal fats. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) is also among the vegan stocks billionaires are loading up on; the company currently has 12 billionaire investors and has invested $300 million to increase its production capacity to meet the rising demand for alternative proteins. As the company foresees a $125 billion market for alternative proteins by 2030, it plans to capitalize on it.Similarly, Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) is refining its strategies for oilseed processing and oil extraction efficiency. Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG)'s venture into high-oleic oils is notable, addressing the increasing demand for healthier vegetable oil alternatives. High-oleic vegetable oils, which have a greater percentage of monounsaturated oleic acid than standard oils, possess an extended shelf life and are more cost-effective. The stability and skin-friendly attributes of high-oleic oils also make them a preferred choice for formulations in creams, lotions, and other cosmetic products.Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) and Viterra, a Glencore Plc-backed marketer and handler of grains and oilseeds, have recently entered into an agreement to form a combined global agribusiness solutions company. The agreement is based on a cash and stock transaction, and the merger aims to create an innovative agribusiness company to meet the demands of increasingly complex markets.As the union will increase both companies' market foothold, they plan to better manage seasonal cycles and supply chains. According to Bunge's announcement, Viterra shareholders will receive 65.6 million shares of Bunge stock, with an aggregate value of approximately $6.2 billion, along with $2.0 billion in cash. The terms represent a consideration mix of around 75% Bunge stock and 25% cash. Moreover, as part of the deal, Bunge Limited will assume $9.8 billion of Viterra's debt, which is associated with approximately $9.0 billion of highly liquid, readily marketable inventories.We have already done a detailed overview of the 12 Biggest Palm Oil Companies In The World; read this insightful piece to know this sector's central entities. Let’s now move towards the top vegetable oil producing countries. Top 20 Vegetable Oil Producing Countries In The WorldTop 20 Vegetable Oil Producing Countries In The WorldOur MethodologyWe identified the countries with the highest vegetable oil output using the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (UN FAO) database. After shortlisting the top 20 vegetable oil producing countries, we obtained their oil production data for 2020, 2019, and 2018 from the UN FAO. We then averaged these annual production figures to determine these nations' standard vegetable oil yield.Based on our findings, here are the leading nations in the vegetable oil industry:20. The Philippines Average Annual Vegetable Oil Production: 1.35 million tons The Philippines has vast coconut plantations; naturally, it's a leading producer of coconut oil. In 2020, the country's largest share of vegetable oil production came from coconut oil (almost 0.96 million tons), followed by maize oil. The country's tropical climate and archipelagic geography provide an ideal environment for coconut cultivation. Beyond mere production, the Philippines has also invested in refining, marketing, and research to cement its position in coconut oil exports.19. Japan Average Annual Vegetable Oil Production: 1.61 million tons While Japan is not traditionally recognized as an agricultural powerhouse, it has a specialized niche in vegetable oil production. Canola (rapeseed) and soybean oils are predominant in the country and are deeply rooted in Japanese culinary traditions. Notably, the country employs advanced oil extraction and refining technologies to ensure consistent quality.18. Colombia Average Annual Vegetable Oil Production: 1.84 million tons Colombia's tropical climate and fertile plains are favorable for palm cultivation, and as a result, the country's annual palm oil production is close to 1 million tons. Other top vegetable oils in Colombia are palm kernel oil and soybean oil.17. Turkey Average Annual Vegetable Oil Production: 1.937 million tonsTurkey's dominance in the vegetable oil sector comes from its extensive sunflower and olive plantations. The country's diverse climates, ranging from Mediterranean to temperate, allow for the cultivation of various oil crops. The country’s most important vegetable oil is sunflower oil, with a production of over 1 million tons, followed by olive and cottonseed oils. Turkish producers emphasize tradition, especially in olive oil, and combine ancient practices with modern technology to position the country as a quality-driven producer in the global market.16. MexicoAverage Annual Vegetable Oil Production: 1.96 million tons Mexico's vegetable oil industry leans heavily on its rich tradition of cultivating soybeans, coconuts, and safflowers. The country has also benefited from its strategic location and a diversified agricultural landscape that allows producers to experiment with new seed varieties. For instance, Mexican producers began growing canola around 2000 and have had success with its yield. Today, a significant share of Mexico’s total vegetable oil output comes from canola.15. NigeriaAverage Annual Vegetable Oil Production: 2.04 million tons Nigeria is Africa's top palm oil producer, and the country's palm oil yield currently stands at 1.28 million tons. The Niger Delta region, characterized by its tropical climate, is particularly conducive to oil palm cultivation. Although the vegetable oil industry faced challenges in past decades, recent revitalization efforts by the government and stakeholders are steadily restoring Nigeria's position in the palm oil market. Besides palm oil, the country also boasts a significant yield of groundnut and soybean oil.14. France Average Annual Vegetable Oil Production: 2.49 million tons France's vegetable oil industry thrives on its agricultural landscape; notably, the country's agricultural production value is the highest in the EU. Rapeseed oil production in France amounts to 1.7 million tons, thanks to its vast rapeseed fields. French vegetable oil producers are renowned for maintaining high standards of quality and sustainability. Coupled with strong regulatory frameworks, France has consistently ranked among the top European vegetable oil producers.13. Spain Average Annual Vegetable Oil Production: 2.613 million tonsSpain and olive oil are synonymous, as the country ranks first among the countries that produce the best extra virgin olive oil. Also, according to the International Olive Council (IOC), Spain produces 40% of global olive oil. The Iberian Peninsula boasts extensive olive groves and benefits from a Mediterranean climate. Spain's dedication to quality assurance and appellation control guarantees its esteemed position in the global market.12. Thailand Average Annual Vegetable Oil Production: 3.61 million tons Thailand has a strong foothold in the vegetable oil industry because of its vast palm oil and coconut oil production. The country's tropical climate and extensive coastline create an ideal environment for these crops. According to the UN FAO, Thailand’s palm oil production reaches up to 2.6 million tons annually.11. Germany Average Annual Vegetable Oil Production: 4.41 million tons Germany produces close to 3.7 million tons of rapeseed (canola) oil each year, owing to its temperate climate and fertile soils. Moreover, the nation's agricultural infrastructure and emphasis on quality have helped it carve a niche in the global vegetable oil market.10. CanadaAverage Annual Vegetable Oil Production: 4.71 million tons Canada is a global leader in canola oil production, and the country's current canola oil production stands at 4.4 million tons. While Canada also produces soybean, maize, and linseed oil, their yields are significantly lower than that of canola oil. The country’s impressive canola oil yield can be attributed to its cooler climate.9. IndiaAverage Annual Vegetable Oil Production: 6.004 million tonsIndia's agriculture is among the most diverse in the world, a result of its vast expanse. The nation produces significant amounts of cotton, canola, soybean, mustard, and coconut and naturally capitalizes on the oil from these seeds. According to the UN FAO, India’s primary vegetable oils are canola, soybean, and cottonseed oils. Systematic breeding programs have improved the quality of oils produced in the country, emphasizing purity and nutritional content.Click to continue reading Top 8 Vegetable Oil Producing Countries In The World.Suggested Articles:15 Most Consumed Crops in the World15 Worst Countries in the World for Vegetarians20 Countries With Highest Rates Of VegetariansDisclosure: None.

We are extremely encouraged by what we've heard today,"" Ahmed told Reuters.Pakistan Gasport owns the country's largest LNG import and regasification terminal at Port Qasim, but LNG imports have historically been facilitated by Pakistan LNG, a state-run firm that last bought a spot cargo in June 2022 from PetroChina.A cargo would be the first shipped in by a private sector company in Pakistan, said Ahmed, who expects LNG prices to fall in coming years, making spot purchases more attractive.Ahmed said 12% to the Brent slope was the ""price to beat"" for a cargo to Pakistan. That works out to nearly $11 per mmbtu, a discount of a sixth to current average Asian LNG prices of $13.""If the government or anybody else can bring LNG at a price of 12% of Brent or lower, there is a market. The minute you cross that barrier, there is resentment,"" he said.Ahmed said he expects Pakistan's LNG demand to grow to 30 million metric tons in 5 years, from about 10-12 million tons now.Story continuesImporters of all commodities to Pakistan have faced increased financing costs and higher processing times due to the ongoing economic and foreign exchange crisis. LNG traders have said sellers to Pakistan could demand a premium because of the country's low credit rating.Pakistan Gasport plans to avert such challenges by not seeking a letter of credit from banks, financing the deal with internal funds, Ahmed said.""I plan to use a currency other than the dollar to facilitate the payment and also use a semi-barter system to settle,"" he said.

So of course we should be very careful,"" he said.""But... we have more than enough gas in Europe, inventories are building up. The weather is okay. It's now shoulder season, the demand is coming down,"" he added.LNG facilities in Australia faced labour disputes last month, with about 700 workers at four facilities operated by Woodside Energy Group and U.S. major Chevron threatening industrial action over pay and conditions.Strike action at Chevron's two major LNG projects in Australia was delayed for 24 hours because of progress made in mediation talks, a union alliance said on Thursday, raising prospects the parties may be nearing a deal.Australia is the world's biggest LNG exporter, and the ongoing dispute over wages and conditions had stoked volatility in gas prices amid fears the move would fuel competition between Asian and European buyers for cargoes.China and Japan are the top lifters of Australian LNG, followed by South Korea and Taiwan.Kani said people could have been more nervous if this had happened in the winter, if the winter had started with very cold weather and gas inventories were going down, but ""now I think it is more stable"".Woodside Energy managed to reach an in-principle agreement with unions at the offshore platforms of its North West Shelf facility.

And the gap between those two gauges, which had halved from July peaks, is starting to yawn wider yet again.Part of the drag on Europe is the ailing Chinese economy, its ongoing property bust and its contracting industrial sector.Although the steep annual drop in Chinese exports and imports last month was marginally better than forecast, the ongoing funk in activity remains stark and threatens Beijing's overall economic growth target of about 5%.Wednesday's news of another miss in German industrial production in July illustrated the ripple effects in Europe of troubles in the world's second biggest economy - and a resurgent crude oil price as winter hoves into view will unnerve both.The contrast with a re-accelerating U.S. economy is stark.The latest data saw U.S. interest rate futures go back to a 50-50 stance on whether the Fed has one last hike left in the tank. Although slightly off the week's highs on Thursday, U.S. Treasury yields remained pumped up.And hovering just below six-month highs on Thursday, the dollar's index against the world's most traded currencies has now risen for six days in a row - a rise of almost 5.5% since the middle of July.With Bank of England boss Andrew Bailey indicating on Wednesday that UK rate hikes are nearly done, the pound took most of the heat over the past 24 hours and hit three-month lows against the dollar.Story continuesThe dollar also hit six-month highs against the Canadian dollar on Wednesday after the Bank of Canada left its policy rates on hold too.With China's yuan recording its lowest close on domestic markets since 2007, weakness in the offshore unit has remerged too.Annual changes in Brent crude oil prices, meantime, turned positive for the first time since January as spot prices climbed following this week's decision by Saudi Arabia and Russia to extend output cuts.Attention now shifts back to what Fed policymakers make of this U.S. growth pickup, the rebound in energy prices and some mixed signals from the tight labor market.At least six senior Fed officials are in speaking engagements later on Thursday - including Fed board member Michelle Bowman and New York Fed chief John Williams.The Fed's Beige Book of economic conditions released on Wednesday appeared relatively relaxed about both the activity and inflation picture. The weekly jobless update later on Thursday is the most immediate focus on the data front.Shares in China, Japan and across Asia were in the red again on Thursday and U.S. stock futures marked further losses on Wall Street at the open. Europe's bourses steadied after initially dipping for the seventh session in a row.Shares of Apple fell another 2.5% premarket on reports China is seeking to broaden an iPhone ban to state firms and agencies. Apple shed 3.6% on Wednesday on news Beijing had banned officials at just central government agencies from using its handsets.Events to watch for on Thursday: * U.S. weekly jobless claims, Q2 labor cost and productivity revisions * Federal Reserve Board Governor Michelle Bowman, New York Fed President John Williams, Chicago Fed chief Austan Goolsbee, Philadelphia Fed chief Patrick Harker, Atlanta Fed chief Raphael Bostic and Dallas Fed chief Lorie Logan all speak.

We generated almost $50 million of cash.And so this balance of growth and improving profitability is pretty attractive, especially when you consider the really big markets that are going after. So we've improved. We want to continuously improve. And we're excited about the trajectory we're on.TODD MCKINNON: At a conference like this, what are some of the questions you're getting? So there-- they want to know about the big picture, but they also want to know about the proof points to get there.I think one of the biggest difference in the last year or the last two years is that, yeah, of course, investors are always worried about the big secular trends, the companies that could be big, the markets that could be big. But they want more proof points about how you're actually getting there.What progress have you made in the short term and the medium term? Before you can talk about that forest they have to see a few more trees, which I think is a healthy thing for all of us.BRIAN SOZZI: The enterprise business for Okta, what's the health and status of that business?TODD MCKINNON: Well, when you think about the whole macroeconomic situation, one thing we've observed in our business is that smaller companies, if you're a company with just a couple hundred employees or 50 employees, you're being pretty cautious with your spend overall and specifically your technology spend.Larger enterprises, they've kind of locked in their budgets in the first of the year, and they're executing now. And you saw that with our quarter we just reported. Our top 25 deals in the quarter were $100 million of total contract value, which is incredibly healthy. The cohort of a million dollar plus ACV deals was one of the fastest growing in the history of Okta.So I think you're seeing a big strategic priority for identity. And you're seeing some stability in the budgets of larger organization, which is driving the results we delivered.TODD MCKINNON: And that's one of the call outs from your most recent quarter was the ability to win bigger deals, maybe bigger deals than you had been winning in prior quarters. What are these companies want from a company like Okta at this point in their lifespan?TODD MCKINNON: Well, they want a few things. The first thing they want is they want to improve their customer experience. People are talking about cost and efficiency. But at the end of the day, businesses want to grow revenue. They want to cut costs and they want to eliminate risk. And we can help them do all of that. We can help their customer retention.We can make a better experience on their mobile app or their website. We can help them convert users from anonymous to logged in users. We can help them do that more effectively and efficiently. And they can do that by writing their own code.In fact, one of our customers is OpenAI. We're the login for ChatGPT. So the developers at OpenAI didn't build log in, they focused on AI. And I think that was the right decision for them and their success would say the same thing.BRIAN SOZZI: OpenAI is growing like a juggernaut. How is that growth translating to growth for your company?TODD MCKINNON: Well, it's an important growing customer for us. And we're focused on making them successful like all our customers. But I think the most exciting thing am about is two things. One is that I think there's going to be 1,000 new technology companies with great apps and services delivered on AI. And those are all going to need identity.You're going to-- the next Salesforce automation or the next finance management or the next-- all these categories are going to be revolutionized by the AI technology, whether that's in some categories like CRM. Maybe it's CRM that does it. But in a lot of categories, this is going to be new companies, new technology.All that need identity. And then when you take them in a workforce setting, the enterprises that are absorbing all this technology are going to need a great workforce at any solution to secure it and manage it and make sense of it all. And we can help them with all of those.BRIAN SOZZI: Is the hype around AI real? Does it deserve to be as hyped as we're making it out to be?TODD MCKINNON: So here's the thing. I'm a pretty even keeled guy. I don't get too excited about things. There's a lot of hype in our industry. I think this may be underhyped. I think it impacts things at so many levels. It impacts what we drive, what we don't drive, what drives itself. It impacts how we interact with computers and how they seem personal, generates how art and media is created.It's really a breakthrough in computer science. And it impacts not only the products but it impacts how software is created. AI tools can help us make better software, whether it's development copilots or software that can, in some cases write itself or improve itself and that's pretty profound at different levels of the tech stack. So I think the industry really has a powerful macro driver for a long time.BRIAN SOZZI: Do you view Okta as an AI play? Do you even think about it like that? Well, I think it's almost a like a trick question because everything's an AI play. When every company needs a technology strategy and all of technology is being impacted by AI, every company by extension is an AI company. So I think it's a little bit-- you have to say yes to that now. It's at the specifics around how you benefit well. I think we can benefit from multiple ways.One is we can provide picks and shovels to the miners. We can make sure that people building AI technology and trying to make it secure and trying to get it delivered to enterprises and consumers can have a great identity infrastructure to do that. And we can make sure that we can use AI in our own products, whether it's detecting threats or building better recommendation on how to use and set up Okta.We'll be talking a lot more about this at our conference coming up October 3 here in San Francisco Oktane. And so make sure you come see us for that.BRIAN SOZZI: Anything you can tease?TODD MCKINNON: Well, it's-- I mean, it's like not surprisingly, if I say AI is underhyped, we're going to try to hype it more, right? So you can see us there. And then the last thing is that we have to make sure as we run our company, both from the products, but also how our business processes and the technology we use, we have to make sure that this AI, the potential is put to good work inside of our company as well.So yeah, I'm very excited about it. As the industry warrant in a warranted way should be.BRIAN SOZZI: Was talking to a CFO of another tech company at the conference. And they were talking about how it's hard to find talent to support these AI initiatives. Do you find it hard to find the talent you need to implement all these AI initiatives?TODD MCKINNON: Well, I think a lot of-- it's always hard to find great talent. I think anyone that's been in technology or been in a growth company or try to do more with technology knows that talent is really important and it's always a challenge.I think the thing about AI is there are researchers and experts and that's very, very rare skill and very prized possession. But I think a lot of the industry is learning together. They're learning about the potential of these things. They're learning about how they can put into products.And I think with a smart, engaged workforce that's motivated to deliver on what Okta is trying to do, we're in a good position to have-- bring on new people that have this expertise, but also to take all of our entire teams and learn about AI together with the whole industry to take us to the next level.BRIAN SOZZI: Okta co-founder and CEO Tom McKinnon, always great to get some time with you. Let's do this again next year.TODD MCKINNON: Well, I'll be here. See you then. Appreciate it.]"

Inspired by fresh, high-quality ingredients like vine-ripened tomatoes, premium cheeses, and garden-picked basil, the Cucina Fresca line of prepared foods has grown to more than 130 products that are available in more than 1,500 grocery stores, specialty shops and food service channels nationwide.Owned and operated by executive chef Brad Glaberson since 2005, Cucina Fresca strives to create great tasting products while staying true to a philosophy of sustainability-a position that further endears the company and its products to a wide range of consumers. According to Brad, ""If we don't do it at home, we don't do it at work,"" which means company initiatives include everything from composting food waste to choosing more sustainable packaging materials.Fans of Cucina Fresca products and the company itself have come to appreciate this approach, so when the company started expanding its line of retail, handcrafted pastas and sauces, some began to express concerns that the products came in plastic packaging.According to company president Patrick Clingman, ""We were getting emails from some of our customers with concerns that our packaging was plastic. We knew we needed plastic modified atmosphere packaging to keep the products fresh, but we also wanted to address their concerns. We'd been talking to SEE&amp;reg; (formerly Sealed Air) about plant-based rollstock but weren't sure it was right. Once we understood how it took regular plastic out of the equation it was a no-brainer.

SKX appears commendable on the back of its robust business strategies. The company remains focused on boosting the omnichannel capabilities by expanding its direct-to-consumer (DTC) business and enhancing its international foothold. SKX has been making strategic investments to improve its worldwide infrastructure, primarily e-commerce platforms and distribution centers. Continued global demand for its comfort technology footwear is also yielding results.Markedly, shares of this footwear leader have appreciated 33.9% against the industry’s 0.5% drop in the past year. This upside run is buoyed by the aforesaid tailwinds.Let’s Dive DeeperSkechers has been directing resources to enhance its digital capabilities, including augmenting website features, mobile applications and a loyalty program. Investments made to integrate store and digital ecosystems for developing a seamless omnichannel experience are likely to drive greater sales. The company has updated its point-of-sale systems to better engage with customers, both offline and online. Initiatives such as “Buy Online, Pick-Up in Store” and “Buy Online, Pickup at Curbside” are worth mentioning.The company has concluded the acquisition of its long-term Scandinavia distributor. We note that the acquisition of its long-term Scandinavia distributor has helped Skechers to build its brand in the Nordic region with stores and e-commerce platforms, and a network of wholesale customers in Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Norway.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchManagement also remains focused on store expansion. In the second quarter of 2023, management opened 50 company-owned stores while closing 39 stores. Store openings consisted of 28 in China, eight of which were transferred from franchise to company-owned, eight big box stores in the United States, and three each in Chile and Vietnam. Also, it added 56 Skechers outlets in four Nordic countries and two stores in Germany from the acquisition of the company’s Scandinavian distributor. Furthermore, Skechers’ international business remains a significant sales growth driver.Story continuesWhat Else?The aforesaid strengths have aided the company post sturdy results for second-quarter 2023, with the top and bottom lines outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improving year over year. Results gained from strength in brands and demand for comfort technology products, aided by solid marketing and distribution capabilities. Also, continued broad-based strength globally, mainly in the DTC unit, further drove the performance. We note that sturdy demand for comfort technology footwear, enhanced in-store product availability and effective demand creation resulted in 29% growth.For 2023, management believes to accomplish sales between $7.95 billion and $8.1 billion compared with the earlier view of $7.9-$8.1 billion and $7.44 billion recorded last year. It envisions earnings per share (EPS) to be between $3.25 and $3.40 versus the prior expectation of $3.00-$3.20 and $2.38 delivered last year. Management expects the acquisition of the Scandinavia distributor deal to be slightly accretive to earnings in 2023. The company looks forward to achieving its goal of $10 billion in annual sales by 2026.Analysts seem optimistic about the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Skechers’ 2023 sales and EPS is currently pegged at $8.1 billion and $3.38 each, suggesting respective growth of 8.7% and 42% from the corresponding year-ago reported figures.

""If a phone call, visit to your home or email doesn't feel right, don't fall for it. Delete it, shut the door or hang up. Remember, PG&amp;E will never ask for your financial information over the phone or via email, nor will we request payment via pre-paid debit cards or other methods of money transfer, including mobile applications.""A typical sign of a scam targeting a utility customer includes a caller claiming to be from PG&amp;E and threatening disconnection if immediate payment is not made via a pre-paid debit card, digital payment mobile application, or other methods of money transfer. As a reminder, PG&amp;E will never send a single notification to a customer within one hour of a service interruption and will never ask customers to make payments with a pre-paid debit card, gift card, any form of cryptocurrency, or instant mobile payment applications, like Zelle® or Venmo.During the first seven months of 2023, reports of scams targeting PG&amp;E customers increased nearly 200% compared to last year. Reports compiled by PG&amp;E found that:There have been over 29,000 scam attempts reported by customers to PG&amp;E.PG&amp;E customers have been scammed out of nearly $580,000 in 2023 alone.At this point in 2022, PG&amp;E had received just over 10,000 scam reports.Scammers can be convincing and often target those who are most vulnerable, including senior citizens and low-income communities. They also aim their scams at small business owners during busy customer service hours. However, with the right information, customers can learn to detect and report these predatory scams by visiting www.pge.com/scams or by calling 1-833-500-SCAM.Story continuesSigns of a potential scamThreat to disconnect: Scammers may aggressively demand immediate payment for an alleged past due bill.Request for immediate payment: Scammers may instruct the customer to purchase a prepaid card, then call them back supposedly to make a bill payment.Request for prepaid card: When the customer calls back, the caller asks the customer for the prepaid card's number, which grants the scammer instant access to the card's funds.Refund or rebate offers: Scammers may say that your utility company overbilled you and owes you a refund, or that you are entitled to a rebate, and ask you for your personal financial information.Scammers Impersonating Trusted Phone Numbers: Scammers are now able to create authentic-looking 800 numbers which appear on your phone display. The numbers don't lead back to PG&amp;E if called back, however, so if you have doubts, hang up and either log into your account at pge.com to confirm your bill details or call PG&amp;E at 1-833-500-SCAM. If customers ever feel that they are in physical danger, they should call 911.How customers can protect themselvesCustomers should never purchase a prepaid card to avoid service disconnection or shutoff. PG&amp;E does not specify how customers should make a bill payment and offers a variety of ways to pay a bill, including accepting payments online, by phone, automatic bank draft, mail or in person.If a scammer threatens immediate disconnection or shutoff of service without prior notification, customers should hang up the phone, delete the email, or shut the door. Customers with delinquent accounts receive an advance disconnection notification, typically by mail and included with their regular monthly bill.Signing up for an online account at pge.com is another safeguard. Not only can customers log in to check their balance and payment history, they can also sign up for recurring payments, paperless billing and helpful alerts.Customers who suspect that they have been victims of fraud, or who feel threatened during contact with one of these scammers, should contact local law enforcement. The Federal Trade Commission's website is also a good source of information about how to protect personal information.For more information about scams, visit pge.com/scams or https://consumer.ftc.gov/scams.About PG&amp;EPacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), is a combined natural gas and electric utility serving more than 16 million people across 70,000 square miles in Northern and Central California.

55,b0c574fe-6fed-3ecb-8ceb-4f6c8b3e5639,NWS,2023-09-07,Here's What We Like About News' (NASDAQ:NWSA) Upcoming Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-news-nasdaq-nwsa-upcoming-100223430.html,1694080943.0,STORY,['NWSA'],"[It looks like News Corporation (NASDAQ:NWSA) is about to go ex-dividend in the next four days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Accordingly, News investors that purchase the stock on or after the 12th of September will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 11th of October.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.10 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$0.20 per share to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that News has a trailing yield of 0.9% on the current share price of $21.21. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether News's dividend is reliable and sustainable. As a result, readers should always check whether News has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. View our latest analysis for News Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Its dividend payout ratio is 77% of profit, which means the company is paying out a majority of its earnings. The relatively limited profit reinvestment could slow the rate of future earnings growth. We'd be concerned if earnings began to decline. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. The good news is it paid out just 20% of its free cash flow in the last year.It's positive to see that News's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. It's encouraging to see News has grown its earnings rapidly, up 58% a year for the past five years. The company is paying out more than three-quarters of its earnings, but it is also generating strong earnings growth.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. News's dividend payments are broadly unchanged compared to where they were eight years ago.Final TakeawayShould investors buy News for the upcoming dividend? We like News's growing earnings per share and the fact that - while its payout ratio is around average - it paid out a lower percentage of its cash flow. News looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. To help with this, we've discovered 3 warning signs for News that you should be aware of before investing in their shares.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

To help consumers better understand their home's potential value, Realtor.com® today announced the addition of potential short-term rental income estimates from Airbnb in their My Home dashboard. This first-of-its-kind integration empowers homeowners with possible earnings estimates for hosting one room or their whole house.Among those surveyed, 23% of homeowners have rented out their home before or plan to rent part of their home out in the future, and 16% would consider it. Their reasons to rent are largely financial, with one-third (34%) of those renting or planning to rent out their home doing so to save money for a home purchase with a higher mortgage rate, to prepare for potential upswings in a variable mortgage (29%), or to help pay their current mortgage (21%).Whether looking to rent their home out and earn extra money while away on vacation, or renting out an extra room to help with mortgage payments, homeowners can now easily access information about how much they can potentially earn by hosting their space on Airbnb in the Realtor.com® My Home dashboard.Uncovering the short-term rental earning potential of a home can also help homeowners evaluate if it's a good idea to rent out their current home as an alternative to selling it. Looking to the future, 60% of surveyed homeowners would consider renting out their current home rather than selling if/when they look to buy or rent somewhere else.

If you want to skip our introduction to dividends and the general investing climate, then take a look at 5 Most Profitable Dividend Stocks. In a stock market that continues to remain unpredictable, dividends offer a sense of stability. A regular income from shares which is unrelated to trading profits provides stability in a high inflationary environment, and if dividend stocks are utilized well, then the prudent investor can make a lot of money over a long time duration. The best example of this principle is Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, who has built a multi-billion dollar portfolio by simply picking the right stocks and then reinvesting their dividends to buy more shares.Another little known fact about dividend stocks is that they are particularly attractive to hold during a high interest rate environment. In fact, data shows that dividend stocks outperform the S&amp;P500 in terms of total returns in periods of high interest rates. Such periods generally see poor stock market performance since high rates affect the business environment, but dividend stocks pay out higher rates of dividends during periods of tight monetary policy. We took a detailed look at the benefits of dividend stocks in our coverage of 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know so you should check it out to learn more unknown facts about dividend investing.A key differentiator between dividend and non-dividend paying companies is the nature of their business. In accounting, any profit that a firm earns is put under the retained earnings account except for the money paid out to investors as dividends. Firms that seek to gain market share by developing more products or opening more offices tend to use the retained earnings as their wallet. However, companies that have already grown or are operating in stable and mature markets such as the crude oil industry often seek out investors by paying them dividends. Naturally, dividends paid also beef up the value of a firm's shares, and you're likely to see the share price fall if a company announces a dividend cut or suspension since dividend lovers are likely to sell the shares and park their money elsewhere.Story continuesPutting two and two together, the higher the profits that a firm earns the more it can afford to pay out dividends. An added cherry on top is if the company is growing. This growth would boost its dividends as well as its share price. And since we're on the topic of growth, the compounding effect of dividends a.k.a. buying more shares from the dividends has the potential to deliver returns like Warren Buffett's if done over the course of decades. S&amp;P Global's research shows that $1 invested in non-dividend stocks in 1930 would be worth a cool $197 by 2021. However, a dividend paying stock would be worth a whopping $6,430 by the end of the same time period - making Warren Buffett's investment portfolio appear less of an intriguing mystery and more of a tale of patience and stock picking prowess. For those of you who love percentages, the difference between the annualized return (which includes dividends) and the price return (which is share price appreciation) is 70% for stocks of the S&amp;P in a period of ten years. Growth, it seems, is at the heart of dividend investing, and we've also taken a look at 12 Best Dividend Stocks For Steady Growth out of which the top three stock picks are L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LHX), Tractor Supply Company (NASDAQ:TSCO), and Morningstar, Inc.

But by and large, fall conference season is a great way for management teams to fine-tune their current and future messaging while they get real-time feedback from investors.At this year's Communacopia, we've seen many of the biggest themes for investors emerge — AI, the consumer, regulatory risks, and tension in the media business.Friends reunite at the Goldman Sachs tech conference. AT&amp;T CEO John Stankey (left) reunites with Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav (right). Stankey sold WarnerMedia to Zaslav in 2022.(Source: Yahoo Finance) (Kevin Burke, Yahoo Finance)But away from these anticipated headlines, here are the seven things yours truly and my colleague Allie Garfinkle have learned from being on the ground and chatting up some of the names running America's biggest public companies.Palpable fear is in the air about Microsoft (MSFT) strengthening its tentacles within the tech industry, specifically around its investment in OpenAI, which gives the tech giant a strong advantage in the AI race.Growth stories trading on a decent valuation in tech are being drowned out by the investor love affair with Nvidia (NVDA). Example: Nvidia rival AMD (AMD). One contact who attended Lisa Su's presentation at Goldman came away impressed with their positioning in AI. Nvidia stock is up over 200% this year; AMD has gained just under 70%.If a company you're invested in isn't discussing what they are doing in automation over the next two years, it's a red flag. Giant companies are trying to bring as much automation as possible to their businesses to counter pandemic-era rises in worker wages and also ride the AI wave.Not many in tech believe we are headed for disinflation in 2024, counter to the present market narrative.Mass tech layoffs are likely over, for now.The appetite to own legacy media companies such as Disney (DIS) and Paramount (PARA) — which are trading near multi-year lows — isn't, well, high. The ongoing Charter (CHTR) and Disney fight isn't helping.Nvidia's stock may have gotten a poor earnings reception a few weeks ago, but the vibe here is you risk underperforming for clients if you aren't long NVDA in 2024.Story continuesFall conference season started with Communacopia and you can find our full coverage here.I often leave here bursting with new ideas.And this year is no different.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Yahoo Finance Markets Reporter Jared Blikre delves into the stocks' unexpected downturns.Apple (AAPL) shares fell in Wednesday's trading following a report that China is banning government officials from using iPhones for work. Blikre points out that history has shown that when Apple's fall from grace is swift, it often leads to a prolonged decline, signifying a potential rocky road ahead for its shares.Adding to the tech turmoil, NVIDIA (NVDA) struggled to surpass its earnings day high of $499, causing concern among investors. While NVIDIA shares remain close to their record high, Blikre breaks down the chart to show why investors may want to be cautious.Despite these setbacks, Blikre highlights some positive indicators in the tech sector, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) showing promise due to an upcoming double top formation. Similarly, iShares Expanded-Tech Software (IGV) surged by nearly 5 percent over the last month, outperforming competitors like iShares Trust- iShares Semiconductor (SOXX), which fell by about a one percent.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Jared Blikre is here with a closer look at some of those technical moves that we're seeing in the sector. Jared.JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. So we're looking at some of the worst days here, particularly for Apple and NVIDIA in about four weeks. Let's pull up the technicals for Apple. This is over six months. I put candlesticks here, and I'm going to put on the 50-day moving average so you can see how previously when we were descending from these highs, we skipped right below it. That was a huge down day. We were descending pretty rapidly in here.I did a study at the time that saw that when Apple falls from a record high very quickly, it tends to be prolonged-- in other words, that drawdown tends to be prolonged. And indeed we came right above the 50-day and now we are selling off strongly from it once again. That is a clear technical signal that we are to be on alert for further downside potentially.Story continuesNow, I want to take a look at NVIDIA. I'm going to put a 3-month chart. This big red candle up here, that was a record high by the way that occurred on its earnings day. And there was some interesting action with respect to buybacks. They sold about $1 billion worth of stock at $499. It'd never seen that price before, so that was potentially exit liquidity for some insiders. I think the main point here is that NVIDIA has not been able to climb above that high there. So even though we are still close to these record highs, I would be a little bit cautious at this point.Now, I want to go to XLK, that is the SPDR S&amp;P 500 technology select fund. And I'm going to put a 5-year chart on here so we can see what's happening and put some lines there. I've heard some rumblings on Twitter, tech is setting up for a huge double top here, and here's how this would play out. However, you'll notice that we are missing this final down leg here. And in fact, you would have to breach 120 decisively to the downside in order to get that top information.Right now, we could easily skirt to new highs. I do want to see a break above these highs here eventually, especially to confirm strength. But for now, I think tech is in a decent position. I'm going to show you Microsoft. Microsoft also in a very similar chart, but also decent position.And then just finally, on the tech note, software versus SOXX-- that is the chip stock. Software over the year to date, that is actually the-- excuse me, the SOXX is actually outperforming year to date. However, over the last month, you will see that software has come from behind. And so software indeed looking a little bit better than the chip stocks at this stage. Seana.]"

If you want to skip all the details about the jewelry market and the major players in the jewelry industry, then head straight to Top 5 Jewelry exporting countries in the World. Jewelry has deep-rooted historical significance, tracing its presence in human culture back thousands of years, evolving from symbolic and cultural adornments into coveted fashion statements and personal ornaments. With this rich history in mind, it's fascinating to see how the global jewelry market has continued to flourish. The global jewelry market, valued at USD 216.48 billion in 2022, is on a growth trajectory. Projections for 2023 estimate a rise to USD 224.38 billion, with expectations of the market reaching USD 308.36 billion by 2030. This expansion is fueled by a rising trend in luxury consumption, where more people are drawn to luxurious products. Jewelry's appeal lies in its ability to highlight body features, reflect fashion trends, and showcase individual style. It's gaining popularity among high-income earners, enhancing its status as a symbol of affluence, and driving increased consumption rates. This combination of factors positions the global jewelry market for significant growth, solidifying its role in the luxury goods industry.As we step further into the modern era, it's clear that the jewelry market is thriving and holds strong potential for growth. Specifically, the United States luxury fine jewelry industry is on the verge of significant expansion. Projections suggest that by 2023, this market is poised to reach an estimated value of US$ 11.5 billion. Yet, the future looks even more promising, with expectations of US fine jewelry market reaching a remarkable US$17.7 billion by 2033. This journey is anticipated to be powered by a consistent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.4% during the forecast period from 2023 to 2033.Story continuesTechnology, especially post-COVID-19, has transformed the ornament industry. Manufacturers using tech, like the Ringly Luxe Smart Ring with features like activity tracking and GPS for safety, are boosting product consumption. This tech-infused trend is driving demand for these innovative ornaments. Among the subsectors, bridal jewelry is one of the most important. Even industry leaders, like Signet Jewelers Ltd (NYSE:SIG), the largest specialty jewelry retailer in the U.S., acknowledge the significant impact of bridal jewelry on their business. During their latest earnings call, Signet's CEO, Gina Drosos, said:“By design, bridal is a big business for us, and as engagements begin their recovery later this year, we’re positioning ourselves to capture a multiyear tailwind. This is important because bridal is a highly strategic category. It’s frequently the most important emotional and financial point of market entry into the jewelry category. That means that in addition to initial sales, it drives the beginning of lifetime relationships leading to future purchases for special events, anniversaries and holidays throughout our customers’ lives. We see bridal as a $600 million revenue growth opportunity. Prior to the pandemic, we estimate the number of engagements was consistently close to 2.8 million per year. That began dropping last year, and we estimate it will bottom out this calendar year 2023 between 2.1 million and 2.2 million, or nearly 25% fewer engagements than normal.”Signet Jewelers Ltd (NYSE:SIG) is further embracing the evolving landscape of the jewelry industry by expanding its footprint in the jewelry rental business. They've recently unveiled plans for an extended rollout of a fine jewelry rental program geared toward special occasions and weddings. This reflects Signet Jewelers Ltd (NYSE:SIG)’s commitment to staying at the forefront of evolving jewelry trends.In addition to these developments, many companies are also embracing sustainability within the jewelry industry. Companies like Pandora and Charles &amp; Colvard, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTHR) are now leading the way by focusing on lab-grown diamonds. Charles &amp; Colvard, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTHR)'s President and Chief Executive Officer, Don O’Connell, highlighted this sustainability shift during a recent earnings call of Charles &amp; Colvard, Ltd. (NASDAQ:CTHR), stating that:""Lab-grown gemstones and lab-grown diamonds specifically are gaining significant popularity in the marketplace, becoming more mainstream for price-conscious consumers seeking larger carat weights with eco-friendly and conflict-free options."" He further emphasized, ""Since introducing lab-grown diamonds, we have become more vertically integrated as we consistently strive to be a competitively priced industry leader in the overall lab-grown fine jewelry market.""Now that you grasp the jewelry market's dynamics, key players, and recent trends, let's explore answers to questions like which country exports the most jewelry and which country is the best for jewelry.Top 15 Jewelry Exporting Countries in the WorldOur MethodologyTo determine the top 15 jewelry exporting countries globally, we utilized the most recent data on jewelry export values, drawing from sources like the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC), among others.

ADP, Paychex, Inc. PAYX, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. BR and Genpact Ltd. G.Industry: OutsourcingLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2144715/4-stocks-to-benefit-from-a-blooming-outsourcing-industryDriven by economic, technological and business factors, the Zacks Outsourcing industry has grown significantly over time. Key factors include cost savings, access to skilled talent, and the ability to focus on core competencies. According to ReportLinker's report, the outsourcing sector is anticipated to witness a substantial growth of USD 75.89 trillion from 2023 to 2027, with a steady compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.5%.Automatic Data Processing, Inc., Paychex, Inc., Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. and Genpact Ltd. can be considered by investors from the in-focus Outsourcing market.About the IndustryOutsourcing involves delegating a company's internal operations to external resources or third-party contractors to enhance operational efficiency. Within the Zacks Outsourcing sector, you'll find companies that provide human capital, business management and IT solutions, primarily catering to small- and medium-sized enterprises. These services encompass a broad spectrum, including HR support, payroll management, benefits administration, retirement planning and insurance services.Certain firms excel in delivering business process services, with a strong focus on transaction processing, analytics and global automation solutions. This outsourcing approach empowers businesses to concentrate on their core competencies while external experts manage these critical functions.4 Trends Shaping the Future of Outsourcing IndustryContinued growth of Business Process Outsourcing (BPO): Most outsourcing activities occur at lower levels within the organizational hierarchy. Per Grand View Research report, in 2022, the global market for BPO reached a valuation of USD 261.9 billion and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.4% from 2023 to 2030. The demand for these services remains high due to their advantages, including greater flexibility, cost reduction, and improved service quality.Story continuesContinued relevance of IT Outsourcing: The IT Outsourcing market is forecasted to attain a revenue of approximately $460.10 billion in 2023, with an anticipated annual growth rate (CAGR 2023-2028) of 11.07%. This growth is expected to lead to a market size of about $777.70 billion by 2028. In the future, outsourced IT services will still cover a wide range of functions, including programming and technical support. Organizations can outsource entire IT departments to cut costs and focus on core tasks. A significant driver of outsourcing trends will be the shortage of in-house engineering talent.Rising importance of cybersecurity: Heightened public awareness and evolving cyber threats, such as ransomware and national-level cyberattacks, have led to a growing demand for robust data encryption and cybersecurity measures. Companies prioritize employee security awareness training and breach detection systems to prevent cybersecurity incidents. To address these challenges, businesses increasingly turn to outsourced cybersecurity services to mitigate risks, maintain compliance, and support scalability in their operations.Emerging trends of technology: Trends like the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML) are on the verge of reshaping the outsourcing sector. These innovations propel efficiency, foster innovation, and bolster competitiveness, fundamentally altering the delivery of outsourcing services and opening novel avenues for businesses to enhance their operational efficiency. For instance, IoT data can be collected, processed, and analyzed in the cloud, enabling real-time decision-making and predictive maintenance for clients. By integrating AI and ML into customer support outsourcing, companies can provide faster, more efficient and consistent customer support while optimizing operational costs.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Encouraging ProspectsThe Zacks Outsourcing industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Business Services sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #90.

With 81% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Archer-Daniels-Midland, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Archer-Daniels-Midland?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Archer-Daniels-Midland already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Archer-Daniels-Midland, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Archer-Daniels-Midland. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.7% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 8.1% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesWe did some more digging and found that 10 of the top shareholders account for roughly 50% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Archer-Daniels-MidlandWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$255m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 19% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Archer-Daniels-Midland. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

Maybe, maybe not.On Wednesday, the market is experiencing some volatility after a two-week rally, which has some investors feeling like they want to position their portfolios more defensively. Understandably, they are rotating into sectors like Utilities, Consumer Staples and raising cash.However, this year the stock market isn’t average. The Nasdaq 100 has rallied 34% YTD and the S&amp;P 500 16.5%, which is well above the average. With such a strong start to the year, it is possible that stocks will move higher unperturbed by the seasonal trends, and investors should thus continue to focus on owning leading stocks.Alternatively, if stocks do end up trading lower in September, investors can look forward to the most bullish period of the year in the final three months. Because of this setup, I think investors can look past the month-to-month expectations and focus on buying the stocks that will lead over the next several months and longer.Amazon AMZN, Synopsys SNPS, and MercadoLibre MELI are all top Zacks Rank stocks, with powerful business models, and strong growth ahead of them.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAmazonAmazon has been benefiting from strong growth in Prime, AWS, and its newest successful business segment Advertising.

88,c75892cf-c756-30ef-a863-85f997794140,SNPS,2023-09-07,Synopsys (SNPS) Upgraded to Strong Buy: Here's Why,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/synopsys-snps-upgraded-strong-buy-160005389.html,1694016005,STORY,['SNPS'],"[Investors might want to bet on Synopsys (SNPS), as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.A company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years.Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements, the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Synopsys is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.For Synopsys, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for SynopsysFor the fiscal year ending October 2023, this maker of software used to test and develop chips is expected to earn $11.09 per share, which is a change of 24.6% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Synopsys. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 4.7%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Synopsys to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ: HST) (the “Company”), the nation’s largest lodging real estate investment trust, today provided an update regarding the impact of the Maui wildfires and other recent weather events on its hotels and the communities where they operate.As the largest hotel real estate owner on Maui with a presence for over 20 years, Host Hotels &amp; Resorts shares a deep connection to the island’s people and culture. Lahaina has long been revered as a sacred place and home to some of the island’s most precious historical and cultural assets. The August wildfires touched everyone on the island and the Company’s hotels are partnering together to support the safety and wellbeing of the Maui community.The Company’s hotels are providing food and shelter for employees, their families, and emergency response teams while also remaining open to guests. General managers at the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani, along with other Wailea area general managers, are working in partnership with World Central Kitchen to provide meals for Maui shelters. In addition, the Company is working with its hotels and operators to provide available resources to support employees as quickly and meaningfully as possible. This includes providing direct employee relief and making charitable donations to emergency response relief organizations on the ground, including the American Red Cross - Maui, World Central Kitchen, Maui Food Bank and Hawaii Community Foundation Maui Strong Fund—all of which are supporting employees and people across Maui in need.James F. Risoleo, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “We are deeply saddened by what has happened on Maui, and we are prioritizing the care of our hotels’ employees, their family members, and the larger community. Maui has a rich history with significant cultural and archaeological assets, and it has been a wonderful home to Host for two decades. We are committed to supporting the island’s resilient people and communities as recovery and rebuilding efforts progress and – like so many others – we remain inspired by the 150-year-old banyan tree that remains standing in the middle of Lahaina.”Story continuesTo date, there has not been any reported property damage to the Company’s hotels or golf courses on Maui, and all its hotels remained open and operational through the wildfires. The Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa remains open to first responders and expects to begin welcoming guests back in mid-October.The Company estimates that net income and hotel EBITDA from its three Maui hotels was impacted by approximately $5 million in the month of August. The Company is not otherwise updating or reaffirming its full year 2023 guidance provided on August 2, 2023, as it is too early in the quarter to provide a comprehensive update or estimated full-year impact to future periods due to the rapidly evolving nature of demand trends on the island. The Company’s risk management team is engaged with its insurers about potential business interruption coverage, and, as those conversations are ongoing, timing and amounts of any potential business interruption proceeds are not yet known.The Company does not expect a delay in the completion of the comprehensive renovation currently underway at the Fairmont Kea Lani, which remains on track to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2023. This project is the final of 24 recent comprehensive renovations in the Company’s portfolio.Other Recent Weather EventsIn the second half of 2023, the Company expects to begin recognizing business interruption gains related to Hurricane Ian, which impacted the Company’s two non-comparable hotels, The Ritz-Carlton, Naples, and Hyatt Regency Coconut Point Resort and Spa.With respect to Hurricane Hilary in Southern California and Hurricane Idalia on the Gulf Coast of Florida, the Company’s hotels did not experience any material property damage or business disruption.ABOUT HOST HOTELS &amp; RESORTSHost Hotels &amp; Resorts, Inc. is an S&amp;P 500 company and is the largest lodging real estate investment trust and one of the largest owners of luxury and upper-upscale hotels.

Alaska Air (ALK), United (UAL), and Southwest Airlines (LUV) warn of rising jet fuel costs impacting ticket prices. Lastly, Overstock (OSTK) shares dive on its revenues tied to the relaunch of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's website.Yahoo Finance Live examines several stocks making significant moves after Wednesday's closing bell.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: AMC shares are selling off after announcing plans to sell up to 40 million shares. The company saying that it plans to use the proceeds to bolster liquidity, to repay, refinance, redeem or repurchase its existing indebtedness here, and general corporate purposes. Well, AMC was widely expected to do this after the court ruled last month that it was allowed to convert preferred stock into common stock.And, Akiko, AMC, the moves are so dramatic, a lot just talk about what the company needs to do to write this business. Clearly this has been a meme stock, a retail trader favorite now for a number of years. But when you take a look at the actual business of AMC, movie theaters, getting people back into the theaters to watch movies.It's not only dealing with the fact that it has not recovered from some of the pre-pandemic levels, but then also coupling that with the Hollywood strike that's going on right now. And the fact that we're already seeing some studios push out releases to 2024. It's certainly a very tough time for AMC.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, Seana, tough to say how much of AMC's stock actually trades on the fundamentals, but you're right. I mean, at the end of the day, the fundamentals are not good for AMC. They haven't gotten back to pre-pandemic levels in terms of getting people back into the theaters. You've got the Hollywood strike, that means less of a pipeline in terms of movies coming up.And then at the end of the day, AMC just hasn't had a turnaround strategy in place. So much of this is about riding the meme wave. You look at where the company is right now, $9.5 billion in debt and lease obligations. So that's at least according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Story continuesBut this is a company that's really struggled to find its footing in terms of its fundamentals and where they need to go to really change the strategy in the face of what we have seen in terms of attendance in theaters.Well, taking a look at some of the airlines, as United, Southwest, and Alaska Air are sounding the alarm about higher jet fuel costs in the third quarter amid rising crude oil prices. Southwest now expects fuel costs between $2.70 to $2.80 per gallon during the third quarter. That's compared to prior estimates of 2.55 to 2.65. The airline said, overall leisure demand and yields continue to remain healthy.And this comes, Seana, as we've talked about, this peak travel where travelers are willing to shell out those high ticket prices. And this has got to be a headwind for the company. But I will say, when you think about where oil prices were last year because they were very elevated, ticket prices going up. They haven't necessarily come down since.And so you have to wonder what this means for the airlines who are riding this wave of consumers really wanting to go not just domestic travel, but international travel as well. Does this mean they have to raise prices even more or just keep it at where they were when prices were at the peak last year?SEANA SMITH: Yeah, exactly. And then also what customers, what consumers are going to do if they're going to be willing to pay those higher prices, if in fact, airlines do decide to hike prices because we've already talked about the fact that maybe we could potentially start to see a bit of a cooling here. We're coming out of the summer season.Yes, travel demand was very strong. We heard that from most of the airlines in their most recent reports. But heading into the fall season, we know that many of these airlines are not going to be able to charge the prices that we saw during the summer. Now adding in higher fuel prices obviously a headwind here for so many of these companies.United, which has arguably been amongst the best position just given the exposure that they have to international travel and the pent up demand for people to travel internationally over the last several months.But United, also one of those ones saying that they expect fuel costs now to come in 2.95 to 3.05 per gallon, which was much higher than expected. So we'll see what the airlines end up doing with this, if they do in fact hike their ticket fares and then what that demand picture looks like.All right, let's also take a look at Overstock taking a big hit today. The stock off-- wow, look at that. Just about 23% after reporting declining revenue at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Overstock bought the intellectual property assets of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond in June and relaunched the website on August 1st. There was a bit of good news in this update, though. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is adding customers. And now have just around more than 4.8 million.But declining revenue here, at least in terms of sales over the last several weeks since that relaunch on August 1st, they're seeing a decline in just about the mid teens for revenue on a year over year basis. Average order value falling in the high teens, percentage base from a year ago levels. A lot of this, at least from an analysts perspective is because of the higher promotional activity.They're doing everything they can to expand their customer base. And obviously, at least for right now, their sales their revenue taking a bit of a hit.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, I mean, just because Overstock took over those assets, doesn't necessarily mean, there's an immediate bump, right? At the end of the day, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond went the way that it did because it was really struggling with the stores in being able to come up with attractive products and attractive value as well.So Overstock really taking on that problem themselves as well. I mean, you could argue, it hasn't been very long since this all happened, so it's still need a little more time. But it really points to the massive task that they have in trying to turn around these assets because it has been many years in the making.SEANA SMITH: And, yeah, certainly. It looks like it's going to be potentially a long road ahead.]"

ELV is well-poised to grow on the back of premium rate hikes in the Health Benefits business, a growing customer base and overall Carelon business strength. The BioPlus acquisition is expected to support its CarelonRx unit’s performance.Elevance — with a market cap of $104.2 billion — is one of the largest publicly traded health insurers in the United States, in terms of membership. Courtesy of solid prospects, this currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is worth retaining in your portfolio at the moment.Let’s delve deeper.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ELV’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $32.89 per share, indicating 13.1% year-over-year growth. The estimate has witnessed one upward movement in the past month against none in the opposite direction. Elevance beat on earnings in all the last four quarters, with an average surprise of 2.8%. This is depicted in the graph below.Elevance Health, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseElevance Health, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseElevance Health, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Elevance Health, Inc. QuoteThe consensus mark for current-year revenues stands at $168.4 billion, suggesting an 8.2% rise from the prior-year reported number. Higher product revenue, administrative fees and premiums are likely to boost the top line.Our estimate for 2023 premiums indicates more than 5% year-over-year growth. We expect product revenues to jump nearly 14% this year, while administrative fees and other revenues are expected to increase close to 6%.Considering the segments, we expect Health Benefits to witness 5.4% growth on the back of premium rate adjustments and higher membership in its Medicaid business. Overall, Carelon will likely see a nearly 10% increase due to improving performance in CarelonRx and Carelon Services units. A solid medical management business is expected to drive its Carelon numbers.Furthermore, ELV’s focus on expanding the capabilities of Carelon is likely to position the company for long-term growth. The augmentation of post-acute care services will further drive the platform, which significantly complements its Health Benefits business. The BioPlus integration at CarelonRx is ahead of schedule, which will boost its capabilities.Story continuesStrategic buyouts and collaborations play a major role in ELV’s long-term growth prospects. Acquisitions like Integra Managed Care, MMM Holdings, Beacon Health, BioPlus and others have strengthened its operations and enhanced its services. We expect more partnerships and inorganic growth opportunities to present themselves in the coming days.The company’s shareholder value boosting efforts are appreciated by investors. It bought back shares worth $646 million in the second quarter alone and had a leftover buyback capacity of $5.6 billion as of Jun 30, 2023. Also, its dividend yield of 1.3% is higher than the industry average of 0.9%.However, there are a few factors that investors should keep an eye on. For example, rising expenses are reducing its margins. Last year, expenses jumped 13.9% year over year. It witnessed an 11.7% increase in the metric in the first half of this year. We expect increased benefit expenses, operating expenses and cost of products sold to keep overall costs high. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive ELV’s growth in the long term.Key picksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are HCA Healthcare, Inc.

AIG is well-poised to grow due to strong Global Commercial business, improving net investment income and new business growth.AIG continues to benefit from strong performance in its General Insurance business and the strengthening of insurance rates. Moreover, divestitures are helping the company to streamline its business and enhance capital allocation.AIG is a leading global insurance organization providing a wide range of property casualty insurance, life insurance, retirement solutions and other financial services.Zacks Rank &amp; Price PerformanceAmerican International currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). In the past year, the stock has gained 11.9% compared with the industry’s growth of 0.2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRising EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AIG’s 2023 earnings per share is pegged at $6.71, indicating a 47.5% increase from the year-ago reported figure of $4.55. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AIG’s 2023 sales is pegged at $51.4 billion, indicating a 13.2% increase from the year-ago reported figure of $45.4 billion.The company beat earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average surprise being 13.5%.Key DriversIn the first half of 2023, a significant portion of AIG’s total revenues came from premiums, which improved 19.9% year over year. The figures are expected to grow further in the future due to strong performance in commercial lines and rate increases contributing to higher pricing.The General Insurance segment accounted for 55.4% of total revenues in the first half of 2023. This segment delivered strong results in the second quarter due to the improving performance of Lexington and Global Commercial businesses. North America Commercial is expected to aid the results of this business segment due to strong growth in net premiums thanks to Lexington and Retail Property. Strong retention, rate increases and new businesses have been the key drivers for the Lexington business.Story continuesTotal net investment income increased 21.6% year over year in the first half of 2023. A high-interest rate environment should provide an impetus to growth in net investment income. In order to take advantage of higher interest rates, AIG has repositioned its General Insurance portfolio to gain higher yields but remains careful about maintaining credit quality and duration. This is likely to result in higher net investment income in 2023.The company is delivering well on its objective to deliver 10% plus adjusted return on capital employed. In July 2023, it closed the sale of its Crop Risk Services to AFG and formed Private Client Select with Stone Point Capital LLC., to streamline its operations and enhance earnings quality.The company rewarded its shareholders with $554 million in repurchases and dividends worth $268 million in the second quarter, reflecting its balanced capital management strategy. This implies that the company’s shares are a good buy for investors looking for returns in the form of dividends.However, AIG’s rising expense level is a concern. Its total benefits and expenses increased 19% in the first half of 2023. We expect the metric to increase 16.9% in 2023. American International’s return on equity of 9.3% is lower than the industry’s average of 10.8%. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive growth in the long term.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the insurance space include Arch Capital Group Ltd. ACGL, Aflac Incorporated AFL and Chubb Limited CB. Arch Capital currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Aflac and Chubb carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The consensus mark for ACGL’s 2023 earnings has moved 2.3% north in the past 30 days.The bottom line of Aflac beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 7.8%.

However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Specifically, we decided to study American International Group's  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for American International Group How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for American International Group is:11% = US$5.2b ÷ US$46b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.11 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.American International Group's Earnings Growth And 11% ROETo start with, American International Group's ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 11%. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the impressive net income growth of 52% seen over the past five years by American International Group. However, there could also be other drivers behind this growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.Story continuesWe then compared American International Group's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 11% in the same 5-year period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for AIG? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is American International Group Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?American International Group has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 9.7%, meaning that it has the remaining 90% left over to reinvest into its business. So it looks like American International Group is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth.Moreover, American International Group is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to rise to 24% over the next three years. Despite the higher expected payout ratio, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with American International Group's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

""When you're the biggest, you're going to be hit really hard with cancellations,"" Vorhaus Advisors CEO Mike Vorhaus said on Tuesday at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Tech Conference in San Francisco. ""The problem for them in the United States is that everybody who has conflicts today, plus everybody who has ever had to cancel, adds up pretty much to the total number of people that would consider ever joining a streaming service. They've already said no to Netflix once, so now there's that contest to get them back and that's quite a struggle.""Though Netflix has its challenges, there's more than enough cord-cutting to go around right now. The data shows that 12% of paid TV subscribers are ""very likely to cut the cord in the next year,"" and those who are most likely to do so are between the ages of 18 and 34.About 47% of people who cancel services do so to save money.Netflix logo on a TV screen in Poland on Nov. 29, 2020.

Every day, 2 out of 5 Americans watch videos on the internet, the Vorhaus survey revealed. Across all age categories, there are increases in daily digital video viewing between 7% and 10%.In part, what's opening the door to this kind of transition is a change in storytelling, Vorhaus told the audience.Story continues""The idea that a story has to be scripted, that the story has to have big actors in it, that the story must have a budget, and a beginning, middle, and end — the world has changed,"" he said.""With all due respect, the story isn't 'When Harry Met Sally' anymore,"" Vorhaus added.

If you want to skip our discussion on the healthcare market, head directly to 5 Best Healthcare ETFs To Buy. In December 2022, BlackRock highlighted concerns about the performance for the healthcare sector in 2023. The previous year was rather challenging for equity and fixed income markets. However, the healthcare sector has historically shown resilience during such times. For 2023, BlackRock expected a volatile market, given the inflationary pressure and other geopolitical uncertainty. As per expectations, the sector has exhibited uncertainty in 2023. Over the past two years, the industry has reached record highs in performance. This can be directly attributed to the industry’s effective response to COVID-19. In 2021, the healthcare sector contributed around 19% of the GDP for the United States, while the medical expense for a person amounted to roughly $13,000. BlackRock reported that revenues from COVID-19 are going to normalize over the next few years, as the world moves on from the pandemic. However, the industry presents a valuable opportunity for innovation in creating mRNA-based technologies to treat cancer, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s. While the pandemic forced drastic changes for the medical sector worldwide, it highlighted the efficacy of telehealth, remote monitoring, and cloud-management services within the industry. Don't Miss: 10 Best Semiconductor ETFsLBMC, a professional services CPA firm, valued the telehealth market at $48.3 billion in 2022, and it is forecasted to reach $57.1 billion in 2023. Similarly, in 2021, the worldwide big data healthcare market was worth $32.9 billion, and it is anticipated to be valued at $105.73 billion by 2030, showing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.85%. With the recent hype about artificial intelligence, companies are expected to innovate and integrate it into their cloud-based data management portals. The industry faces significant challenges despite the recent performance boost since Covid-19. Perhaps the biggest concern in the US market is the shortage of medical professionals. In addition, the rising levels of inflation would increase healthcare premiums. Currently, the consumer price index is at 3%. In comparison, this was 9.1% in June 2022. Although the Federal Reserve has managed to reduce inflation, the officially targeted rate is 2%. To add to this, many experts expect unemployment levels to rise over the next year. Collectively, unemployment and inflation are expected to increase the likelihood of a recession over the next 12 months. Story continuesAlso Read: 20 Biggest ETFs by VolumeWhile the healthcare sector continues to normalize in the post-pandemic world, the sector remains set to innovate – be it treatments, workforce management solutions, medical devices, or better healthcare plans.

(NASDAQ:REGN), a major position and a stock we wrote up in our June 2021 letter, has been one of the best performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 this year. Alas it has not been enough to offset some of our weaker stocks, let alone our overweight exposure to the UK (and Europe) which have suffered from both stock and currency weakness. We do not think we are bad at picking stocks on the long side and hope – reasonably we think – for better relative results in the future. Prior to COVID, our longs were markedly better than the index. Unfortunately, if you look at our long book this quarter and since the onset of the COVID pandemic, there is scant evidence that we have added any value by picking stocks to go long.”11. iShares Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ:IBB)5 Year Performance as of September 4: 10.42%iShares Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ:IBB) aims to mimic the performance of the ICE Biotechnology Index, which consists of biotechnology sector equities listed in the United States.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Two things are very noticeable right off the top. First, sometimes you have to be happy losing less in a bear market environment so that you have more of your capital to grow in the next bull market. We are never really happy losing money. Second, 2022 is likely to be our third year of existence as a fund to lose money for the year. This year would join 2008 and 2018 in this undistinguished category. Our biggest detractors were dominated by  Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN). Consumer/investor fears about media and e-commerce hit WBD and EBAY and profit taking in Amgen came from early 2022 strength.”10.

Danaher has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 this year due to a slowdown in the bioprocessing industry and more cautious spending by biopharma customers. Bioprocessing is a key end-market that drives more than a quarter of Danaher’s profits. Bioprocessing products are the main inputs that biopharma companies use to manufacture biologic drugs, which are the fastest growing category of drugs, growing low-to-mid-teens and representing a sizeable portion of the clinical pipeline.The bioprocessing industry experienced significant growth in 2021 and 2022, driven by Covid vaccines and a strong biotech funding environment. Several participants, including Danaher, lowered their 2023 growth outlook in large part due to customer inventory de-stocking and biotech funding weakness. We anticipate that this slowdown is temporary, and the bioprocessing industry will return to normalized growth of high-single digit to mid-teens in 2024 and beyond.…” (Click here to read the full text)9.

(TSX.V: WGO, OTCQX: WHGOF, FRA: 29W) (the ""Company"") is pleased to announce partial results from 2023 exploration diamond drilling at the Betty Ford target on the Betty property including 3.38 g/t Au over 53.0 m from 7.30 m depth in hole BETFD23D013, which included higher grade subintervals of 7.19 g/t Au over 6.30 m and 8.00 g/t Au over 4.35 m. Results of diamond drilling at the Vertigo target on the JP Ross property include 1.4 g/t Au over 58.4 m in hole JPRVER23D0052 from 40.95 m depth, and JPRVER23D0051 which intersected three zones of high-grade gold mineralization. Betty Ford and Vertigo (Figure 1) are located approximately 65 km southeast and 30 km northeast respectively from the Company’s flagship White Gold Project in west-central Yukon, Canada, which comprises 16 million tonnes averaging 2.23 g/t Au for 1,152,900 ounces of gold in the Indicated Resource category and 19 million tonnes averaging 1.54 g/t Au for 942,400 ounces of gold in the Inferred Resource category (1).The Betty property lies along strike and approximately 40 km east-southeast of Newmont Corporation’s (NYSE: NEM, TSX: NGT) Coffee gold deposit with Indicated Resources of 2.14 Moz gold and Inferred Resources of 0.23 Moz gold(2). The Betty property is also contiguous to and 15 km northeast of Western Copper and Gold Corporation’s (TSX: WRN, NYSE: WRN) Casino porphyry project with Measured &amp; Indicated Resources of 14.8 Moz gold &amp; 7.6 Blbs copper and Inferred Resources of 6.3 Moz gold and 3.1 Blb copper(3). The JP Ross property is road accessible and located in a prolific placer camp with significant recorded placer gold production. These drill programs form part of the Company’s 2023 fully funded exploration program on its extensive and underexplored 350,000 hectare land package in the emerging White Gold District, Yukon, supported by strategic partners Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (TSX: AEM, NYSE: AEM) and Kinross Gold Corporation (TSX: K, NYSE: KGC).Story continues“We are pleased to encounter near surface high-grade gold mineralization over such a broad zone at Betty Ford which remains open for expansion. Furthermore, we have also encountered the first occurrence of gold within the deeper sulphide domain of the polylithic breccia unit while testing for possible feeder structures, which represents an important development in our understanding of Betty Ford and the potential to even further extend mineralization. The diamond drilling at Vertigo has improved our structural interpretation of the known mineralization controls at this high-grade gold target. These results continue to demonstrate the expansiveness of gold mineralization in our underexplored district scale exploration portfolio in a tier 1 mining district,” stated David D’Onofrio, Chief Executive Officer.Maps and images accompanying this news release can be found at http://whitegoldcorp.ca/investors/exploration-highlights/. Assay results and drill collar details for Betty Ford and Vertigo are summarized below in Tables 1 and 2, and Tables 3 and 4 respectively.Highlights:Betty Ford:Diamond drilling consisted of four holes totalling 1,165 m (Figure 2) to further evaluate the zone of near-surface high gold mineralization encountered in 2021 (BETFD21D003: 3.46 g/t Au over 50 m), and 2022 (BETFD22RC004: 8.94 g/t Au over 18.29 m), and also test for the presence of a mineralized buried porphyry at depth, as well as a possible feeder contact/structure for the gold mineralization.BETFD23D013 (Figure 3) intersected 3.38 g/t Au over 53 m from 7.30 m depth, including 7.19 g/t Au over 6.30 m and 8.00 g/t Au over 4.35 m. Assays for the lower portion of BETFD23D013 from 364 m to 503 m remain outstanding.BETFD23D012 intersected 1.20 g/t Au over 8.3 m from 166.7 m depth, including 5.51 g/t Au over 1.0 m, and is the first occurrence of gold within the sulphide domain of the polylithic breccia unit and also significantly extended the width of the polylithic breccia unit.Based on visual inspection, holes BETFD23D014 and D015 appear to have also intersected significant zones of oxidized mineralized breccia which has been the primary host of gold mineralization at the Betty Ford target. Assay results are pending and will be released as they are received and interpreted.Vertigo:Diamond drilling at Vertigo was designed to test a revised structural interpretation including identification of multiple prospective vein sets and potential for bulk tonnage gold mineralization.5 holes totalling 1,022 m (Figure 4) tested the mineralized zone near previous trenching and drilling, as well as adjacent gold-in-soil anomalies located 250-300 m to the east-northeast, southwest and south.Hole JPRVER23D0052 intersected 58.4 m grading 1.4 g/t Au from 40.95 m depth, with narrower high-grade subintervals of 9.10 g/t Au over 2.85 m and 6.68 g/t Au over 4.80 m, with multiple occurrences of visible gold within the zones.Hole JPRVER23D0051, located approximately 50 m west-northwest of JPRVER23D0052, intersected 3 narrow (&lt; 2 m) mineralized zones grading 4.37 g/t Au over 1.30 m, 15.79 g/t Au over 1.60 m, and 4.17 g/t Au over 1.90 m.Newly collected borehole optical televiewer data supports the structural interpretation of multiple mineralized vein sets, with two separate orientations.Additional targets remain to be tested and to date all drilling at Vertigo has been conducted at shallow depths with the longest hole being only 280.5 m.Additional results from the Company’s diamond drilling at the Betty Ford and Cali targets, and the regional exploration program will be announced in due course (see Company News Releases dated August 15, 2023, July 20, 2023, and July 6, 2023).Precious Metals Beaver CreekThe Company will be presenting and providing a corporate update at 2023 Precious Metals Summit Beaver Creek.

The property is transected by the Coffee Creek Fault which exerts important structural controls on Newmont’s Coffee gold deposit 40 km along strike to the west-northwest.Gold mineralization at the Betty Ford target is hosted in a polylithic breccia unit along an east-west striking splay structure located approximately 1.5 km south of and parallel to the Coffee Creek Fault. The target, which forms an approximately 1 km long east-west trending gold-in-soil anomaly with gold values ranging from trace up to 1,961 ppb Au, was initially RAB drill tested by the Company in 2018 with BETFRDRAB18-002 intersecting near surface gold mineralization averaging 1.08 g/t Au over 50.29 m from 4.57 m depth. During 2021 and 2022, the Company completed 11 diamond drill holes totalling 2,297 m and 2 RC holes totalling 201 m to further test the target along an approximately 250 m strike length. This drilling has continued to intersect a broad zone of near-surface gold mineralization within the polylithic breccia host unit that has returned 1.17 g/t Au over 48.00 m in hole BETFD21D001, 3.46 g/t Au over 50.0 m in BETFD21D003, 1.50 g/t Au over 55.15 m in BETFD22D007, and 8.94 g/t Au over 18.29 m in BETFD22RC004 including 21.73 g/t Au over 6.10 m. Thus far, mineralization has been traced for approximately 175 m along strike and to a vertical depth of 75 m. The zone remains open primarily to the east for a minimum of 100 m and further evaluation of the target is recommended.The 2023 diamond drilling program at the Betty Ford target comprised 4 holes totaling 1,165 m that was designed to test: 1) the presence of a mineralized buried porphyry at depth beneath the polylithic breccia unit; 2) a possible feeder contact/structure identified from VLF-EM surveying; 3) a strong gold-in-soil anomaly in the area of an eastern gully and interpreted fault structure; and 4) controls on higher grade gold mineralization such as that intersected in hole BETFD22RC004.Betty Ford - Partial 2023 Diamond Drilling ResultsAssay results received to date for the 2023 Betty Ford diamond drilling program are summarized below in Table 1. Assays have been received for all of hole BETFD23D012 and a portion of BETFD23D013 from surface to 364 m.Hole BETFD23D012 was drilled to test for a potential feeder contact/structure for the near-surface gold mineralization. A VLF-EM survey suggests that in this area the contact is characterized by a resistivity high to the south, and the gold mineralization encountered in existing holes appears to be at the contact zone with a resistivity low to the north. The hole collared in metasediments (3.0-42.0 m), and then passed downwards into a feldspar porphyry dyke from 42-113 m (71 m), and polylithic breccia from 113 m to the end of the hole at 202 m. It appears that the VLF feature is explained by the resistivity contrast between the metasediments and feldspar porphyry (resistivity high) and the polylithic breccia (resistivity low), and that the prospective metasedimentary – polylithic breccia contact in this area has been infilled with a dyke. Of note, the hole intersected a gold mineralized zone grading 1.20 g/t Au over 8.3 m within the breccia from 166.7 – 175.0 m, which is the deepest gold mineralization encountered to date at Betty Ford and is well within the sulphide domain. Additionally, the hole successfully widened the polylithic breccia to the south by approximately 50 m and now measures up to 90 m locally in true width.BETFD23D013 with a final depth of 503 m, is the deepest hole drilled to date at Betty Ford and was designed primarily to test for the presence of a mineralized buried porphyry intrusion at depth beneath the polylithic breccia unit. The hole collared in oxidized mineralized breccia which passed downwards into a transition zone to 60 m depth. The hole intersected 3.38 g/t Au over 53.0 m from 7.3 m depth, and included two higher grade subintervals including 7.19 g/t Au over 6.3 m and 8.00 g/t Au over 4.35 m further extending the high-grade mineralization zone 10 to 25 m east of gold mineralization previously intersected in hole BETFD21D003 which returned 3.46 g/t Au over 50.0 m. The hole drilled through a thick interval of polylithic breccia down to 289.5 m, then a zone of breccia with intermittent feldspar porphyry dykes (3 – 30 m wide) from 289.5-383.0 m, and finally continuous polylithic breccia to the end of the hole at 503 m.Assay results for the lower portion of holes BETFD23D013 (364 – 503 m) and holes 014 and D015 are pending and will be released as they are received and interpreted. Details on the Betty Ford target are provided in a news release issued by the Company on July 6, 2023 (available on SEDAR+).Table 1.

Covering 76,385 hectares centred on the famed Henderson Creek placer gold area. The property hosts several prospective targets including Vertigo, Stage Fright (JPRSF19RAB-005: 2.31 g/t Au over 16.76 m), Sabotage (JPRSAB19RAB-011: 3.42 g/t Au over 7.62 m), North Frenzy (JPRNF19RAB-002: 5.45 g/t Au over 4.57 m), Notorious (GT-Probe: 24.4 g/t Au; Rock samples: 18.2 g/t Au &amp; 33.6 g/t Ag) , Life Boat (JPRLB19RAB-001: 5.41 g/t Au over 3.05 m) and others.Gold mineralization at Vertigo is associated with quartz veining, brecciation and strong quartz-sericite altered structures containing disseminated to locally massive arsenopyrite, galena and pyrite, and locally fine-grained visible gold within a felsic gneiss host unit. Vuggy textures and iron oxides after pyrite, as well as an interpreted early phase of potassic alteration, are common.Gold mineralization at Vertigo occurs at a principal fault intersection between a district-scale WNW-trending magnetite-destructive fault zone (Vertigo FZ) and a major NE-trending magnetic and topographic (LiDAR) lineament. Gold mineralization occurs within an approximately 2.0 km by 0.8 km mag-destructive sigmoid, suggesting that a left-lateral pull-apart can be the principal controlling array. On a local scale, optical televiewer data and trench mapping confirmed that steeply dipping quartz veins predominantly follow a principal WNW-trend and a subordinate NE-trend. Both vein systems crosscut at high angle to the host-rock sub-horizontal foliation, while the subordinate vein array occurs parallel to open folding of NE-axis. Overall, the geometry, magnetic character and scale of the WNW- and NE-trending faults and quartz veins are encouraging, as they closely resemble the principal structures controlling gold mineralization at, respectively, the Golden Saddle and Ryan’s Surprise deposits.Initial diamond drilling at Vertigo was carried out by Kinross in 2010 with the completion of 4 holes totalling 521.7 m. During 2018 and 2019, the White Gold carried out RAB (25 holes, 1,448.9 m) and RC drilling (36 holes, 2,551.3m), and in 2019 completed 46 diamond drill holes totalling 9,568.5 m. The 2018 RAB and RC holes drilled to the south (180° azimuth) and north (360° azimuth), whereas 2019 RAB, RC and diamond drill holes drilled to the north-northeast (020° azimuth) to test the interpreted primary west-northwest striking and south dipping mineralized structures. The drilling produced very encouraging results (e.g. 23.44 g/t Au and 144.75 g/t Ag over 24.38 m in hole JPRVERRAB18-014, 9.46 g/t Au and 36.68 g/t Ag over 22.86m in hole JPRVERRC18-006, and 11.64 g/t Au and 32 g/t Ag over 5.34m in hole JPRVER19D0015 – see Table 1, and Company News Releases dated Dec. 06, 2018 and Aug. 08, 2019) with significant associated silver values.More recently the Company has reviewed and interpreted available borehole optical televiewer and trench structural data which indicates that there are 3 mineralized vein sets at Vertigo: 1) the primary WNW striking vein set which has been the focus of previous drilling; 2) a north-northeast (022°) striking secondary vein set which dips steeply to both the west and east; and 3) a set of narrow (up to 10-15 cm) sheeted quartz veins that strike east-northeast (070°) and dip moderately at 55° north. These latter quartz veins were exposed during mechanical trenching during the 2019 field season, and vein samples returned encouraging gold assays in the range of 1.5 g/t Au to 17.3 g/t Au, however 2019 diamond drilling did not test this newly identified vein set due to the orientation of drilling.The 2023 diamond drilling program at the Vertigo target comprised 5 holes totalling 1,022 m which tested the mineralized zone near previous trenching and drilling, as well as adjacent gold-in-soil anomalies located 250-300 m to the east-northeast, southwest and south. All holes were drilled to the south-southeast (152°-155°) at dips of -50° to -52°, and holes lengths ranged from 138 to 233 m.Vertigo - 2023 Diamond Drilling Results Assay results for the 2023 Vertigo diamond drilling program are summarized below in Table 3. Hole JPRVER23D052 produced the most encouraging results intersecting 58.4 m grading 1.4 g/t Au from 40.95 m downhole, with narrower high-grade subintervals of 9.10 g/t Au over 2.85 m and 6.68 g/t Au over 4.80 m. This hole confirms that Vertigo locally contains relatively broad zones of bulk tonnage gold mineralization. Hole JPRVER23D051 was collared approximately 50 m west-northwest of JPRVER23D0052 and intersected 3 discrete gold mineralized zones grading 4.37 g/t Au over 1.30 m, 15.79 g/t Au over 1.60 m, and 4.17 g/t Au over 1.90 m. Intervening intervals between mineralization did not return any significant gold values, suggesting a variation in vein density and structure between the two holes.Hole JPRVER23D053 was drilled approximately 250 m east-northeast of hole JPRVER23D052 to test a gold-in-soil anomaly and intersected a single narrow zone grading 2.77 g/t Au over 1.90 m from 64.45 m depth. Holes JPRVER23D054 and JPRVER23D055, drilled to the south and west-southwest to test additional gold-in-soil anomalies did not encounter significant mineralization.The 2023 diamond drilling successfully identified two primary fault and vein arrays that strike WNW and NE. The higher concentration of gold in hole JPRVER23D052 is closely associated with an increase in vein and breccia structures in the hanging wall of a major fault zone which appears to strike WNW. The highest gold grades (5.5 – 15.6 g/t Au) are associated with multiple phases of quartz-pyrite and quartz-arsenopyrite which is hosted in brittle-ductile vein sets and crackle and hydrothermal breccias. Additional review of the 2019 drill core and other data (geochemical &amp; geophysical) is expected to aid in refining the structural interpretation for future drill targeting.Additional surface targets on the project remain to be drill-tested, and Vertigo has seen only relatively shallow drilling, so opportunities exist for the discovery of additional high-grade gold zones.Table 3.

Persistent economic chatter can rattle even seasoned traders. Still, the goal for those aiming to craft a retirement portfolio is straightforward: Target resilient, retirement-friendly stocks that can weather any storm.Investing isn’t just about chasing dividends; it’s about betting on companies with robust foundations that can tackle market volatility head-on. Such stalwarts possess stellar balance sheets and an innate ability to shine, irrespective of the broader market dynamics. Hence, if you’re on the hunt for stocks for your retirement portfolio, prioritize firms equipped to survive and thrive amidst any economic backdrop. These three fit the description perfectly.Apple (AAPL)An image of a building with the Apple logo on it, a pink sunset in the backgroundSource: askarim / ShutterstockRegarding tech behemoths, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) continues to shine with its groundbreaking innovations. The company’s spectacular business model and the unwavering surge of its stock have consistently drawn the attention of investment moguls such as Warren Buffett. While the world remains enamored with the iPhone, its diversified arsenal of products and unmatched customer loyalty set it apart from the competition. Its unique strengths allow for premium pricing, ensuring a gusher of quarterly cash flows. It’s no wonder Buffett lauds Apple as the crown jewel of his portfolio, making it his investment firm’s most significant holding.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMarket titans Paul Tudor Jones and Jim Simons amplified their stakes in the tech giant by triple-digit margins. Moreover, Apple isn’t just about hoarding its earnings. Since 2012, it channeled over $500 billion into share repurchases, and in the last quarter alone, it returned a staggering $24 billion to its shareholders, maintaining a tradition of annually hiking dividends since 2013. Sitting atop a cash war chest worth $62.48 billion and boasting a 0.5% dividend yield with nine consecutive years of growth, Apple continues its reign as an investor’s dream.Story continuesBank of America (BAC)bank of America stock BAC stockSource: ShutterstockThis year has been remarkably turbulent for bank stocks, with the sector grappling with the aftershocks of the Signature Bank (OTCMKTS:SBNY) and Silicon Valley Bank (OTCMKTS:SIVBQ) debacles. To rub salt in the wounds, the banking realm has faced additional pressure from prominent credit rating agencies downgrading several entities. However, amid this financial storm, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), the nation’s second-largest lender, seems to have weathered weather the storm effectively while trading near its 52-week low prices.Surprisingly, this dip in Bank of America’s trajectory comes after the financial giant surpassed Wall Street’s second-quarter estimates across both lines. With elevated interest rates propelling its income, the bank reported an earnings-per-share of 88 cents, outshining the anticipated 84 cents. The quarterly revenue, too, was at an impressive $25.2 billion against the projected $24.9 billion. However, despite these optimistic numbers, BAC has waved a cautionary flag about a deceleration in its loan and deposit growth amidst the cooling U.S. economy.Nevertheless, BAC’s robust shareholder rewards program offers confidence. The bank boasts an enviable track record of dividend payments spanning 23 years, with an impressive nine consecutive years of payout surges, dwarfing the sector’s median of a mere two years. Furthermore, it offers a remarkable 3.4% yield complemented by a 5-year growth rate of 12.9%.NextEra Energy (NEE)The NextEra Energy (NEE) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.comNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is forging an optimistic path into the future, effectively replacing harmful fossil fuels with cleaner alternatives such as wind and solar. Its dedication to a sustainable world involves generating power that respects our planet’s ecological balance.Over the years, it has operated a remarkably consistent business, generating strong growth across both lines. Moreover, its second-quarter financials reflect its determination to push forward despite market headwinds, showcasing an astounding profit of $2.795 billion, nearly doubling the previous year’s $1.38 billion.Beyond financial success, NextEra is diving into pioneering territory, partnering with CF Industries Holdings (NYSE:CF) to explore the vast potential of hydrogen as a green energy source. The collaboration could potentially usher in a new dawn for renewable power.More importantly, NEE is a dividend aristocrat for retirement stock investors, having raised its payouts for the past 26 consecutive years.

They are seeking compensation from the bank, which they blame for losses incurred by the pension fund for Brazil's postal workers. Credit: Marcio MonzanePostal employees in Brazil are demanding that Bank of New York Mellon cover more than $2 billion of investment losses related to the workers' pensions, arguing that the U.S.-based bank mismanaged the funds.The losses have resulted in reduced pension benefits for hundreds of thousands of Brazilian retirees and higher out-of-pocket costs for current postal workers, according to groups that represent the workers.More than 100 representatives from the postal workers federations of Brazil and community groups in the U.S. and Brazil gathered in front of BNY Mellon's Wall Street headquarters last Friday afternoon to advocate for restitution. They carried signs demanding the return of funds lost by the pension fund for Brazil's postal workers retirement system, called Postalis.""We intend to put pressure on BNY Mellon to acknowledge its responsibility and fulfill its obligation to fully reimburse Postalis for the entirety of the losses incurred,"" José Aparecido Gimenes Gandara, president of the Brazilian Postal Workers Federation (FINDECT), said in a statement.A BNY Mellon subsidiary managed part of Postalis from 2011 to 2019. Managers of the fund, including the former head of the New York bank's Brazilian business unit, embezzled money from Postalis investment funds and placed other risky bets that contributed to the mismanagement, advocates for the postal workers said.In a statement, BNY Mellon gave no ground to the protesters.""Any investment losses suffered by the Brazilian Postal Workers Pension Fund, Postalis, were ultimately the result of Postalis' own conduct,"" BNY Mellon said.The advocacy groups said that retired postal workers in the country of 216 million have seen their pension benefits cut by as much as 25%, and that those reductions will last for life.At the same time, current postal employees are now required to pay more into their pension plans than they were before the pension fund suffered the losses. The losses also led to the scaling down of several benefits, including one that provides a life insurance payment in a lump sum when a worker dies.Story continuesAn estimated 55,000 retired workers and 117,000 current employees have been affected by the reductions, according to the postal workers unions. Close to 500,000 Brazilians rely on the postal workers retirement system, including current workers, retirees and dependent family members.BNY Mellon's contract with the retirement system ""assigns fiduciary responsibility for the results of the investments to Bank of New York Mellon,"" Emerson Marinho, president of the Brazilian Postal Workers Federation, said in an interview.The bank has said that it doesn't believe that fiduciary managers are responsible for financial decisions.The dispute is also subject to ongoing legal action, including action by Brazil's federal prosecutor, according to groups advocating for the postal workers.In 2018, government prosecutors in Brazil tried unsuccessfully to recover the losses from the New York bank. They argued that BNY Mellon failed to monitor the risks facing Postalis and did not comply with relevant asset allocation rules.At the time, the prosecutors estimated the damage to the pension fund to be worth about 8.2 billion Brazilian reals, or more than 2 billion U.S. dollars.Brazil's parliament and BNY Mellon have discussed potential restitution, according to recent news reports, but no agreement has been announced. The advocacy groups said they plan to engage with U.S. lawmakers and continue to organize events in both Brazil and the United States to raise awareness about the lost pension funds.]"

The surge of outbound expenditures by Indian tourists has significantly bolstered the global tourism industry, particularly during the first six months of the year, with May and June witnessing a robust upswing in holiday spending overseas, according to Sukhani.Notably, the growth rate has surged by 30 to 40 percentage points over the previous year, signaling the resilience of India’s tourism sector even amidst global challenges. (For more, read Skift’s Megatrend report, India is the New China.)2: Visa Policies: The GamechangerWhile traditional hotspots such as the U.S., UK, and Singapore remain popular among Indian travelers, there has been growing demand for travel to countries with easier visa policies.Thailand is a notable example, said Sukhani.“Thailand, once a steady tourist corridor, has regained its prominence due to its accessible travel policies,” said Sukhani.Furthermore, the introduction of direct flights from cities like Delhi to Azerbaijan and Georgia has facilitated increased tourist movement to these destinations. Indian citizens just need to secure an e-visa to enter Azerbaijan. More than 60,000 tourists from India visited Azerbaijan in 2022.Story continues3: Resilience of Discretionary SpendingDespite inflation and potential recession risks, discretionary spending in India has remained strong. Sukhani said that leisure travel is witnessing an upsurge, with people traveling more frequently than before the pandemic, dispelling concerns of reduced travel due to economic concerns. Travelers are also displaying a willingness to invest in quality travel experiences.The American Express Global Travel Trends report had also highlighted that 90% of Indian travelers are emphasizing travel plans centered around personal wellness, with 87% intending to allocate more of their budget to luxury experiences rather than traditional luxury goods this year.4: Rise of Solo TravelA significant trend reshaping India’s travel landscape is the rise of solo travel coupled with a focus on enriching experiences. The emphasis on mental health has prompted an increase in wellness tourism, ranging from spa holidays to fitness-centered getaways.“The demand for unique experiences has also led to the popularity of experiential travel promoting travel companies to curate experiential packages that prioritize activities over material possessions,” he said.5: Business Travel Drives Blended TripsThe enthusiasm for leisure travel, he said, extends to business travelers, who are increasingly blending work trips with leisure experiences, a trend that Skift had earlier referred to as “The Great Merging.”Recently, Marriott’s Area Vice President for South Asia had highlighted the rising number of guests combining business trips with staycations.6: Airline Partnerships and Loyalty ProgramsAs airlines collaborate with financial institutions to capitalize on evolving travel trends, Mastercard has also partnered with Indian banks and carriers to launch co-branded credit cards.After HDFC and low-cost carrier Indigo’s co-branded card on the Mastercard network, the launch of the Vistara card, in collaboration with IDFC FIRST Bank, shows the airlines’ commitment to offering enhanced experiences.While Sukhani acknowledged that the initiative bolsters customer loyalty, he also emphasized the importance of reaching a critical mass for loyalty programs and co-branded cards to succeed. “You do need a certain number of customers for the program to justify itself,” he said.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

The collaboration is set to power BMW's new vehicles with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Digital Chassis Solution.This innovation aims to provide drivers and passengers with safer, smarter and more sophisticated in-vehicle experiences. BMW has chosen Qualcomm as its systems solution provider, incorporating the latest Snapdragon Cockpit Platform and Snapdragon Auto Connectivity Platforms for 5G connectivity.One key aspect of this partnership is the integration of Snapdragon Cockpit Platforms into new BMW vehicles and MINI's New Family vehicles. These platforms enhance the user experience by offering high-definition graphics, premium audio, crystal-clear voice communication and AI-driven features. Notably, they empower the BMW Intelligent Personal Safety Assistant with in-car virtual assistance, natural language interactions, contextual safety monitoring and precise navigation.Additionally, the Snapdragon Auto 5G Modem-RF provides ultra-fast connectivity and network reliability, ensuring seamless and always-connected experiences inside and outside the vehicles.BMW and Qualcomm are jointly developing an open and scalable Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) that spans from Level 2 to Level 3 High Automated Driving functionalities. These advanced safety features are based on the Snapdragon Ride Platform, with Level 2+ systems expected to be available by 2025.By powering BMW's cutting-edge vehicles and co-developing advanced ADAS systems, Qualcomm is solidifying its foothold in the automotive sector. This move not only enhances Qualcomm's reputation but also places it at the forefront of technological advancements within the broader automotive ecosystem.The extended partnership between BMW and Qualcomm promises to redefine the future of in-vehicle experiences and safety. As Qualcomm continues to innovate and collaborate, it is poised to reap the rewards of a dynamic and evolving automotive landscape.With the acquisition of Veoneer, Qualcomm has incorporated Arriver's Computer Vision, Drive Policy and Driver Assistance assets into its ADAS portfolio to deliver an open and competitive platform for automakers to better compete with rivals within the self-driving vehicle market.

If you want to skip our discussion on the healthcare market, head directly to 5 Best Healthcare ETFs To Buy. In December 2022, BlackRock highlighted concerns about the performance for the healthcare sector in 2023. The previous year was rather challenging for equity and fixed income markets. However, the healthcare sector has historically shown resilience during such times. For 2023, BlackRock expected a volatile market, given the inflationary pressure and other geopolitical uncertainty. As per expectations, the sector has exhibited uncertainty in 2023. Over the past two years, the industry has reached record highs in performance. This can be directly attributed to the industry’s effective response to COVID-19. In 2021, the healthcare sector contributed around 19% of the GDP for the United States, while the medical expense for a person amounted to roughly $13,000. BlackRock reported that revenues from COVID-19 are going to normalize over the next few years, as the world moves on from the pandemic. However, the industry presents a valuable opportunity for innovation in creating mRNA-based technologies to treat cancer, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s. While the pandemic forced drastic changes for the medical sector worldwide, it highlighted the efficacy of telehealth, remote monitoring, and cloud-management services within the industry. Don't Miss: 10 Best Semiconductor ETFsLBMC, a professional services CPA firm, valued the telehealth market at $48.3 billion in 2022, and it is forecasted to reach $57.1 billion in 2023. Similarly, in 2021, the worldwide big data healthcare market was worth $32.9 billion, and it is anticipated to be valued at $105.73 billion by 2030, showing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.85%. With the recent hype about artificial intelligence, companies are expected to innovate and integrate it into their cloud-based data management portals. The industry faces significant challenges despite the recent performance boost since Covid-19. Perhaps the biggest concern in the US market is the shortage of medical professionals. In addition, the rising levels of inflation would increase healthcare premiums. Currently, the consumer price index is at 3%. In comparison, this was 9.1% in June 2022. Although the Federal Reserve has managed to reduce inflation, the officially targeted rate is 2%. To add to this, many experts expect unemployment levels to rise over the next year. Collectively, unemployment and inflation are expected to increase the likelihood of a recession over the next 12 months. Story continuesAlso Read: 20 Biggest ETFs by VolumeWhile the healthcare sector continues to normalize in the post-pandemic world, the sector remains set to innovate – be it treatments, workforce management solutions, medical devices, or better healthcare plans.

(NASDAQ:REGN), a major position and a stock we wrote up in our June 2021 letter, has been one of the best performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 this year. Alas it has not been enough to offset some of our weaker stocks, let alone our overweight exposure to the UK (and Europe) which have suffered from both stock and currency weakness. We do not think we are bad at picking stocks on the long side and hope – reasonably we think – for better relative results in the future. Prior to COVID, our longs were markedly better than the index. Unfortunately, if you look at our long book this quarter and since the onset of the COVID pandemic, there is scant evidence that we have added any value by picking stocks to go long.”11. iShares Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ:IBB)5 Year Performance as of September 4: 10.42%iShares Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ:IBB) aims to mimic the performance of the ICE Biotechnology Index, which consists of biotechnology sector equities listed in the United States.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Two things are very noticeable right off the top. First, sometimes you have to be happy losing less in a bear market environment so that you have more of your capital to grow in the next bull market. We are never really happy losing money. Second, 2022 is likely to be our third year of existence as a fund to lose money for the year. This year would join 2008 and 2018 in this undistinguished category. Our biggest detractors were dominated by  Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN). Consumer/investor fears about media and e-commerce hit WBD and EBAY and profit taking in Amgen came from early 2022 strength.”10.

Danaher has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 this year due to a slowdown in the bioprocessing industry and more cautious spending by biopharma customers. Bioprocessing is a key end-market that drives more than a quarter of Danaher’s profits. Bioprocessing products are the main inputs that biopharma companies use to manufacture biologic drugs, which are the fastest growing category of drugs, growing low-to-mid-teens and representing a sizeable portion of the clinical pipeline.The bioprocessing industry experienced significant growth in 2021 and 2022, driven by Covid vaccines and a strong biotech funding environment. Several participants, including Danaher, lowered their 2023 growth outlook in large part due to customer inventory de-stocking and biotech funding weakness. We anticipate that this slowdown is temporary, and the bioprocessing industry will return to normalized growth of high-single digit to mid-teens in 2024 and beyond.…” (Click here to read the full text)9.

After all, the U.S. healthcare industry is worth more than $700 billion annually and growing at a brisk clip, especially with an aging population and global health events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Whether it is a health insurance company, a drug maker, or a medical device manufacturer, the healthcare landscape is rich and diverse, full of an array of different stocks to choose from. This has led to the rise of healthcare stocks for a market crash.Other reasons to like healthcare stocks are long-duration patents that can protect sales and profits, strong dividend payments to stockholders, and pricing power. Given the essential nature of healthcare, the sector is also more immune than most to economic downturns and market crashes.Here are three healthcare stocks to buy for a soft landing.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsUnitedHealth Group (UNH)Nurse holding a tablet with icons representing different aspects of healthcare and healthcare data representing CANO stock.Source: metamorworks / ShutterstockThere’s a nice buy-the-dip opportunity in UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) right now. The largest health insurer in the U.S. has seen its stock decline 5% this year. Trading at 22 times future earnings and with a quarterly dividend payment of $1.88 per share (1.53% yield), there are a lot of reasons to like UNH stock. Plus, companies and individuals prioritize paying their health insurance premiums in any type of economy, making UnitedHealth Group largely immune to economic downturns.UNH stock is lower this year largely due to concerns about a spike in medical costs, which could eat into profits. However, UnitedHealth Group largely dispelled those concerns with its recent Q2 print.The insurer beat Wall Street expectations on both the top and bottom lines and said that it is seeing a surge in demand for non-urgent surgeries and outpatient services that were placed on hold during the pandemic. UnitedHealth Group also lifted its full-year earnings guidance to $24.70 to $25.00 a share, up from $24.50 to $25.00 previously. This makes it one of those healthcare stocks for a market crash to consider.Story continuesPfizer (PFE)Pfizer logo on Pfizer building. Pfizer is an American pharmaceutical corporation.Source: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.comWinter is coming and with it an expected resurgence of Covid-19. Enter drug maker Pfizer (NYSE:PFE). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently said that it expects an updated COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer to be available to the public by mid-September, providing a potential catalyst for the pharmaceutical company and its stock. A boost in sales of its COVID-19 treatments cannot come soon enough at Pfizer, whose share price is down 30% this year and currently trading near a 52-week low. All in all, it’s one of those top healthcare stocks for a market crash.PFE stock has been hurt by a dramatic downturn in sales of its Covid-19 vaccine and Covid-19 antiviral pill called Paxlovid. The company reported that its revenue in Q2 of this year decreased 54% from a year earlier due to waning COVID-19 vaccine sales.The company continues to trumpet its pipeline of new medications that include treatments for urinary tract infections, Lupus, and heart disease. However, a more immediate uptick in sales of its COVID-19 vaccine this fall and winter could prove to be the shot in the arm that this stock needs.Medtronic (MDT)Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocksSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comMedical device manufacturer Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) is another stock that looks ready for a reversal of fortune. Down 15% over the last five years, MDT stock looks poised to recover after the company issued strong Q2 financial results and hiked its annual earnings forecast. Like UnitedHealth, Medtronic says it is seeing a rise in non-urgent surgeries coming out of the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result, the company, which makes pacemakers and catheters, is seeing robust sales, particularly for devices used in heart and gastrointestinal procedures.Sales of Medtronic’s heart devices unit, its biggest revenue driver, increased 5.50% in the latest quarter to $2.85 billion, which was above analysts’ estimates of $2.78 billion. That helped to drive total revenue up 4.50% to $7.70 billion, topping Wall Street consensus estimate of $7.57 billion. Looking ahead, Medtronic said it now expects its full-year profit to be between $5.08 and $5.16 a share, up from a previous range of $5 to $5.10. MDT stock also offers a quarterly dividend that yields 3.36%.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

That demand sets up a positive situation for investors in 5G stocks. Companies that can supply services and products that answer that demand stand to grow very rapidly. In fact, the 5G services sector is expected to grow at nearly 60% annually between this year and 2030. That equates to a doubling in market value every 1.2 years throughout that period. Investors in 5G stocks will see their capital grow at exceptional rates. It’s a matter of identifying strong firms in the sector and remaining patient enough to reap the rewards.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsEricsson (ERIC)Ericsson (ERIC) logo on a smartphone screen.Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.comEricsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) is a Swedish telecommunications networking stock in firm providing equipment and services to network operators and one of the more solid 5G stocks out there. The company recognizes the opportunity it has to provide networks the ability to deliver data 100 times faster than 4G does. Ericsson is a relatively inexpensive investment costing less than $5 per share. The company is not large but its revenues are growing moderately and increased by 3% in Q2. Ericsson is a very global firm and it opportunity in 5G means that it develops in spurts in certain geographies. A few years ago it was making strong efforts to move into the U.S. as government backlash against Huawei opened opportunities stateside. In Q2 the firm’s U.S. sales declined while it simultaneously grew in India offsetting the decline. Enterprise sales were a particularly bright spot for the firm with sales growing by 20%. Ericsson is smaller and riskier than many other 5G plays as it continues to search for stable profitability. Investing in ERIC includes a nice dividend that offsets some of that risk and the small size of the company also helps to make its growth narrative more attractive. American Tower REIT (AMT)Antenna Telephone and communication towers have a sunset background. American Tower (AMT) is one of the largest 4G tower operators in the U.S.Source: SERDTHONGCHAI / Shutterstock.comStory continuesAmerican Tower REIT (NYSE:AMT) stock represents an adage that investors hear increasingly more often these days: Invest in assets, not liabilities. The assets for discussion in this case are the leasing rights to cellphone towers. American Tower REIT provides income and potential appreciation to investors through that business model. Let’s discuss the income side of that equation first because as a REIT AMT stock can be a bit confusing. When I say confusing I’m referring to the payout ratio. The general rule of thumb is that a healthy dividend has a payout ratio somewhere between 35% and 55%. That means up to 55% of earnings get returned to investors as dividends. REITs however, are obligated by law to return at least 90% of their earnings as a dividend. Thus, American Tower REIT’s payout ratio of 3 isn’t unhealthy and its 3.6% yield is comfortable. It’s actually stable, having last been reduced more than a decade ago. The payout ratio calculation is different for REITs and those interested in the mechanics should read this article. Overall, AMT is among the 5G stocks that provide access to assets in 5G for investors. Crown Castle (CCI)image of small toy homes with a red arrow pointing up to represent reits to buySource: ShutterstockCrown Castle (NYSE:CCI) is another cell tower REIT stock investors ought to consider. It offers many of the same general benefits that AMT does. Let me start by expanding upon the idea that REIT dividends aren’t as they seem by explaining Crown Castle’s. Its payout ratio of 1.57 looks entirely unsustainable at first blush. Any investor would logically conclude that no firm can pay 157% of earnings back to investors as dividends for long. It would cause the business to shrink indefinitely and ultimately collapse. What we really want to look at here is the FFO payout ratio. It’s a simple calculation of dividends paid/funds from operations that gives a more accurate reading of dividend health for REITs. In Crown Castle’s case, it stands at 82.8% presently. That’s in the healthy 75% to 85% range for REITs making CCI another asset-first investment for income investors in the 5G space.  AT&amp;T (T)AT&amp;T logo on wooden backgroundSource: Lester Balajadia / Shutterstock.comAT&amp;T (NYSE:T) is one of the largest and best-known 5G networks. Its stock is bound to come up in discussions about the 5G opportunity. Its dividend is almost certainly bound to enter those discussions as well which is where we should start because it is one of the primary reasons to invest in T shares. That dividend is the only realistic reason investors should consider AT&amp;T. The actual stock returns have been abysmally low over the past decade at 1.76% annually. However, the dividend yields 7.85% presently and makes those returns effectively much higher. The dividend was reduced in 2022 but the Q2 payout ratio was a healthy 47%. AT&amp;T is a sound choice for income investors who have the patience to stick with the company as it finds its footing on the promise of a 5G boom. Take the income, be patient, and hope that the stock can appreciate in time. Qualcomm (QCOM)Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on the side of a building in San Jose, CA.Source: jejim / Shutterstock.comQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is primarily known by investors as a chip stock. Of course, semiconductors are in everything including 5G-enabled devices. The company’s Snapdragon 5G platforms are comprehensive meaning its chips are found in everything 5G from modems to antennas. Qualcomm provides chipsets across the technology sector so it isn’t a pureplay 5G firm by any means. However, that means it is an investment that broadly benefits form the incoming opportunities throughout the tech sector. Whether that’s IoT, AI, augmented reality or anything else, Qualcomm is likely touching that opportunity in some form. Investors are right to be concerned about Qualcomm’s latest earnings release. Revenues fell by 23% and earnings dropped 52%. Handset sales drive the majority of the firm’s business and consumers are reticent to buy phones at the moment. That said, analysts see share prices increasing by $30 beyond their current $109 price. There’s a 2.9% dividend for those who make that bet right now.  Cisco (CSCO)cisco (CSCO) logo on an office buildingSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comCisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) is a networking form with obvious connections to the growth potential in 5G stocks. It’s also lagged behind the AL-led wave of growth and has been a laggard relative to the Nasdaq. In other words, it’s arguably undervalued given all of the positives underpinning the stock. 5G growth is a clear opportunity for the firm and its ability to sell networking equipment. I don’t necessarily believe that Cisco should increase dramatically in price soon. It’s fairly valued relative to historical prices based on earnings. However, CSCO shares offer exposure to tech in general, a beta that is low for its sector and generally moderate, and a dividend yielding 3%. Cisco plainly did well per its most recent earnings report. Sales increased by 16% and EPS jumped up by 43%. The rest of the tech sector is enamored with AI and the tremendous growth it has provided a few firms. I believe it has also overlooked the other tech winners who haven’t suffered a contraction including Cisco. Marvell Technology (MRVL)image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campusSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comMarvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) sells chips and hardware into several verticals including 5G. The stock is falling as I write this even though revenues were $1 million higher than expected and earnings 1 cent better than anticipated. The reaction is because MRVL shares have risen by 55% year-to-date while the sector has grown by 39%. Given that Marvell Technology didn’t blow expectations out of the water when others have, investors may be punishing the firm. That sets up an opportunity based on the consensus views of Wall Street which has the shares valued at more than $70 while trading at $53. Investors have arguably grown greedy in relation to all things AI. They seem to be expecting every firm to provide Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) type gains because of the general AI opportunity. It doesn’t work like that but Marvell Technology is certainly leveraging that opportunity as the 5G opportunity. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(NYSE:MRK) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 78%",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/merck-co-inc-nyse-mrk-110032883.html,1694084432,STORY,['MRK'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Merck implies that they have significant influence over the company's share priceA total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 44% ownership Insiders have sold recently To get a sense of who is truly in control of Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 78% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Merck. See our latest analysis for Merck ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Merck?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Merck does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Merck's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Merck is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.6%. With 8.1% and 4.7% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of MerckThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Merck &amp; Co., Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$180m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 22% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Merck. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Merck better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   4 warning signs for Merck   you should know about.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

The EC’s decision follows the positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) received on July 20, 2023. The vaccine was previously approved for use in the European Union (EU) for individuals 18 years of age or older. The use of ERVEBO should be in accordance with official recommendations.""Ebola virus disease is severe and potentially life-threatening for both children and adults. The European Commission’s expanded approval of ERVEBO for children 1 year of age and older is an important milestone for the prevention of disease caused by Zaire ebolavirus,"" said Dr. Eliav Barr, senior vice president, head of global clinical development and chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. ""When outbreaks of Ebola virus disease occur, they can quickly become a public health crisis. We are proud to play a role, alongside the global public health community, in helping to prepare for potential outbreaks of Zaire ebolavirus.""In January 2021, Merck confirmed an agreement with UNICEF to establish the world’s first global Ebola vaccine stockpile with ERVEBO to support future Zaire ebolavirus outbreak preparedness and response efforts. To date, over 500,000 doses of the licensed vaccine have been delivered to the stockpile, which is administered by the International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision.Selected Safety Information for ERVEBOCONTRAINDICATIONSDo not administer ERVEBO to individuals with a history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine, including rice protein.Story continuesWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSManagement of Acute Allergic ReactionsAmong 18,616 participants vaccinated with at least one dose of ERVEBO in clinical trials, there were two reports of anaphylaxis. Monitor individuals for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions following vaccination with ERVEBO. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision must be available in case of an anaphylactic event following the administration of ERVEBO.Limitations of Vaccine EffectivenessVaccination with ERVEBO may not protect all individuals. Vaccinated individuals should continue to adhere to infection control practices to prevent Zaire ebolavirus infection and transmission.Immunocompromised IndividualsThe safety and effectiveness of ERVEBO have not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals. The effectiveness of ERVEBO in immunocompromised individuals may be diminished. The risk of vaccination with ERVEBO, a live virus vaccine, in immunocompromised individuals should be weighed against the risk of disease due to Zaire ebolavirus.TransmissionVaccine virus RNA has been detected by RT-PCR in blood, saliva, urine, and fluid from skin vesicles of vaccinated individuals. Transmission of vaccine virus is a theoretical possibility.ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most commonly reported local and systemic adverse events in clinical trials were:Individuals 18 years of age and older: injection-site pain (70%); headache (55%); feverishness (39%); muscle pain (33%); somnolence, reduced activity, fatigue (26%); joint pain, arthralgia (19%); chills (17%); injection-site swelling (17%); decreased appetite (15%); abdominal pain (13%); injection-site redness (12%); nausea (10%); arthritis (5%); vomiting (4%), rash (4%); abnormal sweating (3%) and mouth ulceration (2%).Individuals 12 months through 2 years of age: feverishness (83%); crying (31%); decreased appetite (27%); injection-site pain (26%); somnolence, reduced activity, fatigue (20%); diarrhea (19%); vomiting (17%); irritability (11%); screaming (10%); mouth ulceration (6%); chills (5%); injection-site swelling (5%); headache (4%); abdominal pain (2%); abnormal sweating (2%) and injection-site erythema (1%).Individuals 3 years through 11 years of age: feverishness (65%); headache (50%); injection-site pain (40%); decreased appetite (24%); somnolence, reduced activity, fatigue (22%); abdominal pain (21%); chills (14%); myalgia (12%); vomiting (11%); dizziness (8%); nausea (8%); injection-site pruritus (7%); crying (3%); arthralgia (3%); diarrhea (3%); injection-site swelling (3%); abnormal sweating (1%); mouth ulceration (2%) and irritability (1%).Individuals 12 years through 17 years of age: headache (59%); injection-site pain (52%); feverishness (48%); myalgia (30%); somnolence, reduced activity, fatigue (28%); decreased appetite (21%); chills (19%); dizziness (17%); abdominal pain (16%); arthralgia (16%); nausea (8%); abnormal sweating (5%); diarrhea (4%); vomiting (4%); injection-site pruritus (3%); injection-site swelling (3%) and mouth ulceration (2%).DRUG INTERACTIONSInterference with Laboratory TestsFollowing vaccination with ERVEBO, individuals may test positive for anti-Ebola glycoprotein (GP) antibody and/or Ebola GP nucleic acid or antigens. GP-based testing may have limited diagnostic value during the period of vaccine viremia, in the presence of vaccine-derived Ebola GP, and following antibody response to the vaccine.USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONSThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies of ERVEBO in pregnant women, and human data available from clinical trials with ERVEBO are insufficient to establish the presence or absence of vaccine-associated risk during pregnancy.Human data are not available to assess the impact of ERVEBO on milk production, its presence in breast milk, or its effects on the breastfed child.INDICATIONS AND USAGE IN THE U.S.ERVEBO® is indicated for the prevention of disease caused by Zaire ebolavirus in individuals 12 months of age and older.Limitations Of UseThe duration of protection conferred by ERVEBO is unknown. ERVEBO does not protect against other species of Ebolavirus or Marburgvirus. Effectiveness of the vaccine when administered concurrently with antiviral medication, immune globulin (IG), and/or blood or plasma transfusions is unknown.About Ebola Virus DiseaseEbola virus disease is a rapidly progressive, severe, potentially fatal and transmissible hemorrhagic illness caused by infection with one of the Ebola virus species. While there are six identified Ebola virus species, the Zaire ebolavirus strain has been the leading cause of outbreaks over the last 20 years. The average fatality rate for Ebola virus disease is approximately 50% but has ranged from 25% to 90% in previous outbreaks.Human-to-human transmission can occur via blood or bodily fluids, objects (like needles and syringes), possibly from contact with semen from a man who has recovered from Ebola, or direct contact through broken skin or mucous membranes.About ERVEBO® (Ebola Zaire Vaccine, Live) Suspension for intramuscular injectionERVEBO® is indicated for the prevention of disease caused by Zaire ebolavirus in individuals 12 months of age and older. ERVEBO is a live recombinant viral vaccine consisting of a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) backbone deleted for the VSV envelope glycoprotein and substituted with the envelope glycoprotein of the Zaire ebolavirus (Kikwit 1995 strain).ERVEBO was initially engineered by scientists from the Public Health Agency of Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory and the technology was subsequently licensed by a subsidiary of NewLink Genetics Corporation now known as Lumos Pharma, Inc. Merck licensed the vaccine in 2014 and led research and development efforts in collaboration with a number of public health organizations to enable a broad clinical development program. This project has been funded in part with federal funds from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), under contract number HHSO100201700012C.The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), L’institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale (INSERM), and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) sponsored the PREVAC study, designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two Ebola virus disease vaccine candidates, including ERVEBO, in adults and children aged 12 months and older.ERVEBO is approved in the European Union, United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Switzerland, and 10 countries in Africa.About MerckAt Merck, known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, we are unified around our purpose: We use the power of leading-edge science to save and improve lives around the world.

Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Rockwell Automation. See our latest analysis for Rockwell Automation ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Rockwell Automation?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Rockwell Automation. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong.

Rockwell Automation is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 12%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.0% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.1% by the third-largest shareholder.A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 22 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Rockwell AutomationThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Rockwell Automation, Inc.. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$76m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 16% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Rockwell Automation.

That, along with the electrification of vehicles, are expected to drive power demand, the CEO said.""Natural gas, and in particular pipeline and storage capacity, will be the beneficiary of that continued electrification,"" Armstrong said.The shift away from coal to gas for power generation in the states where Williams operates will result in the need for an additional 4.6 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d) of gas, he added.Considering the volume of gas it transports and the pipeline capacity it has, and not the price of natural gas, Williams expects strong revenue growth from its existing and future projects with robust dividend yields, Armstrong said.Front-month gas futures for October delivery fell 7.8 cents, or 3%, on Wednesday morning, to $2.504 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), putting the contract on track for its lowest close since Aug. 23.Williams is working on increasing its pipeline network to transport even more gas to U.S. customers, including producers of liquefied natural gas, Armstrong said.(Reporting by Curtis Williams; Editing by Marianna Parraga and Bill Berkrot)]"

The latest contract win is an example of that. Such strong order flows are expected to boost the defense business segment’s top line.Growth ProspectsWith the United States being the world’s largest weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products.

It turns out, she was far from alone. A few years later, one trend is emerging from the pandemic's economic shock: more Black women-owned businesses are being founded and growing quickly, outpacing other businesses. In fact, Gilliard and her woman-coaching business Femininely Free! are part of a surge in new Black women-owned businesses, which grew 32.7% between 2019 and 2023. That's compared with the 12.1% growth of all women-owned businesses during the same period, according to the upcoming 2023 Wells Fargo Impact of Women-Owned Businesses report to be released in November.""I was trying to make a business out of a hobby that I had for about 20 years,"" said Gilliard, who's based in Philadelphia. ""I think that sometimes you have a dream and you're not really sure how to get the business going.""To help her launch Femininely Free! Gilliard turned to Milestone Circles, a mentoring program for women entrepreneurs offered by the Nasdaq Entrepreneurial Center (NEC) and funded by Wells Fargo Foundation support. Participants, 86% of which have been Black, African American, and/or Afro-Caribbean, learn to improve their business alongside a ""circle"" of fellow entrepreneurs.Milestone Circles, now entering its third year, has connected nearly 2,000 women business owners to powerful peer networks that help them hit their business milestone. Wells Fargo and the NEC plan to double the number of graduates to 4,000 by the end of 2024 to better meet the needs of the thousands of women entrepreneurs who've already applied to the free program, which is part of Wells Fargo's Connect to More program.""[Milestone Circles] helps women entrepreneurs like myself to know that, listen, you're not by yourself,"" said Cynthia Hurley, a Brooklyn, New York-based entrepreneur and founder of Make Cent$ With Your Money, which promotes financial literacy to women and young people. ""This is a community of women who are facing challenges, who are all looking to do the same thing: grow their business.""Story continuesBlack women-owned businesses are growingBlack women-owned businesses aren't just increasing in number after the pandemic, they're growing faster, too. While the average revenue among Black women-owned businesses is still lower than others, it's catching up, increasing 35.3% between 2019 and 2023 compared with 7.1% and 4.1% for women-owned and Black-owned businesses, respectively, according to the Wells Fargo report.Tamika Chance of Waldorf, Maryland, has grown her IT support firm T12 Technologies by learning to better market herself and her services, which helped her win new contracts. It's a skill she picked up in her Milestone Circle.""As a woman entrepreneur, it's very difficult to have people speak to you and sometimes take you seriously in the services that you do,"" Chance said. ""With Wells Fargo, they're providing the tools, information, and paths to reach those tools and resources you need to grow.""One reason for growth: supportOne factor behind the recent growth in Black women-owned businesses is that these business owners are harnessing new opportunities and resources.While Black women are more likely to earn less, get less financing, and not have networks to rely on, the past few years have brought new investment from banks to support small businesses and a renewed push from consumers to support Black-owned businesses, according to the report. For example, Wells Fargo, the Bank of Doing, launched the $420 million Open for Business Fund in 2020 to help small businesses impacted by the pandemic with a focus on expanding financing opportunities for women- and Black-owned businesses through community development financial institutions, or CDFIs.Through the Milestone Circles program, thousands of women entrepreneurs have built their own community and made their business ideas into a reality.""It's important that banks help the communities in which they serve. Wells Fargo has been a partner in the community ever sense I can remember,"" Gilliard said. ""If you're in the community, you should be a part of the community. That's my motto.""Wells Fargo Foundation President Otis Rolley poses in Times Square with women entrepreneurs who recently graduated from the Milestone Circles program.

The WHO has reported finding BA.2.86 in at least six countries.According to CDC data, the EG.5 subvariant, a descendant of the Omicron lineage nicknamed ""Eris"" on social media that originally emerged in November 2021, accounts for about a fifth of current U.S. COVID cases.A variant nicknamed ""Fornax,"" officially FL.1.5.1, is the next largest at 14.5% of U.S. infections, and represents a growing share of East Coast COVID cases. A wide range of other variants account for smaller shares of the total, with BA.2.86 currently representing less than 1%.Dr. David Dowdy, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, believes FL.1.5.1 will become the predominant COVID variant in the coming months, but he does not expect an infection wave like the one driven by Omicron last winter.Dowdy suggested that the current surge in cases may be due to immunity from vaccination and infection wearing off some since the last surge.Story continuesWhat do scientists say about BA.2.86?Scientists have been keeping an eye on BA.2.86 because it carries more than 35 mutations in key portions of the virus compared to XBB.1.5, the dominant variant through most of 2023.The dramatic changes - on par with the genetic shift seen in the Omicron variant compared with its Delta predecessor - raised concerns that the new variant could cause a major surge.Experiments testing versions of the virus in two U.S. independent laboratories suggest that is unlikely, said Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, whose lab led one of the studies.His team tested lab-made versions of the virus in people who were vaccinated or previously infected and found that antibodies against the variant were comparable or slightly higher than those against current circulating variants.Experiments done in the lab of Dr. David Ho at Columbia University, as well as by teams in Sweden and China, had similar findings.Will vaccines protect against new variants?Barouch's studies also suggested that newly updated vaccines will raise antibody responses ""to some extent"" against all of the currently circulating variants, including BA.2.86.Moderna on Wednesday said clinical data showed that its retooled COVID vaccine generated a nearly 9-fold increase in human antibodies that can neutralize BA.2.86.Pfizer said on Wednesday that its updated COVID shot showed neutralizing activity against BA.2.86 and EG.5 in studies conducted on mice.The updated shots are being reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and are expected to be available this month.(Reporting By Deena Beasley and Julie Steenhuysen Editing by Bill Berkrot)]"

The updated shot Moderna developed has yet to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but is expected to be available by early October, at latest.Story continuesWhile monitoring the variant is important, Reuters reported that several experts claimed that a new wave of severe disease and death is unlikely because immune defenses have been built up across the globe, both from prior infections and mass vaccination.

Knowing that stock in a large, well-capitalized, reputable company gives investors some sense of calm.Blue-chip companies have been in business for significant years, have reliable earnings, plenty of free cash flow, and tend to pay dividends to stockholders. Prime examples of blue-chip stocks include Walmart (NYSE:WMT), McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). These can anchor a portfolio and tend to be more reliable and less volatile than stocks of start-up companies and more speculative investments.Blue-chip stocks might not rise much during a bull market. But they also don’t fall as much when Wall Street gets mauled by a bear. For buy-and-hold investors, blue-chip stocks should form the foundation of their portfolio, especially when investing conservatively for retirement or a college education. Let’s examine three brilliant blue-chip stocks for lucrative, long-term growth.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCAVA Group (CAVA)Cava Group is a restaurant chain founded in 2006 in Rockville, Maryland, by Ted Xenohristos, Chef Dimitri Moshovitis and Ike Grigoropoulos.Source: Nicole Glass Photography / Shutterstock.comHaving only gone public just one month ago, Mediterranean restaurant chain CAVA Group (NYSE:CAVA) is off to a promising start. Some analysts are even likening it to blue-chip growth name Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG).Since its initial public offering (IPO) in mid-June, CAVA stock has gained 20%. The company shocked markets by reporting a profit in its first earnings report as a public traded concern.CAVA stock vaulted 12% higher on news of the profit and currently has a market valuation to $5.18 billion. Cava stunned analysts by announcing Q2 net profit of $6.5 million or 21 cents a share. This is up from a net loss of $8.2 million or $6.23 a share a year prior. Revenue in the quarter totaled $172.9 million, a 6% increase from $163 million last year. CAVA Group opened 16 new restaurants during Q2, bringing its total to 279 locations. Impressively, same-store sales increased nearly 20% in the quarter.Story continuesAlready profitable and with a successful IPO under its belt, CAVA Group looks like a brilliant blue-chip stock. It may indeed become the next Chipotle.Molson Coors (TAP)Molson Coors (TAP) logo on a web browser magnified by a magnifying glassSource: OleksandrShnuryk / Shutterstock.comSticking with the food and beverage theme, brewer Molson Coors (NYSE:TAP) is enjoying a resurgence coming out of the pandemic. Sales are surging as we head into football season.The U.S.-Canadian brewing giant also reported stunning Q2 results, with its net income rising 624% from a year earlier to $342.4 million. This was mostly because of a big spike in beer sales. With restaurants, bars, and stadiums back to full capacity, Molson Coors’ sales of beer brands such as Miller Lite and Molson Canadian are soaring through the roof.Q2 sales totaled $3.3 billion, up 14% from $2.9 billion in Q2 of 2022. The company recorded its best U.S. sales growth  since 2008 and also saw major sales increases in Canada and the UK. Looking ahead, Molson Coors raised its forward guidance, saying it now expects an increase in profits this year of 23% to 26%. This represents an up from a previous forecast of growth in the low single digits. TAP stock has risen nearly 30% year to date, making it a great long-term blue-chip pick.Starbucks (SBUX)the Starbucks (SBUX) logo on a sign outside of a coffee shopSource: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.comFinally, the final pick is retail coffee chain Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). A current  buy-the-dip opportunity exists because stock is down a slight 2% on the year.Long-term, Starbucks has proven to be a brilliant blue-chip winner with a share gain of 86% over the last five years. The company, which sells an average of eight million cups of coffee a day, continues to perform strongly in North America. However, it does face some headwinds in its second biggest market of China, whose economy is slowing down.Starbucks reported earnings per share (EPS) of $1 versus 95 cents had been expected in Q2 of this year. Operating margins grew to 17.3% from 15.9% a year earlier, driven by higher prices for its lattes and scones. However, the company’s revenue in the quarter fell short of consensus forecasts at $9.17 billion compared to the anticipated $9.29 billion. Same-store sales growth of 10% also fell short of estimates for 11%. Also, ongoing unionization efforts by U.S. employees are weighing on the share price. But over the long haul, SBUX stock should be fine.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

That will add up to 188,000 new jobs when all spending is complete.The vast majority of this spending came after 2021, when the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act was signed, and in 2022 and 2023 following passage of the IRA. Of the $154 billion of spending announced, $124 billion has come since the start of 2021.“The EV transition is impacting every aspect of the economy, including the manufacturing of EVs and the EV supply chain,” Tom Taylor, Atlas Public Policy senior policy analyst, said in a statement. Atlas Public Policy co-sponsored the data initiative, dubbed the EV Jobs Hub, with the BlueGreen Alliance Foundation. “The [data] seeks to cut through the noise from large announcements and organize it in a more digestible way,” Taylor said.Read more: Are electric cars more expensive to insure?Drilling deeper into the data, the organization finds that South Korean electronics and battery giant LG plans to spend the most here in the US ($17.2B), followed by Tesla (TSLA) ($15.7B), GM (GM) ($15.5B), Ford (F) ($11.9B), and SK Innovation ($10.3B), another South Korean company focused on batteries. In terms of industry, battery manufacturing counts for 65% of all spending, the study finds.The data isn't all rosy, however, as on the labor front the companies that spend the most don’t always hire the most. As seen in EV battery and powertrain manufacturing, fewer workers are needed to do the job. This has led to deep concern on the part of the United Auto Workers (UAW) — currently negotiating with the Big Three (Ford, GM, and Stellantis) on a new labor deal — with job protection in the form of higher wages and ending of tiered employment on the top of the union’s wish list as the EV transition rolls out across North America.Story continues“The UAW supports and is ready for the transition to a clean auto industry. But the EV transition must be a just transition that ensures auto workers have a place in the new economy,” UAW president Shawn Fain said in a statement in late August.Of the companies hiring the most in the EV space since 2010, Tesla leads the pack with 28,500 announced hires, followed by Ford (13,800), Rivian (RIVN) (13,700), LG (11,300), and Hyundai (11,100). Only Ford and LG (at joint GM/LG Ultium battery plants) use unionized labor.Indeed, of the facilities built since 2010, only 25% are represented by unionized labor, which is a concern for the White House and Democratic legislators.The stakes couldn’t be higher for the automakers as well as politicians looking to tout the EV buildout. GM’s head of manufacturing said in a video statement on Tuesday that UAW demands would threaten the automaker’s “manufacturing momentum.” It would also threaten one of the bigger manufacturing wins the US has seen in the last 50 years.Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The UAW has said 97% of members voted in favor of authorizing a strike if agreement is not reached.""They chose to follow the same path they have in the past, which is delay, delay,"" UAW President Shawn Fain told CNBC Wednesday night. ""They waited now until the last eight days to want to start talking -- so we've got a lot of work to do.""Last week, Ford said it had offered a 9% wage increase through 2027, much less than the 46% wage hike being sought by the union. The UAW expects to receive a proposal from General Motors on Thursday, a source told Reuters, who spoke on condition of anonymity. GM confirmed it will meet with the UAW Thursday but declined to provide any details.Stellantis said on Wednesday it intends to give the UAW a counter offer on the union's economic demands by the end of the week.Ford said Wednesday it continues to negotiate with the UAW but declined comment on details of the talks.Last week, the UAW filed unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board against GM and Chrysler-parent Stellantis, saying they refused to bargain in good faith.The union's demands include a 20% immediate wage increase followed by four 5% annual wage hikes, defined-benefit pensions for all workers, 32-hour work weeks and additional cost of living hikes.The UAW also wants all temporary workers at U.S. automakers to be made permanent, enhanced profit sharing and the restoration of retiree health-care benefits and cost-of-living adjustments.The UAW said Ford wants no cap on temporary workers and that those workers would not participate in profit sharing, would earn less than 60% of the top wage rate for permanent workers and receive inferior health-care benefits.Ford said it would boost starting pay for temporary workers to $20 an hour, up 20%, and offer permanent employees $12,000 in cost-of-living adjustments over the contract.The UAW said Ford's profit-sharing formula change would have cut payouts by 21% over the last two years, while Ford said it was offering a $5,500 signing bonus upon the contract's ratification for permanent and temporary workers.

At a rally on Monday, President Shawn Fain of the organization promised that members will take action by any means necessary to secure a fair contract. Those strikes are making headlines across Hollywood and now potentially, the auto industry union membership has actually steadily declined in recent years to just 10% of the workforce last year. That was an all-time low.But according to data from Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, strike activity actually increased last year. So what can we make of maybe smaller but mightier unions? We're joined now by Nathan Bomey, Axios business reporter and co-author of the Axios closer newsletter. And David Madland, Center for American Progress senior fellow and senior advisor at the American Worker Project. Guys, thanks so much for being here.Story continuesNathan, I want to start with you. Kind of set the scene for us here as to what we are hearing from the UAW and the sort of effect that could have.NATHAN BOMEY: Well, the UAW's newly-elected President, Shawn Fain, is a real firebrand, and he has come out swinging. He has basically said that the automakers are giving their executives exorbitant pay and compensation and that it's time for the workers to get some of that too. With about just a little over a week till the contract deadline expires, it looks like a strike is a real possibility.- OK, and so with that strike being a possibility, are we looking at an all out strike here or is this targeting specific plants or specific operations which then could still more largely impact other areas of the manufacturing process here?NATHAN BOMEY: So historically, the UAW will pick one automaker as a target, essentially to start the negotiations with them. And then if they can't reach a deal, they strike. And then eventually once they do reach a deal, then they use that as a pattern to negotiate with the other two.But this time, we are hearing there's a possibility of striking all three at the same time. Sean Fein at the UAW has not ruled that out. If that happens, we would see a serious bottleneck in the auto industry.- So to go from the specific questions here for Nathan to the sort of bigger question for David, what it feels like here is that we have these very sort of noisy work actions in the form of the UAW and the Hollywood writers and actors strikes. We've had a number of other actions involving the likes of Starbucks over the past couple of years, and yet we do see that union membership declining. So what are we to make of the current role of the union in American workers lives?DAVID MADLAND: You're hitting, I think, on a core reality that the desire for unions is sort of as high now as it's ever been. About 70% of the public support unions and about half of the public say they would like to join a union. But as you noted, union membership is sort of near the lowest it's ever been. And that's because unfortunately, our law makes it very, very hard for workers to join unions and allows companies lots of tools for union busting. And so we're seeing this great upsurge in activity. And whether it can change corporate behavior and change the law, I think is the real open question.- What is the perception among those represented by the unions as well? I mean, when you think about still the fees that they might have to pay in many of these instances, how has that perhaps moved their own discourse internally or among the workers being represented in one way or the other?DAVID MADLAND: Well, union members generally support their union because it leads to higher wages, better benefits, safer workplaces, and also protections from arbitrary dismissal and discrimination. And so even though some people don't like to pay the fees, even that-- because in many states, you need to pay a fee to join-- to receive the benefits of collective bargaining. But even in states where you don't, most people covered by a union contract still pay because they see the strong benefits that everyone really receives from union contracts.- Nathan, when we look at the case of the UAW in particular, like many other unions, it has seen membership decline, although it's also because the number of autoworkers broadly has declined in the US over the past few decades. But as you've done your reporting, I'm curious if you've gotten sort of a vibe from the union membership itself, not just leadership, about their sort of feelings around the whole situation.NATHAN BOMEY: Well, I think there are two aspects of this. First off, 97% of UAW members did vote to authorize a strike. So essentially, basically, all of the UAW membership is saying we're OK with the strike if you, our leadership, decides that we need one.However, on the other side, I think it's worth noting that there is a bit of a growing political disconnect between the members and the leadership because in the last two elections by the UAW's own admission, about one third of its members voted for Donald Trump. I think this was pretty unsettling for the UAW to realize in 2016 that a lot of its members weren't on the side of its historically progressive politics. And so the question for the UAW leadership is, can they maintain the support of those members when they're at the bargaining table with the automakers?- Right, OK. So for all of these industries over the course of the year, it's been largely different. And as of right now, it seems like based on what we've heard from the conference calls, even the earnings calls from companies in Ford and GM, they're expecting this to get done. But if it does not, what type of hit to production but additionally in terms of revenue as well are we expecting could eventually come forward, Nathan?NATHAN BOMEY: We're talking about a risk of potentially billions of dollars here, and that's why the automakers are very, very nervous. I think there's also the possibility of price increases if the contract negotiations end up with a deal that the automakers have to pass on the cost.Just saw an analyst report this morning that said that we could see higher costs of EVs. Maybe that's what's necessary to get the workers the pay that they deserve, but it is important to note what are going to be the consequences. I think that there's a wide agreement here that Tesla would be the winner if there's a big strike, also would be the winner if the automakers have to agree to huge pay increases because of course, Tesla is not unionized.One big question after this is all over is, when and if-- well, when and will the UAW start to take a crack at organizing Tesla again? They tried in the past, they failed. Will they try again? I think that's a really important thing to watch.]"

Cummins (CMI), Paccar (PCAR), Daimler (MBG.DE) have created a joint venture that will spend $2 to $3 billion to build a battery cell factory in a yet to be determined U.S. location. Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Pras Subramanian breaks down the deal and discusses the growing EV investments in the United States.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Well, three companies are partnering to bring battery cell production to the US. The joint venture is going to be dedicated to accelerating and localizing battery cell manufacturing to the states. To tell us more about this and who is involved, Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian is joining us. So who's partnering up here?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Hey, Julie. So it's basically Accelera, which is engine maker Cummins's zero emissions arm, partnering with Daimler Truck and US truck maker PACCAR, which is behind brands like Kenworth and Peterbilt. They're forming a joint venture to make battery cells for commercial vehicles and other industrial applications. The JV will make LFP-type batteries, which are cheaper and better for heavy use and shorter distances, perfect for short-haul trucking.So the companies say the total investment will be around $2 to $3 billion with a 21-gigawatt hours of annual output. The JV did not say, however, where they'll actually build this factory, though perhaps near a Cummins or PACCAR plant in the US. But I got to say, Julie, it's another win for the US and EV battery investment in this country.JULIE HYMAN: And similarly, we're also seeing automakers investing in EVs in the US. So how does this project then fit into that bigger picture?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: So earlier today, the BlueGreen Alliance, which is a foundation that tracks sort of clean energy investment in environmental issues, tabulated some data and found out that through the last couple of years, the amount of total EV investments in batteries and plants and things like that is $154 billion in total investment and leading to about 188,000 total new jobs across the country and in that growing battery belt in the center of the country. So top five companies in terms of spend are LG, Tesla, GM, Ford, and SK Innovation, which is the South Korean battery company. So a lot of big deals in this space, more investment coming. It is, like I said, a big win for the White House and also backers of manufacturing here in the US.Story continuesBRAD SMITH: And so who right now, just as the broader context here, is the battery leader and who is making the best effort to really try and cut into that market share?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: In terms of making the most batteries in the US or in investment, I would say it's LG. They have the biggest investment, around $17 billion so far in the US. And they make batteries for GM, Ford as well, just sort of across the board there. But you see more from Tesla, Panasonic, and also SK Innovation, which is Ford's big partner. They're going to build-- they're helping Ford build a big plant in Tennessee and Kentucky that's coming up probably next year.BRAD SMITH: All right, great insights as always. Pras, thank you so much for helping us break this down. Appreciate it.]"

In line with his commitment to bring environmentally friendly vehicles into the mainstream, Biden unveiled a significant financial commitment of $15.5 billion last Thursday.This incentive — aimed at retooling existing factories for electric vehicles (EVs) and battery production — is not just a nod to environmental concerns but also a strategic play to boost domestic manufacturing and job creation. In the wake of this funding announcement, you can power up your portfolio with stocks like General Motors GM, Ford F and Solid Power SLDP.Biden's $15.5B EV Incentive BreakdownThe $15.5 billion package is a mix of grants and loans, with a significant portion earmarked for the retooling of existing factories. Specifically, $2 billion in grants and up to $10 billion in loans will be available to support the conversion of automotive manufacturing projects, encompassing light-, medium-, and heavy-duty EVs. An additional $3.5 billion has been set aside to bolster domestic battery manufacturing for EVs and the national grid.This initiative is a lifeline for legacy automakers, many of whom have been grappling with the challenges of transitioning to EVs profitably. By focusing on the retooling of existing facilities, the administration is ensuring that these traditional players are not left behind in the EV revolution. Moreover, EV startups that have repurposed facilities previously dedicated to internal combustion engine vehicles could also stand to benefit.The investment into domestic EV and battery manufacturing aligns seamlessly with the Biden administration's commitment to bolstering the American manufacturing sector. The backdrop to this is the recent trend of onshoring battery manufacturing. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in global supply chains, particularly for critical battery materials predominantly sourced from China. The Inflation Reduction Act of August 2022 further catalyzed domestic manufacturing by offering a slew of incentives. All in all, the road ahead for the U.S. EV industry looks electrifying.Story continuesThe Booming EV ProspectsWhile overall U.S. vehicle sales were down year over year in 2022, EV sales managed to maintain momentum. More than 807,000 EVs were sold last year in the United States, accounting for 5.8% of total vehicle sales, up from 3.2% in 2021. Per Statista, EV sales in the United States are expected to reach 2.46 million units by 2028. Revenues are expected to witness a CAGR of around 18.17% between 2023 and 2028, resulting in a projected market volume of $161.6 billion by 2028.Legacy automakers are revving up their e-mobility game and are setting deadlines to phase out ICE models. Pure-play EV makers are also focused on expanding their vehicle lineup. The pursuit of EV dominance is only expected to intensify in the coming years as major automakers, startups and pure EV companies all work toward the development of eco-friendly vehicles.Potential BeneficiariesIt goes without saying that investors get a massive opportunity to reap tremendous gains from the industry’s growth trajectory. The Biden administration's $15.5 billion offer is a testament to the U.S. government's commitment to the EV transition. Legacy automakers like Ford, General Motors and Stellantis among others, which have a significant manufacturing footprint in the United States, could leverage this funding to expedite their EV transition. EV startups like Rivian, which has repurposed traditional automotive facilities, might also find the funding beneficial in scaling up production. With a clear focus on domestic battery production, companies like Tesla (with its Gigafactory) and other battery-focused firms stand to gain. As the nation aims to reduce its dependency on foreign battery materials, companies involved in the domestic sourcing and processing of these materials could also see a boost.Stocks to TrackGeneral Motors, one of the world’s biggest automakers,held the largest share of the U.S. auto market at 16% in 2022.General Motors’ massive EV push is commendable. The automaker — currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) — plans to roll out 30 fresh EV models by 2025-end. This year, it will have nine EV models in the North America market.Solid demand for GMC Hummer EV, Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV, Cadillac crossover EV, Equinox EV, Silverdo EV, Sierra EV, Blazer EV and BrightDrop Zevo 600 is expected to buoy top-line growth. The firm’s modular battery platform, the Ultium Drive system, is aiding the transition to an all-electric portfolio. GM’s battery plants in Ohio, Tennessee and Lansing are likely to scale up its e-mobility prowess. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GM’s 2023 sales implies year-over-year growth of 9.3%.Ford, GM’s crosstown rival, is also making impressive strides in the EV domain. Mustang Mach-E is already the second best-selling electric SUV in the United States and is boosting Ford’s sales. Deliveries of E-Transit vans and F-150 e-pickups boost shipment prospects further. The company remains on track to reach an annualized EV production capacity of 600,000 units globally by the end of this year.Its production target of more than 2 million EVs by 2026-end (representing 49% CAGR over the span of 2023-2026) augurs well for long-term growth. By 2030, Ford expects EVs to account for 50% of its global sales, which will cement its position in the red-hot EV landscape. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for F’s 2023 sales implies year-over-year growth of 7.5%. F currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Solid Power, which designs solid-state battery technology, made its public debut in December 2021. The company’s strategy involves licensing its designs or supplying its solid electrolyte to other battery manufacturers for production. An additional advantage lies in its compatibility with existing technologies, expediting its route to market. With ambitious plans to commence large-scale electrolyte production in 2024, scaling up to 40,000 metric tons by 2028, Solid Power aims to support the production of approximately 800,000 EVs annually. With the backing of industry giants Ford and BMW AG, the company is poised to secure a robust customer base if it can adhere to its ambitious timeline. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SLDP’s 2023 sales implies year-over-year growth of 49%.

Alaska Air (ALK), United (UAL), and Southwest Airlines (LUV) warn of rising jet fuel costs impacting ticket prices. Lastly, Overstock (OSTK) shares dive on its revenues tied to the relaunch of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's website.Yahoo Finance Live examines several stocks making significant moves after Wednesday's closing bell.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: AMC shares are selling off after announcing plans to sell up to 40 million shares. The company saying that it plans to use the proceeds to bolster liquidity, to repay, refinance, redeem or repurchase its existing indebtedness here, and general corporate purposes. Well, AMC was widely expected to do this after the court ruled last month that it was allowed to convert preferred stock into common stock.And, Akiko, AMC, the moves are so dramatic, a lot just talk about what the company needs to do to write this business. Clearly this has been a meme stock, a retail trader favorite now for a number of years. But when you take a look at the actual business of AMC, movie theaters, getting people back into the theaters to watch movies.It's not only dealing with the fact that it has not recovered from some of the pre-pandemic levels, but then also coupling that with the Hollywood strike that's going on right now. And the fact that we're already seeing some studios push out releases to 2024. It's certainly a very tough time for AMC.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, Seana, tough to say how much of AMC's stock actually trades on the fundamentals, but you're right. I mean, at the end of the day, the fundamentals are not good for AMC. They haven't gotten back to pre-pandemic levels in terms of getting people back into the theaters. You've got the Hollywood strike, that means less of a pipeline in terms of movies coming up.And then at the end of the day, AMC just hasn't had a turnaround strategy in place. So much of this is about riding the meme wave. You look at where the company is right now, $9.5 billion in debt and lease obligations. So that's at least according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Story continuesBut this is a company that's really struggled to find its footing in terms of its fundamentals and where they need to go to really change the strategy in the face of what we have seen in terms of attendance in theaters.Well, taking a look at some of the airlines, as United, Southwest, and Alaska Air are sounding the alarm about higher jet fuel costs in the third quarter amid rising crude oil prices. Southwest now expects fuel costs between $2.70 to $2.80 per gallon during the third quarter. That's compared to prior estimates of 2.55 to 2.65. The airline said, overall leisure demand and yields continue to remain healthy.And this comes, Seana, as we've talked about, this peak travel where travelers are willing to shell out those high ticket prices. And this has got to be a headwind for the company. But I will say, when you think about where oil prices were last year because they were very elevated, ticket prices going up. They haven't necessarily come down since.And so you have to wonder what this means for the airlines who are riding this wave of consumers really wanting to go not just domestic travel, but international travel as well. Does this mean they have to raise prices even more or just keep it at where they were when prices were at the peak last year?SEANA SMITH: Yeah, exactly. And then also what customers, what consumers are going to do if they're going to be willing to pay those higher prices, if in fact, airlines do decide to hike prices because we've already talked about the fact that maybe we could potentially start to see a bit of a cooling here. We're coming out of the summer season.Yes, travel demand was very strong. We heard that from most of the airlines in their most recent reports. But heading into the fall season, we know that many of these airlines are not going to be able to charge the prices that we saw during the summer. Now adding in higher fuel prices obviously a headwind here for so many of these companies.United, which has arguably been amongst the best position just given the exposure that they have to international travel and the pent up demand for people to travel internationally over the last several months.But United, also one of those ones saying that they expect fuel costs now to come in 2.95 to 3.05 per gallon, which was much higher than expected. So we'll see what the airlines end up doing with this, if they do in fact hike their ticket fares and then what that demand picture looks like.All right, let's also take a look at Overstock taking a big hit today. The stock off-- wow, look at that. Just about 23% after reporting declining revenue at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Overstock bought the intellectual property assets of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond in June and relaunched the website on August 1st. There was a bit of good news in this update, though. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is adding customers. And now have just around more than 4.8 million.But declining revenue here, at least in terms of sales over the last several weeks since that relaunch on August 1st, they're seeing a decline in just about the mid teens for revenue on a year over year basis. Average order value falling in the high teens, percentage base from a year ago levels. A lot of this, at least from an analysts perspective is because of the higher promotional activity.They're doing everything they can to expand their customer base. And obviously, at least for right now, their sales their revenue taking a bit of a hit.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, I mean, just because Overstock took over those assets, doesn't necessarily mean, there's an immediate bump, right? At the end of the day, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond went the way that it did because it was really struggling with the stores in being able to come up with attractive products and attractive value as well.So Overstock really taking on that problem themselves as well. I mean, you could argue, it hasn't been very long since this all happened, so it's still need a little more time. But it really points to the massive task that they have in trying to turn around these assets because it has been many years in the making.SEANA SMITH: And, yeah, certainly. It looks like it's going to be potentially a long road ahead.]"

Buttigieg also weighed in on the looming government shutdown, saying it ""would be a mess for the U.S. economy.""Click here for more of Yahoo Finance's coverage from the Goldman Sachs Communacopia tech conference.Video TranscriptBRIAN SOZZI: Mr. Secretary, always nice to get some time with you here. So we're done with the summer. We're getting ready into the fall travel season. But before we even start our fall travel, we had news this week about United Airlines having trouble, or computer glitches, or whatever it might have happened. There have you talked to United Airlines, and do you think that is indicative of airlines underinvesting in their platforms?PETE BUTTIGIEG: Well, you never want to generalize too much from one case, but, you know, this is not the first time this year that we've heard about technology issue. The issue that we saw earlier at Southwest Airlines. We had an issue with the FAA. So clearly in terms of keeping the aviation system operating smoothly with the pressure that it's under, there's going to need to be continued attention to technology.I did speak to the United Airlines' CEO yesterday as the situation was developing. They were able to get on top of it pretty quickly and get service back to normal. But certainly, I think it points to the role that technology increasingly plays not just on board technology and, of course, we spend a lot of attention here at the department certifying and looking after the safety of aircraft technology itself. But everything around that from dispatch systems that airlines use for their operations to the various communication systems that the FAA uses for hours.Story continuesAnd of course, across all of that our top priority is always going to be safety. And then once safety is seen to, then you got to make sure that the operations are looked after. But the good news is overall, you look across the Labor Day weekend at the end of a summer that saw an all-time record high in terms of the number of Americans getting onto airplanes. We saw less than 1% of flights canceled, less than 2% of flights delayed. We're not satisfied or sitting back resting comfortably, but very encouraged by the results that we saw that holiday weekend, and generally speaking, over the course of the summer.BRIAN SOZZI: These tech delays, Mr. Secretary, that seemingly come out of nowhere, should flyers just expect these things to happen this fall and even into next year as technology plays a greater role in our lives?PETE BUTTIGIEG: Well, the big thing I want flyers to know is that when there's a situation that an airline is responsible for, and certainly a mechanical failure or an IT failure, delaying or canceling your flight is an example of that. You have recourse. We are enforcing customer service agreements that are dramatically improved compared to where they were just a year and a half ago after everything passengers went through last summer and the pressure that we put on airlines.So we're encouraging passengers to go to flightrights.gov so you understand if you do get stuck in a situation like that an airline is responsible for, what you can expect and what you can be guaranteed in terms of coverage for how you get rebooked having your expenses covered while you're on the ground meals, hotels, that kind of thing. The best scenario, of course, is for that kind of disruption not to happen in the first place. When it does happen, we want to make sure passengers know that our department has your back.BRIAN SOZZI: ""The New York Times"" recently reported, Mr. Secretary, close calls or an increasing number of close calls on the tarmac. Why do you think this is happening? You know, we haven't had a major aviation disaster in some time, but I think consumers seeing these stories are like, wow, what's going on here, and what could be done to prevent something catastrophic from happening?PETE BUTTIGIEG: Well, a lot goes into maintaining the safety record of our airspace. We have the safest, most complex aviation system in the world. Amazingly, flying is actually the safest form of travel by far in the United States. But we don't take that for granted or sit back with that, which is why now even a situation that was out of the norm, let alone an actual incident, is going to get the kind of attention that used to be reserved for when there was an actual collision in the past-- something that hasn't happened in over a decade in the United States. And again, lots of work goes into keeping it that way.Keeping it that way for the future includes making sure we have the right kind of technology. It means making sure that there is the right kind of training and attention we're pushing a lot right now on situational awareness, communications, sterile cockpits, good hygiene that everybody whether in the tower or in the flight deck needs to maintain.The other thing I would add is that what would not help us in the progress we're making right now is a government shutdown. You know, this is a very good and important example of why non-defense spending in the federal budget is very important. If we went through a shutdown, a lot of the progress that we have been making on building up air traffic control staffing and readiness and training would be stopped in its tracks.We would lose the momentum that we've gained over recent weeks and months, and it would send us in the wrong direction. So one of many-- many reasons we're looking to Congress to do what it takes to fund the FAA, fund the government, and keep things moving.BRIAN SOZZI: There has been some chatter on the other side of the aisle-- the Republican side-- maybe they should push for a government shutdown. Just from your vantage point, how terrible would that be for the US economy? You're talking about, you know, flights being ground to a halt potentially, and a lot of other things that could be really damaging.PETE BUTTIGIEG: Look, this would be a mess for the US economy. Even if they keep the bare minimum up and running in terms of having the air traffic control towers open, we would lose the trainees who are part of the operation there. A shutdown even lasting a few days or a week could set us back by months in terms of the training pipeline for controllers because everything that goes into building that kind of experience and keeping it current.So you look at aviation, which is in the neighborhood of 5% of our GDP, that alone would be dealt a really serious blow to the momentum that we've been seeing from a shutdown. It's one of many, many examples why this is not-- you know, they're playing with live fire here. This is not theoretical. This is not academic. This is direct damage to the US economy that can and, in our view, must be avoided and be prevented.I don't think there's any justification for playing political games with something as important to our economy and as important to our economic and national security as keeping the federal government up and running and serving the American people.BRIAN SOZZI: And lastly, Mr. Secretary, I know this doesn't fall under your direct purview, but we're at a pretty interesting moment in the UAW negotiations with the major automakers. If an agreement isn't reached and these workers go on strike, maybe that's one less car produced, maybe one person won't be able to get to work, what do you think that does to our economy, and does it feel like a very big moment for the labor movement in this country?PETE BUTTIGIEG: I think the moment you're seeing with the labor movement is a recognition that there are big changes and developments coming to the auto industry, and the UAW wants to make sure that workers benefit from those changes. Look, I grew up in a town that was shaped not just by the auto industry generally, but by the achievements of the UAW specifically, were the hometown to Local 5 and Local 9 back in South Bend.And so I've seen directly how the middle class and the prosperity of whole communities is shaped by the ability of autoworkers to get a fair share of the wealth that they create. Now, of course, they need to be at the table working with the auto companies that have a business to run and need to make sure that that sector succeeds.And so our role has been engaging the parties and urging them to come to a negotiated solution that spares the American economy the impact of a strike, and that also ensures that workers do right by the extraordinary opportunity in front of us. You Know, not that long ago, a few years ago, we were talking about a manufacturing recession here in the United States.Now, we're seeing a manufacturing job boom. I was just back in Indiana, where I grew up, and drove the road from South Bend to Indianapolis past a massive facility under construction outside of Kokomo that is just one example of the auto supply chain and industry construction and development happening right now. We need to make sure we keep the momentum for that economic manufacturing growth. And as the UAW is seeking to ensure, have that development happen in a way that benefits American workers.BRIAN SOZZI: Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, always great to get some time with you. Thank you for talking about a lot of really important issues with Yahoo Finance all the time. Thank you so much.PETE BUTTIGIEG: Same here. Always good to be with you. Thanks]"

Almost half (47%) are highly optimistic about the local economy, compared to 29% last fall. About a third (34%) are highly optimistic about the national economy compared to 22% a year ago.Also, profit and demand expectations are higher with 55% expecting profits to rise (compared to 46% last fall) and 64% expecting an increase in demand in the next six months (compared to 57% a year ago). Expectations for sales are similar to the spring survey, with 62% expecting an increase. Nearly two-thirds (65%) attribute their greater optimism for their business to confidence in their ability to run it.""While the large spike in optimism among these business owners is a surprise, it can be attributed in part to the resilience that they demonstrated during the challenging years they have faced since the pandemic began,"" PNC Chief Economist Gus Faucher said. ""Business owners who survived that demanding time are confident in their ability to run their businesses and focus on what they can control versus what they can't.""Story continuesHiring remains a challenge, however. Nine in 10 employers say they intend to hold steady on hiring with just 9% planning to increase their staffing and just 1% expecting layoffs. Among businesses looking to hire employees, one in three (35%) say it's become harder to hire qualified employees over the past six months, similar to last spring (36%) and a year ago (39%). The most common reason employers say it has become harder to hire is that there are not enough applicants overall (49%). Other reasons cited are candidates' lack of experience or skills (22%), high salary/benefit requirements (14%), and inability to meet legal/security requirements (6%).""It is interesting to note that while hiring is a concern of business owners, half of employers have seen an increase in employee enthusiasm for their work over the past year. This means the people they already have are clearly engaged,"" Faucher said.As inflation has eased over the last year, so have owners' expectations on raising prices. More than half (55%) of businesses say they expect to increase prices in the next six months, unchanged from last spring but significantly fewer than a year ago (63%).Main justifications for increasing customer prices have shifted somewhat. Favorable market conditions top the list (38%), but a growing number identify keeping up with rising labor costs (32% vs. 21% last spring). Nearly three in 10 (29%) report raising prices to keep up with rising non-labor costs.Fewer expect their price increases to be 5% or more as compared to last fall (25% vs. 36% in fall 2022) while 56% are expecting a more moderate raise of 3% to 4%, significantly up from a year ago (38%).The steady drumbeat of Federal Reserve rate hikes over the past year has caught the attention of business owners. Two-thirds (65%) of respondents expect Fed rate hikes to have an effect on their business over the next year, including 31% who say they anticipate rate increases will put pressure on profits.Other findings in the survey include:Seeking Artificial Intelligence: One in three business owners (33%) believe Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications could be useful to their business. AI relevance is highest for manufacturing businesses (47%). Among those who consider AI useful, more than four in 10 (44%) are already using AI applications, while 45% are evaluating or planning to implement applications in the next year or two.Employee Strategies: One in three business owners (33%) expect to increase employee compensation, up from 24% in the spring but fewer than last fall (40%). More than four in 10 employers (43%) report increased compensation requirements among their workforce and 38% say the need for flexible hours or remote work has increased. Employers are taking a variety of measures to attract and retain employees: 35% have standardized flexible work options; 27% have changed benefit packages and 23% have standardized their hiring, promotion or compensation practices.Flexibility Remains Top of Mind: Two-thirds (67%) of employers say flexible work arrangements are important to the business. Among those who have standardized flexible work options and consider flexible work arrangements important to their business, 60% say it helps attract and retain employees and 38% believe their policies enhance the reputation of the business.Supply Chain Concerns Abate: Business leaders' top concern for their business in the next six months has shifted from supply chain disruptions to costs. Nearly a quarter (23%) are most concerned about the cost of materials, up from 9% last fall, while 14% are most concerned about labor costs, up from 4% last fall. The portion worried about supply chain disruptions dropped to 10% from 25% last fall. More than four in 10 (43%) of construction firms say material costs are their top concern.Full national and regional survey results are available at pnc.mediaroom.com.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

It would be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.It did not disclose the possible financial terms of a deal and said definitive terms would be set out in a further announcement. Any deal would be subject to shareholder approval, due diligence and regulatory approval, it said.WestRock shareholders would receive shares in the combined group, Smurfit Kappa said. Smurfit Kappa's Irish-listed shares were down 2.16% at 0900 GMT.U.S.-listed shares of WestRock rose 6.6% in trading before the bell.Smurfit, which operates in 22 European countries and 13 in South, Central and North America, is Europe's largest paper and packaging producer. WestRock is the second largest packaging company in the U.S.At current market prices, the combined market capital of the two firms would be around $19 billion. They had combined revenue of $34 billion in the 12 months to the end of June.Research analysts at Credit Suisse said the proposed combination had significant strategic and operational merits and strengthens the company's Americas presence, especially in faster-growing Central America.The merger would be ""a good cultural fit"" with a strong focus on an innovation-driven expansion of the group's sustainable packaging business, they said in a research note.The combined entity, which would have around 100,000 employees, could log pre-tax cost savings of more than $400 million on an annual run-rate basis at the end of the first year following the completion of the deal, said Smurfit.The tie-up would require one-off cash costs of approximately $235 million, it added.Story continuesThe deal would offer ""complementary portfolios with unique product diversity and innovative sustainability capabilities, with breadth and depth across renewable, recyclable and biodegradable packaging solutions"", the Smurfit statement said.COVID HANGOVERThe Irish firm has benefited from a boom in demand for packaging goods and e-commerce during COVID-19 lockdowns, but suffered a setback when economies reopened and producers started cutting back packaging stocks.Last month it reported a fall in first-half core profit as it struggled to offset a year-on-year decline in volumes.WestRock beat Wall Street expectations for third-quarter profit and said it remained focused on streamlining its portfolio and further reducing costs.The merger, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, would be effected though an Irish scheme of arrangement involving Smurfit Kappa and a merger of a subsidiary with WestRock, Smurfit said.Smurfit would de-list from Euronext Dublin and cancel its premium listing on the London Stock Exchange under the deal, the statement said. Its North and South American operations would be headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia.($1 = 0.9326 euros) (Reporting by Kanjyik Ghosh and Pratyush Thakur in Bengaluru and Conor Humphries in Dublin, Additional reporting by Savyata Mishra; Editing by Shailesh Kuber, Dhanya Ann Thoppil and Jan Harvey)]"

IP, Smurfit Kappa Group plc SMFKY, WestRock Co. WRK and Sappi SPPJY.Industry: Paper ProductsLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2144879/4-paper-and-related-products-stocks-countering-industry-headwindsOf late, the Zacks Paper and Related Products industry has been impacted by weak packaging demand, as customer spending has been muted due to inflationary pressures. Nevertheless, increasing packaging requirements due to the rising trend in e-commerce activities and steady demand from consumer-oriented end markets, such as food and beverages and healthcare, will support the industry. The growing preference for paper as a sustainable and eco-friendly packaging option due to environmental concerns will act as a key driver for the industry.Players like International Paper Co., Smurfit Kappa Group plc, WestRock Co. and Sappi are likely to gain from the above-mentioned trends.About the IndustryThe Zacks Paper and Related Products industry comprises companies that manufacture and sell paper and paper products. The industry is highly diversified in terms of products ranging from graphic paper and packaging paper to absorbent hygiene products. Graphic papers, which include printing and writing papers, and newsprint, are utilized for communication purposes.The industry provides packaging solutions for liquid, food, pharmaceutical, beauty, household, commercial and industrial products. It also produces fluff and specialty pulps utilized in absorbent hygiene products, tissues and paper products. The industry caters to a wide array of industries, including food and beverage, farming, home and personal care, health, retail, e-commerce and transport. The industry players meet customers' shipping, storage and display requirements with sustainable solutions.Major Trends Shaping the Future of the Paper and Related Products IndustryLow Consumer Spending, High Costs Are Near-Term Woes: The current inflationary pressures have been impacting consumers, leading to a lower demand for goods. This has impacted packaging demand as consumer priorities have shifted toward non-discretionary goods and services. Customers have been trying to lower their elevated inventories, impacting packaging demand.Story continuesThe companies in the industry had to cut down production levels to align with customer demand. Moreover, the industry is witnessing rising costs of transportation, chemical and fuel, and supply-chain headwinds. Thus, industry players are increasingly focusing on pricing actions and cost reduction, and resorting to automation in manufacturing to boost productivity and efficiency.Digitization Hurts Paper Demand: The transition to digital media has been eroding the graphic paper market for some time now. The same remains a persistent threat to the industry. Paperless communication, the increased use of email, less print advertising, more electronic billing and fewer catalogs dented graphic paper demand. Consequently, the industry is resorting to machine conversions into packaging and specialty papers. Paper consumption in schools, offices and businesses took a hit from the pandemic-led shutdowns. However, the demand picked up on the reopening of schools and offices.E-commerce &amp; Consumer Products to Support Packaging Demand: The industry's considerable exposure to consumer-oriented end markets, including food and beverages, and healthcare, ensures steady growth in earnings. With e-commerce, packaging gained the utmost importance as it has to maintain the integrity of the product and be durable to withstand the complexity involved in delivering the product.Per Statista, global e-commerce revenues are projected to witness a CAGR of 11.2% from 2023 to 2027, representing a major growth opportunity for the industry. In 2022, e-commerce accounted for nearly 19% of retail sales worldwide and is expected to be 25 by 2027. India is expected to lead retail e-commerce development, seeing a CAGR of 14.11% between 2023 and 2027, closely followed by Brazil, Argentina and Turkey, with growth of 14.07%, 13.63% and 13.57%, respectively.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Paper and Related Products industry is a 12-stock group within the broader Basic Materials sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #236, which places it in the bottom 5% of the 249 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak prospects in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group's earnings growth potential. Year to date, the industry's earnings estimates for 2023 have moved down 13%, and the same for 2024 has declined 35%.Before we present a few Paper and Related Products stocks that investors can consider, it is worth looking at the industry's stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Versus Broader MarketThe Paper and Related Products industry has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 and the sector over the past year.

Continued global demand for its comfort technology footwear is also yielding results.Markedly, shares of this footwear leader have appreciated 33.9% against the industry’s 0.5% drop in the past year.

Investments made to integrate store and digital ecosystems for developing a seamless omnichannel experience are likely to drive greater sales. The company has updated its point-of-sale systems to better engage with customers, both offline and online. Initiatives such as “Buy Online, Pick-Up in Store” and “Buy Online, Pickup at Curbside” are worth mentioning.The company has concluded the acquisition of its long-term Scandinavia distributor. We note that the acquisition of its long-term Scandinavia distributor has helped Skechers to build its brand in the Nordic region with stores and e-commerce platforms, and a network of wholesale customers in Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Norway.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchManagement also remains focused on store expansion.

Management expects the acquisition of the Scandinavia distributor deal to be slightly accretive to earnings in 2023. The company looks forward to achieving its goal of $10 billion in annual sales by 2026.Analysts seem optimistic about the stock.

The three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — were down 2.4%, 1.8% and 2.2%, respectively. The Dow posted its worst month since May, the S&amp;P 500 saw the worst monthly performance since February and the Nasdaq Composite recorded its worst month since November 2022. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite terminated a five-month win streak.Last month, U.S. stock markets faced major setbacks for the first time in 2023. Market participants remain worried about how markets will behave this month. September is historically the worst-performing month on Wall Street. In the absence of earnings results, the Fed's September FOMC meeting will be the key focal point this month.In this regard, investors are hopeful that a series of recently released weak economic data may act as a barrier for the central bank to hike interest rates further. Maintenance of the interest rate status quo may ensure a northbound journey for Wall Street.U.S. Economy Seems to be CoolingThe Department of Labor reported that nonfarm payrolls in August came in at 187,000, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 173,000. However, the data for July was revised downward by 30,000 to 157,000. The data for June was also revised downward by 80,000 to 105,000, marking it the smallest monthly gain since December 2020. The unemployment rate climbed to 3.8% in August from 3.5% in July. The consensus estimate was 3.6%. August marked the highest monthly unemployment rate since February 2022. Average hourly wage rate rose 0.2% in August compared with 0.4% in July. The consensus estimate was 0.3%. Year over year, the wage rate increased 4.3% in August, below the consensus estimate of 4.4%.Story continuesThe ADP private sector job data for August, and the Job Opening and Labor Turnover Survey of July also indicated that the labor market is cooling. Moreover, second-quarter 2023 U.S. GDP growth rate was revised downward to 2.1% from 2.4% reported earlier.The Conference Board and the University of Michigan reported, respectively, that the consumer confidence index and consumer sentiment index fell sharply in August as consumers remained worried about the prolonged high inflation rate and a lesser number of job openings.The core PCE price Index — the Fed's most favorite inflation gauge — increased 0.2% month over month and 4.2% year-over-year in July. Both data were lower than the consensus estimates.Buoyed by the above-mentioned weak economic data, the CME FedWatch tool is currently showing 93% probability that the Fed will keep the range of interest rate unchanged in the September FOMC meeting. There is a 7% chance that the rate will be hiked by 25 basis points. Notably, the existing range of 5.25-5.5%, is the highest since 2001.At this stage, growth stocks are likely to outperform markets in September as the Fed is unlikely to raise interest rates further and the fear of a near-term recession has reduced to a great extent.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five growth stocks that have solid upside left for the rest of 2023.

Defensive utilities was the only gainer, up 0.1%.Story continuesApple was the biggest drag across the three major indexes, down 3.7% after a report that China had banned officials at central government agencies from using iPhones and other foreign-branded devices for work.Other megacaps also declined, with Tesla, Amazon.com and Nvidia down between 1.6% and 3.8% as yields on the 10-year and the two-year U.S. Treasuries moved higher after the economic data.The S&amp;P 500 barely reacted after the Fed's ""Beige Book"" snapshot of the U.S. economy was released, a week ahead of the keenly awaited August inflation data and the Fed's rate decision on Sept. 20.The report showed ""modest"" U.S. economic growth in recent weeks while job growth was ""subdued,"" and inflation slowed in most parts of the country.A recent uptick in oil prices has also stoked fears of persistent inflationary pressures that could compel the Federal Reserve to maintain its hawkish stance on interest rates.Lockheed Martin dropped 4.5% after the U.S. weapons maker trimmed the delivery outlook for its F-35 jets.Roku climbed 1.9% after the video-streaming company said it would reduce its workforce by about 10% and limit new hiring.Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 2.38-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.10-to-1 ratio favored decliners.The S&amp;P 500 posted 3 new 52-week highs and 25 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 33 new highs and 146 new lows.

Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Accordingly, News investors that purchase the stock on or after the 12th of September will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 11th of October.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.10 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$0.20 per share to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that News has a trailing yield of 0.9% on the current share price of $21.21. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether News's dividend is reliable and sustainable. As a result, readers should always check whether News has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. View our latest analysis for News Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Its dividend payout ratio is 77% of profit, which means the company is paying out a majority of its earnings. The relatively limited profit reinvestment could slow the rate of future earnings growth. We'd be concerned if earnings began to decline. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. The good news is it paid out just 20% of its free cash flow in the last year.It's positive to see that News's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. It's encouraging to see News has grown its earnings rapidly, up 58% a year for the past five years. The company is paying out more than three-quarters of its earnings, but it is also generating strong earnings growth.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. News's dividend payments are broadly unchanged compared to where they were eight years ago.Final TakeawayShould investors buy News for the upcoming dividend? We like News's growing earnings per share and the fact that - while its payout ratio is around average - it paid out a lower percentage of its cash flow. News looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. To help with this, we've discovered 3 warning signs for News that you should be aware of before investing in their shares.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

To help consumers better understand their home's potential value, Realtor.com® today announced the addition of potential short-term rental income estimates from Airbnb in their My Home dashboard. This first-of-its-kind integration empowers homeowners with possible earnings estimates for hosting one room or their whole house.Among those surveyed, 23% of homeowners have rented out their home before or plan to rent part of their home out in the future, and 16% would consider it. Their reasons to rent are largely financial, with one-third (34%) of those renting or planning to rent out their home doing so to save money for a home purchase with a higher mortgage rate, to prepare for potential upswings in a variable mortgage (29%), or to help pay their current mortgage (21%).Whether looking to rent their home out and earn extra money while away on vacation, or renting out an extra room to help with mortgage payments, homeowners can now easily access information about how much they can potentially earn by hosting their space on Airbnb in the Realtor.com® My Home dashboard.Uncovering the short-term rental earning potential of a home can also help homeowners evaluate if it's a good idea to rent out their current home as an alternative to selling it. Looking to the future, 60% of surveyed homeowners would consider renting out their current home rather than selling if/when they look to buy or rent somewhere else. Most cited financial reasons as the motivator: 21% saying it'd be great to have extra income from a renter, and 19% would do so to maintain the home equity they've already built.Story continuesTo get started with the tool, homeowners can simply input their address in the Realtor.com® My Home dashboard to claim their home. They can then view their potential earnings from hosting on Airbnb in the Host or Rent tab of the dashboard. The interactive tool can be adjusted for renting a private room or all of the home; estimated earnings for a seven-day rental are based on Airbnb data from similar listings in the ZIP code.""Short-term rentals are a great way to help with some of the costs of homeownership – renting out their house for a couple days or weeks out of the year when it's not in use could generate  extra income that can be put toward the mortgage, maintenance, or even help cover the cost of a vacation,"" said Mausam Bhatt, chief product officer, Realtor.com®. ""By arming homeowners with information about how much they could potentially make by renting a room or their whole home on Airbnb, Realtor.com® is helping them better understand their options and in turn make more informed decisions about their home.""The Airbnb integration will make the Realtor.com® My Home dashboard even more valuable for current homeowners who can also manage their home's details, track their home's value with up to three valuation estimates, explore their equity and discover how their home compares to others nearby, as well as see recently sold homes in their area and compare top local real estate agents.The ability to host and a homeowners' actual earnings will depend on local laws, availability, rental price, and demand in their area. The earnings estimates aren't a valuation or appraisal of your home.

As part of the $97.9 million additional investment in the Lone Star state, Verizon engineers have been busy at work adding capacity, coverage and upgrading service in Austin, TX.“We know how critical reliable, consistent, high-performing wireless connectivity is, and we are working hard to deliver the highest quality service possible to Austin,” said Phillip French, Vice President of Engineering and Operations for Verizon. “Our teams are committed in Austin and across Texas, where we’re seeing tremendous growth, to out-work our competitors every day in order to meet our promise to our customers.”In 2023, Verizon engineers in Austin have turned on 11 new macro cell sites (large coverage cell sites) and 91 new small cell sites, adding capacity and coverage in Pflugerville, Georgetown, Leander, Buda, Circle C and The Domain areas. And they are not slowing down. Sixteen additional macro cell sites will be coming online in the next few months which will add capacity and coverage to Del Valle, Georgetown, Bee Cave, East Austin, Creedmore, Leander, NW Austin, Mueller, East Kyle, Austin Executive Airport, and Pflugerville.Along with these new cell sites, Verizon engineers have been dramatically expanding access to 5G service throughout Austin using Verizon’s newly acquired C-band spectrum. As of last month, Austin residents and visitors are now able to use a full 140 MHz of spectrum, more than doubling the 5G bandwidth available to serve customers throughout Austin. This allows Verizon to more quickly expand and enhance its 5G Ultra Wideband network, providing much greater capacity to accommodate more customers and more robust services, as well as enable higher data speeds. This additional spectrum will also allow Verizon to offer 5G Home broadband and Business Internet services to more customers throughout Austin.Story continuesThe Moody Center, home to many legendary concerts, performances and sporting events has also recently gotten an upgrade. The Center has been modernized with a Verizon managed Distributed Antenna System (DAS), a wireless network of antennas throughout the arena allowing for better performance and greater capacity to accommodate fans’ needs. The speeds and capacity provided by this state-of-the-art system rivals any NBA Arena.Lastly, the addition of 5G service and the many additional wireless solutions allow far more data to travel on the wireless network in McAllen. That exponential increase in data carried into and out of the cell sites serving the community requires upgraded fiber optic cable links. Fiber optic cables are used to move data between cell sites and connect those sites to the rest of the network. Verizon has increased the capacity on the fiber connections in many cell sites in the McAllen area so they can carry 10 times the amount of data.MEDIA CONTACT:Karen Schulz864.561.1527Karen.schulz@verizonwireless.com]"

I know – it’s not the most pleasant of topics. As well, you’re going to want to apply caution with this fall stock clean-up list. It can be an astute warning or a clown show.Still, I think there’s good reason to consider exiting stocks losing momentum in the fall. For one thing, the broader market performance has been rather choppy over the past month. Given that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged that there’s significant work to be done to tame inflation, more volatility may be on the horizon.Second, it’s obvious that consumers are hurting. From the record credit card debt in the U.S. that exceeded $1 trillion to major retailers warning about fading consumer confidence, folks don’t need to look far for an excuse to red flag stocks to avoid in Autumn. Plus, we’ve had such a great run, which may mean it’s time for a correction. With that, below are end-of-summer stock sales to consider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPeloton (PTON)Peloton (PTON stock) sign on city storefrontSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comForgive me for attacking the low-hanging fruit but I think it’s time to fade away from Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON). A few days ago, the exercise bike manufacturer released its results for its fiscal fourth quarter. While the print was mixed – missing against expected losses but beating analysts’ revenue target – management also admitted that the churn (attrition rate) associated with its bike recall was greater than anticipated.But does a mixed earnings print and some bad news warrant inclusion on a list of stocks to sell in Autumn? Yes, it does, especially if the ones selling are the insiders. Before you send me hate mail, you should realize that per Fintel data, the number of insider purchases of PTON stock amounted to 102 transactions. However, the number of sales clocked in at 711.Story continuesPlus, the most recent insider buy occurred on May 25, 2021. True, analysts have an average $7.80 price target that implies a robust double-digit upside. Still, with a breakdown of five buys, 10 holds, and one sell, PTON is one of the fall stock clean-up names.Apartment Investment &amp; Management (AIV)Real estate investment trust REIT on an office desk.Source: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / ShutterstockAs a real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on its namesake industry, Apartment Investment &amp; Management (NYSE:AIV) might seem a compelling idea on the surface. However, I believe AIV belongs on your radar for stocks to sell in Autumn.Sure, on a cynical level, those who missed out on the post-pandemic housing boom – of which there were many – are now forced to be renters. Subsequently, companies like Apartment Investment &amp; Management (better known as Aimco) can take advantage. Certainly, jacked-up rents have sparked outrage but folks have to live somewhere.However, the reason why AIV ranks among the stocks losing momentum in the fall may center on declining average daily occupancy rates. Basically, you can only milk your tenants for so much before they crack. And broader evidence suggests we may be approaching that breaking point. Tellingly, only one analyst – Andrew Rosivach from Wolfe Research – presently covers AIV stock. Further, the rating is a “hold” without a price target. Still, if you read between the economic lines, you may come away believing AIV is one of the stocks to avoid in autumn.Mullen Automotive (MULN)The Mullen (MULN) Five vehicle is displayed at the 2021 LA Auto Show media day in Los Angeles, November, 18, 2021.Source: Ringo Chiu / Shutterstock.comI’m about to get massacred (digitally speaking of course) when mentioning electric vehicle manufacturer Mullen Automotive (NASDAQ:MULN) in the same article discussing stocks to sell in Autumn. Don’t take that the wrong way. We, investors, should be so lucky to buy shares of an enterprise that features so much intense loyalty.However, that same loyalty can also cloud judgment, in my humble opinion. I’ll share a quick story. On Aug. 3, I published my not-so-encouraging view on MULN stock. Essentially, a combination of a rough economic backdrop and lack of operational progress symbolized a clear warning to prospective speculators. Following the article, one gentleman offered to educate me (politely, I must say) about Mullen.Sadly, I wish that more people would press Mullen and flailing companies like the EV maker rather than attempting to sway influencers’ opinions. Case in point: Since my article was published, MULN hemorrhaged 51% of its equity value. Certainly, you’re free to disagree and call me a clown for not believing in Mullen. However, the continued losses imply that it’s actually one of the end-of-summer stock sales.American Eagle (AEO)An image of an America Eagle (AEO) store in a mall.Source: Helen89 / Shutterstock.comMoving from one of the most ardently supported enterprises to one with arguably less fanfare, American Eagle (NYSE:AEO) once symbolized must-have fashion for the young generation. However, since the Great Recession, AEO has been see-sawing wildly. In fact, take away the peaks and valleys, and what you’re left with is a flat trendline. Thus, it’s one of the stocks to sell in Autumn.Again, American Eagle perfectly epitomizes the concept of don’t kill the messenger. Per data from Fintel, the number of insider purchases amounts to 28 transactions. Further, the most recent buy occurred in late July of last year. On the other hand, the number of insider sales amounts to 150 transactions. The latest exiting occurred in April of this year. If AEO isn’t one of the candidates for fall stock clean-up, those closest to the business are sending mixed signals.Speaking of mixed signals, analysts rate AEO as a consensus hold. However, with a price target of $14.50, investors may face sizable losses. It’s probably time to exit while you still can.Carvana (CVNA)Carvana (CVNA stock) logo on white object in foreground as well as a high-rise building in the backgroundSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comOne of the most remarkable entities of the year, so far, online used-car retailer Carvana (NYSE:CVNA) has swung up more than 900% since the Jan. opener. So, for those that have been negative on CVNA – including yours truly – yes, mentioning CVNA as one of the stocks to sell in Autumn is the equivalent of a clown show.Still, once whatever this is starts returning to some semblance of normal, CVNA could again become one of the stocks to avoid in autumn. Fundamentally, the narrative just doesn’t support Carvana. Specifically, data from S&amp;P Global Mobility points out that the average age of passenger vehicles on U.S. roadways hit a record 12.5 years. Put another way, stifling inflation has forced people to hold onto their vehicles for longer than ever.If you’re looking to speculate, an auto parts retailer might be a better idea. Further, if you wanted to gamble on auto dealerships, brick-and-mortar plays would likely be more enticing. After all, Carvana no longer enjoys the COVID-19 tailwind of seeking contactless services.Lastly, analysts peg shares a hold with an average price target of $40.13, implying sizable downside.Cricut (CRCT)Image of a person doing crafts on a table.Source: CRAFT24/Shutterstock.comTalk about stocks to sell in autumn (or any season) long enough and you’re bound to encounter companies that you like as a consumer but not as an investor. Such is the case with Cricut (NASDAQ:CRCT). Based in South Jordan, Utah, Cricut manufactures smart cutting machines while providing an easy-to-use app. With this combination, users can create custom cards, unique apparel, and other household items.I have to admit that I’ve been thinking about buying one myself; yeah, I know – so alpha male of me. However, my liking of the product cannot overcome my concerns about the business. Since hitting a revenue tally of $1.3 billion in 2021, the following year saw an erosion to $886.3 million. Even worse, in the second quarter, sales came out to $177.8 million, a loss of 3.3% YOY.To be fair, CRCT does have a decently stable balance sheet. Still, it’s one of the stocks losing momentum in the fall and it’s not hard to see why. Glaringly, analysts peg CRCT as a moderate sell. Also, the downside price target sits at $7.88. It’s probably safer to stay away.Affirm (AFRM)Affirm (AFRM) logo displayed on a smartphone. AFRM LayoffsSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comA consumer-lending financial technology (fintech) specialist, Affirm (NASDAQ:AFRM) provides a buy now, pay later (BNPL) platform. A few days ago, AFRM attempted to reverse its negative trajectory. Without Affirm’s surprising fiscal Q4 earnings beat and optimistic guidance for Q1, shares would have easily made a case for stocks to sell in autumn.As it stands, it’s still one of end-of-summer stock sales. It’s just that the magnitude of pessimism may be tempered a bit. To be fair, the company provided exactly what it needed in terms of the financial print. However, Affirm faces severe obstacles within the broader consumer economy. Folks are tired, indebted, and are also in many cases losing their jobs.Sure, that might sound appealing for a BNPL operator. However, someone’s going to be on the hook if customers can’t pay back their loans. Therefore, not every analyst was moved by Affirm’s Q4 performance. Right now, analysts peg AFRM as a hold. This breaks down as three buys, eight holds and four sells. With a downside price target of $15.80, it’s probably wiser to steer clear.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

264,78d890d4-f17d-3681-a078-3d88b0da80f5,SWK,2023-09-07,2 Manufacturing Tools Stocks to Watch Amid Industry Woes,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-manufacturing-tools-stocks-watch-145200058.html,1694011920,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'LECO', 'SWK']","[The Zacks Manufacturing-Tools &amp; Related Products industry is benefiting from improving supply chains, which indicate faster deliveries and easier availability of raw materials. Cost-control measures support the company’s bottom line despite inflationary pressure. While manufacturing activities have been showing signs of improvement, it has remained in the contraction territory for the past several months, indicating a lower demand environment. This weighs on the industry’s near-term prospects.Despite the dim outlook, Stanley Black &amp; Decker SWK and Lincoln Electric LECO are poised for growth on the back of improving supply chains and an uptick in manufacturing activities.About the IndustryThe Zacks Manufacturing-Tools &amp; Related Products industry comprises companies that develop and distribute hand and mechanics tools, hydraulic tools, engineered fastening systems, and heavy-lifting technology solutions. Arc-welding products, robotic-welding packages, fume-extraction equipment, oxy-fuel cutting equipment, plasma cutters, healthcare solutions, electronic security solutions and other products are also produced by some tool-makers. The highly advanced tools are used in industrial, commercial, oil &amp; gas, mining, automotive and other industries. The providers of electronic security solutions cater to commercial, retailers, government, financial and healthcare markets. Talking about international operations, some industry players provide products and services to customers in North and South America, Japan, Europe, Canada, Asia and the Middle East.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Manufacturing Tools IndustryPersistent Weakness in the Manufacturing Sector: Continued weakness in the manufacturing sector has been weighing on demand in the industry. Per the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) report, in August, the Manufacturing PMI (Purchasing Manager’s Index) touched 47.6%, contracting for the 10th consecutive month. A figure less than 50% indicates a contraction in manufacturing activity. The New Orders Index remained in contraction territory at 46.8%, declining 0.5 percentage points from the figure recorded in July. While the manufacturing sector remains in the contraction territory, it is showing signs of gradual improvement. The Manufacturing PMI has been steadily improving over the past few months. In August, the index increased 1.2 percentage points from the figure recorded in July. The uptick in manufacturing activities augurs well for the industry.Easing Supply Chain Disruptions: While supply-chain disruptions persist, especially related to the availability of electronic components, the situation has improved, as evident from the ISM report’s Supplier Deliveries Index, which reflected faster deliveries for the 11th straight month in August. Easing supply chain issues should support manufacturing tools companies’ growth in 2023. Cost-control measures support the margins of the industry participants despite inflationary pressure.Hefty Investments in Product Development: The industry participants constantly focus on innovation, product upgrades and development of new products to stay competitive in the market. While this bodes well for long-term growth, the hefty investments associated with it weigh on margins and profitability of these companies. Successive acquisitions to expand product portfolio, boost technological capabilities and extend geographical presence often leave these companies with a highly leveraged balance sheet.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Manufacturing-Tools &amp; Related Products industry, housed within the broader Zacks Industrial Products sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #185. This rank places it in the bottom 26% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the group’s 2023 earnings per share has declined 52.1% over the past year.Despite the industry’s dull near-term prospects, we will present a few stocks that you may want to hold in your portfolio. But before that, it’s worth taking a look at the industry’s stock market performance and current valuation.Industry Underperforms S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Manufacturing-Tools &amp; Related Products industry has outperformed both the S&amp;P 500 composite index and the sector in the past year.Over this period, the industry has rallied 21.4%, compared with the sector and the S&amp;P 500 index’s increase of 16.7% and 13.5%, respectively.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of forward P/E (F12M), which is a commonly used multiple for valuing manufacturing tools and related product stocks, the industry is currently trading at 19.43X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 19.44X.

The company designs new types of molecules and then works with major pharmaceutical companies to test them.Nvidia’s venture capital arm, the Silicon Valley investor Andreessen Horowitz, and Obvious Ventures, a prolific San Francisco venture capital firm, are among those investing, according to the Financial Times, which revealed the fundraising.Mr Uszkoreit was one of eight scientists, mostly Google employees, who co-authored a seminal scientific paper that unveiled a computing model called a transformer, which has powered the rise of chatbots such as ChatGPT and image and video generation tools.The technology was also used by the Google-owned AI lab Deepmind, which used it to develop a protein-folding program that promises to rapidly improve medical research.All of the researchers have since left Google, and some ex-employees have claimed the tech giant’s culture meant it failed to capitalise on its early work in AI.Inceptive focuses on generating new mRNA molecules, which formed the basis of the Pfizer and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines. Mr Uszkoreit told the FT that Inceptive was working with a major pharmaceutical company to develop a new vaccine for an infectious disease.Interest in using AI to develop new drugs has jumped in recent years, particularly with the recent investment boom driven by technologies such as ChatGPT.However, experts have warned that the new technology may not lead to immediate results, since much of the work of developing new drugs requires lengthy laboratory testing and clinical trials.Shares in British company Exscientia, which uses AI to develop new drugs, have fallen by almost 80pc since the company’s US listing in 2021, while shares in London-based BenevolentAI have fallen by almost 90pc since last year.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

But by and large, fall conference season is a great way for management teams to fine-tune their current and future messaging while they get real-time feedback from investors.At this year's Communacopia, we've seen many of the biggest themes for investors emerge — AI, the consumer, regulatory risks, and tension in the media business.Friends reunite at the Goldman Sachs tech conference. AT&amp;T CEO John Stankey (left) reunites with Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav (right). Stankey sold WarnerMedia to Zaslav in 2022.(Source: Yahoo Finance) (Kevin Burke, Yahoo Finance)But away from these anticipated headlines, here are the seven things yours truly and my colleague Allie Garfinkle have learned from being on the ground and chatting up some of the names running America's biggest public companies.Palpable fear is in the air about Microsoft (MSFT) strengthening its tentacles within the tech industry, specifically around its investment in OpenAI, which gives the tech giant a strong advantage in the AI race.Growth stories trading on a decent valuation in tech are being drowned out by the investor love affair with Nvidia (NVDA). Example: Nvidia rival AMD (AMD). One contact who attended Lisa Su's presentation at Goldman came away impressed with their positioning in AI. Nvidia stock is up over 200% this year; AMD has gained just under 70%.If a company you're invested in isn't discussing what they are doing in automation over the next two years, it's a red flag. Giant companies are trying to bring as much automation as possible to their businesses to counter pandemic-era rises in worker wages and also ride the AI wave.Not many in tech believe we are headed for disinflation in 2024, counter to the present market narrative.Mass tech layoffs are likely over, for now.The appetite to own legacy media companies such as Disney (DIS) and Paramount (PARA) — which are trading near multi-year lows — isn't, well, high. The ongoing Charter (CHTR) and Disney fight isn't helping.Nvidia's stock may have gotten a poor earnings reception a few weeks ago, but the vibe here is you risk underperforming for clients if you aren't long NVDA in 2024.Story continuesFall conference season started with Communacopia and you can find our full coverage here.I often leave here bursting with new ideas.And this year is no different.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

271,d2534bb1-f216-3b49-a227-f2b9033fd78b,NVDA,2023-09-07,Bull of the Day: NVIDIA (NVDA),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bull-day-nvidia-nvda-092000963.html,1694078400,STORY,['NVDA'],"[I last wrote about NVIDIA (NVDA) as the Bull of the Day in early August to preview their Q2 report and to explain why I thought investors should be buying any dips back toward $425.I surmised “Shares have ramped, but analysts still underestimate the King of AI and its new paradigm.”Then in the weeks leading up to the company’s August 23 report, I kept encouraging my TAZR Trader members to buy the dip while they had the chance because I expected a bigger beat-and-raise quarter than most of Wall Street was imagining.Here were 3 points I highlighted in an August 22 note…The big story Monday (8/21) was the monster +8.5% rally in NVDA, after HSBC raised their PT to $780.The problem is that the analyst, Frank Lee, was the same guy who said ""Sell"" in November at $120 and then stayed at Sell in March when we were saying ""BUY MOAR!""So this is really just one of those ""I was way wrong so now I'm gonna steal the headlines"" calls.Don't get me wrong -- I see $750 in the next 18 months if the demand train keeps rolling.But it will be a somewhat bumpy ride.Case in point, this morning, we saw another gap open to nearly $482 (new highs by a buck) and a quick fade as last week's smart bulls cashed some quick gains. From $475 to $405 and back in a month is pretty volatile.So all this frenzy means it's time to talk a bit about what to expect.First, we were right in June about planning for a big beat and raise quarter, and why you should still buy at $425.My thesis was that the Street was way-underestimating what was coming with another big beat-and-raise due to off-the-charts demand for DGX systems built with Hopper and Ampere cards -- and anything else left in inventory.The past two months have been all about analysts catching up to that reality.Second, the flurry of volatility here is largely psychological (good ole greed and fear), but also large firms getting better positioned in options ahead of tomorrow.Third, there is a possibility that lots -- not all -- of the coming good news is priced-in at $475.You see, as analysts wrapped their spreadsheets around demand, supply, pricing, and what those smoothed trajectories look like over the next 2-4 quarters, they can't extrapolate that blow-out beat-and-raise numbers will continue into CY '25.Some of course will do that. But what matters is what the majority do.As I talked about last week, I expect a beat to Q2's guide of $11B by at least $1B. And the Q3 guide could be $14B or higher (consensus $12B).Most of the Street isn't as optimistic. So if we get this kind of beat-raise on the topline, the stock should go to new highs above $500.But I can't know what Q4 looks like, let alone next year. And maybe that's what matters most right now.Also worth noting is that next year's topline consensus just crept up another $5B to $60B, for 38% growth.Either way, I'm glad to have kept you aboard the Jensen Huang AI Starship and deciding whether we take some profits at $500 or wait until $550 is a good problem to have.(end of TAZR 8/22 commentary excerpts)I share this to show you some good and proven ways to always think about NVIDIA as an investor moreso than a trader.Because look what happened with the Starship Jensen’s results and guidance: They blew the roof off with a roughly $2 billion beat on the Q2 top line and then forecasted almost a $4 billion beat for the current Q3.This means that the crowd of spreadsheet jockeys (Wall Street analysts), who have been underestimating NVIDIA’s growth in hyper-scale accelerated computing, have spent the last two weeks punching new, much more bullish assumptions into their models that keep NVDA a Zacks #1 Rank.Here are where their consensus revenue projections stand now on the Zacks Detailed Estimates page…FY’24 (ends January): $53 billion for 97% growthFY’25 (begins in Feb): $76 billion for 43% growthAnd there’s profit optimism too…FY’24 EPS consensus just moved from $7.79 to $10.46FY'25 EPS consensus just moved from $10.77 to $15.48 (48% annual growth after the current year’s 210%+ advance!)Based on these revenue and profit estimates for next year, NVDA trades at 30X EPS and only 16X sales. As I described in my June video and article, NVDA should continue to trade at a premium of 20X sales as it progresses to $100 billion in annual revenue…Nvidia DGX: Workhorse of AI Will Drive NVDA to $2 TrillionFor the past seven years since I first learned about what Jensen was creating from GPU gaming cards, I’ve said that the key to NVIDIA innovation dominating the world of hyperscale accelerated computing revolved around three factors…Story continues1) The capabilities of GPU stacks creating ""massively parallel architectures"" for harnessing big-data with modeling, automation, and simulation2) The CUDA hardware + software stack that enables fast training and deployment of machine learning and deep learning models3) The evangelism of thousand of developers who get ingrained in the platform tools and never want to leave that ecosystemLong-time Apple evangelist Gene Munster recently said the same thing…“CUDA has created a moat around Nvidia's chip business. It would be difficult to get developers to switch to a different platform.”And that’s why observers like me and Dan Ives of Wedbush think that this is the iPhone moment for NVIDIA and its AI tools.In conclusion, let's hear from the AI wizard himself, Jensen Huang…""The world has something along the lines of about a trillion dollars' worth of data centers installed in the cloud and enterprise. And that trillion dollars of data centers is in the process of transitioning into accelerated computing and generative AI.""I think this translates into NVIDIA hitting $100 billion per year in revenue much sooner than my 2026 projection in June. So don’t miss your chance to buy NVDA under $450 again. I’m pretty sure you won’t see it below $400 ever again.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company witnessed solid top-line and bottom-line performances in the reported quarter. The top line benefited from robust contributions from all its revenue sources. Solid growth in HSAs also drove the top line. The solid uptick in total HSA assets in the reported quarter is promising. The expansion of both margins also bodes well. The company raising its revenue and adjusted EPS outlook for the fiscal year raises our optimism.However, continued inflationary pressure leading to higher wage inflation issues does not bode well.Zacks Rank and Other Key PicksHealthEquity currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are DaVita Inc.

Shares have added about 2.2% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Cabot due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Cabot’s Q3 Earnings &amp; Revenues Miss Estimates, Fall Y/YCabot recorded third-quarter fiscal 2023 (ending Jun 30, 2023) earnings of $1.43 per share, down from the year-ago quarter's $1.69.CBT posted adjusted earnings of $1.42 per share, down from the year-ago quarter's figure of $1.73. Adjusted earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.56.The company’s net sales in the third quarter were $968 million, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,145.3 million. Net sales decreased around 15.8% from the prior-year quarter.Segment HighlightsReinforcement Materials’ sales decreased around 14.5% year over year to $624 million in the reported quarter. It lagged our estimate of $683.2 million. Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) in the segment were $132 million, up around 17% from the year-ago quarter. The upside can be attributed to improved unit margins from higher pricing and better product mix in calendar-year 2023 customer agreements, which were partly offset by lower volumes.In the reported quarter, sales in the Performance Chemicals division declined 18% year over year to $307 million, falling short of our projection of $443.2 million. EBIT also witnessed a substantial drop of approximately 49% to $32 million, primarily attributed to reduced volumes and an unfavorable product mix, largely stemming from challenges in key end markets. The most significant volume contraction was observed in the fumed metal oxides product line.FinancialsCabot had cash and cash equivalents of $220 million at the end of the quarter, down around 5.7% year over year. The company’s long-term debt was $1,093 million.Capital expenditures in the reported quarter were $80 million.Cash flow from operating activities was $243 million in the quarter.Cabot paid $23 million of dividends and repurchased shares worth $15 million in the reported quarter.Story continuesOutlookThe company expects steady sequential volumes and strong EBIT growth year over year in Reinforcement Materials due to pricing and mix benefits in customer agreements. For Performance Chemicals, it expects stable sequential volumes in major product lines, with moderate growth in battery materials and inkjet. Pricing pressure in China's EV value chain is expected to affect battery materials in the short term. Cabot expects EBITDA results for fiscal 2023 to be lower than its earlier communicated guidance. Fiscal fourth-quarter adjusted EPS is projected to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.55, leading to a full-year range of $5.13 to $5.28.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -16.8% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Cabot has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Cabot has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerCabot belongs to the Zacks Chemical - Diversified industry. Another stock from the same industry, Air Products and Chemicals (APD), has gained 3.2% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended June 2023.Air Products and Chemicals reported revenues of $3.03 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -4.9%.

These three reliable value stocks look like a perfect fit regardless of the market’s direction.American Express (AXP)an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocketSource: ShutterstockFew businesses have the cachet of credit services provider American Express (NYSE:AXP). “You can’t create another American Express,” Warren Buffett told Bloomberg in December. AXP is the fourth biggest holding in Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A NYSE:BRK-B). Also, AXP is the fourth largest general-purpose card network in the world based on purchase volume. And it’s definitely in first place when it comes to prestige credit cards.How does AmEx make most of it revenue? It’s not interest charges, but rather the fees it charges merchants for facilitating those transactions. The company’s term “discount revenue” totaled $30.7 billion in 2022, up 25% from the year prior. In contrast, interest income was just $12.7 billion.Because it targets wealthier, high-spending customers, American Express’ business doesn’t feel the impact of market or economic downturns as hard. Its card members spend on average as much as three times more annually than non-members.Story continuesThat makes American Express stock one you don’t want to leave home without.Genuine Parts (GPC)5 Great Blue-Chip Stocks to BuySource: ShutterstockAuto parts retailer Genuine Parts (NYSE:GPC) is a great stock to buy now.

Helping consumers keep their cars on the road by owner-repair is a booming business. The auto parts retailer reported record Q2 sales of $5.9 billion last week and raised its outlook for the full year.Even better, GPC pays a dividend and has done so for 75 straight years. It also raised the payout for 67 consecutive years, making it a Dividend King. The dividend currently yields 2.5% annually.

Operating margin was 6.2% versus 5.9% at the insurance business.Also, UnitedHealth’s stock is cheap, going 17 times next year’s earnings estimates, less than twice sales, and a discounted 11 times free cash flow. The insurer also pays a dividend yielding a modest 1.5% annually that will help soften the blow of any market downdraft.

This article aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of Cummins' valuation, offering insights into its financial strength, profitability, and growth. We invite readers to delve into the analysis below to discover whether Cummins presents a valuable investment opportunity.Company Snapshot: Cummins Inc (NYSE:CMI)Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Signs with CMI. Click here to check it out. CMI 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of CMICummins Inc (NYSE:CMI) is a leading manufacturer of diesel engines, primarily used in commercial trucks, off-highway equipment, and railroad locomotives. The company also produces standby and prime power generators and sells powertrain components, including transmissions, turbochargers, aftertreatment systems, and fuel systems. Despite facing robust competition and increasing government regulation of carbon emissions, Cummins has maintained its industry leadership. The company's stock price is currently $236.13, with a market cap of $33.40 billion, while the GF Value stands at $310.59, indicating that the stock might be modestly undervalued.Unveiling Cummins (CMI)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure that represents the current intrinsic value of a stock. It is derived from historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past returns and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line provides an overview of the stock's fair trading value. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher. Given Cummins' current price of $236.13 per share and a market cap of $33.40 billion, the stock appears to be modestly undervalued.Story continuesUnveiling Cummins (CMI)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideExamining Cummins' Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with poor financial strength carries a higher risk of permanent loss of capital. Therefore, it's important to carefully review a company's financial strength before deciding to buy its stock. Looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage can provide a good starting point for understanding a company's financial strength. Cummins has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.28, which is worse than 79.08% of 2792 companies in the Industrial Products industry. The overall financial strength of Cummins is ranked 6 out of 10, indicating fair financial health.Unveiling Cummins (CMI)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideProfitability and Growth of Cummins (NYSE:CMI)Companies that have been consistently profitable over the long term offer less risk for investors. Higher profit margins usually dictate a better investment compared to a company with lower profit margins. Cummins has been profitable 10 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $32.20 billion and an Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $17.85. Its operating margin is 9.45%, which ranks better than 64% of 2800 companies in the Industrial Products industry. Overall, the profitability of Cummins is ranked 9 out of 10, indicating strong profitability.Growth is a crucial factor in a company's valuation. The faster a company is growing, the more likely it is to be creating value for shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth rate of Cummins is 9.3%, which ranks better than 59.39% of 2672 companies in the Industrial Products industry. However, the 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 4.9%, which ranks worse than 59.31% of 2364 companies in the Industrial Products industry.ROIC vs WACC: A Measure of ProfitabilityAnother way to determine a company's profitability is to compare its return on invested capital (ROIC) to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months, Cummins's return on invested capital is 11.21, and its cost of capital is 8.46.Unveiling Cummins (CMI)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideConcluding ThoughtsIn conclusion, Cummins (NYSE:CMI) stock appears to be modestly undervalued. The company's financial condition is fair, and its profitability is strong. However, its growth ranks worse than 59.31% of 2364 companies in the Industrial Products industry.

Ten percent will go to technology partner Huizhou, China-based EVE Energy, which has a U.S. sales office near Columbus, Ohio. EVE’s website shows test production of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells in the second quarter of 2022. Wednesday’s announcement talked about a factory with 21 gigawatt-hour capacity. That’s roughly the energy to power 16 million homes.LFP battery cells offer lower cost, longer life and enhanced safety, without using nickel and cobalt raw materials.The Cummins-Daimler-Paccar joint venture will manufacture battery cells for electric commercial vehicles and industrial applications. The total investment is expected to be $2 billion to $3 billion, the companies said in a news release.Daimler contracts for LFP batteries with Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL) for commercial trucks. It uses lithium-ion batteries from Proterra Inc. in its school bus and chassis businesses.‘Strict focus on costs and smart capital allocation’“For Daimler Truck, partnerships and a strict focus on costs and smart capital allocation are the key levers to succeed on the path towards sustainable transportation,” CEO Martin Daum said. “This planned joint venture enables economies of scale beyond Daimler Truck.“It is a key puzzle piece of our battery industrialization strategy, ensuring access to the right battery cell technology at the right cost.”Paccar had planned to use batteries from startup Romeo Power in a five-year agreement that began in 2020. Nikola Corp. later acquired Romeo and is liquidating its assets. Second-generation Paccar heavy-duty electric trucks should begin with DAF Trucks in Europe in 2024.“Our vision is the highest quality, locally produced battery technology to enhance the operations of our customers and help them achieve their operational and environmental goals,” Paccar CEO Preston Feight said.Story continuesCummins, through its Accelera unit, makes electric buses for Gillig as well as fully integrated electric chassis for commercial vehicles.“Not only are we advancing a key technology solution for our customers, but accelerating the energy transition in the United States,” Cummins CEO Jennifer Rumsey said.Surge in EV-related manufacturing projectsIncreased adoption of electric vehicles has produced more than $150 billion of EV-related manufacturing plant projects across 16 U.S. states, according to a new report from CBRE.Automakers General Motors, Ford and Stellantis have moved to locally produce batteries for electric vehicles. Ford announced in August a partnership with South Korean battery manufacturers SK On and EcoPro BM to build an $890 million cathode manufacturing facility in Quebec, Canada. It will provide battery materials for future Ford electric vehicles.Government incentives like the Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS and Science Act are designed to boost U.S. production of critical technologies for zero-emission EVs. In trucking, the demand is driven by California, which is banning new internal combustion-powered trucks from its roads by 2035.The joint venture likely will be reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States for any conflict with national security.Related articles:As electric batteries evolve, it’s all about the rangeVolvo, Mack replacing batteries on electric trucks because of fire risk Nikola will recall 209 battery-electric trucks following 2 firesClick for more FreightWaves articles by Alan Adler.The post Daimler Truck, Cummins and Paccar partner to make battery cells in US appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

Cummins (CMI), Paccar (PCAR), Daimler (MBG.DE) have created a joint venture that will spend $2 to $3 billion to build a battery cell factory in a yet to be determined U.S. location. Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Pras Subramanian breaks down the deal and discusses the growing EV investments in the United States.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Well, three companies are partnering to bring battery cell production to the US. The joint venture is going to be dedicated to accelerating and localizing battery cell manufacturing to the states. To tell us more about this and who is involved, Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian is joining us. So who's partnering up here?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Hey, Julie. So it's basically Accelera, which is engine maker Cummins's zero emissions arm, partnering with Daimler Truck and US truck maker PACCAR, which is behind brands like Kenworth and Peterbilt. They're forming a joint venture to make battery cells for commercial vehicles and other industrial applications. The JV will make LFP-type batteries, which are cheaper and better for heavy use and shorter distances, perfect for short-haul trucking.So the companies say the total investment will be around $2 to $3 billion with a 21-gigawatt hours of annual output. The JV did not say, however, where they'll actually build this factory, though perhaps near a Cummins or PACCAR plant in the US. But I got to say, Julie, it's another win for the US and EV battery investment in this country.JULIE HYMAN: And similarly, we're also seeing automakers investing in EVs in the US. So how does this project then fit into that bigger picture?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: So earlier today, the BlueGreen Alliance, which is a foundation that tracks sort of clean energy investment in environmental issues, tabulated some data and found out that through the last couple of years, the amount of total EV investments in batteries and plants and things like that is $154 billion in total investment and leading to about 188,000 total new jobs across the country and in that growing battery belt in the center of the country. So top five companies in terms of spend are LG, Tesla, GM, Ford, and SK Innovation, which is the South Korean battery company. So a lot of big deals in this space, more investment coming. It is, like I said, a big win for the White House and also backers of manufacturing here in the US.Story continuesBRAD SMITH: And so who right now, just as the broader context here, is the battery leader and who is making the best effort to really try and cut into that market share?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: In terms of making the most batteries in the US or in investment, I would say it's LG. They have the biggest investment, around $17 billion so far in the US. And they make batteries for GM, Ford as well, just sort of across the board there. But you see more from Tesla, Panasonic, and also SK Innovation, which is Ford's big partner. They're going to build-- they're helping Ford build a big plant in Tennessee and Kentucky that's coming up probably next year.BRAD SMITH: All right, great insights as always. Pras, thank you so much for helping us break this down. Appreciate it.]"

But by and large, fall conference season is a great way for management teams to fine-tune their current and future messaging while they get real-time feedback from investors.At this year's Communacopia, we've seen many of the biggest themes for investors emerge — AI, the consumer, regulatory risks, and tension in the media business.Friends reunite at the Goldman Sachs tech conference. AT&amp;T CEO John Stankey (left) reunites with Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav (right). Stankey sold WarnerMedia to Zaslav in 2022.(Source: Yahoo Finance)But away from these anticipated headlines, here are the seven things yours truly and my colleague Allie Garfinkle have learned from being on the ground and chatting up some of the names running America's biggest public companies.Palpable fear is in the air about Microsoft (MSFT) strengthening its tentacles within the tech industry, specifically around its investment in OpenAI, which gives the tech giant a strong advantage in the AI race.Growth stories trading on a decent valuation in tech are being drowned out by the investor love affair with Nvidia (NVDA). Example: Nvidia rival AMD (AMD). One contact who attended Lisa Su's presentation at Goldman came away impressed with their positioning in AI. Nvidia stock is up over 200% this year; AMD has gained just under 70%.If a company you're invested in isn't discussing what they are doing in automation over the next two years, it's a red flag. Giant companies are trying to bring as much automation as possible to their businesses to counter pandemic-era rises in worker wages and also ride the AI wave.Not many in tech believe we are headed for disinflation in 2024, counter to the present market narrative.Mass tech layoffs are likely over, for now.The appetite to own legacy media companies such as Disney (DIS) and Paramount (PARA) — which are trading near multi-year lows — isn't, well, high. The ongoing Charter (CHTR) and Disney fight isn't helping.Nvidia's stock may have gotten a poor earnings reception a few weeks ago, but the vibe here is you risk underperforming for clients if you aren't long NVDA in 2024.Story continuesFall conference season started with Communacopia and you can find our full coverage here.I often leave here bursting with new ideas.And this year is no different.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

CBS extended summer reality favorite ""Big Brother"" so it could run into November.Networks are trying to fill gaps created when Hollywood writers walked off the job in May, shutting down comedy and drama sets just as they were gearing up to film fall shows. Actors joined the picket lines in July for the first dual Hollywood work stoppage in 63 years.The fall season has been a staple of American TV for decades, the time to roll out the best that broadcast TV has to offer.""It's going to be a patchwork of different genres and whatever they have in the can that they can run,"" media consultant Brad Adgate said of the broadcast schedules.New episodes of scripted shows will be in much shorter supply. ABC's hit comedy ""Abbott Elementary,"" Paramount Network's top-rated drama ""Yellowstone"" and NBC's long-running crime series ""Law &amp; Order"" will show reruns.ABC's entire Thursday night lineup consists of game shows: ""Celebrity Wheel of Fortune,"" ""Press Your Luck"" and ""The $100,000 Pyramid."" The Walt Disney-owned network has no new scripted programming on its fall schedule.""Move over, Hot Labor Summer. It’s time for Sad TV Fall,"" the Los Angeles Times wrote.CATERING TO OLDER VIEWERSBroadcast television already faced major challenges as younger audiences switched to streaming.The average age of broadcast viewers was 62, according to Nielsen data from November of last season, compared with 40 on streaming.Story continuesToday, the biggest drama on broadcast draws around 10 million viewers, compared with roughly 20 million a decade ago.Adding to the tumult, ABC has gone dark in nearly 15 million homes because of a dispute between Disney and cable TV provider Charter Communications.While the strikes compounded problems for broadcast executives, they said they had planned ahead and applied lessons learned when COVID-19 abruptly halted production, forcing them to rewrite schedules and seek overseas programming they could bring to U.S. audiences.""We've navigated through the pandemic and that has helped us think about how to prepare for this,"" said Dan Harrison, executive vice president of program planning and content strategy for Fox Entertainment.Fox is bringing back Ramsay's ""Kitchen Nightmares,"" which ended a decade ago, on Mondays and will continue his ""Hell's Kitchen"" series on Thursdays.The network also will benefit from its recent focus on adult animation. Next to new episodes of ""The Simpsons,"" ""Family Guy"" and ""Bob's Burgers,"" Fox will introduce ""Krapopolis"" about a city run by a family of humans, gods and monsters. Writing of those shows was completed well before the strikes because animation takes longer to produce.Comcast's NBC started some of its drama productions earlier than usual in preparation for a potential strike, said Steve Kern, senior vice president of program planning and strategy for NBC Entertainment.NBC has scheduled fresh episodes of five scripted dramas, including ""Magnum P.I.,"" newcomer ""Found"" and a Canadian series, ""Transplant.""""Our schedule is largely returning intact,"" Kern said.One thing missing from NBC: new installments in creator Dick Wolf's ""Law &amp; Order"" and ""Chicago"" franchises. The network will air repeats.'YELLOWSTONE' JOINS SUNDAY LINEUPDespite the shake-ups, executives see opportunities.Paramount Global hopes to turn new fans on to ""Yellowstone,"" which has been running on the Paramount Network cable channel and streaming on Peacock.The first season of the drama about a wealthy ranch owner played by Kevin Costner will air on CBS, also owned by Paramount, after ""Sunday Night Football"" and ""60 Minutes.""For scripted shows, CBS will run the British edition of hit comedy ""Ghosts,"" and the first international version of the ""NCIS"" franchise, set in Sydney.Viewers can turn to streaming services for new series, though they too have seen popular dramas such as ""Stranger Things"" and ""Euphoria"" shut down by the strikes.Netflix just released ""One Piece,"" a live-action adaptation of the Japanese manga series about pirates, and Apple TV+ will release a new season of ""The Morning Show"" next week. A reboot of ""Frasier"" starring Kelsey Grammer will debut on Paramount+ in November. (Reporting by Lisa Richwine; Editing by Mary Milliken and Jonathan Oatis)]"

A copy of the same can be downloaded here. In the second quarter, markets performed well, and the S&amp;P 500 index (“S&amp;P”) and the Russell 1000 Growth Index returned 8.7% and 12.8%, respectively.

In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2023.RiverPark Large Growth Fund highlighted stocks like The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in the second quarter 2023 investor letter. Headquartered in Burbank, California, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is an entertainment company that operates through Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution; and Disney Parks, Experiences, and Products. On September 6, 2023, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stock closed at $80.98 per share. One-month return of The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) was -7.44%, and its shares lost 28.14% of their value over the last 52 weeks. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has a market capitalization of $148.176 billion.RiverPark Large Growth Fund made the following comment about The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:""The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS): DIS was a top detractor in the quarter following mixed FY2Q results. Revenue of $22 billion was up 13% year over year, although EPS, at $0.93, was down 14% year over year. Disney Plus, part of the company’s direct-to-consumer business (DTC), had better subscriber numbers than anticipated despite a price increase, although losses at the DTC business as a whole are growing. The linear TV business also continues to suffer secular headwinds with - 10% revenue growth, and the company faced inflationary cost pressures at its theme parks.DIS is nevertheless blessed with a deep library of unique content that includes both live sports (providing large, non-time shifted audiences) and incomparable brands including Disney, Marvel, Pixar and Lucasfilm, as well as the ABC network. The company also has a wealth of upcoming new content, with a plan to release over 100 original titles per year on a $30 billion annual content production budget. Now that the disruption in its theme park, cruise and theatrical businesses has come to an end, we believe that Disney is among the best-positioned media companies in the new landscape to combine multi-channel and DTC distribution.We think the return of long-time CEO Bob Iger will lead to higher and more consistent profitability at the theme parks, better value realization in the linear assets, and consolidation of the company’s DTC assets leading to higher profitability sooner. We therefore expect DIS to grow its free cash flow significantly over the next 3-4 years, from its depressed $1 billion last year, returning to and exceeding its previous $10 billion peak in 2018.""Story continuesJoe Seer/Shutterstock.comThe Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is in 21st position on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

With an Earnings Per Share (EPS) (EPS) of 2.22, the question arises: is the stock fairly valued? This article aims to answer this question by providing an in-depth analysis of Nasdaq's valuation. We invite you to delve into the following analysis for a deeper understanding.Company IntroductionWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with NDAQ. Click here to check it out. NDAQ 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of NDAQFounded in 1971, Nasdaq is renowned for its equity exchange. Apart from its market-services business, which constitutes about 35% of sales, the company also sells and distributes market data. It offers Nasdaq-branded indexes to asset managers and investors through its information-services segment, which makes up 30% of its sales. Nasdaq's corporate-services business, accounting for 20% of sales, provides listing services and related investor relations products to publicly traded companies. Through Nasdaq's market technology group, which constitutes 15% of sales, the company facilitates the exchange operations of other exchanges worldwide and provides financial compliance services. With a current stock price of $52.02 per share and a market cap of $25.60 billion, Nasdaq's stock appears to be fairly valued according to our GF Value estimate.Unveiling Nasdaq (NDAQ)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideUnderstanding GF ValueThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page provides an overview of the fair value at which the stock should be traded. This value is calculated based on three factors:Historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio, and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) at which the stock has traded.A GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth.Future estimates of the business performance.We believe the GF Value Line represents the fair value at which the stock should be traded. The stock price will most likely fluctuate around the GF Value Line. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Story continuesGiven that Nasdaq is fairly valued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be close to the rate of its business growth.Unveiling Nasdaq (NDAQ)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideThese companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Nasdaq's Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with low financial strength could result in permanent capital loss. Therefore, investors must carefully review a company's financial strength before deciding whether to buy shares. Looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage can give a good initial perspective on the company's financial strength. Nasdaq has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.54, which ranks worse than 74.07% of 756 companies in the Capital Markets industry. Based on this, GuruFocus ranks Nasdaq's financial strength as 5 out of 10, suggesting a fair balance sheet.Unveiling Nasdaq (NDAQ)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideNasdaq's Profitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies poses less risk, especially those that have demonstrated consistent profitability over the long term. A company with high profit margins is also typically a safer investment than one with low profit margins. Nasdaq has been profitable 10 times over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $6.10 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $2.22. Its operating margin is 27.68%, which ranks better than 68.44% of 640 companies in the Capital Markets industry. Overall, GuruFocus ranks the profitability of Nasdaq at 8 out of 10, which indicates strong profitability.One of the most important factors in the valuation of a company is growth. Long-term stock performance is closely correlated with growth according to GuruFocus research. Companies that grow faster create more value for shareholders, especially if that growth is profitable. The average annual revenue growth of Nasdaq is13.7%, which ranks better than 62.5% of 680 companies in the Capital Markets industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth is 12.1%, which ranks worse than 51.4% of 465 companies in the Capital Markets industry.ROIC vs WACCAnother method of determining the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital to the weighted average cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months, Nasdaq's return on invested capital is 6.08, and its cost of capital is 8.26.Unveiling Nasdaq (NDAQ)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideConclusionOverall, Nasdaq (NASDAQ:NDAQ) stock is estimated to be fairly valued. The company's financial condition is fair, and its profitability is strong.

Yet, crude prices dipped for the first time in 10 days as traders took stock of market direction after a 10% rally in that span.Both New York-traded West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude and London-based global oil benchmark Brent lost close to 1% each Thursday despite the U.S. Energy Information Administration, or EIA, reporting a fourth straight weekly decline in domestic crude stockpiles.WTI settled at $86.87 per barrel, down 67 cents, or 0.8%, on the day. It hit a 10-month peak of $88.09 in Wednesday's session. Despite the slide, WTI was still up 1.5% on the week, extending last week’s 7.2% gain.Brent settled below the key $90 per barrel mark the first time in three days as it finished Thursday’s official trade at $89.22, down 68 cents, or 0.8%. Week to date, the global oil benchmark remained up 1.5%.“Oil prices are finally in overbought territory,” Phil Flynn, an analyst at Chicago’s Price Futures Group, who’s typically bullish on all things energy, said, acknowledging the technical pressure brought on to the two crude benchmarks by a near 30% rally since mid-June.As modest as Thursday’s correction may be, it would help attract more buying at the lower end, Flynn added.Sunil Kumar Dixit, a commodities chartist who heads SKCharting.com, said WTI might need to drop beneath $86 to spur demand at the lower end.“The bullish rally appears to be in the process of momentum distribution following double top on day time frame, though it's initial extent may be limited to $84.90&amp;$84.40,” Dixit said.“Downward consolidation requires a clear break below the previous day's low of $85.90, followed by a day close below the zone.”The EIA reported that U.S. crude stockpiles dropped by 6.307M barrels during the week ended Sept. 1, extending the 10.584M-barrel draw in the prior week to Aug. 25..Refiners had doubled down on fuel processing in the four weeks running up to the holiday, maintaining an extraordinarily high run rate of more than 93% of capacity.

It is based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates.

Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Devon Energy The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.36bUS$3.37bUS$3.04bUS$2.61bUS$2.47bUS$2.40bUS$2.36bUS$2.35bUS$2.36bUS$2.39bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x6Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ -5.20%Est @ -2.99%Est @ -1.45%Est @ -0.37%Est @ 0.39%Est @ 0.92% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.5% US$3.1kUS$2.9kUS$2.4kUS$1.9kUS$1.6kUS$1.5kUS$1.3kUS$1.2kUS$1.1kUS$1.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$18bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.4b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (8.5%– 2.2%) = US$38bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$38b÷ ( 1 + 8.5%)10= US$17bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$35b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$53.5, the company appears about fair value at a 1.7% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Devon Energy as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.278. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Devon EnergyStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDividends are not covered by cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For Devon Energy, we've put together three essential items you should assess:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 4 warning signs  with Devon Energy (at least 2 which are a bit concerning)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Future Earnings: How does DVN's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

Needless to say, Cramer does have some detractors, as well as a running meme in some circles that as soon as he recommends something, investors should sell. Outright betting against his stock picks certainly isn’t working this year however.Story continuesIn addition to his buy recommendations, Cramer also advises viewers and investors on other aspects of the market and urges them to plan accordingly for the potential pitfalls looming in the future, such as the possibility of a U.S. debt crisis. To weather your portfolio against such a storm, check out 10 Stocks Jim Cramer Thinks Can Weather a Debt Default.Fisher and Cramer are certainly in lockstep when it comes to some of their favorite stock picks. The Cramer ETF, which has just 22 long positions, has five of Fisher’s top six holdings and ten of its top 63. Let’s see which stocks the two investment gurus are in agreement on heading towards the final quarter of 2023.Jim Cramer and Billionaire Ken Fisher Love These 10 StocksOur MethodologyThe following data is gathered from Fisher Asset Management’s latest 13F filing with the SEC, as well as the buy recommendations made by Jim Cramer, as tracked by the LJIM ETF. We follow hedge funds like Fisher Asset Management because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q2 2023 reporting period.Jim Cramer and Billionaire Ken Fisher Love These 10 Stocks10. RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX)Value of Fisher Asset Management’s 13F Position: $909 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 56 Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are three of Ken Fisher’s biggest holdings, but only Microsoft has been in his 13F portfolio as long as RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) (formerly Raytheon). Fisher’s held a long position in RTX dating back to the second quarter of 2002, and 21 years later, raised his stake in the company by 3% during Q2 of this year. It ranks as Fisher’s 63rd largest 13F holding as of June 30. Hedge fund ownership of RYX rose by 17% during Q2.Jim Cramer has been bullish on RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) for several months, declaring on the August 16 edition of CNBC’s Mad Money that he thinks it’s time to buy the stock following its 10% drop on July 25. Cramer expressed similar sentiments in June, telling investors that they have a chance to buy RTX at a discount due to unjustified weakness. Cramer expressed bullishness on the long-term prospects of RTX’s aerospace and defense businesses, saying they’re in poised for many years of gigantic orders.Carillon Tower noted that RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) expected its defense business to rebound thanks to strong demand, as noted in the fund’s Q3 2022 investor letter:“Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) announced strong results led by strength in its commercial segment, but weakness in its defense business led to investor consternation. Management guided to a recovery in this segment, citing both transitory supply chain issues and continued strong demand.”9. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) Value of Fisher Asset Management’s 13F Position: $919 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 40 Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) came in one spot ahead of RTX in Ken Fisher’s 13F portfolio, ranking 62nd. The billionaire money manager has owned a stake in Ford since the final quarter of 2009, and raised the size of his Ford holding by 18% during the second quarter of 2023. Hedge fund ownership of Ford nearly doubled between the middle of 2020 and mid-2021, but has since fallen by 31%.Jim Cramer visited Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F)’s headquarters and interviewed CEO Jim Farley in June and came away impressed with what he saw and heard. The former hedge fund manager said Ford looks extremely undervalued, even more so than Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), which he also likes, and believes the stock could return to its former $25 highs if he’s right. He likewise described the stock’s downside risk as minimal.Leaven Partners noted that several major companies, including Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), were forced to issue profit warnings last Q3, as noted in the fund’s Q3 2022 investor letter:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Ford (NYSE:F), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”8. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)Value of Fisher Asset Management’s 13F Position: $1.31 billion Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 111 JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) is the 34th largest 13F holding of Ken Fisher, topping $1.3 billion in value as of June 30. Fisher has held a long position in JPM dating all the way back to the third quarter of 2001. Hedge fund ownership of JPMorgan jumped by 15% during the first quarter of the year before falling slightly in the second quarter.Jim Cramer has been a fan of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) for years, calling the company a fortress on X back in March. He followed that up in July by praising CEO Jamie Dimon and co. for JPMorgan’s “amazing” second quarter results and declared that the company is valued very low given that it’s a colossus.  JPM earned net income of $14.5 billion in Q2, up 67% year-over-year, while revenue grew by 34% to $42.4 billion.The Madison Sustainable Equity Fund noted the positive impact that rising interest rates will have on JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM)’s income in the fund’s second quarter 2023 investor letter:“JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) has rebounded nicely following the mini-bank crisis in March. They held an analyst meeting in May at which they gave updated guidance on net interest income. They expect net interest income to increase to $84 billion from its forecast of $81 billion as First Republic assets will get a nice boost from rising interest rates.”7. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)Value of Fisher Asset Management’s 13F Position: $1.40 billion Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 230 While a plethora of other hedge funds have bailed on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in the past couple years, Ken Fisher has maintained a large position in the social media giant, which he’s owned since early 2014. META was Fisher’s 29th largest 13F holding on June 30, valued at $1.40 billion. There was a 33% drop in the number of funds long META between Q2 2021 and Q3 2022, but hedge funds have been buying back into the stock for three straight quarters since then.Jim Cramer said that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was rapidly becoming his favorite stock back in March of this year. That came on the heels of a rough stretch for META and Cramer himself, who had previously urged his viewers to buy META back in June of 2022, only for the stock to crash to seven-year lows a few months later. Cramer gave up on the stock in late October and apologized to his viewers, only to see it surge by 85% over the following few months.Tumultuous history with the stock aside, Cramer is back aboard the META bandwagon, saying back in July that they’ve trounced everyone, noting in particular the impressive engagement metrics and monetization initiatives of META’s TikTok challenger Reels over on Instagram.The Baron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund is impressed with the strong user engagement on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s services, as the fund noted in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Shares of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), the world’s largest social network continued their upward trajectory, rising by 35.4% due to stabilizing revenues and ongoing improvements in margins. Meta reported continued growth in Instagram Reels adoption and other new advertising products. In addition, the company’s advancements in AI continue contributing to its targeting and measurement capabilities, while GenAI innovation presents an opportunity for new products and incremental monetization. The company also achieved a significant milestone of 3 billion daily active users across its family of apps, representing a 5% year-over-year increase. User engagement remains robust, with video content and Instagram Reels playing a significant role in user time on the platform. The monetization gap between Reels and other ad formats is steadily narrowing, and Meta anticipates it will reach revenue neutrality by late 2023 or early 2024. Meta has also reported an increase in its speed and agility of execution following the recent organizational changes and cost cuts. Longer term, we believe Meta will benefit from its leadership in mobile advertising, massive user base, innovative culture, leading GenAI research and potential distribution, and technological scale, with further monetization opportunities ahead.”6. Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)Value of Fisher Asset Management’s 13F Position: $2.21 billion Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 89 Closing out the first half of the list is Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), which ranks as Fisher’s 13th largest 13F holding as of June 30. Fisher has been long ORCL for more than two decades and other hedge funds are now starting to take serious interest in the software and cloud services giant. Hedge fund ownership of Oracle surged by 29% during the second quarter, with Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management and Paul Tudor Jones’ Tudor Investment being among the leading funds to build a stake in the company during the quarter.On a Mad Money Lightning Round in early August, Jim Cramer was adamant that viewers should buy more Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), saying they should buy it “right here” (around $110-$113; it’s now $121) and noting that it was in his Investing Club’s Bullpen as a stock to monitor. Back in June, Cramer stated that Oracle has quietly become a major player in cloud infrastructure. Oracle’s cloud revenue surged by 76% to $1.4 billion during its fiscal Q4 2023, accelerating from 55% year-over-year growth a quarter earlier.The Madison Sustainable Equity Fund was bullish on Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)’s fiscal Q4 results, as the fund relayed in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) reported a solid fiscal fourth quarter and provided guidance for the first quarter that continued to support solid growth for the company. Revenues grew 17% and were primarily driven by Cloud Services (up 29%) with Oracle’s cloud infrastructure (OCI) business growing 89% in the quarter. Oracle has messaged that this business has price-performance advantages as compared to the other infrastructure companies (Amazon, Microsoft, Google) and appears to be winning business as a result. On the earnings call, management made the case that OCI will play a significant role in the Generative AI workloads which bodes well for continued growth.” Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are stalwart holdings of Ken Fisher’s portfolio that Jim Cramer also loves.

318,9ab964c6-c2a8-3055-b126-d1275e8917be,MU,2023-09-07,"Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/micron-technology-inc-mu-trending-130010258.html,1694005210,STORY,['MU'],"[Micron (MU) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this chipmaker have returned +3.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.6% change. The Zacks Semiconductor Memory industry, to which Micron belongs, has gained 0.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Micron is expected to post a loss of $1.19 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -182.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of -$4.56 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -154.6%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of -$1.52 indicates a change of +66.7% from what Micron is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Micron.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Micron, the consensus sales estimate of $3.91 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -41.2%. The $15.44 billion and $20.08 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -49.8% and +30.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMicron reported revenues of $3.75 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -56.6%. EPS of -$1.43 for the same period compares with $2.59 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.68 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.99%. The EPS surprise was +9.49%.Over the last four quarters, Micron surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Micron is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Micron. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Cocks said, ""When I started at Wizards of the Coast back in 2016 that was 15 percent of Hasbro's profitability. It's now over 50 percent of the profitability of the company.""Regarding on how to adopt to AI, Cocks said, ""Any creative would admit that AI is transformative to how they think about and how they concept new ideas. So I think it's going to be very exciting.""Click here for more of Yahoo Finance's coverage from the Goldman Sachs Communacopia tech conference.Video TranscriptBRIAN SOZZI: Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live, and we're still stationed at the Goldman Sachs tech and media conference but why not talk some toys as the holiday shopping season gets ready to kick off? Joining me now to talk some toys is Hasbro CEO, Chris Cocks. Thanks for joining us.CHRIS COCKS: Thanks for having me, Brian.BRIAN SOZZI: All right, so what brings a toy CEO to a Goldman Sachs tech/media conference?CHRIS COCKS: Well, we're also a game company. So games is a lot of technology, particularly our digital games.BRIAN SOZZI: Take us through your digital journey. And we'll talk about how the holiday season might play out for you guys but where are you at on digital? And how large is your digital footprint inside Hasbro?CHRIS COCKS: Well, right now, our overall game footprint is about $2.1 billion. It's by far the most profitable and highest growth aspect of Hasbro. And digital games right now is about 25% of it. And as we think about digital games, there's really three businesses. There's a licensing business, there's a games as a service kind of business, and then there's a triple-A publishing that we're also developing.Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: These are some big numbers. Do investors appreciate the growth potential of a business like this?CHRIS COCKS: I think a lot of them do and the ones that don't are starting to really wake up to it. Like when I started at Wizards of the Coast back in 2016, that was 15% of Hasbro's profitability. It's now over 50% of the profitability of the company.BRIAN SOZZI: Are you still gaming?CHRIS COCKS: Yeah, oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.BRIAN SOZZI: Do you have any hits right now?CHRIS COCKS: Oh, for sure.BRIAN SOZZI: Like, what is the trajectory of the games? What's in the market and what's coming?CHRIS COCKS: Well, ""Baldur's Gate 3"" launched on PC. It's going to be launching on PS5 I think today or tomorrow. It's one of the best rated games in history. I think it's got a 96 or a 97 on Metacritic. The only games that are like GTA and Zelda. And it's tearing up the charts. We also have Monopoly Go. It's the number one game across iOS and Android in terms of mobile.BRIAN SOZZI: What are your big bets on digital and the gaming platform for next year?CHRIS COCKS: Well, we continue to invest in our licensors. So I think Scopely and Monopoly Go and ""Baldur's Gate 3"" is going to have a really long life for us. That's probably when you look at our overall licensing portfolio, it's over $100 million, $150 million of very high profit revenue for us. We have games as a service like ""Magic, The Gathering Arena"" and ""D&amp;D Beyond,"" which also are super high profit and high growth businesses for us.And then we're investing in a lot of our own publishing capability. And I think you'll hear about US announcing a couple of those games over the next couple of months, and we're excited for that.BRIAN SOZZI: Do you want to announce them now?CHRIS COCKS: No, no, I can't. I can't.BRIAN SOZZI: One of the main themes at this event of course, is the AI. Does AI change how you develop a game?CHRIS COCKS: Oh, for sure. I think AI changes-- I think AI is going to change any creative industry. I think the important thing is you have to adopt a creator first mindset though. Creators are super important to us. We hire and employ over 1,000 artists and designers across our company, whether they work for Hasbro or they're contractors that we work with. We got to make sure anything we do with AI thinks about them first. But I think any creative would admit that AI is transformative to how they think about and how they concept new ideas.So I think it's going to be very exciting. It's still early innings, and we've got to figure out how to do it right. And we've got to make sure that we always remember that humans need to be at the center of any kind of solution.BRIAN SOZZI: We just headed into a decade of just creepy toys with AI like, creepy dolls. Like, is this what we're looking at now? And how does that change how children interact with these things?CHRIS COCKS: Well, I think like with any technology, you have to think about it responsibly and you have to think about how they cross the chasm. So I think there's a big hype cycle around AI right now, probably going to need a couple of years to really kind of mature and make sure we have the right guardrails associated with it. But I think like any new technology, companies need to invest in it and figure out how to utilize it.BRIAN SOZZI: On another note, a non-Goldman analyst a couple of weeks ago published a note on Hasbro saying they-- you have undergone some of the most intense change out of any company they cover. Where are you at in turning around at Hasbro?CHRIS COCKS: Well, I think it varies based on the aspect of the business. So Hasbro really has three businesses. We have entertainment, we have toys, and we have games. In entertainment, we're in the process of right-sizing that business. We just announced that we're selling our film and TV division called the E1. And I think we'll have a much smaller but more strategic footprint as a result of that.In games, that's all about growing the hot hand. That business has grown at double digit kegger over the last five years. We continue to see very robust growth prospects for it. And it's at a very rich margin for us, 30% plus margin. So we'll continue to lean into that.And toys, I would say that's more of a turnaround for us. And right now with toys, we're about bringing on the right people, establishing the right mindset, and executing like crazy. And I'd say we're probably an inning too of that but we're starting to see some nice results from it.BRIAN SOZZI: What have you identified in terms of toys that need an improvement? Or you're not putting out the right toys in the market. Has the market itself changed?CHRIS COCKS: Well, I think we have no shortage of great creative ideas. I think what we needed was better process to be able to vet what the ideas that we need to bring to market should be. And then more consumer mindsets set in terms of consumer research, data analytics, and an understanding of our channel partners and what they need. I think if you pair good process with the great creativity and especially the outstanding brand portfolio we have, you're going to see a pretty good turnaround from us over the next 18 to 24 months.BRIAN SOZZI: We're hearing a lot from major retailers. Delinquencies on credit cards are on the rise. The consumer is cautious. What's your expectation for the holiday season as pertains to the toy business?CHRIS COCKS: Well, I think it's a mix of headwinds and tailwinds in terms of the consumer right now. The fan economy still is really robust, and Hasbro has great exposure there with games like ""Magic the Gathering"" our fan business, which is a lot of ""Marvel"" and ""Star Wars,"" ""Dungeons and Dragons."" I think the more general consumer still has a very good employment kind of set of prospects. Employment rates are still at historical lows.But there's a lot of debt piling up. There's a lot of interest rates that are starting to climb on mortgages, student loans are starting to come due again. So we're going to need to see those headwinds, kind of those headwinds and tailwinds bend a little bit more towards tailwinds to make sure the toy industry stays healthy.BRIAN SOZZI: One of the tailwinds that some folks that cover Hasbro saw was a slowdown in inflation. But now oil prices are back on the rise. What's your inflation outlook? Obviously, oil is a critical ingredient or input to how you make a toy.CHRIS COCKS: Well in general, we lock in our prices about 12 to 15 months in advance, and so we're actually seeing deflation in the cost of our toys. If you look at the general toy industry today, we started to see a slowdown in Q4 of last year in toys, and that's extended into this year. Right now the general industry is down, mid-single digits to high-single digits. Our hope is we start to see a turnaround in September and October where at least we start to get flattish.Hasbro, I think we feel pretty good about our product portfolio and our ability to execute, but it's got to be an industry thing. We've got to do it with our retailers, we've got to do it with our other partners to see that turnaround happen.BRIAN SOZZI: All right, well, we look forward to continuing to follow your journey. Hasbro CEO, Chris Cocks. Enjoy the rest of this Goldman Sachs conference.CHRIS COCKS: Hey, thanks so much. Appreciate it.]"

HAS have experienced a robust 39.7% increase in its stock value over the last six months, significantly outperforming the industry's 16.8% growth rate. This impressive performance can be attributed to its successful new product introductions, strategic collaborations and a compelling product portfolio. Nevertheless, it is important to note that elevated expenses could potentially impact its overall financial performance.Let’s delve deeper.Growth DriversHasbro remains committed to fostering innovation, exemplified by its collaboration with Paramount to elevate storytelling and content capabilities. Furthermore, it has made significant investments in Boulder Media, its animation studio, and has expanded its digital capabilities to stimulate sales growth. It also maintains its ongoing commitment to Transformers Franchise, extending its presence across various entertainment mediums, encompassing movies, television, and digital platforms.During 2022, HAS amped up its strategic licensing partnerships with top brands like FurReal Friends, Littlest Pet Shop and EASY-BAKE Oven.

It has a supreme gaming portfolio and is refining gaming experiences across a multitude of platforms like face-to-face gaming, tabletop gaming and digital gaming experiences in mobile. Given a strong product lineup and a greater focus on entertainment backed products, Hasbro's Entertainment and Licensing segment is poised for growth.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is optimistic about its growth opportunities over the next three years and anticipates operating profit growth of 50%.

The former averages about 1.6 million Scoville units and the Naga Viper stands only a bit less at 1.3 million. (This metric is named after scientist Wilbur Scoville, who determined how to measure a pepper’s pungency and heat back in 1912.) When both are brushed onto the dust of a chip, they make a Paqui that burns so hot, the unit of the Hershey Company warns consumers, it’s a “truly twisted experience.” As part of its “One Chip Challenge,” the company dares eaters to see if they can endure it for $9.99—and it just saw its first known case of a death after ingestion, a 14-year-old in Massachusetts.Paqui challenged eaters to take on the reaper and viper peppers via a website decorated with a red skull and a snake weaving through it. The company also used to challenge people to see how long they could hold off drinking or eating anything after consuming the chip, according to the New York Times, but it has removed that language from its side following the death of Harris Wolobah, a teenager from Worcester, as first reported by the Boston Globe. “How long can you last before you spiral out?” the official website read.Lois Wolobah told the Times that her son Harris had shown her a picture of the coffin-shaped chip box where the Paqui was located, telling her that’s what he had eaten while doubled over, clutching his stomach. Two hours after his mom had taken him from the school nurse, Harris was sent to a hospital, where he died shortly afterward. Lois said her son had no other health concerns, and there will be no autopsy results for up to 12 weeks, a spokesperson for the Massachusetts Office of the Chief Medical Examiner told the Times.Paqui is owned by Amplify Snack Brands (the owner of the considerably milder SkinnyPop), which has been a Hershey subsidiary since a $1.6 billion acquisition in 2017.The “One Chip Challenge” has been around for some time now, with a spokesperson for Paqui telling Time in 2016 that “the Paqui Carolina Reaper chip delivers such a gripping tidal wave of heat that people can only handle one chip.”Story continuesChallenges are often a way that public marketers try to cue into social virality and fads. Taking a cue from the early fads like the cinnamon challenge or planking, these companies make hashtags associated with their brands in hopes of spreading the world and getting an extra boost to sales. Just look at the recent McDonald's Grimace Birthday, which took off after Gen Z put its own spin on the promotion. After the typically existential humor trend took it to almost 3 billion TikTok views, McDonald's saw a sales boost of more than 11%. But these hits can take a deadly turn.Teenagers like Wolobah are often more drawn to these challenges, according to clinical psychology researchers. “In recent years, social media challenges have grown more popular—and more dangerous, leading to serious injuries and even deaths,” wrote Elisa Trucco and Julie Cristello for The Conversation., explaining that teens are more vulnerable as they use social media often, are more susceptible to peer pressure, and are in a more risk-taking stage of their lives.The Hershey Company did not immediately respond to Fortune's request for comment.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeWant more for your money?

A few days later his team received a phone call from the U.S. embassy about the request, he said.""I think having McDonald's in the country is a message: a message of confidence...

If you want to skip out background on the bank, then take a look at 5 Undervalued Stocks to Buy According to Goldman Sachs. Even with turmoil in its ranks, investment bank Goldman Sachs continues to maintain its upbeat sentiment about a recession in the U.S. With the third quarter of 2023 underway, the U.S. economy has come quite far ahead from the doom and gloom that had plagued investors' minds last year. The economy, despite downward growth revisions later on, maintained growth during the second quarter and there is cautious optimism that the Federal Reserve just might forgo an interest rate increase later this month. At the same time, the labor market is also cooling, and inflation on the consumer front is dropping.In its fresh analyst note, the bank believes that the odds of a recession taking place in America over the next year is 15%, down from an earlier 20%. The 15% odds are still higher than the 'soft landing' that Bank of America is projecting, but while the latter's shift is a recent one, Goldman Sachs has been one of the most cautious banks in the industry when it comes to recession speculation throughout the course of this year. The latest note from Goldman Sachs' chief economist Jan Hatzius, which comes a handful of weeks before the Federal Reserve decides whether to increase interest rate hikes or take another pause, outlines that there will be no rate hike in September, and if the data sets create space, then there won't be a rate hike in November either.The economist added that there is little reason to fear any lag from earlier policy tightening, with a growth in disposable income from a surprisingly robust labor market also in the cards for next year. As to when the interest rates are going to come down, Hatzius believes that rate cuts are unlikely for at least more than two quarters with the first cuts expected to take place during the second quarter of 2024. The latest remarks come after a strong rally in the U.S. dollar which appears to have re calibrated demand for the greenback in global markets despite the hawkishness of the Federal Reserve seemingly appearing at its end.Story continuesIt also follows recent remarks from Hatzius made to CNBC which came after the latest labor market report. According to him:I think it's a very constructive report. We had a pretty good increase in non farm payrolls, in fact somewhat stronger than expected especially if you allow for some of the special factors, the yellow bankruptcy and the Hollywood writers strike. If you add that in your above 200 thousand. Household employment actually growing above 200 thousand as well. The increase in the unemployment rate that we saw, which is you know pretty sizeable, three tenths is pretty sizeable. But it was entirely driven by an increase is labor force participation, which is what you want to see. And then, the average hourly earnings number that showed a downside surprise, only a two tents increase, and that is also what the Fed wants to see because at this time wages are still growing somewhat faster than what is compatible with 2% inflation in the long term. So if I look at this, and then also if I bring in the JOLTS number, the job openings and quits numbers that we got early in the week, this is very consistent with a soft landing.Hatzius also believes that inflation will continue to drop last year and lead to interest rate cuts. However, the price increase rate is unlikely to touch the Fed's preferred 2% target range.Taking a brief look at what's going on within Goldman Sachs' walls as the market turns optimistic about the economy, the bank is currently attempting to refocus back to investment banking. The shift follows after Goldman decided to target consumer banking, but losses in the sector have rattled broader confidence in the bank's management. Its one of the few mega banks whose shares have not performed well this year, as stock is down 5% year to date. This makes the shares lag traditional rival Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) whose stock is flat year to date and post losses when compared to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) whose stock is up 8%.

This list was compiled by ranking some stocks in the bank's portfolio by their forward price to earnings ratio, with the top three picks being Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Zscaler, Inc.

Speaking of forward price to earnings, Goldman's Sachs P/E ratio is currently 8.67, while the ratios for JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley come out as 10.09 and 11.67, respectively. Seems like Wall Street is cautious about Goldman Sachs' growth prospects.But what about undervalued stocks?

The Company also expects to grant the initial purchasers of the Notes an option to purchase up to an additional $200 million aggregate principal amount of Notes for settlement within a 13-day period beginning on, and including, the date on which the notes are first issued, solely to cover over-allotments. The Notes are expected to be guaranteed by Seagate and Seagate Technology Unlimited Company.The Notes will be exchangeable under certain circumstances at the option of the holders into cash up to the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be exchanged, and cash, ordinary shares of Seagate, or a combination of both, at Seagate’s election, in respect of any remainder of the Company’s conversion obligation in excess of such principal amount. The interest rate, initial exchange rate and other terms of the Notes will be determined at the time of pricing of the offering.In connection with the pricing of the Notes, the Company and Seagate expect to enter into privately negotiated capped call transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers in the Note offering or their respective affiliates and/or other financial institutions (the ""option counterparties"") having an expiration date that is the same as the maturity date of the Notes. The capped call transactions are expected to cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the Notes, the same number of Seagate’s ordinary shares that will initially underly the Notes.Story continuesThe capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to Seagate’s ordinary shares and/or offset potential cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount, in each case, upon any exchange of the Notes, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. If the market price per ordinary share, as measured under the terms of the capped call transactions, exceeds the cap price of the capped call transactions, there would nevertheless be dilution and/or there would not be an offset of such potential cash payments, in each case, to the extent that such market price exceeds the cap price of the capped call transactions. If the initial purchasers of the Notes exercise their over-allotment option, the Company expects to enter into additional capped call with the option counterparties.The Company expects that, in connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates will enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Seagate’s ordinary shares and/or purchase Seagate’s ordinary shares concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the Notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of ordinary shares or the Notes at that time. In addition, the Company expects that the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to Seagate’s ordinary shares and/or by purchasing or selling Seagate’s ordinary shares or other securities of the Company in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the Notes and prior to the maturity of the Notes (and are likely to do so during the final observation period related to an exchange of the Notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of the ordinary shares or the Notes, which could affect the ability of holders to exchange their Notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to an exchange of the Notes, it could affect the amount of cash that holders will receive upon exchange of their Notes.The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes to repay existing indebtedness, including portions of the Company’s outstanding term loans and/or senior notes, and for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment of other outstanding indebtedness, capital expenditures and other investments in the business.This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. The Notes, guarantees, and ordinary shares to be offered have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, or applicable state securities laws, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration except pursuant to an applicable exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.About SeagateSeagate Technology is the leading innovator of mass-capacity data storage solutions.

The Company cannot assure that the offering will be consummated, nor can it guarantee the size or terms of the offering.

Ten percent will go to technology partner Huizhou, China-based EVE Energy, which has a U.S. sales office near Columbus, Ohio. EVE’s website shows test production of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells in the second quarter of 2022. Wednesday’s announcement talked about a factory with 21 gigawatt-hour capacity. That’s roughly the energy to power 16 million homes.LFP battery cells offer lower cost, longer life and enhanced safety, without using nickel and cobalt raw materials.The Cummins-Daimler-Paccar joint venture will manufacture battery cells for electric commercial vehicles and industrial applications. The total investment is expected to be $2 billion to $3 billion, the companies said in a news release.Daimler contracts for LFP batteries with Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL) for commercial trucks. It uses lithium-ion batteries from Proterra Inc. in its school bus and chassis businesses.‘Strict focus on costs and smart capital allocation’“For Daimler Truck, partnerships and a strict focus on costs and smart capital allocation are the key levers to succeed on the path towards sustainable transportation,” CEO Martin Daum said. “This planned joint venture enables economies of scale beyond Daimler Truck.“It is a key puzzle piece of our battery industrialization strategy, ensuring access to the right battery cell technology at the right cost.”Paccar had planned to use batteries from startup Romeo Power in a five-year agreement that began in 2020. Nikola Corp. later acquired Romeo and is liquidating its assets. Second-generation Paccar heavy-duty electric trucks should begin with DAF Trucks in Europe in 2024.“Our vision is the highest quality, locally produced battery technology to enhance the operations of our customers and help them achieve their operational and environmental goals,” Paccar CEO Preston Feight said.Story continuesCummins, through its Accelera unit, makes electric buses for Gillig as well as fully integrated electric chassis for commercial vehicles.“Not only are we advancing a key technology solution for our customers, but accelerating the energy transition in the United States,” Cummins CEO Jennifer Rumsey said.Surge in EV-related manufacturing projectsIncreased adoption of electric vehicles has produced more than $150 billion of EV-related manufacturing plant projects across 16 U.S. states, according to a new report from CBRE.Automakers General Motors, Ford and Stellantis have moved to locally produce batteries for electric vehicles. Ford announced in August a partnership with South Korean battery manufacturers SK On and EcoPro BM to build an $890 million cathode manufacturing facility in Quebec, Canada. It will provide battery materials for future Ford electric vehicles.Government incentives like the Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS and Science Act are designed to boost U.S. production of critical technologies for zero-emission EVs. In trucking, the demand is driven by California, which is banning new internal combustion-powered trucks from its roads by 2035.The joint venture likely will be reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States for any conflict with national security.Related articles:As electric batteries evolve, it’s all about the rangeVolvo, Mack replacing batteries on electric trucks because of fire risk Nikola will recall 209 battery-electric trucks following 2 firesClick for more FreightWaves articles by Alan Adler.The post Daimler Truck, Cummins and Paccar partner to make battery cells in US appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

Cummins (CMI), Paccar (PCAR), Daimler (MBG.DE) have created a joint venture that will spend $2 to $3 billion to build a battery cell factory in a yet to be determined U.S. location. Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Pras Subramanian breaks down the deal and discusses the growing EV investments in the United States.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Well, three companies are partnering to bring battery cell production to the US. The joint venture is going to be dedicated to accelerating and localizing battery cell manufacturing to the states. To tell us more about this and who is involved, Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian is joining us. So who's partnering up here?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Hey, Julie. So it's basically Accelera, which is engine maker Cummins's zero emissions arm, partnering with Daimler Truck and US truck maker PACCAR, which is behind brands like Kenworth and Peterbilt. They're forming a joint venture to make battery cells for commercial vehicles and other industrial applications. The JV will make LFP-type batteries, which are cheaper and better for heavy use and shorter distances, perfect for short-haul trucking.So the companies say the total investment will be around $2 to $3 billion with a 21-gigawatt hours of annual output. The JV did not say, however, where they'll actually build this factory, though perhaps near a Cummins or PACCAR plant in the US. But I got to say, Julie, it's another win for the US and EV battery investment in this country.JULIE HYMAN: And similarly, we're also seeing automakers investing in EVs in the US. So how does this project then fit into that bigger picture?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: So earlier today, the BlueGreen Alliance, which is a foundation that tracks sort of clean energy investment in environmental issues, tabulated some data and found out that through the last couple of years, the amount of total EV investments in batteries and plants and things like that is $154 billion in total investment and leading to about 188,000 total new jobs across the country and in that growing battery belt in the center of the country. So top five companies in terms of spend are LG, Tesla, GM, Ford, and SK Innovation, which is the South Korean battery company. So a lot of big deals in this space, more investment coming. It is, like I said, a big win for the White House and also backers of manufacturing here in the US.Story continuesBRAD SMITH: And so who right now, just as the broader context here, is the battery leader and who is making the best effort to really try and cut into that market share?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: In terms of making the most batteries in the US or in investment, I would say it's LG. They have the biggest investment, around $17 billion so far in the US. And they make batteries for GM, Ford as well, just sort of across the board there. But you see more from Tesla, Panasonic, and also SK Innovation, which is Ford's big partner. They're going to build-- they're helping Ford build a big plant in Tennessee and Kentucky that's coming up probably next year.BRAD SMITH: All right, great insights as always. Pras, thank you so much for helping us break this down. Appreciate it.]"

Rowe Price today released findings from its latest Defined Contribution Consultant Research Study. T. Rowe Price surveyed 32 defined contribution (DC) consultants and advisory firms—with a collective $6.7 trillion in assets under advisement—to explore factors driving plan sponsor decisions as they relate to target date solutions, retirement income, investment trends, and financial wellness programs.Several key themes emerged from the findings, including:Support for greater diversification opportunities within target date strategies, specifically within the fixed income allocation (e.g., adding exposure to nontraditional bonds);Plan sponsors adopting a more decision-oriented posture on retirement income solutions;Shaper focus on fixed income options due to the current interest rate environment;Support for both active and passive investment options, with high conviction in return-seeking fixed income strategies; andContinued motivation to invest in financial wellness programs to improve overall worker satisfaction and retention.QUOTESMichael Davis, Head of Defined Contribution plan specialists, T. Rowe Price, and former Deputy Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Department of Labor""Ongoing market volatility and economic uncertainty are driving changes in the retirement landscape, creating obstacles for the intermediary community, but also evolutionary opportunities for DC plans and consultant and advisory practices. This study helps us to better understand that evolution, especially as we compare the 2021 results to the 2023 findings. Fixed income markets are a perfect example – with tightening monetary conditions, higher interest rates, and inflation, it is not surprising that 62% of consultants and advisors surveyed agree with the statement, 'fixed income oversight for DC plans now requires more consideration than it did in prior years.'""Story continuesJessica Sclafani, Defined Contribution Specialist, T. Rowe Price""Data from this survey helps us put our fingertips on the pulse of what is important for our DC plan clients and their trusted consultants and advisors. An important learning from this year's survey was that the current market environment has created a unique opportunity for the industry to expand the way it thinks about offering participants exposure to fixed income, and more specifically, the types of fixed income made available—whether it's in a standalone investment or in multi-asset investment option. Fixed income has historically not received the same mindshare as equities, but amid the current interest rate environment, and with many plans experiencing an aging workforce, the time feels right to be talking about fixed income in DC plans. Another striking finding from this year's survey was DC plan sponsors' meaningful shift in sentiment with respect to in-plan retirement income solutions. On the whole, we observe plans evolving from an exploratory to a decision-oriented stance.""KEY FINDINGSWhen looking at target date solutions, two key implementation developments received strong support – target date solutions offered in a collective investment trust (CIT) and target date solutions utilizing both active and passive underlying strategies. With respect to target date diversification, adding exposure to nontraditional bonds garnered the most interest from DC consultants. Despite the recent inflationary environment, study results reveal only moderate support for adding or increasing allocations to traditional inflation-sensitive strategies in target date portfolios.The survey shows that plan sponsors are taking a close look at retirement income; the 2021 DC Consultant Study showed consultants describe 59% of clients as ""having no stated opinion"" on in-plan retirement income solutions versus only 24% in 2023. Data also shows the percent of clients that consultants categorize as currently offering or planning to add a retirement income solution has more than doubled: 8% of clients in 2021 compared with 19% in 2023. Despite increasing retirement income product proliferation, survey respondents identify a simple systematic withdrawal capability as the most appealing strategy or solution for the delivery of retirement income.The evolving fixed income landscape has made it necessary for many consultants to sharpen their focus on the asset class– 78% report a greater focus on identifying opportunities for diversification within fixed income, whether it is across the credit spectrum or global yield curve, as well as by method of implementation (active or passive). Fixed income is also where respondents express the greatest conviction in active management. At least half of respondents selected active management as their preferred method of implementation for core plus bond/multi-sector, corporate bond (investment grade), international or global bond, low duration bond, and high yield bond strategies.Study respondents generally approve of the use of both active and passive investment strategies in DC plans overall. Most preferred both active and passive investment options for large-cap equity, small-/mid-cap equity, and international equity. Notably, more than half (52%) of respondents believe emerging markets equity is best implemented using active management.Additionally, research showed the primary motivation for plan sponsors to invest in financial wellness programs came from the desire to improve worker satisfaction and retention and reduce employee financial stress. The topics that matter most were improving overall financial knowledge and estimating retirement income needs – with 43% and 54% of respondents respectively believing that the importance of these issues has increased over the last 12 months.The Defined Contribution Research Study was conducted during Q1 2023. The executive summary is available here.ABOUT THE DEFINED CONTRIBUTION RESEARCH STUDYThe 2023 Defined Contribution Research Study was conducted by T. Rowe Price in partnership with Schaus Group.

After collapsing almost 20% last year, the S&amp;P 500 is up 26% from its lows. That’s almost good enough to be classified as a bull market.However it pulled back a bit from its recent peak, then jumped again, introducing future uncertainty.Investors should use due caution in this environment. Cooling inflation and better than expected corporate earnings amid a robust economy suggests more room to run. On the other hand, rising consumer indebtedness and tight credit markets fuels suspicion of a looming recession. The New York Federal Reserve (FED)predicts a 66% chance of a recession by summer of 2024.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNow is the time to find safe haven value stocks. Protect your portfolio’s downside while still offering potential for capital appreciation. These three reliable value stocks look like a perfect fit regardless of the market’s direction.American Express (AXP)an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocketSource: ShutterstockFew businesses have the cachet of credit services provider American Express (NYSE:AXP). “You can’t create another American Express,” Warren Buffett told Bloomberg in December. AXP is the fourth biggest holding in Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A NYSE:BRK-B). Also, AXP is the fourth largest general-purpose card network in the world based on purchase volume. And it’s definitely in first place when it comes to prestige credit cards.How does AmEx make most of it revenue? It’s not interest charges, but rather the fees it charges merchants for facilitating those transactions. The company’s term “discount revenue” totaled $30.7 billion in 2022, up 25% from the year prior. In contrast, interest income was just $12.7 billion.Because it targets wealthier, high-spending customers, American Express’ business doesn’t feel the impact of market or economic downturns as hard. Its card members spend on average as much as three times more annually than non-members.Story continuesThat makes American Express stock one you don’t want to leave home without.Genuine Parts (GPC)5 Great Blue-Chip Stocks to BuySource: ShutterstockAuto parts retailer Genuine Parts (NYSE:GPC) is a great stock to buy now. The average new vehicle cost is at $48,334 with interest rates on a new car purchase average 6.58%. Used car average price is just over $27K with interest rates at 11.7%. It might be better than a year ago, but it’s still an historically pricey time to buy a car.People are simply choosing to not buy new or used cars, preferring instead to keep their old jalopy running. Cox Automotive says July repair order volume dropped 7.8% at franchised dealerships in the U.S.Genuine Parts owns the 9,600-store NAPA Auto Parts chain. Helping consumers keep their cars on the road by owner-repair is a booming business. The auto parts retailer reported record Q2 sales of $5.9 billion last week and raised its outlook for the full year.Even better, GPC pays a dividend and has done so for 75 straight years. It also raised the payout for 67 consecutive years, making it a Dividend King. The dividend currently yields 2.5% annually. The auto parts specialist stock is one to buy.UnitedHealth Group (UNH)The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comUnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) should also rank high on the list of stocks to buy for downside protection in an uncertain market. The insurer is a defensive play for your portfolio. Your health is something you just can’t go without. Doctor visits, prescription medications, and even emergency services are all necessary and remain in high demand regardless of the way the economy turns.UnitedHealth revenues jumped 16% in Q2 to $93 billion. Insurance provides the vast bulk of those revenues (78%). But its Optum health services business is the true growth engine, as revenue jumped 25% to $56 billion. Despite being the smaller of the two arms, Optum is also more profitable. Operating margin was 6.2% versus 5.9% at the insurance business.Also, UnitedHealth’s stock is cheap, going 17 times next year’s earnings estimates, less than twice sales, and a discounted 11 times free cash flow. The insurer also pays a dividend yielding a modest 1.5% annually that will help soften the blow of any market downdraft.

(NASDAQ:NTAP) has been quite strong recently and CEO George Kurian has played a role in it. Coming up to the next AGM on 13th of September, shareholders would be keeping this in mind. The focus will probably be on the future company strategy as shareholders cast their votes on resolutions such as executive remuneration and other matters. In light of the great performance, we discuss the case why we think CEO compensation is not excessive. Check out our latest analysis for NetApp Comparing NetApp, Inc.'s CEO Compensation With The IndustryOur data indicates that NetApp, Inc. has a market capitalization of US$17b, and total annual CEO compensation was reported as US$11m for the year to April 2023. We note that's a decrease of 40% compared to last year. While this analysis focuses on total compensation, it's worth acknowledging that the salary portion is lower, valued at US$1.0m.For comparison, other companies in the American Tech industry with market capitalizations above US$8.0b, reported a median total CEO compensation of US$14m. From this we gather that George Kurian is paid around the median for CEOs in the industry. Moreover, George Kurian also holds US$22m worth of NetApp stock directly under their own name, which reveals to us that they have a significant personal stake in the company.Component20232022Proportion (2023)SalaryUS$1.0mUS$991k9%OtherUS$10mUS$18m91%Total CompensationUS$11mUS$19m100%On an industry level, roughly 19% of total compensation represents salary and 81% is other remuneration. In NetApp's case, non-salary compensation represents a greater slice of total remuneration, in comparison to the broader industry. It's important to note that a slant towards non-salary compensation suggests that total pay is tied to the company's performance.Story continuesceo-compensationA Look at NetApp, Inc.'s Growth NumbersOver the past three years, NetApp, Inc. has seen its earnings per share (EPS) grow by 18% per year. Its revenue is down 3.9% over the previous year.Overall this is a positive result for shareholders, showing that the company has improved in recent years. The lack of revenue growth isn't ideal, but it is the bottom line that counts most in business. Historical performance can sometimes be a good indicator on what's coming up next but if you want to peer into the company's future you might be interested in this free visualization of analyst forecasts.Has NetApp, Inc. Been A Good Investment?Most shareholders would probably be pleased with NetApp, Inc. for providing a total return of 96% over three years. So they may not be at all concerned if the CEO were to be paid more than is normal for companies around the same size.To Conclude...Given the company's decent performance, the CEO remuneration policy might not be shareholders' central point of focus in the AGM. Instead, investors might be more interested in discussions that would help manage their longer-term growth expectations such as company business strategies and future growth potential.We can learn a lot about a company by studying its CEO compensation trends, along with looking at other aspects of the business. We identified 2 warning signs for NetApp (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) that you should be aware of before investing here.Important note: NetApp is an exciting stock, but we understand investors may be looking for an unencumbered balance sheet and blockbuster returns.

347,3f35aed5-7e97-3ec0-b9da-8cf937dac619,TSCO,2023-09-07,Will Tractor Supply's (TSCO) Growth Plans Aid Amid Inflation?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tractor-supplys-tsco-growth-plans-142500190.html,1694010300.0,STORY,"['TSCO', 'WMT']","[Tractor Supply Company TSCO has been long gaining from robust demand and strength in Life Out Here Strategy. Its e-commerce business and Neighbor's Club loyalty program are impressive.These led to sturdy year-over-year performance in second-quarter 2023. The company’s earnings of $3.83 per share rose 8.5% year over year. Net sales advanced 7.2% year over year to $4,184.7 million, driven by contributions from the acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home, store openings, and comparable store sales growth.Comps improved 2.5% year over year but lagged our estimate of 5.3% growth. Comparable average transaction count improved 1.8%, while comparable average ticket grew 0.6%. Sturdy demand for core year-round merchandise including consumable, usable and edible products contributed to comps growth.Consequently, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock inched up 1% against the industry’s decline of 3.9%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s dive deeper.Growth StrategiesThe company is on track to build up on Tractor Supply’s Out Here lifestyle assortment and convenient shopping format to gain new customers and market share. The strategy is essentially based on five key pillars, which include customers, digitization, execution, team members and total shareholder return.As part of plans, it revised long-term financial growth targets for 2022-2026. Management still envisions achieving net sales growth of 6-7%, while comps are expected to climb 4-5%. The operating margin is now anticipated to be 10.1-10.6%, up from the earlier mentioned 9-9.5%. Earnings per share are likely to jump 8-11%, up from the previously projected 8-10%.Earlier, it launched Field Activity Support Team, and implemented various technology and service enhancements across the enterprise.TSCO remains focused on its growth initiatives, which include expansion of store base and incorporation of technological advancements to induce traffic and drive the top line. It is well positioned to increase its domestic store to 2,500 in the long term. In the second quarter, it opened 17 Tractor Supply stores and three Petsense stores. Management intends to open 70 Tractor Supply stores and 10-15 Petsense stores in 2023.The company announced an update to its long-term store plan and several new real estate programs to strengthen its balance sheet and real estate portfolio. As part of this, it set a target of 3,000 Tractor Supply stores in the United States, up 200 locations from its prior guidance. Also, it anticipates accelerating its annual new store growth to 80 stores in 2024 and 90 per year in 2025.Another key component of the company’s space productivity initiatives is the transformation of its Side Lot. Project Fusion and Side Lot model transformations have been significant investments toward stores. These store investments target achieving higher market share and boosting productivity across existing and new stores. Notably, TSCO boasts more than 700 Project Fusion stores, accounting for 30% of its store base.Its ONETractor strategy, aimed at connecting store and online shopping, bodes well. The company’s omni-channel investments include curbside pickup, same-day and next-day delivery, a re-launched website and new mobile app. Earlier, it launched Tractor Supply Visa Credit Card, which allows customers to earn points on their everyday purchases, both in-store and anywhere Visa is accepted.Tractor Supply exited the second quarter with 31 million Neighbor's Club members, driven by all-time high retention rates and re-launch of the point-based structure of its Neighbor's Club program. Rebranding of Petsense by Tractor Supply and expansion of its Neighbor's Club program to Petsense stores received positive customer feedback. These moves will enable it to gain new pet customers for both banners. Management earlier predicted to reach more than $2 billion in sales by 2026.Story continuesHeadwinds to OvercomeTractor Supply has been reeling under inflation woes and rising costs.  In second-quarter 2023, SG&amp;A expenses including depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of sales, expanded 77 bps year over year to 22.8%. In dollar terms, SG&amp;A expenses including depreciation and amortization rose 10.9% year over year to $955.4 million and came ahead of our estimate of $867.9 million. Higher SG&amp;A expenses resulted from increased depreciation and amortization, opening of a distribution center and impacts of raised medical claims.As a result, management revised its guidance for 2023, which seems dull. It expects net sales of $14.8-$14.9 billion, down from earlier mentioned $15-$15.3 billion and in-sync with our estimate of $14.8 billion. Meanwhile, comps are likely to grow 1.3-2.5%, down from the prior stated 3.5-5.5% rise. We estimate the metric to inch up 1.6%.Operating margin is anticipated to be 10.2-10.3% compared with 10.1-10.3% mentioned earlier. Earnings per share are estimated to be $10.20-$10.40, down from $10.30-$10.60 expected earlier but in-sync with our forecast of $10.24.Wrapping UpAll said, online strength, solid demand and well chalked-out endeavors are likely to help the stock offset inflation led cost woes. Topping it, a long-term earnings growth rate of 7.8% and a VGM Score of A reflects its inherent strength.Analysts also seem optimistic about the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TSCO 2023 sales and EPS is pegged at $14.9 billion and $10.27, suggesting respective growth of 4.7% and 5.8% from the year-ago reported figures.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies are BJ's Restaurants BJRI, Urban Outfitters URBN and Walmart WMT.BJ's Restaurants, which operates a chain of high-end casual dining restaurants in the United States, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Designed to further advance the procedural performance and safety of the WATCHMAN technology, which is indicated to reduce stroke risk in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) who need an alternative to oral anticoagulation therapy, the device now features a polymer coating, visualization markers and a broader size matrix to treat a wider range of patients.Experience the interactive Multichannel News Release here: https://www.multivu.com/players/English/9029355-boston-scientific-watchman-flx-pro-fda-approval/ The WATCHMAN FLX Pro device is built upon the proven safety and procedural performance of the WATCHMAN FLX™ LAAC device, which was approved in July 2020 and has been used in nearly 190,000 of the more than 300,000 WATCHMAN procedures successfully completed to date globally. The latest WATCHMAN FLX Pro device is enhanced with a coating designed to reduce device-related thrombus and enable faster, controlled healing and endothelization of the device surface. In addition, newly added visualization markers are intended to enhance device placement for optimal sealing around the LAA. This device is also available in a new 40mm size option, which will enable physicians to treat a broader range of anatomies with the WATCHMAN technology.""We are pleased to introduce U.S. clinicians to our newest LAAC technology, which is designed to enhance post-procedural healing, improve the precision of WATCHMAN FLX Pro implants, and expand the size range of treatable appendages,"" said Joe Fitzgerald, group president, Cardiology, Boston Scientific. ""These enhancements to our WATCHMAN FLX technology will enable efficiency during implant procedures and allow physicians to optimize treatment for their patients.""Story continuesPreclinical research for the new technology has shown positive results for faster, more controlled healing around the device surface. Data across several of these preclinical studies demonstrated that the polymer coating provided an 86% reduction in inflammation three days following the procedure, a 70% reduction of thrombus at 14 days and a 50% increase in endothelial tissue coverage 45 days post procedure.1 ""There is a rich history of safe use and low thrombosis rates in cardiovascular devices that utilize this thromboresistant polymer coating, and we have adapted that model to provide a more streamlined healing process that begins immediately following LAAC,"" said Dr. Kenneth Stein, M.D., senior vice president and global chief medical officer, Boston Scientific. ""We believe this evolution of the WATCHMAN device also gives promise for a future with less thrombosis risk, which may eventually enable a simpler post-implant drug regimen for patients.""The WATCHMAN FLX Pro device maintains key characteristics of the WATCHMAN FLX device, including the fully rounded design that enables physicians to safely enter, and maneuver within, the left atrial appendage. It can also be fully recaptured, repositioned and redeployed for precise placement, and the frame design allows for optimal device engagement with the tissue for long-term stability and a faster, more complete seal.The WATCHMAN FLX Pro device is currently being studied in the WATCHMAN FLX Pro CT study, a single-center premarket study using multiple imaging modalities to assess post-procedural device tissue coverage and the relationship, if any, to clinical outcomes. It will also be further evaluated in the post-market HEAL-LAA study, which will commence over the coming weeks and follow outcomes from approximately 1,000 patients with NVAF implanted with the technology at 60 sites in the U.S.For more information on the WATCHMAN FLX Pro device, visit www.watchman.com/flxpro.About Boston ScientificBoston Scientific transforms lives through innovative medical solutions that improve the health of patients around the world.

The award has been offered by the Naval Supply Systems Command Weapon Systems Support, Philadelphia, PA.Valued at $173.6 million, the contract is expected to be completed by August 2026. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will provide support for the repair of landing gear used on the F/A-18 E/F aircraft.A major portion of the work related to this contract will be executed in Quebec, Canada and St. Louis, MO.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has several combat proven aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk. BA's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, have resulted in a solid inflow of jet delivery and support orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such strong order flows are expected to boost the defense business segment’s top line.Growth ProspectsWith the United States being the world’s largest weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, a prominent jet maker, therefore enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global military aviation market is expected to witness a CAGR of 7.4% during 2023-2028. North America constitutes the largest share of the aforementioned market.Such developments can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities as well as increased defense spending. These projections are expected to benefit Boeing, along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Story continuesSince its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of combat manned aircraft. The company has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime and anywhere, under any condition.NOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 sales implies a 5.6% improvement from that reported in 2022.Lockheed’s Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacturing, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Its major programs include F-35, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor jets.LMT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.5%. Shares of Lockheed Martin rose 5.9% in the past year.Textron’s business unit Textron Aviation Defense designs, builds and supports versatile and globally-known military aircraft, preferred for training and attack missions. The unit’s military trainer and defense aircraft includes the T-6 trainer, which has been used to train pilots from more than 20 countries, and the AT-6 light attack military aircraft.TXT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 11.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 sales implies a 7.7% improvement from the previous year’s reported figure.Price Movement and Zacks RankShares of Boeing have risen 42.7% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 4.3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The offering also provides human assistance using Intuit's live platform when needed.The assistant was developed using the software behemoth's generative AI-based proprietary operating system named GenOS, which was launched in June to help Intuit developers incorporate AI across the company's products.Within TurboTax, Intuit Assist uses the company's tax domain expertise, rich data and proprietary, AI-powered Tax Knowledge Engine to determine consumers' specific tax situation and navigate the tax code. It will create a personalized tax checklist based on data a customer shares at the start of the tax preparation process to provide answers to their questions, customized insights and recommendations. The assistant will also work with TurboTax Live to assist human experts with personalized answers based on aggregated insights, the company said.Intuit Assist in TurboTaxImage Credits: IntuitSimilarly, for Credit Karma users, the digital assistant will help them provide personalized answers to their money questions. It will use customers' financial data to offer distinct answers and recommendations, including a personalized set of financial options.The assistant will also be a part of QuickBooks to help small businesses by, for example, showing cash flow hot spots and identifying top-selling products and spending anomalies. It will also help small and midsize businesses get started with QuickBooks if they are new to the platform and will help to import data from their website to personalize the profile. Further, the assistant will help generate invoice reminders, which can be customized in terms of tone and length, the company said.Story continuesFor small businesses, entrepreneurs and marketers running email campaigns using Mailchimp, Intuit said its generative AI-based assistant will help them personalize their marketing at scale and create their campaigns based on their brand's identity and market intent. It will allow them to change the tone, text and image faster.Once the campaign is designed, Intuit Assist can help schedule it to be sent and added to the company's marketing calendar. Additionally, it can generate automated draft email content using product and service data from QuickBooks. The assistant can also add customers to the Mailchimp sales pipeline for long-term tracking in case businesses have longer sales cycles or lead qualification processes.Intuit Assist in MailchimpImage Credits: IntuitAt the core of Intuit Assist is GenOS, the operating system that comprises four blocks: GenStudio to interact with large language models, GenRuntime to allow automatic orchestration, GenUX to provide customer-facing applications for user interaction and user flows based on large language models and, finally, large language models themselves, which include both the third-party ones and Intuit's in-house models.Intuit chief data officer Ashok Srivastava told TechCrunch that GenOS could switch between the company's own large language models and those developed by third parties based on the need of the context. The company did not want to have a ""myriad of point solutions"" — separate options for different products — and thus chose a single solution.""I'm fully aware that other companies are investing in large language models, and I congratulate them on that. We're not only doing that, but we're [also] building an entire operating system on top of it,"" Srivastava said in an interview.Intuit has been looking at AI as its next focus area for some time, and its CEO Sasan Goodarzi well conveyed it in the past. In 2020, the company even laid off hundreds of employees with obsolete skills and added a similar number of new roles to mark the shift.Intuit’s shiftThe early move toward AI advancements helped Intuit get some attractive numbers: 810 million AI-driven customer interactions per year, over 25 million conversations processed using natural language processing per year, 65 billion machine learning predictions per day, 2 million AI models in production that are refreshed daily and around 900 AI, machine learning and data science patents.""We started investing in generative AI long before people made the big splash last year,"" Srivastava said. ""When we invest in creating revolutionary experiences for our customers, it will enhance our business.""Having said that, deploying generative AI involves challenges. One of which is how companies deal with customer privacy. In the case of Intuit, it is even crucial as the company is working with its customers' financial and transactional data.Srivastava told TechCrunch that the company developed a set of principles and created an AI governance team to ensure that it has the ""right level of transparency"" in AI and is ""adhering to privacy and security.""""We review the use of AI across the company and ensure that it adheres to our AI principles. These include ensuring that the work that we're doing powers prosperity. It's enhancing human talents so that the human talent, whether it's the human experts' talent, consumers' talent or small business owners' talent . . . is enhanced, that it's fair and that the AI is being used to improve the financial lives of everyone, including groups that have historically been excluded from access to financial services, accountability, we follow a very thoughtful approach to ensuring that we're accountable for the use of explainability,"" he stated.The other problem with generative AI is hallucination, in which AI systems generate inaccurate, unrealistic or entirely fabricated information, data or content. Currently, no generative AI model can completely eliminate incorrect responses. Even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has not yet outrightly promised its fix. The problem could have significant consequences when it comes to taxes and financial advice.Are AI models doomed to always hallucinate?However, Srivastava said Intuit's approach to using large and relevant datasets helps ensure it is delivering ""accurate answers to customers and mitigating the risk of hallucination or other types of inaccurate or inappropriate answers.""""When Intuit Assist provides an answer or gives guidance to a customer, it's drawing on the deep expertise that Intuit has developed over many years, plus the data that gives us a 360-degree view of the customer. This helps make sure the answer given by Intuit Assist is not generic or hallucinatory, but is relevant and grounded in the customer's own data, and reflects the years of domain expertise that Intuit has built around powering prosperity,"" he said.Intuit Assist in TurboTax is currently accessible to customers, with planned enhancements set to debut for the 2023 tax season, while the assistant is available to select Credit Karma members in the U.S. and will be rolled out more widely in the coming months. It is also available to select beta customers on QuickBooks and will roll out to all U.S. users in the coming months. Moreover, it is currently accessible to a specific group of Mailchimp customers, with a broader expansion slated for the upcoming months.""Leveraging our vast amounts of rich data and years of investment in AI and GenAI, we're unlocking the power of our platform to reimagine AI-assisted customer experiences,"" Goodarzi said in a prepared statement.This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/06/intuit-assist-generative-ai-assistant/]"
365,a8c1acb9-460f-35e6-8f82-a3c29d3ba721,INTU,2023-09-07,Intuit cut hundreds of jobs and spent at least $20 billion in a massive bet on AI. Today the company is revealing its new virtual assistant,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intuit-cut-hundreds-jobs-spent-120000980.html,1694001600,STORY,['INTU'],"[When he was running Intuit’s TurboTax and QuickBooks businesses, Sasan Goodarzi had a startling realization: No matter how much work the company put into helping people calculate their own taxes or keep their own books, they didn’t really want to do those things at all.“I realized that building out a platform for our customers to do the work was not actually the future,” he recalls. “The future was, it’s done for you.”The light bulb moment spurred Goodarzi, who became CEO in 2019, to lead the company into a massive strategy reset putting AI at the center of the business. The revamp has included two major acquisitions costing $20 billion in total, firing hundreds of employees, and investing heavily into AI, years before the technology made a blockbuster debut into the public consciousness.The company has been incorporating elements of AI into its business for years, but its first major stand-alone A.I. product for consumers, called Intuit Assist, debuts today. It’s embedded into products including TurboTax, Credit Karma, QuickBooks, and Mailchimp, and the company says it can do everything from foreseeing a looming cash crunch at a small business to creating and executing an email marketing campaign. Goodarzi believes that an early gamble on AI, along with a massive trove of data, is a winning strategy to extend the company’s domination of tax and accounting software for individuals and small businesses. And he has quite literally bet his entire company on the idea that millions of people will trust an AI service to recommend specific, personalized business decisions.“At the end of the day, there are certain decisions you have to make,” Goodarzi says. “And the decision I made was, as a team, we’re going to bet the company on data and AI.""A big bet on big dataIntuit has a long history of changing with the times.The company launched in 1983 with personal finance software called Quicken. Specialized PC software was hot back then, but Intuit’s peers from that year (Flexidraw, VisiCalc) are long gone. It has outlived them all by continually disrupting itself to meet the advent of Microsoft Windows, the internet, mobile devices, and other revolutionary innovations that competitors couldn’t handle.Story continuesToday the company is best known for creating TurboTax, the bestselling tax prep software, and QuickBooks, the No. 1 accounting software for small and medium-size businesses. Since the company went public in 1993, the S&amp;P index has risen 902%, and the Nasdaq has risen 1,940%. Intuit stock is up 23,190%. Most of the Wall Street analysts covering the stock rate it a Buy. None rate it Underweight or Sell.Despite Intuit’s history of constant transformation, when Goodarzi decided to put AI at the center of its business model in 2019, not all of his top lieutenants agreed. “It was a big debate,” he recalls. “Five years ago, putting AI at the core was hard to see. You had to have a belief.”The deciding factor in that decision was the company’s incredible trove of data—something that AI needs to train, and what enables the company to give detailed financial recommendations tailored to each customer. “AI is really useless if you don’t have vast data and clean data,” Goodarzi told Fortune three years ago. Speaking more recently, he said that when it came to a new strategy, “the decision I made was, we’re going to bet the company on data and AI.”Intuit already had data from its 57 million customers, which gave it a significant advantage when it came to financially focused AI. Then in 2020, Goodarzi bought Credit Karma, a personal money management platform, for $8.1 billion. That brought in 110 million consumers and their financial data. And in 2021 he bought Mailchimp, a marketing platform, for $12 billion. That brought in 10 million more customers and their data.“Everybody wants to talk about how great their data is,” says Jackson Ader, a MoffettNathanson analyst who covers the company. “But Intuit’s dataset, on the consumer side or small-business side—it’s second to none.”Amid these acquisitions and a strategy shift, Goodarzi made an unprecedented move in 2020—firing 715 employees, the first mass layoff in the company’s history. Moving AI to the core was going too slowly, Goodarzi felt, and Intuit’s ambitious reskilling program couldn’t work fast enough. He replaced the departing workers with over 700 new ones, largely people with AI skills. “We were starting to see momentum in our bets around data and AI,” he says, “but we knew we didn’t have the talent at the level that was needed to accelerate what was possible. We took those dollars and reinvested them in the craft skills we needed.”Goodarzi’s grand goalsIntuit says the generative AI–powered assistant it introduced today will offer personalized analyses and recommendations for anyone who runs a small business, files their taxes, manages finances, or markets products and services.For example, besides warning a small business of an impending cash crunch, Intuit says it can now create an email marketing campaign—strategy, images, words, which customers to target—analyze the results, and recommend next steps. The company says it can also give personalized recommendations to a consumer who lives paycheck to paycheck and confronts an unexpected expense, or help an entrepreneur get started, importing data from the entrepreneur’s website and taking on day-to-day chores such as sending invoice reminders to customers.Intuit has a long AI head start against its competitors including H&amp;R Block, Cash App, TaxSlayer, Xero, FreshBooks, and others. The company is hoping its early investment will produce a network effect, in which good AI-generated recommendations attract more customers, bringing in more data, improving the company’s products, therefore attracting more customers.But the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT last November raised the fear, at least among investors, that the company had been ambushed. Who would need Intuit’s AI products if anyone could ask free or low-cost generative AI to do almost anything? The fear deepened when OpenAI introduced GPT-4 three months later and demoed its ability to calculate taxes—calling the system TaxGPT and asking it to answer the tax problem of a fictional couple, to show how it arrived at its answer, and, as a flourish, to write a rhyming poem summarizing it all (“To calculate their tax, it’s true/A standard deduction we must construe…”).The fears are unwarranted—for now. GPT-4 can read the tax code, but it can’t give personalized recommendations because it doesn’t have Intuit’s massive proprietary dataset. GPT-4 is “more friend than potential threat” to Intuit, says Ader, because Intuit “has the data—that is what they have in spades.”Investors seem to like Intuit’s A.I.-powered strategy to date. The stock has far outperformed the S&amp;P and Nasdaq since Goodarzi took the helm. But he feels certain his controversial call of five years ago has a long way yet to play out. His goals are broadscale: to double the savings rate of customers on Intuit’s platform by 2025 (the U.S. personal savings rate was 3.5% in July) and to increase the success rate of small and medium businesses on the platform by 20 percentage points by 2030 (about 50% of new businesses fail in the first five years). As for the company itself, Intuit expects its revenue to increase 11% to 12% in the fiscal year ending July 31, 2024, and expects earnings per share to increase 11% to 15%.Goodarzi considers A.I. a general-purpose technology as transformative as electricity and the internet. “We are at the beginning of the journey with A.I.,” he says. “In the next five to 10 years it will create new economies and destroy some economies, will create new experiences, fuel new company growth, and make certain companies go out of business.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeWant more for your money?

(Nasdaq: INTU), the global financial technology platform that makes Intuit TurboTax, Credit Karma, QuickBooks, and Mailchimp, today introduced Intuit Assist, a new generative AI (GenAI)-powered assistant that will provide personalized, intelligent recommendations to help consumer and small business customers make smart financial decisions with less work and complete confidence, enabling them to put more money in their pockets.This press release features multimedia.

Intuit Assist uses powerful and relevant contextual data sets spanning small business, consumer finance, and tax to deliver personalized financial insights to our 100 million small business and consumer customers. This data, combined with the power of Intuit’s AI-driven expert platform and the accelerated investment the company has made in GenAI, will deliver game-changing new experiences. Intuit Assist will intuitively show, guide, help, and do the hard work for users, and connect customers to experts on our Live Platform to provide human assistance when needed.""With the introduction of Intuit Assist, we’re taking a giant step forward in powering prosperity for all. We’re creating a future where we do the hard work for small businesses and consumers to fuel their financial success, helping them achieve their dreams,"" said Sasan Goodarzi, chief executive officer of Intuit. ""Leveraging our vast amounts of rich data and years of investment in AI and GenAI, we’re unlocking the power of our platform to reimagine AI-assisted customer experiences.""Story continuesIntuit Assist spans the company’s products to harness their power and deliver new benefits in all-new ways to improve customers’ financial lives. Intuit Assist will leverage rich customer data with AI and human experts to empower consumers and small business owners to more confidently make smart financial decisions. It will help level the playing field for entrepreneurs and small businesses that don’t have access to the same resources their larger enterprise competitors do, supporting those who need it the most.""AI is fundamentally changing how we work and live. As people start to make financial decisions with the help of this technology, responsible stewardship and accuracy are paramount,"" said Patrick Moorhead, founder, CEO, and chief analyst at Moor Insights &amp; Strategy. ""We believe Intuit stands out for its ability to harness robust data across the small business, tax, and consumer finance segments to deliver accurate and personalized AI-driven experiences at scale. This responsible stewardship, paired with Intuit’s investments in AI and data over the last decade, boils down to a generative AI leadership position in the consumer and small business fintech space.""Consumers will find it easier than ever to manage and improve their financial lives. They’ll be able to get personalized recommendations throughout the year, with actions they can take to maximize their tax refund and accurately file taxes in record time with TurboTax. And they’ll be given the tools to make smart money decisions throughout their financial journey with Credit Karma. For example:Intuit Assist for TurboTax - Underpinned by Intuit’s decades of tax domain expertise, rich data, and proprietary, AI-powered Tax Knowledge Engine, Intuit Assist will work alongside tax filers of any income or complexity, helping them every step of the way. It will get to know a consumer’s individual tax situation and apply its knowledge, navigating the tax code, including the latest changes. This will help reduce tax preparation time and help consumers gain faster access to refunds, with complete confidence that their taxes are done accurately.At the start of the tax preparation process, Intuit Assist will create a personalized tax checklist based on data the customer shares, enabling TurboTax and human tax experts to leverage the power of AI to proactively provide fast answers, personalized insights, and recommendations. In TurboTax Live, Intuit Assist will work alongside the experts to help them serve customers even more efficiently. Intuit Assist will augment tax experts’ knowledge with fast, personalized answers based on aggregated, data-driven insights, reducing the time spent searching, finding, and synthesizing responses for customers.Whether a customer is filing on their own in TurboTax or working with a tax expert assisted by AI in TurboTax Live, Intuit Assist will unlock new value in TurboTax. Intuit Assist is available to customers now, with enhancements rolling out in the coming months for the 2023 tax season. More information is available here.Intuit Assist for Credit Karma - Credit Karma members will be able to use Intuit Assist to get highly personalized answers to their money questions. When a member comes to Credit Karma with a question about how to manage their finances, they aren’t met with a generic response. Instead, Intuit Assist will be able to connect the dots for members and provide personalized assistance based on their own financial data. This is what Intuit Assist does best: it will identify the right opportunities at the right time and make relevant recommendations, so members can take advantage of better financial products and optimize their spending. By helping members contextualize and understand their finances through two-way conversations, Intuit Assist will empower members to confidently take action, or give it permission to take action on their behalf. Take the example of a member who has connected their accounts, lives paycheck to paycheck, and has an unexpected expense, such as a car breakdown costing them hundreds of dollars. Intuit Assist will notify the member that they’re running low on cash for the month and help formulate a plan to avoid a cash crunch. It will provide a personalized set of financing options, enable the member to clearly assess their options and tradeoffs, and empower them to apply for the product that’s right for them. This can help the member find ways to cover their upcoming expenses until their next paycheck. Intuit Assist is now available to select US members and will become available more widely in the coming months. More information is available here.Small businesses will grow and thrive using QuickBooks and Mailchimp to run their business end to end and engage their customers with powerful marketing tools, all available with the click of a button. Whether starting up or scaling up, small businesses will have more time to do the work they love in service to their customers. For example:Intuit Assist for QuickBooks - Intuit Assist will tip the odds of success in favor of small businesses, providing guidance on how to adapt, react, and make informed business decisions. From surfacing cash flow hot spots to identifying top-selling products and spending anomalies, small businesses will have access to AI-powered assistance that unearths relevant insights based on their business performance and their customers’ behavior. For example, Intuit Assist will be able to deliver deep insights based on simple requests or questions such as ""show me my profit and loss for last month"" or ""how many of my invoices are overdue?"" It will dynamically predict follow-up questions and answer in clear, natural language.For small and mid-size businesses not yet using QuickBooks, Intuit Assist will revolutionize how they get started, automatically importing data from their website into QuickBooks to personalize the business’s profile. It will take on day-to-day tasks, such as generating invoice reminders, which can be customized to be more friendly in tone or shorter in length. In QuickBooks Live, Intuit Assist will work alongside human bookkeeping and tax experts to help them serve more customers even more efficiently. Intuit Assist is now live to select beta customers and will roll out to all U.S. QuickBooks customers in the coming months. More information is available here.Intuit Assist for Mailchimp - Small businesses, entrepreneurs, and marketers at any size business can direct Intuit Assist to do more of their marketing. As their new GenAI assistant, it will help them personalize marketing at scale and make data-backed decisions to measure, fine-tune, and optimize campaign effectiveness. For example, Intuit Assist will help them create an entire marketing campaign based on a brand's identity and marketing intent, targeted toward a specific audience. With a few clicks it will change the tone, the text, the image, or generate something totally new based on the guidance it’s given and the information it has from its rich, relevant data sets. Once customers are happy with the campaign, they can schedule it to be sent, and it will be added to the company’s marketing calendar. Intuit Assist for Mailchimp will then surface a follow-up action plan to ensure high campaign engagement. It will also generate automated draft email content in their Mailchimp inbox using product and service data from QuickBooks. For businesses with longer sales cycles or lead qualification processes, Intuit Assist will automatically add a customer to their Mailchimp sales pipeline for easy tracking of the customer life cycle, from lead to sale. This helps them prioritize leads and automate follow-ups so that they can take on higher-value clients and more profitable work. Intuit Assist is now live to select Mailchimp customers and will roll out more widely in the coming months. More information is available here.Intuit’s Proprietary Generative AI Operating System (GenOS) Enables Rapid Innovation Intuit Assist was developed using the company’s proprietary GenAI operating system (GenOS), and is designed to run with our own financial large language models (LLMs) that are fine-tuned to solve tax, accounting, cash flow, personal finance, and marketing challenges.

SRDX has been gaining from its solid prospects in the thrombectomy business over the past few months. The optimism led by a solid third-quarter fiscal 2023 performance and its consistent efforts to boost research and development (R&amp;D) are expected to contribute further. Yet, concerns related to reliance on third parties and data security threats persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock has gained 12.3% against the 3.5% decline of the industry. The S&amp;P 500 has witnessed 13.1% growth in the said time frame.The renowned medical device and in-vitro diagnostics technology provider has a market capitalization of $513.9 million. Surmodics projects 76.8% growth for fiscal 2023, expecting to maintain its strong performance. SRDX’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average earnings surprise being 71.2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Consistent Efforts to Boost R&amp;D: Surmodics’ solid efforts to improve its R&amp;D stature have been a key growth driver, which raises our optimism. The company’s whole product solutions pipeline and sirolimus-based below-the-knee drug-coated balloon program deserve mention. Surmodics has been making progress using its internally developed .014 balloon platform.For the first nine months of fiscal 2023, R&amp;D expenses reflected continued investment in medical device product development, including in Surmodics’ Pounce thrombectomy and Sublime radial access product platforms and costs associated with its SurVeil drug-coated balloon (DCB).Thrombectomy Prospects Bright: Surmodics’ aim to leverage its proprietary Pounce thrombectomy platform technology to develop products raises our optimism. On the third quarter of fiscal 2023 earnings call in August, Surmodics’ management stated that sales of its Pounce Arterial Thrombectomy and Sublime Radial products were an important contributor to the 38% medical device business product sales growth achieved in the quarter.Story continuesIn June, Surmodics received the FDA’s approval for the SurVeil DCB.Strong Q3 Results: Surmodics registered a solid uptick in the overall top and bottom lines in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The company recorded robust revenues from its Medical Device segment and primary sources. During the quarter, Surmodics witnessed strong contributions from sales of its Pounce and Sublime products, indicating their continued solid demand.DownsidesReliance on Third Parties: A principal element of Surmodics’ business strategy is to enter into licensing arrangements with medical devices and other companies that manufacture products incorporating its technologies. The revenues it derives from such arrangements depend upon its ability or its licensees’ ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, market and sell products incorporating Surmodics’ technologies. Its failure or the failure of its licensees to meet these requirements could have a material adverse effect on Surmodics’ business.Data Security Threats: Surmodics collects and stores sensitive data, including its proprietary business information, on its networks. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to its operations and business strategy. Despite Surmodics’ security measures, its information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers, resulting from employee error or other disruptions.Estimate TrendSurmodics is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for fiscal 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its loss per share has narrowed from $1.85 to 22 cents.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $26 million, suggesting a 0.02% improvement from the year-ago reported number.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc.

(NYSE:LYB) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for LyondellBasell Industries Is LyondellBasell Industries Fairly Valued?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.77bUS$3.46bUS$2.97bUS$3.14bUS$3.20bUS$3.27bUS$3.34bUS$3.41bUS$3.48bUS$3.56bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x7Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 2.06%Est @ 2.08%Est @ 2.10%Est @ 2.12%Est @ 2.13%Est @ 2.13% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.8% US$2.6kUS$3.0kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.0kUS$1.9kUS$1.8kUS$1.7k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$22bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.6b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.8%– 2.2%) = US$65bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$65b÷ ( 1 + 7.8%)10= US$31bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$52b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$99.7, the company appears quite undervalued at a 38% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at LyondellBasell Industries as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.125. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for LyondellBasell IndustriesStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios.

The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.6b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.2%) = US$36bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$36b÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)10= US$18bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$28b.

Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Vulcan Materials as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.936. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Vulcan MaterialsStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Basic Materials industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Basic Materials market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Caterpillar CAT, General Electric GE and Sherwin Williams SHW.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Will Stocks Rise in September? Global Week AheadIn the Global Week Ahead, Reuters writes that...""As an awful August gives way to an uncertain September, investors hope this month will confirm that the seemingly relentless rise in interest rates will end soon, meaning respite for both stocks and bonds.""""But there are a few snags.""This September is chock-full of risk events, including:·         Central bank meetings·         A G20 summit, and·         Make-or-break macro dataNot to mention that it tends to be the worst month of the year for the mighty S&amp;P500 share index.Next are Reuters' five world market themes, reordered for equity traders—(1) Will September Be a Poor Month for U.S. Stocks?Now the Federal Reserve's Jackson Hole confab is over, investors are strapping in for a potentially volatile month.The S&amp;P 500 tends to post its worst monthly performance in September, with an average decline of -0.7%, according to CFRA data going back to 1945.There are plenty of catalysts for volatility. The Sept. 13th U.S. inflation reading would likely have to support the narrative of cooling consumer prices and resilient growth that has boosted stocks for most of the year.Investors will also scrutinize the message from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell after the central bank's Sept. 20th meeting to determine the likelihood of another hike this year.Story continuesMeanwhile, there is a risk of a fourth federal government shutdown in a decade if squabbling lawmakers cannot reach a deal by Sept. 30th, when funding runs out with the end of the current fiscal year.On the data front, U.S. services sector activity is due Wednesday.(2) Germany Is the 'Sick Economy' in Europe NowGermany looks likely to be the only major economy to contract this year.Business activity there shrank at the fastest pace in over three years in August, business sentiment has deteriorated and the economy stagnated in the second quarter.No wonder the region's economic powerhouse is once again being called the sick man of Europe.July industrial orders and production data in the coming week may reinforce that perception, supporting the case for the ECB to leave rates unchanged in September.Germany's coalition just agreed to a 7 billion euro ($7.56 billion) corporate tax relief package to give the economy what Chancellor Olaf Scholz called a ""big boost.""But economists are skeptical, noting that at just +0.2% of GDP, the package is no game-changer and that the sick will need more medicine.(3) Any Bright Spots in the G20 Summit?Some progress this summer on debt deals for the string of struggling emerging economies in, or facing, default has sharply driven up year-to-date returns for the sovereign bonds for Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Ghana and Zambia.This bright spot could, during the G20 Summit in Delhi, support ongoing efforts to tackle the persistent, damaging debt crisis among developing nations.Multilateral institutions and creditor countries have used most international gatherings to refine the Common Framework agreement that was meant to make recovering from debt distress quicker and easier.But the absence of China's President Xi Jinping in Delhi could cast a pall.China has become the biggest bilateral lender to some developing nations in recent years, and its reluctance to make bigger concessions during restructuring efforts has been a core sticking point.(4) Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Leadership Changes HandsThe Reserve Bank of Australia is set to hold rates steady for a third straight meeting on Tuesday, as Governor Philip Lowe prepares to pass the baton to deputy Michele Bullock.A sharp cooling of inflation hints at an easier road for Bullock, after Lowe's controversy-filled legacy of painful backtracks and abrupt shifts that cost him a second term.Rates are at an 11-year high of 4.1% after 400 bps of tightening since May 2022.Traders expect that to be the peak, after inflation unexpectedly eased to a 17-month trough below 5% in July.But it won't be all plain sailing.Economic risks in top trade partner China are ramping up right as things at home look rosier.(5) Will the Bank of England (BoE) Stop Hiking Its Policy Rate Shortly?Is Britain's economy slowing enough for the Bank of England to end its battle against inflation?U.K. retail sales for August, as measured by the British Retail Consortium on September 5th, may harden the view expressed in other surveys that consumers are deeply cautious.Sentiment has soured alongside a slowing housing market, following 14 back-to-back rate increases. Monthly house price data from Halifax on September 7 will indicate whether the 9-trillion pound ($11.37 trillion) U.K. residential property sector has weakened further.But the economy, which has defied recession forecasts, could still get a boost.Headline inflation dropped to +6.8% in July, energy costs are set to fall from October and wage growth is now positive in real terms.If this sends Brits flocking back to the shops, it could strengthen the BoE's resolve to stay tough on inflation.Top Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) StocksLet's look into three major U.S. industrial stocks, ones that made it onto our #1 list.(1) Caterpillar: This is a $286 stock with a market cap of $146 billion. It is found in the Manufacturing – Construction and Mining Industry. I see a Zacks Value score of C, a Zacks Growth score of B and a Zacks Momentum score of B.(2) General Electric: This is a $114 stock with a market cap of $124 billion. It is found in the Diversified Operations Industry. I see a Zacks Value score of F, a Zacks Growth score of D and a Zacks Momentum score of D.(3) Sherwin Williams: This is a $275 stock with a market cap of $70.7 billion.

If you want to skip our discussion on the healthcare market, head directly to 5 Best Healthcare ETFs To Buy. In December 2022, BlackRock highlighted concerns about the performance for the healthcare sector in 2023. The previous year was rather challenging for equity and fixed income markets. However, the healthcare sector has historically shown resilience during such times. For 2023, BlackRock expected a volatile market, given the inflationary pressure and other geopolitical uncertainty. As per expectations, the sector has exhibited uncertainty in 2023. Over the past two years, the industry has reached record highs in performance. This can be directly attributed to the industry’s effective response to COVID-19. In 2021, the healthcare sector contributed around 19% of the GDP for the United States, while the medical expense for a person amounted to roughly $13,000. BlackRock reported that revenues from COVID-19 are going to normalize over the next few years, as the world moves on from the pandemic. However, the industry presents a valuable opportunity for innovation in creating mRNA-based technologies to treat cancer, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s. While the pandemic forced drastic changes for the medical sector worldwide, it highlighted the efficacy of telehealth, remote monitoring, and cloud-management services within the industry. Don't Miss: 10 Best Semiconductor ETFsLBMC, a professional services CPA firm, valued the telehealth market at $48.3 billion in 2022, and it is forecasted to reach $57.1 billion in 2023. Similarly, in 2021, the worldwide big data healthcare market was worth $32.9 billion, and it is anticipated to be valued at $105.73 billion by 2030, showing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.85%. With the recent hype about artificial intelligence, companies are expected to innovate and integrate it into their cloud-based data management portals. The industry faces significant challenges despite the recent performance boost since Covid-19. Perhaps the biggest concern in the US market is the shortage of medical professionals. In addition, the rising levels of inflation would increase healthcare premiums. Currently, the consumer price index is at 3%. In comparison, this was 9.1% in June 2022. Although the Federal Reserve has managed to reduce inflation, the officially targeted rate is 2%. To add to this, many experts expect unemployment levels to rise over the next year. Collectively, unemployment and inflation are expected to increase the likelihood of a recession over the next 12 months. Story continuesAlso Read: 20 Biggest ETFs by VolumeWhile the healthcare sector continues to normalize in the post-pandemic world, the sector remains set to innovate – be it treatments, workforce management solutions, medical devices, or better healthcare plans.

(NASDAQ:REGN), a major position and a stock we wrote up in our June 2021 letter, has been one of the best performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 this year. Alas it has not been enough to offset some of our weaker stocks, let alone our overweight exposure to the UK (and Europe) which have suffered from both stock and currency weakness. We do not think we are bad at picking stocks on the long side and hope – reasonably we think – for better relative results in the future. Prior to COVID, our longs were markedly better than the index. Unfortunately, if you look at our long book this quarter and since the onset of the COVID pandemic, there is scant evidence that we have added any value by picking stocks to go long.”11. iShares Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ:IBB)5 Year Performance as of September 4: 10.42%iShares Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ:IBB) aims to mimic the performance of the ICE Biotechnology Index, which consists of biotechnology sector equities listed in the United States.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) - this number remained unchanged from the last quarter. Here is what Smead Capital Management has to say about Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Two things are very noticeable right off the top. First, sometimes you have to be happy losing less in a bear market environment so that you have more of your capital to grow in the next bull market. We are never really happy losing money. Second, 2022 is likely to be our third year of existence as a fund to lose money for the year. This year would join 2008 and 2018 in this undistinguished category. Our biggest detractors were dominated by  Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN). Consumer/investor fears about media and e-commerce hit WBD and EBAY and profit taking in Amgen came from early 2022 strength.”10.

Danaher has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 this year due to a slowdown in the bioprocessing industry and more cautious spending by biopharma customers. Bioprocessing is a key end-market that drives more than a quarter of Danaher’s profits. Bioprocessing products are the main inputs that biopharma companies use to manufacture biologic drugs, which are the fastest growing category of drugs, growing low-to-mid-teens and representing a sizeable portion of the clinical pipeline.The bioprocessing industry experienced significant growth in 2021 and 2022, driven by Covid vaccines and a strong biotech funding environment. Several participants, including Danaher, lowered their 2023 growth outlook in large part due to customer inventory de-stocking and biotech funding weakness. We anticipate that this slowdown is temporary, and the bioprocessing industry will return to normalized growth of high-single digit to mid-teens in 2024 and beyond.…” (Click here to read the full text)9.

If you want to skip out background on the bank, then take a look at 5 Undervalued Stocks to Buy According to Goldman Sachs. Even with turmoil in its ranks, investment bank Goldman Sachs continues to maintain its upbeat sentiment about a recession in the U.S. With the third quarter of 2023 underway, the U.S. economy has come quite far ahead from the doom and gloom that had plagued investors' minds last year. The economy, despite downward growth revisions later on, maintained growth during the second quarter and there is cautious optimism that the Federal Reserve just might forgo an interest rate increase later this month. At the same time, the labor market is also cooling, and inflation on the consumer front is dropping.In its fresh analyst note, the bank believes that the odds of a recession taking place in America over the next year is 15%, down from an earlier 20%. The 15% odds are still higher than the 'soft landing' that Bank of America is projecting, but while the latter's shift is a recent one, Goldman Sachs has been one of the most cautious banks in the industry when it comes to recession speculation throughout the course of this year. The latest note from Goldman Sachs' chief economist Jan Hatzius, which comes a handful of weeks before the Federal Reserve decides whether to increase interest rate hikes or take another pause, outlines that there will be no rate hike in September, and if the data sets create space, then there won't be a rate hike in November either.The economist added that there is little reason to fear any lag from earlier policy tightening, with a growth in disposable income from a surprisingly robust labor market also in the cards for next year. As to when the interest rates are going to come down, Hatzius believes that rate cuts are unlikely for at least more than two quarters with the first cuts expected to take place during the second quarter of 2024. The latest remarks come after a strong rally in the U.S. dollar which appears to have re calibrated demand for the greenback in global markets despite the hawkishness of the Federal Reserve seemingly appearing at its end.Story continuesIt also follows recent remarks from Hatzius made to CNBC which came after the latest labor market report. According to him:I think it's a very constructive report. We had a pretty good increase in non farm payrolls, in fact somewhat stronger than expected especially if you allow for some of the special factors, the yellow bankruptcy and the Hollywood writers strike. If you add that in your above 200 thousand. Household employment actually growing above 200 thousand as well. The increase in the unemployment rate that we saw, which is you know pretty sizeable, three tenths is pretty sizeable. But it was entirely driven by an increase is labor force participation, which is what you want to see. And then, the average hourly earnings number that showed a downside surprise, only a two tents increase, and that is also what the Fed wants to see because at this time wages are still growing somewhat faster than what is compatible with 2% inflation in the long term. So if I look at this, and then also if I bring in the JOLTS number, the job openings and quits numbers that we got early in the week, this is very consistent with a soft landing.Hatzius also believes that inflation will continue to drop last year and lead to interest rate cuts. However, the price increase rate is unlikely to touch the Fed's preferred 2% target range.Taking a brief look at what's going on within Goldman Sachs' walls as the market turns optimistic about the economy, the bank is currently attempting to refocus back to investment banking. The shift follows after Goldman decided to target consumer banking, but losses in the sector have rattled broader confidence in the bank's management. Its one of the few mega banks whose shares have not performed well this year, as stock is down 5% year to date. This makes the shares lag traditional rival Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) whose stock is flat year to date and post losses when compared to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) whose stock is up 8%.

This list was compiled by ranking some stocks in the bank's portfolio by their forward price to earnings ratio, with the top three picks being Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Zscaler, Inc.

Speaking of forward price to earnings, Goldman's Sachs P/E ratio is currently 8.67, while the ratios for JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley come out as 10.09 and 11.67, respectively.

ADP, Paychex, Inc. PAYX, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. BR and Genpact Ltd. G.Industry: OutsourcingLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2144715/4-stocks-to-benefit-from-a-blooming-outsourcing-industryDriven by economic, technological and business factors, the Zacks Outsourcing industry has grown significantly over time. Key factors include cost savings, access to skilled talent, and the ability to focus on core competencies. According to ReportLinker's report, the outsourcing sector is anticipated to witness a substantial growth of USD 75.89 trillion from 2023 to 2027, with a steady compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.5%.Automatic Data Processing, Inc., Paychex, Inc., Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. and Genpact Ltd. can be considered by investors from the in-focus Outsourcing market.About the IndustryOutsourcing involves delegating a company's internal operations to external resources or third-party contractors to enhance operational efficiency. Within the Zacks Outsourcing sector, you'll find companies that provide human capital, business management and IT solutions, primarily catering to small- and medium-sized enterprises. These services encompass a broad spectrum, including HR support, payroll management, benefits administration, retirement planning and insurance services.Certain firms excel in delivering business process services, with a strong focus on transaction processing, analytics and global automation solutions. This outsourcing approach empowers businesses to concentrate on their core competencies while external experts manage these critical functions.4 Trends Shaping the Future of Outsourcing IndustryContinued growth of Business Process Outsourcing (BPO): Most outsourcing activities occur at lower levels within the organizational hierarchy. Per Grand View Research report, in 2022, the global market for BPO reached a valuation of USD 261.9 billion and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.4% from 2023 to 2030. The demand for these services remains high due to their advantages, including greater flexibility, cost reduction, and improved service quality.Story continuesContinued relevance of IT Outsourcing: The IT Outsourcing market is forecasted to attain a revenue of approximately $460.10 billion in 2023, with an anticipated annual growth rate (CAGR 2023-2028) of 11.07%. This growth is expected to lead to a market size of about $777.70 billion by 2028. In the future, outsourced IT services will still cover a wide range of functions, including programming and technical support. Organizations can outsource entire IT departments to cut costs and focus on core tasks. A significant driver of outsourcing trends will be the shortage of in-house engineering talent.Rising importance of cybersecurity: Heightened public awareness and evolving cyber threats, such as ransomware and national-level cyberattacks, have led to a growing demand for robust data encryption and cybersecurity measures. Companies prioritize employee security awareness training and breach detection systems to prevent cybersecurity incidents. To address these challenges, businesses increasingly turn to outsourced cybersecurity services to mitigate risks, maintain compliance, and support scalability in their operations.Emerging trends of technology: Trends like the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML) are on the verge of reshaping the outsourcing sector. These innovations propel efficiency, foster innovation, and bolster competitiveness, fundamentally altering the delivery of outsourcing services and opening novel avenues for businesses to enhance their operational efficiency. For instance, IoT data can be collected, processed, and analyzed in the cloud, enabling real-time decision-making and predictive maintenance for clients. By integrating AI and ML into customer support outsourcing, companies can provide faster, more efficient and consistent customer support while optimizing operational costs.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Encouraging ProspectsThe Zacks Outsourcing industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Business Services sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #90.

The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble What's The Estimated Valuation?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$15.0bUS$16.4bUS$17.6bUS$18.8bUS$19.6bUS$20.3bUS$20.9bUS$21.5bUS$22.0bUS$22.6bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 3.45%Est @ 3.06%Est @ 2.79%Est @ 2.59%Est @ 2.46% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2% US$14.1kUS$14.6kUS$14.7kUS$14.8kUS$14.5kUS$14.2kUS$13.8kUS$13.3kUS$12.9kUS$12.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$139bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$23b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.2%– 2.2%) = US$576bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$576b÷ ( 1 + 6.2%)10= US$317bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$457b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$152, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 21% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Procter &amp; Gamble as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Procter &amp; GambleStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Household Products market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

UDR is well-poised to benefit from a diversified portfolio, with a superior product mix of A/B quality properties in urban and suburban communities in both coastal and Sunbelt locations.The company’s efforts to diversify its portfolio with respect to geographies and price points limit its exposure to volatility and concentration risks while assuring stable cash flows. Moreover, in recent quarters, UDR has been experiencing strong pricing power, as evidenced by blended lease rate growth. For 2023, management expects year-over-year same-store revenue growth (on a cash basis) of 6-7%. Our estimate indicates a year over-year increase of 6.7% in same-store revenues in 2023.UDR is also leveraging technological investments and process enhancements to drive innovation and margin expansion. Its Next Generation Operating Platform allows the company to electronically interact with and provide service to residents and prospects throughout its diversified portfolio. These efforts are likely to give UDR a competitive edge over its peers. For 2023, management expects year-over-year same-store net operating income (NOI) growth (on a cash basis) of 6.5-8%. We estimate year-over-year growth of 7.4% in the company’s same-store NOI in the current year.The company maintains a healthy balance sheet position with ample liquidity. It exited the second quarter of 2023 with $1.1 billion liquidity. The company’s debt maturity schedule is well-laddered, with weighted average years to maturity of 6.3 and a weighted average interest rate of 3.21%. Also, 88.4% of its NOI is unencumbered.Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT investors and UDR remains committed to that. The company has increased its dividend five times in the last five years, and the five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 4.21%, which is encouraging.Moreover, backed by healthy operating fundamentals, we expect the FFO as adjusted (FFOA) to increase 8.7% in 2023. Given our FFOA growth projections and UDR’s solid financial position, the latest dividend hike seems sustainable and well covered by cash flow from operations. Such efforts boost investors’ confidence in the stock.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 1.8% so far in the year, slightly below its industry’s increase of 2.1%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, the struggle to lure the renters is likely to persist as the supply volume is expected to remain elevated in a number of its markets. With the ongoing construction standing at a high level, a sizeable number of apartment deliveries are expected in the upcoming period. Particularly, management expects its pricing power across its Sunbelt markets to remain constrained in the near term amid a relatively high level of new supply deliveries in these markets.Furthermore, a high interest rate environment is a concern for UDR. Elevated rates imply high borrowing costs for the company, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate. The company has a substantial debt burden and its total debt as of Jun 30, 2023, was $5.4 billion. Our estimate indicates a year-over-year rise of 15.1% in interest expenses in 2023.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Invitation Homes Inc.

Interest rates are soaring. The Federal Reserve is still worried about inflation and is keeping monetary policy tight. A potential recession looms. There’s a seemingly perfect storm out there for these real estate stocks to watch.And yet, quite possibly, the bears have overstayed their welcome. Markets are forward-looking, after all, and can anticipate when a turn is coming.Interest rates won’t keep going up forever. There are still strong demographic drivers to support the housing market. And the pandemic-driven impacts to commercial real estate won’t indefinitely linger either. All that to say that it’s a good time to be looking at these three real estate short squeeze candidates with high short interest today.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsVornado Realty Trust (VNO)Group of colleagues discuss something in an office conference room.Source: GaudiLab / ShutterstockVornado Realty Trust (NYSE:VNO) is an office real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on the New York City metropolitan market.As has been widely discussed in the media, the office market is struggling in the post-pandemic landscape. Some firms have gone remote permanently. Many others are returning to the office, but for only three- or four-day workweeks. This reduces demand for office space and lowers the potential rents and value of existing office buildings.VNO stock had already dipped from a peak of about $90 in 2015 to around $60 prior to the onset of COVID-19. Since then, the walls caved in, with Vornado crashing to as low as $12 per share earlier this year.Vornado shares are now starting to recover, however. That could be because the company’s portfolio remains attractive. It owns more than 20 million square feet of prime office space in Manhattan. Key tenants include the likes of business media giant Bloomberg and Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) New York City headquarters. It owns properties in world-class districts such as Fifth Avenue and Times Square.Story continuesNot all office space is going to make it through the current disruption. However, Vornado’s holdings of top-tier properties in the nation’s largest city should insulate it from the bust.UWM Holdings (UWMC)An image of a man holding a phone with a web of real estate icons above it; rent, sale, key, handshake, graph, paperworkSource: Denizce/ShutterstockUWM Holdings (NYSE:UWMC) is among the top real estate short squeeze candidates. It’s the nation’s largest mortgage lender. It took that title not too long ago thanks to its relentless growth, along with missteps by some of its rivals.There has been plenty of room for shifts in the industry due to the abrupt change in housing demand and interest rates. The housing market skyrocketed in 2020, leading to record volumes of mortgages and profits for UWM and its peers. However, that boom turned to bust amid surging interest rates and a near complete absence of refinancing transactions.However, UWM is seizing the moment. It is now investing in growth as its peers pull back. Meanwhile, thanks to prior cost discipline, UWM remains profitable and is even paying a dividend.UWM’s CEO Mat Ishbia had some stark words for his competition in the firm’s quarterly earnings report writing, “Other management teams seem to have forgotten that during a mortgage boom, the majority of the opportunity is in the first six months. Companies that are not prepared for those events react late, hire late, train late and miss most of the opportunity.”UWM is currently facing challenges due to the unsettled housing and interest rate environment. But the firm, as Ishbia suggested, is investing through the cycle and seems set to prosper when the macroeconomic winds improve. Meanwhile, the massive short interest in UWMC stock could run into trouble at any time.Blackstone Mortgage Trust (BXMT)A sign for Blackstone (BX) hangs on a white wall.Source: Isabelle OHara / Shutterstock.comBlackstone Mortgage Trust (NYSE:BXMT) is a REIT focused on commercial mortgages.Given a great deal of consternation about the commercial real estate market, short sellers have been hounding BXMT stock over the past year.But, perhaps things aren’t as bad as the market would suggest. For one thing, only 25% of Blackstone Mortgage Trust’s exposure is to U.S. office space. Blackstone Mortgage is diversified with exposure to apartments, life sciences buildings, and international properties among other things — in addition to its office loans.96% of the company’s loans are currently performing as planned. And earnings remain high enough to cover the dividend; the trust generated distributable earnings of 79 cents last quarter versus its dividend of 62 cents per share.Right now, bears have sold short more than 12% of the float of BXMT stock short. That’s a massive number for a sleepy mortgage REIT. As things stand today, Blackstone Mortgage’s 11% dividend yield appears to be safe, which could lead to a major short squeeze as bears tire of having to pay out that massive yield on their short positions.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

For a quick overview of the top 10, read our article 10 Countries with Most Affordable Housing in the World. Buying a home has been one of the most sought-after life goals around the world. But it's becoming harder to own a house lately amid rising costs. Housing prices vary widely across the globe, with some markets charging substantially more than others. However, there are also countries with affordable housing. Recently, housing prices have been falling in many OECD countries, mainly due to central banks raising interest rates, which has made it more expensive to borrow money to buy a home.As a result, countries such as Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, are seeing a decline in housing demand due to increased mortgage rates. In Europe, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Norway are also experiencing rising mortgage prices.Since the pandemic, the global cost of construction has increased by 28%. As of December 2022, there also has been a reported increase of 32% in the costs of primary construction materials, with copper and cement prices rising by 3% and 9% respectively. On the other hand, it is believed that by the end of 2023, interest rates will stabilize, causing the fluctuation in mortgage rates to come to a stop. The US housing market could be headed for a positive change in the long term. Warren Buffet has injected an investment of more than $700 million into three major housebuilding companies: D.R. Horton Inc., NVR Inc., and Lennar Corp.The Changing Landscape of the Housing Market in the USWarren Buffet’s company Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) made a sizable investment of more than $700 million in homebuilding stocks. adding D.R. Horton Inc. (NYSE:DHI), NVR Inc. (NYSE:NVR), and Lennar Corp.(NYSE:LEN) to his portfolio.Story continuesThe three companies that Warren Buffett recently invested in are all players in the US housing market, with D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) being the largest residential builder in the country. Meanwhile, Lennar (NYSE:LEN) sells single-family and detached homes, with a market capitalization of $36.23 billion. NVR (NYSE:NVR), a supplier of structural building components, is valued at $20.04 billion.As of the end of June 2023, Berkshire Hathaway owned 5,969,714 shares of D.R. Horton, 152,572 shares of Lennar, and 11,112 shares of NVR.30 Countries with Most Affordable Housing in the WorldMethodologyWe created a list of the 30 Countries with Most Affordable Housing in the World by evaluating two metrics: affordability and profitability of ownership. We collected data from the OECD Housing Prices report to rank each country on these two metrics.Affordability is a measure of how easy it is for people to buy a home, calculated by comparing the average home price to the average income per person.Affordability = nominal house price index / nominal disposable income per head.A lower affordability index indicates that it is more affordable to buy a home in that country. For example, Romania has an affordability index of 66.46, which means that it is the most affordable country to buy a home in.Profitability of ownership is a metric that measures the financial benefits of owning a property, such as the potential for appreciation and rental income, compared to the costs of ownership, such as mortgage payments, property taxes, and maintenance. It is calculated by dividing the nominal house price index by the housing rent price index.Profitability of Ownership = nominal house price index/housing rent price index.A higher profitability of ownership index indicates that it is more profitable to own a home in that country. For example, Finland has a profitability index of 94.16, while South Korea has a profitability index of 102.81. This means that owning property in Korea is more likely to be a profitable investment than owning property in Finland.We initially assigned ranks from 1 to 30 to each country on our list, with 1 indicating the most affordable country and 30 indicating the least affordable. This was done to streamline the evaluation process.Next, we assigned equal weights of 0.5 to each metric to calculate a single ranking for each country. This resulted in a composite weighted average, which was used to determine the final list of the most affordable countries in the world.Finally, the countries were ranked in descending order from 30 to 1, based on the composite results. A ranking of 30 indicates the country with the least affordable housing, while a ranking of 1 indicates the country with the most affordable housing.Countries with Most Affordable Housing in the World30.

The stock's fair valuation is $21.25, as indicated by its GF Value.Understanding GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Signs with AAL. Click here to check it out. AAL 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of AALThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors:1. Historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at.2. GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth.3. Future estimates of the business performance.We believe the GF Value Line is the fair value that the stock should be traded at. The stock price will most likely fluctuate around the GF Value Line. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Is American Airlines Group (AAL) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapRecognizing the RisksHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with American Airlines Group should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 0.88, and the company's revenues and earnings have been on a downward trend over the past five years, which raises a crucial question: Is American Airlines Group a hidden gem or a value trap? These indicators suggest that American Airlines Group, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Story continuesDecoding the Altman Z-ScoreBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Company OverviewAmerican Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ:AAL) is the world's largest airline by aircraft, capacity, and scheduled revenue passenger miles. Its major U.S. hubs are Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix, and Washington, D.C. It generates over 30% of U.S. airline revenue connecting Latin America with destinations in the United States. After completing a major fleet renewal, the company has the youngest fleet of U.S. legacy carriers.Income BreakdownIs American Airlines Group (AAL) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapAssessing the Altman Z-ScoreA dissection of American Airlines Group's Altman Z-score reveals American Airlines Group's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress:The Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio provides insights into a company's capability to reinvest its profits or manage debt. Evaluating American Airlines Group's historical data, 2021: -0.11; 2022: -0.14; 2023: -0.11, we observe a declining trend in this ratio. This downward movement indicates American Airlines Group's diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt. Consequently, it exerts a negative impact on its Z-Score.Declining Revenues and EarningsOne of the telltale indicators of a company's potential trouble is a sustained decline in revenues. In the case of American Airlines Group, both the revenue per share (evident from the last five years' TTM data: 2019: 98.91; 2020: 76.68; 2021: 30.98; 2022: 59.35; 2023: 76.58; ) and the 5-year revenue growth rate (-10.7%) have been on a consistent downward trajectory. This pattern may point to underlying challenges such as diminishing demand for American Airlines Group's products, or escalating competition in its market sector. Either scenario can pose serious risks to the company's future performance, warranting a thorough analysis by investors.Is American Airlines Group (AAL) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapSluggish Earnings GrowthThe company's earnings picture does not look much brighter. The 3-year EPS without NRI growth rate (-63.1%) is sluggish, and the future 3 to 5-year EPS growth estimate (66.42%) does not show a promising uptick. These indicators could suggest the company is struggling to translate sales into profits effectively, a critical element of a successful business model.ConclusionDespite its low price-to-fair-value ratio, American Airlines Group's falling revenues and earnings cast a long shadow over its investment attractiveness. A low price relative to intrinsic value can indeed suggest an investment opportunity, but only if the company's fundamentals are sound or improving. In Steelcase's case, the declining revenues, EBITDA, and earnings growth suggest that the company's issues may be more than just cyclical fluctuations.Without a clear turnaround strategy, there's a risk that the company's performance could continue to deteriorate, leading to further price declines. In such a scenario, the low price-to-GF-Value ratio may be more indicative of a value trap than a value opportunity.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the following Screener: Walter Schloss Screen .Investors can find stocks with good revenue and earnings growth using GuruFocus' Peter Lynch Growth with Low Valuation Screener.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Yahoo Finance Live's Brad Smith and Julie Hyman break down the report and the outlook for airlines.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: Watching airline stocks today after Southwest United and Alaska all raised fuel cost guidance. Now, this is interesting here. They're Warning of higher prices to come despite renewed demand for travel. And actually, if you look at all of their individual statements, they, kind of, say the same thing but something slightly different here.For United Airlines, at least, jet fuel prices climbing over 20%. As a result, companies all in fuel price now expected to be between $2.95 as you're seeing there on the screen to the top side of that range of $3.05 a gallon. But then if you go even further and, kind of, look at some of the other statements that have come out, I think for many of them-- and I took a look at Southwest this morning as well-- there's a different type of demand or at least customer category that you're going after.If you're a United versus Southwest and for even Alaska, all of them coming out with this sweeping move to announce today. It just goes to show that investors need to continue to keep a close eye on where those fuel costs, which are negotiated usually months in advance, where that's moving for them. So them getting-- all of these airlines getting out in front of that for their investors.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah and here's another one where the stocks are moving more in premarket trading, were more universally down. In particular, Southwest was taking a hit perhaps because Southwest is seen as more vulnerable than those other airlines to begin with. Southwest also coming out and saying unit revenue, which is a measure of demand and fares, is going to be down 5% to 7% from a year earlier this quarter.The outlook had been 3% to 7%. So now 5% to 7%, so basically, that outlook getting a little bit worse. But again, it was hitting the shares more earlier and now they're a little changed. Perhaps investors taking a closer look, deeper dive into the filing as the morning goes on.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, even with Southwest, they have given us a little bit of the inclination into how, of course, the hurricane season is beginning to impact them as well. That was named within this filing. So that perhaps an early glimpse of where Southwest might have a little bit more to say when they finally do report the full financial report or performance for the quarter.]"

AIG is well-poised to grow due to strong Global Commercial business, improving net investment income and new business growth.AIG continues to benefit from strong performance in its General Insurance business and the strengthening of insurance rates. Moreover, divestitures are helping the company to streamline its business and enhance capital allocation.AIG is a leading global insurance organization providing a wide range of property casualty insurance, life insurance, retirement solutions and other financial services.Zacks Rank &amp; Price PerformanceAmerican International currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). In the past year, the stock has gained 11.9% compared with the industry’s growth of 0.2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRising EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for AIG’s 2023 earnings per share is pegged at $6.71, indicating a 47.5% increase from the year-ago reported figure of $4.55. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AIG’s 2023 sales is pegged at $51.4 billion, indicating a 13.2% increase from the year-ago reported figure of $45.4 billion.The company beat earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average surprise being 13.5%.Key DriversIn the first half of 2023, a significant portion of AIG’s total revenues came from premiums, which improved 19.9% year over year. The figures are expected to grow further in the future due to strong performance in commercial lines and rate increases contributing to higher pricing.The General Insurance segment accounted for 55.4% of total revenues in the first half of 2023. This segment delivered strong results in the second quarter due to the improving performance of Lexington and Global Commercial businesses. North America Commercial is expected to aid the results of this business segment due to strong growth in net premiums thanks to Lexington and Retail Property. Strong retention, rate increases and new businesses have been the key drivers for the Lexington business.Story continuesTotal net investment income increased 21.6% year over year in the first half of 2023. A high-interest rate environment should provide an impetus to growth in net investment income. In order to take advantage of higher interest rates, AIG has repositioned its General Insurance portfolio to gain higher yields but remains careful about maintaining credit quality and duration. This is likely to result in higher net investment income in 2023.The company is delivering well on its objective to deliver 10% plus adjusted return on capital employed. In July 2023, it closed the sale of its Crop Risk Services to AFG and formed Private Client Select with Stone Point Capital LLC., to streamline its operations and enhance earnings quality.The company rewarded its shareholders with $554 million in repurchases and dividends worth $268 million in the second quarter, reflecting its balanced capital management strategy. This implies that the company’s shares are a good buy for investors looking for returns in the form of dividends.However, AIG’s rising expense level is a concern. Its total benefits and expenses increased 19% in the first half of 2023. We expect the metric to increase 16.9% in 2023. American International’s return on equity of 9.3% is lower than the industry’s average of 10.8%. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive growth in the long term.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the insurance space include Arch Capital Group Ltd. ACGL, Aflac Incorporated AFL and Chubb Limited CB. Arch Capital currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Aflac and Chubb carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The appeal of REITs is straightforward: REITs allow anyone the opportunity to profit from real estate properties, without actually having to own property. REITs operate across a number of sectors, including industrial, healthcare and retail.REITs are required to distribute the vast majority of their taxable income to shareholders in exchange for a favorable tax status. As a result, investors can find high dividend yields across the REIT universe. In this way, real estate can be accessible to stock market investors as a way to generate passive income for retirement.In addition, investors should focus on REITs with quality business models and sustainable dividend payouts. These three REITs have safe dividends, even in a recession, along with their high yields.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsRealty Income (O)realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browserSource: ShutterstockRealty Income (NYSE:O) is a retail-focused REIT that owns more than 4,000 properties. It owns retail properties that are not part of a wider retail development (such as a mall) but instead are standalone properties. This means that the properties are viable for many different tenants, including government services, healthcare services and entertainment.In the 2023 first quarter, the company’s net income available to common stockholders was $225 million, equivalent to 34 cents per share. Normalized funds from operations (FFO) per share increased by 2% to $1.04 compared to the same period last year. Adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders was $650.7 million, or 98 cents per share.Realty Income generates its growth through growing rents at existing locations, via contracted rent increases or by leasing properties to new tenants at higher rates but also by acquiring new properties. In the first quarter, the company invested $1.7 billion in 339 properties and properties under development or expansion. The initial weighted average cash lease yield for these investments was 7%.Story continuesThe company also expects to increase its investments in international markets during the next couple of years. Indeed, it made a first deal in the U.K. in 2019 and plans to do more such deals in the future when it finds attractive targets. These acquisitions will help drive profits in the long run.Realty Income is well-known for its monthly dividend payments. Indeed, the company has now declared consecutive monthly dividends for over 50 years. Realty Income has also increased its dividend for over 25 consecutive years, placing it on the exclusive list of Dividend Aristocrats. In fact, Realty Income is only one of three REITs on the Dividend Aristocrats list. Shares currently yield 5.4%.Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT)a businessperson holds an imaginary blueprint of a houseSource: ShutterstockFederal Realty (NYSE:FRT) was founded in 1962 and concentrates in high-income, densely populated coastal markets in the U.S., allowing it to charge more per square foot than its competition.In the 2023 first quarter, revenue increased by 6.3% year-over-year to $273.06 million. The company achieved 3.6% growth in comparable property operating income for Q1 and signed 101 leases for 504,502 square feet of comparable space. Net income for common shareholders was 65 cents per diluted share. After impressive Q2 results, Federal Realty raised its full-year guidance range for FFO.Federal Realty’s future growth will come from a continuation of higher rent rates on new leases and its impressive development pipeline fueling asset-base expansion. Margins are expected to continue to rise slightly as it redevelops pieces of its portfolio and same-center revenue continues to move higher. As the economy emerges from the Covid-19 crisis, we expect results to support the long-term thesis for Federal Realty as same-store NOI continues to grow and occupancy remains robust.Federal Realty’s competitive advantages include its superior development pipeline, its focus on high-income, high-density areas and its decades of experience in running a world-class REIT.Federal Realty’s competitive advantages include its superior development pipeline, its focus on high-income, high-density areas and its decades of experience in running a world-class REIT. The company has increased its dividend for over 50 years in a row, placing it on the Dividend Kings list. FRT is the only REIT on the Dividend Kings list.Essex Property Trust (ESS)A magnifying glass zooms in on Essex Property Trust, Inc. (ESS) logoSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comEssex Property Trust (NYSE:ESS) invests in West Coast multifamily residential proprieties. It engages in development, redevelopment, management and acquisition of apartment communities and a few other select properties. Essex has ownership interests in several hundred apartment communities consisting of over 60,000 apartment homes.On July 27, Essex announced its second-quarter earnings results. In Q2, core FFO per share was $3.77, exceeding the consensus of $3.73 but lower than the previous quarter’s $3.65 and the same period last year’s $3.68. Same-property scheduled rents rose 1% compared to the previous quarter and 5.2% compared to the same period last year. Same-store property net operating income increased to $280.8 million from $274.1 million in Q1 and $271.2 million in Q2 of 2022.The company raised its 2023 earnings guidance primarily due to higher same-property revenue and lower property taxes in Washington. The company increased its 2023 core FFO per share guidance to a range of $14.88 to $15.12. That’s up from the previous range of $14.59 to $14.97. This new guidance is slightly above the consensus estimate of $14.85.For Q3, the company expects core FFO per share to be between $3.69 and $3.81. The average analyst estimate is $3.70.Essex Property Trust is a high-quality apartment REIT that has raised its dividend for 29 consecutive years from the time it first became a publicly traded trust. Real estate has a natural moat and Essex’s exposure to high-value cities with strong technology cultures further widens that moat.However, apartments generally have a more elastic supply than single family homes, which offsets some of that protection. This was shown during the previous recession, when the trust’s FFO fell, but not by an extreme amount, and Essex was able to continue raising its dividend.The trust has a solid BBB+ credit rating and currently has a very healthy interest coverage ratio and net-debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio. ESS stock has a 3.9% yield.On the date of publication, Bob Ciura did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(NASDAQ:PEP) Looks Like A Quality Company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-pepsico-inc-nasdaq-pep-130020384.html,1694005220,STORY,['PEP'],"[While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for PepsiCo How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for PepsiCo is:45% = US$8.0b ÷ US$18b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.45 in profit.Does PepsiCo Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, PepsiCo has a higher ROE than the average (17%) in the Beverage industry.roeThat's what we like to see. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk. You can see the 2 risks we have identified for PepsiCo by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesCombining PepsiCo's Debt And Its 45% Return On EquityIt's worth noting the high use of debt by PepsiCo, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 2.45. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.SummaryReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.Of course PepsiCo may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have high ROE and low debt.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

If you want to skip our discussion on the healthcare market, head directly to 5 Best Healthcare ETFs To Buy. In December 2022, BlackRock highlighted concerns about the performance for the healthcare sector in 2023. The previous year was rather challenging for equity and fixed income markets. However, the healthcare sector has historically shown resilience during such times. For 2023, BlackRock expected a volatile market, given the inflationary pressure and other geopolitical uncertainty. As per expectations, the sector has exhibited uncertainty in 2023. Over the past two years, the industry has reached record highs in performance. This can be directly attributed to the industry’s effective response to COVID-19. In 2021, the healthcare sector contributed around 19% of the GDP for the United States, while the medical expense for a person amounted to roughly $13,000. BlackRock reported that revenues from COVID-19 are going to normalize over the next few years, as the world moves on from the pandemic. However, the industry presents a valuable opportunity for innovation in creating mRNA-based technologies to treat cancer, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s. While the pandemic forced drastic changes for the medical sector worldwide, it highlighted the efficacy of telehealth, remote monitoring, and cloud-management services within the industry. Don't Miss: 10 Best Semiconductor ETFsLBMC, a professional services CPA firm, valued the telehealth market at $48.3 billion in 2022, and it is forecasted to reach $57.1 billion in 2023. Similarly, in 2021, the worldwide big data healthcare market was worth $32.9 billion, and it is anticipated to be valued at $105.73 billion by 2030, showing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.85%. With the recent hype about artificial intelligence, companies are expected to innovate and integrate it into their cloud-based data management portals. The industry faces significant challenges despite the recent performance boost since Covid-19. Perhaps the biggest concern in the US market is the shortage of medical professionals. In addition, the rising levels of inflation would increase healthcare premiums. Currently, the consumer price index is at 3%. In comparison, this was 9.1% in June 2022. Although the Federal Reserve has managed to reduce inflation, the officially targeted rate is 2%. To add to this, many experts expect unemployment levels to rise over the next year. Collectively, unemployment and inflation are expected to increase the likelihood of a recession over the next 12 months. Story continuesAlso Read: 20 Biggest ETFs by VolumeWhile the healthcare sector continues to normalize in the post-pandemic world, the sector remains set to innovate – be it treatments, workforce management solutions, medical devices, or better healthcare plans.

(NASDAQ:REGN), a major position and a stock we wrote up in our June 2021 letter, has been one of the best performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 this year. Alas it has not been enough to offset some of our weaker stocks, let alone our overweight exposure to the UK (and Europe) which have suffered from both stock and currency weakness. We do not think we are bad at picking stocks on the long side and hope – reasonably we think – for better relative results in the future. Prior to COVID, our longs were markedly better than the index. Unfortunately, if you look at our long book this quarter and since the onset of the COVID pandemic, there is scant evidence that we have added any value by picking stocks to go long.”11. iShares Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ:IBB)5 Year Performance as of September 4: 10.42%iShares Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ:IBB) aims to mimic the performance of the ICE Biotechnology Index, which consists of biotechnology sector equities listed in the United States.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Two things are very noticeable right off the top. First, sometimes you have to be happy losing less in a bear market environment so that you have more of your capital to grow in the next bull market. We are never really happy losing money. Second, 2022 is likely to be our third year of existence as a fund to lose money for the year. This year would join 2008 and 2018 in this undistinguished category. Our biggest detractors were dominated by  Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN). Consumer/investor fears about media and e-commerce hit WBD and EBAY and profit taking in Amgen came from early 2022 strength.”10.

Danaher has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 this year due to a slowdown in the bioprocessing industry and more cautious spending by biopharma customers. Bioprocessing is a key end-market that drives more than a quarter of Danaher’s profits. Bioprocessing products are the main inputs that biopharma companies use to manufacture biologic drugs, which are the fastest growing category of drugs, growing low-to-mid-teens and representing a sizeable portion of the clinical pipeline.The bioprocessing industry experienced significant growth in 2021 and 2022, driven by Covid vaccines and a strong biotech funding environment. Several participants, including Danaher, lowered their 2023 growth outlook in large part due to customer inventory de-stocking and biotech funding weakness. We anticipate that this slowdown is temporary, and the bioprocessing industry will return to normalized growth of high-single digit to mid-teens in 2024 and beyond.…” (Click here to read the full text)9.

The unfavorable estimate revisions indicate brokers’ lack of confidence in the stock.Bearish Industry Rank: The industry, to which UNP belongs, currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 191 (of 250 plus groups). Such an unfavorable rank places UNP in the bottom 24% of the Zacks industries. Studies show that 50% of a stock price movement is directly related to the performance of the industry group it belongs to.A mediocre stock within a strong group is likely to outclass a robust stock in a weak industry. Therefore, reckoning the industry’s performance becomes imperative.Underperformance: Union Pacific has declined 5.7% in the past year compared with a 4.7% decline of the industry it belongs to.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWeak Zacks Rank and Style Score: UNP currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Moreover, its current Momentum Style Score of C shows its short-term unattractiveness.Other Headwinds:  We are concerned about Union Pacific's high-debt levels. Debt/earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) ratio (adjusted) at Union Pacific deteriorated to 2.3 in 2018 from 1.9 in 2017. It increased to 2.5 at the end of 2019.This rose further to 2.9 at the end of 2020. The reading was 2.7 at the end of 2021. The figure inched up to 2.9 at 2022 end.The metric was 2.9 at the end of the second quarter of 2023 as well. A high debt/EBITDA ratio often indicates that a firm may be unable to service its debt appropriately.A decline in volumes due to soft consumer markets and reduced fuel surcharge revenues are concerns. Volumes declined 2% year over year in the first half of 2023. Given the soft freight market scenario, revenue weakness is likely to persist throughout 2023. This may hurt overall volumes.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the Zacks Transportation sector are GATX Corporation GATX and Triton International Limited TRTN.GATX, which presently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has strengthened its railcar leasing operations. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.For third-quarter and full-year 2023, GATX’s earnings are expected to register 36.6% and 14.3% growth, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.Triton, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #2, is benefiting from its consistent efforts to reward shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.Triton has an impressive liquidity position. Its current ratio (a measure of liquidity) was 3.83 at the end of second-quarter 2023.

Clinic in Plainfield, NJ.Resources from the Quest Diagnostics Foundation will enable the clinic to double its capacity by providing primary care services for a second day of the week.The clinic previously operated one day each week, with Rutgers faculty and physician assistant students seeing patients who are trying to manage acute and chronic diseases and providing them with referrals to specialists as well as critical education on managing their health conditions. Despite the progress in improving access to primary healthcare services, the students and faculty at H.O.P.E. found themselves regularly turning patients away due to high demand and a limited number of appointments available in a single day.""Quest Diagnostics and the Quest Diagnostics Foundation have shown, yet again, the power of this private-public collaboration in reducing healthcare disparities in the greater Plainfield community, both through the provision of additional no cost lab tests to our patients and the financial support needed to expand our clinical services,"" said Frank Giannelli, director of the H.O.P.E. Clinic and an assistant professor in the physician assistant program at Rutgers School of Health Professions.Rutgers and Quest initially teamed up last year to provide no-cost laboratory tests to help diagnose and manage acute and chronic diseases. Under the program, clinicians send laboratory orders directly to a nearby Quest Patient Service Center, which allows patients to visit immediately after their appointment. The results are transmitted directly back to the clinic for follow-up with the patient, streamlining the process to make it easier for patients to receive the treatment they need.

In fact, the qualities that define an entrepreneur such as risk taking, creativity, perseverance, and passion are foundational to the way we operate and pursue opportunities to serve our customers and communities. In fact, the very reason Cisco started in 1984 was born from personal desire to solve an urgent issue and need for personal connection.Len Bosack and Sandy Lerner were not able to email each other from their respective offices at Stanford University because they were on different networks with different local area protocols. They developed the multiprotocol router, and that's how Cisco was born!Their entrepreneurial spirit lives on in a company that strives to solve business challenges for our customers today. Not only that, but Cisco also helps businesses large and small to seize the opportunities of tomorrow.Training future entrepreneursFor more than 25 years, Cisco Networking Academy has trained people to build and maintain networks utilizing the latest technology. But it has done so much more than that. As part of the process, learners are encouraged to work collaboratively, and the program fosters a mindset of identifying and solving problems.These are core entrepreneurial skills. Numerous Networking Academy learners have gone on to use those skills, not only in networking, but in business too.Antonius, from Indonesia, had never encountered a computer until a tsunami brought rescue workers to his hometown, where he saw the value-and opportunity-in tech. He went on to study at Networking Academy and earn CyberOps Associate certification. In one of his first jobs after studying, Antonius used his problem-solving skills to conclude that the network of the large organization where he worked had been hacked, and that rebuilding the system from scratch was the best solution.Story continuesNiels, in Belgium, took a different path. After working in kitchens from a very young age, Neils decided to embark on Networking Academy study. ""I have been in love with tweaking computers all my life,"" he says. While he found the study challenging at times, with support from the Networking Academy community, he went on to attain CCNA certification. Niels credits the program with giving him the self-belief necessary to start his own penetration testing company.Doing moreObviously, the tech revolution has seen a vast increase in the demand for the sort of hard skills that are the basis of Cisco Networking Academy, and those skills continue to be indispensable.The World Economic Forum found over 85% of organizations surveyed for the 2023 Future of Jobs Report identified increased adoption of new technologies and broadening digital access as the trends most likely to drive transformation in their organization.The same report, however, finds that technological literacy is only the third in the list of skills businesses see as growing in importance over the next five years. Creative thinking and analytical thinking rank as numbers one and two, respectively.Recognizing that technical skills alone are not enough for success in today's business environment, Networking Academy has recently launched several new courses on our Skills For All platform:Engaging Stakeholders for Success provides essential skills for any professional, regardless of the industry. Learning to effectively engage with stakeholders is a core skill in any workplace. In this course, learners gain the insights and tools to identify, prioritize, and engage with stakeholders for success.Discovering Entrepreneurship offers a solid foundation for anyone interested in developing entrepreneurial skills. The course covers entrepreneurship fundamentals, including the entrepreneurial perspective, identifying opportunities, and crafting an entrepreneurial story.The big ideaObviously, no course can teach the entrepreneurs of tomorrow how to have the big idea that drives a new business or industry. But by helping learners recognize that idea and teaching them the analytical and personal skills to make that idea grow, we can help them along that journey.A problem as simple as being unable to send your partner an email saw the founding of the company that would grow into the Cisco we know today.
